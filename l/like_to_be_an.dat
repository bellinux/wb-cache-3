[...] Although she believed 1920s Brisbane to be quite parochial, she stated {{that it was not}} [...] "altogether narrow and rigid."

[...] Vedder said, [...] "It's easily the best stuff we've done but also some of the hardest stuff. It's very aggressive, because again, it's kind of a product of what it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> American these days. It's pretty aggressive, especially when you turn it loud."

[...] "Alien Soldier is a long-lost piece of Treasure's action gaming legacy," [...] said Thomas. [...] "It's got the fast-firing, high-energy, overly-explosive intensity that fans of the company have come to expect." [...] Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life described the graphics and animation as some of the best on the Mega Drive. He found the game difficult, but still enjoyable for fans of the run and gun genre. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer described the game as [...] "manically-paced" [...] and [...] "bizarrely creative" [...] while also providing a disclaimer that it's [...] "really hectic and difficult if you're not into this sort of thing." ...|$|E

General Sir Alan Cunningham was his younger brother. His parents were described as having a [...] "strong intellectual and clerical tradition," [...] both grandfathers having been in the clergy. His father was a Professor of Anatomy at Trinity College, Dublin, whilst his mother stayed at home. Elizabeth Browne, {{with the aid of}} servants and governesses, oversaw much of his upbringing; as a result he reportedly had a [...] "warm and close" [...] relationship with her.

He was then sent to a Naval Preparatory School, Stubbington House, which specialised in sending pupils through the Dartmouth entrance examinations.

40|$|Abstract Critics of {{functionalism}} {{about the}} mind often {{rely on the}} intuition that collectivities cannot be conscious in motivating their positions.

We demonstrate that collective mentality <b>is</b> not <b>an</b> affront <b>to</b> commonsense, and we report evidence that demonstrates that the intuition that there is nothing that it’s <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> collectivity <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> some extent, culturally specific rather than universally held. This being the case, we argue that mere appeal to the intuitive implausibility of collective consciousness does not offer any genuine insight into the nature of mentality in general, nor the nature of consciousness in particular. ...|$|R

Contrasting this opinion, Politico's James Rosen {{described}} the chapters regarding Watergate as the [...] "ost problematic" [...] and wrote: [...] "There are numerous factual errors– misspelled names, wrong dates, phantom participants in meetings, fictitious orders given– and the authors never substantively address, only pause occasionally to demean, the vast scholarly literature that has arisen {{in the last two}} decades to explain the central mystery of Watergate." [...] Rosen's review was not entirely negative and he indicated that the book [...] "succeeds in taking readers beyond the caricatures and conspiracy theories to preserve the valuable memory of Hunt as he really was: passionate patriot; committed Cold Warrior; a lover of fine food, wine and women; incurable intriguer, wicked wit and superb storyteller." [...] Dennis Lythgoe of Deseret News said [...] "he writing style is awkward and often embarrassing", but that [...] "the book as a whole is a fascinating look into the mind of one of the major Watergate figures". In National Review, Mark Riebling praised American Spy as [...] "the only autobiography I know of that convincingly conveys what it was <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> American spy." [...] The Boston Globe writer Martin Nolan called it [...] "admirable and important" [...] and said that Hunt [...] "presents a livelier, tabloid version of the 1970s".
