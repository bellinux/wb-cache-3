5|$|Chenevix-Trench {{was known}} for his {{substantial}} tenures as headmaster of Bradfield College, Eton College and Fettes College; he had also taught at Shrewsbury School. He died in 1979. In 1994, a book by Tim Card, a former Vice-Provost of Eton, revealed {{for the first time that}} Chenevix-Trench had not left his position as headmaster of Eton of his own accord. There followed some newspaper articles critical of Chenevix-Trench's use of corporal punishment, and numerous <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> in response, most of which were positive about Chenevix-Trench's legacy. Peel, a teacher at Fettes College at the time, published The Land of Lost Content two years later.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji first {{expressed}} interest in becoming a music critic in 1914, and he started contributing criticism to The New Age in 1924, after it had published some of his <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor.</b> By 1930, Sorabji had become disillusioned with concert life and developed a growing interest in gramophone recordings, believing that he would eventually lose all reason to attend concerts. In 1945 he stopped providing regular reviews and only occasionally submitted his writings to correspondence columns in various journals. While his earlier writings reflect a contempt for the music world in general—from its businessmen to its performers—his later reviews {{tend to be more}} detailed and less caustic.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, amateur historians {{first began}} writing {{accounts}} {{of the events of}} the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In January 1950, William M. Scnure mentioned the event {{at a meeting of the}} Northumberland County Historical Society, and the fort on North Mountain was said to exist in an article written by Myrtle Magargel in 1955. In 1958 the Fishing Creek Confederacy was mentioned in the History of Columbia County, Pennsylvania, which was intended to be used in schools in Columbia County. In the 1960s and 1970s local newspapers occasionally ran articles summarizing the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 1998, the Bloomsburg Theater Ensemble compiled a book of Columbia County history based on <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor,</b> and several of these letters mentioned the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 2012 Byron Heller wrote a piece of historical fiction called The Fishing Creek Confederacy, inspired by the events of the Fishing Creek Confederacy. The confederacy has been the subject of satirical works.|$|E
