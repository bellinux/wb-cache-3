Providing the highest level of usability with regard to use of seat belt or LATCH hardware in adjacent seating positions would be achieved by placing each pair of lower anchors between the webbing and buckle hardware for the seating position. If the OBLACL is less than 710 mm, an improvised center LATCH position (permitting use of the inboard lower anchors from the outboard seating positions to secure a child restraint in the center seating position) may be feasible. The maximum spacing of this improvised center LATCH position would be 480 mm. If a vehicle allowed an improvised center LATCH position, placing the inboard lower anchor between the outboard buckle and nearest center seat belt hardware would maximize usability of the seat belt in the outboard seating position and lower anchors in the center seating position...|$|E

40|$|Australia is {{considering}} allowing {{the use of}} <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage</b> systems for child restraints in motor vehicles. However, care {{needs to be taken}} to ensure that the mix of existing Australian child restraint systems and any proposed <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage</b> system does not pose safety risks for children. In addition, it is desirable to avoid unique requirements for an Australian <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage</b> system and hence an assessment of UNECE ISOFIX and US FMVSS LATCH requirements was undertaken. A series of 28 frontal impact sled tests were conducted based on the Australian Standard AS/NZS 3629 child restraint dynamic test method. A further series of 15 tests were conducted in a vehicle body mounted on an impact sled with an acceleration-time history representative of a 56 km/h full frontal rigid barrier crash. Three different models of forward-facing child restraint were tested, with varying anchorage configurations including rigid ISOFIX, flexible LATCH strap and 3 -point seatbelt. Top tethers were evaluated with anchorages directly behind the child restraint (0 °) and offset at an angle of 20 °. P 3 and Hybrid III 3 year old dummies were used. Anchorage loads and safety performance of the restraint system were assessed. In tests in the vehicle body, maximum dynamic top tether loads were in the range of 7 - 8 kN and maximum dynamic <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage</b> loads are estimated to be in the range 13 - 14 kN. Tests using rigid ISOFIX <b>anchorages</b> generally produced <b>lower</b> head acceleration and forward excursion than other tested anchorage types.

40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{study of}} how vehicle features contribute to CRS installation errors. Thirty-two subjects were recruited based on their education level (low or high) and experience with installing CRS (none or experienced). Each subject was asked to perform four child restraint installations in three vehicles. Each subject first performed a CRS installation with a seatbelt in one vehicle, followed by three CRS installations using LATCH, one in each of three vehicles. One child restraint with a hook-on LATCH connector and one with a push-on LATCH connector were used. All installations were forward-facing, using an 18 -month-old CRABI anthropomorphic test device (ATD). Six vehicles were used in testing, with half of subjects testing with each vehicle. Conditions were selected to provide a range of LATCH locations (visible, above seating surface, buried in bight), buckle stalk types (webbing vs. rigid), and tether locations (package shelf vs. seatback). After each installation, the experimenter evaluated 28 factors for each installation (such as tightness of installation, tether tightness, and LATCH belt attached correctly). Analyses used linear mixed models to identify the CRS installation outcomes associated with vehicle features. For LATCH installations, vehicles requiring higher forces to attach connectors to <b>lower</b> <b>anchorages</b> {{were more likely to}} be attached incorrectly. Vehicle seats with a bightline waterfall (which places the lower anchorage above the seating surface) increased rates of tight CRS installation for both seatbelt and LATCH installs. Seatbelt installations were tight (and locked) more frequently when the buckle stalk was located close to the bight rather than further forward. Subjects used the tether correctly in 30 % of installations. Subjects used the tether more frequently during LATCH installations compared to seatbelt installations. The tether was used more frequently in sedans (with anchorage locations on the package shelf) than in vehicles with the tether anchorage located on the seatback. However, when the tether was used, it was routed correctly more often in vehicles with the tether anchorage on the seatback. A tether wrap around distance of 210 mm was sufficient to allow tightening of the tether with the two CRS tested, but additional testing showed that 5 / 16 CRS could not be tightened sufficiently with this wrap around distance. Installation time decreased with successive trials, but installation time was longer when subjects used the vehicle or CRS manuals. Subjects used the vehicle manual in 38 % of installations, and were more likely to do so when the tether anchorage was located on the vehicle seatback. Subjects used the CRS manual in 88 % of installations. In questionnaire responses, subjects indicated that the head restraints affected installations, and vehicle manuals varied in their ease of understanding. They also noted that tether anchorages on seatbacks were more difficult to locate than those on the package shelf. Results from this study do not fully support SAE and ISO recommendations for LATCH usability in vehicles. Recommendations ar...|$|E
40|$|The {{head and}} thorax {{of the child}} {{occupant}} are mainly injured regions in passenger car side impacts. In {{order to reduce the}} injury risks of head and thorax, a multi-objective optimization design of child restraint system (CRS) and side airbag is conducted in terms of CRS safety performances. A mathematical model of a child occupant in side collision is developed by using MADYMO software and the validity of the model is evaluated by comparing results between simulation and sled test. For the purpose of minimizing accelerations of child head and thorax, a sensitivity analysis of the design variables is conducted using the orthogonal design of experiment (DOE) and analysis of variance. The primary design variables are therefore determined, including material permeability of side airbag, location of top tether in X-direction and stiffness coefficient of <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage.</b> The objective functions for accelerations of child head and thorax are generated with second-order multinomial regression equations in terms of the determined design variables. Optimization is carried out byusing non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The optimized configuration of the CRS is obtained by further analysis based on the Pareto-optimal solutions. The results indicate that main design parameters of child restraint system are material permeability 0. 037 of side airbag, location − 0. 25 m of top tether in X-direction, stiffness coefficient 0. 5 of <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage.</b> Under the optimized condition, the peak value of head acceleration is minimized by about 24 percent.

40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} study on vibration mitigation of a stay cable {{by using a}} semi-active electro-rheological (ER) damper in an open-loop control mode. A 12 m-long stay cable specimen, which is a 1 : 12 scale model of a 143 m-long prototype cable in an actual cable structure, is established for the experimental study. A specifically designed low-force ER damper is connected perpendicular to the cable near the <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage</b> in the cable plane. By imposing random narrow-band excitation to the cable at a point near the upper anchorage, the nonlinear frequency response curves of the cable-damper system under different exciting force amplitudes and applied voltage levels are experimentally obtained, from which the resonant frequencies and equivalent viscous damping ratios corresponding to various combinations of the excitation levels and electric field strengths are identified. These results are conducive to devising an efficient multi-stepping switch control strategy. For the purpose of comparison, the dynamic responses of the cable-damper system are also analytically predicted by use of the finite element method. ...|$|R

The <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations spanned the entire range of lap belt angles permissible under FMVSS 210 and the upper anchorages (D-ring locations) were distributed widely as well.

A 12 m-long stay cable specimen, which is a 1 : 12 scale model of a 143 m-long prototype cable in an actual cable structure, is established for the experimental study. Modal testing on the pure cable without damper is first performed to identify the actual modal properties of the cable under three different tension levels. Then a series of dynamic tests are conducted on the cable incorporated with a small-size wire-rope isolator near the <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage.</b> By exciting the cable transversely at a point near the upper anchorage, the nonlinear frequency response curves of the cable-damper system under different excitation force amplitudes and three installation positions of the damper are obtained experimentally. The resonant frequencies and the equivalent viscous damping ratios of the nonlinear system under different excitation levels are also identified, which are useful for the design analysis based on linear vibration theory. The experiments show that the damping of the cable-damper system increases noticeably when the deformation of the damper attains a certain level. This feature should be beneficial to the mitigation of wind-rain-induced cable vibration because this type of vibration usually brings about large response amplitudes of the cable...|$|R

40|$|A neuro-control {{method is}} {{proposed}} for semi-active vibration control of stay cables using magneto-rheological (MR) dampers. A {{finite element model}} with multiple degrees-of-freedom is formulated for the hybrid system of a sagged stay cable incorporated with MR dampers. Two neural network control strategies are developed by using the full-order system model directly and introducing a reduced-order modal model, respectively. In the first strategy, which eschews a model reduction process, the neural network controller is designed and trained to have the dual functions of controller and observer, so that the resulting neuro-controller is able to perform the clipped linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control with incomplete state observation. In the second strategy, {{with the aid of}} a reduced-order modal model, the neural network controller is designed to consist of a control network and a state estimator network. The resulting neuro-controller performs the clipped LQG control using only a few observed states. The control effectiveness of the proposed neural network control strategies is verified numerically by application to a 12 m long scale-model cable prototype transversely connected with an MR damper near the <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage.</b> The response mitigation ability of the proposed control strategies using incomplete output observation is compared with that of the clipped LQG control with full state observation. The adaptive capability of the configured neuro-controllers under dynamic excitation distinct from training loading is examined.

A research/implementation project on using semi-active magneto-rheological (MR) dampers for cable vibration control of the bridge is in progress. As part of this ongoing project, one typical stay cable with 115 m length was installed with two MR dampers near the <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage,</b> and accelerometers were deployed on the damped cable and its two neighboring cables for long-term monitoring. After installing the dampers and sensors, wind-rain-induced cable oscillations were observed two times. This paper aims to investigate the vibration characteristics and to identify the equivalent modal damping of the cables with and without MR dampers in one wind-rain-excited event based on in-situ monitoring. In this wind-rain-excited event, the in-plane and out-of-plane responses of the damped cable and its two neighboring free cables were monitored. Equivalent modal damping ratios of the cables in both in-plane and out-of-plane motions are identified by means of spectral analysis of the measured data in conjunction with a curve-fitting technique. Such observed and identified results are beneficial to understanding the coupled motion of cables in wind-rain-excited conditions and the damping contribution of MR dampers to both in-plane and out-of-plane motions. The frequency-domain analysis of the wind-rain-excited responses of the damped and undamped cables also reveals the response characteristics under wind-rain excitation and the damping mechanism of MR dampers in suppressing such oscillation.

Although this technique has many advantages, in space closure stage causes up righting problem in upper incisors, which should be adjusted by applying additional torque in anterior region. Purpose: The purpose of this clinical trial {{was to determine whether}} there is a significant difference in final incisor inclination (torque) of two groups one treated with MBT technique and the other by changing the point of application of the closing force (in anterior region). Materials and Methods: Twelve patients (8 girls, 4 boys) with Cl I malocclusion and crowding, whom were candidate for first premolars extraction, were selected. For space closure, 6 anterior teeth (canine to canine) in upper and lower jaws ligated and the applied force was from the hooks on canines to hooks on the first molars. After space closure the results compared with the results of a previous study which treatment plan was according to original MBT technique (anterior hooks soldered to arch wire). Forces applied randomly among quadrants by NiTi coil spring (American Orthodontics Co.) or active tie backs with elastic modules (Dentaurum Co.)

In these experiments, cadavers and the 50 th percentile Hybrid III manikin were used in deceleration sled tests to simulate a frontal crash. Six cadaver tests and two Hybrid III tests were conducted at high velocity impact (ΔV = 13. 4 m/s), and three cadaver tests at low velocity impact (ΔV = 6. 7 m/s). Surrogates were instrumented with two chestbands to provide chest contours. A three-point belt instrumented with a force transducer above the shoulder level was used for restraining the surrogates. Onboard and offboard high-speed cameras captured the left and frontal-left views of the occupant. The two cameras were synchronized by a flashlight and/or film event marker. The captured crash views were used to reconstruct {{the motion of the}} surrogates in three dimensions. This information was used in conjunction with the contour records from the chestbands to reconstruct the shape of the shoulder belt at five levels; the upper anchorage point, shoulder, upper chestband, lower chestband, and the <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage</b> point. Shoulder belt tension records were used with the belt shape in vector analysis to determine the forces at the three belt levels which are in contact with the occupant.

40|$|Obesity {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the risk of some types of injury in crashes. One hypothesis is that obesity adversely effects belt fit by changing the routing of the belt relative to the underlying skeletal structures. To evaluate this hypothesis, belt fit was measured in a laboratory study of 54 men and women, 48 percent of whom were obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or greater. Test conditions included a wide range of upper and <b>lower</b> belt <b>anchorage</b> locations and ranges of seat height, seat cushion angle, and seat back angle spanning a large fraction of current vehicle front and rear seats. In some conditions, foot position was restricted to simulate the typical situation in the second row of a small sedan. Across individuals, an increase in BMI of 10 -kg/m 2 was associated with a lap belt positioned 43 mm further forward and 21 mm higher relative to the anterior-superior iliac spines of the pelvis. Each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI was associated with an increase in lap belt webbing length of 130 mm. The worsening of lap belt fit with restricted foot position was slightly greater for obese participants. Obesity was associated with a more-inboard shoulder belt routing across a wide range of upper belt anchorage locations, and the shoulder belt webbing length between the D-ring and latchplate increased by an average of 60 mm with each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI. The results suggest that obesity effectively introduces slack in the seat belt system by routing the belt further away from the skeleton. Particularly in frontal crashes, but also in rollovers and other scenarios, this slack will result in increased excursions and an increased likelihood and severity of contacts with the interior. The higher routing of the lap belt with respect to the pelvis also increases the likelihood of submarining in frontal crashes...|$|R
40|$|The {{rational}} use of natural, {{economic and}} social resources {{in order to ensure}} the sustainability and a long-term balance {{has become one of the}} largest global concerns. In the civil engineering field, the limited durability of steel reinforced concrete structures, especially in aggressive environments, and the high costs of the repair and maintenance operations have motivated the search for alternative materials and solutions to steel. One of these alternative reinforcements is the glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars due to their immunity to corrosion, which is an important advantage when comparing to steel. However, several factors such as the novelty in the market, the high fabrication costs, the different design philosophies and the uncertainties of its behaviour with the concrete have been delaying the use of the GFRP bars in a larger scale. This thesis aims to contribute to the scientific knowledge of the GFRP reinforced concrete, as it studies its behaviour and design. The research work is mainly experimental and is based on a campaign with 24 full-scale reinforced concrete (RC) beams 4. 30 m long and rectangular crosssection of 0. 25 x 0. 40 m 2, divided into two groups with different purposes: - 18 beams to study the performance of different GFRP bar layouts as shear reinforcement; - 6 beams to assess the behaviour of a rehabilitation solution with GFRP bars to replace the deteriorated flexural steel reinforcement. The specimens of the first group were designed to fail due to shear with four different GFRP shear reinforcement solutions: 1) closed hoop GFRP stirrups, 2) two C shaped GFRP bars forming a stirrup, 3) two double headed GFRP bars and 4) two simple straight GFRP bars. Two shear reinforcement ratios with different spacing were also tested with the closed hoop GFRP stirrups. For each GFRP shear reinforcement layout, three different longitudinal stiffnesses were considered using steel and GFRP bars with different ratios. The beam specimens were tested until failure under a four point loading set-up and both the serviceability and the ultimate performance were analysed. The results were reported in terms of deflections, crack pattern, crack width, strains in the longitudinal and shear reinforcements, ultimate load capacity and failure modes. The different shear layouts were compared regarding their load carrying performance and their field implementation easiness. The design of the beams and their result predictions were made according to the existing guidelines and codes. It was concluded that the closed hoop stirrups and the C-stirrups were the most efficient and that the beams load capacity was highly underestimated by the GFRP codes. To improve the design formulas of these codes, different values for the limit strains and for the strut angle were proposed. The double headed bars as shear reinforcement were also efficient in the cases with higher longitudinal stiffness because it contributed to keep the integrity of the beam by exhibiting low deflections and crack widths. It was observed that a wide crack at the end of these bars highly compromises the anchorage function of the head. The solution of the simple straight bars was not effective because of the lack of anchorage length. The idea for the second group of beams was inspired on the RC structures with deteriorated bottom concrete due to the corrosion of the longitudinal steel reinforcement. Actually, no steel corrosion was considered in these specimens, but they were concreted in two phases to simulate the replacement of the deteriorated concrete, starting at the stage after its complete removal. The rehabilitation procedure consisted on the insertion of the longitudinal GFRP bars and the concreting of a new bottom layer in the beam. Two solutions with different GFRP longitudinal cross-section areas were designed according to the existing guidelines, one to restore the ultimate load capacity of the original beam, and the other to maintain the deflection of the original beam. The ends of the GFRP bars were conic heads to compensate their <b>lower</b> <b>anchorage</b> length. The rehabilitated beam specimens were subjected to 3 point bending tests until failure, and their service and ultimate behaviour were analysed. Results are presented in terms of deflection, crack pattern, mid-span crack width, reinforcement strains, ultimate flexural capacity and failure modes. It was concluded that this technique was effective for both the serviceability and ultimate limit states of the rehabilitated beam, as it was able to restore the deflection and the load capacity of the original beam, and that the existing GFRP design documents can be used. Although this was mainly an experimental research work, a simple but reliable two-dimensional finite element (FE) model was defined using ATENA software to simulate the tests, which helped to better understand some issues regarding the specimens behaviour and enabled to extrapolate some results of non-tested possibilities. The linear and nonlinear behaviour of all materials was adequately modelled by appropriate constitutive laws. Furthermore, numerical results were compared with the experimental results. Results show that, in general there was a good agreement between the overall modelling results and the experimental ones. The constructed models were able to predict the experimental behaviour in terms of ultimate capacity and load-deflection curves. Regarding the first group of beams, two additional stirrups spacing were modelled in order to clarify its influence in the shear capacity. It was simulated different longitudinal reinforcement ratios to assess its influence in the shear capacity. As a final remark, the results of the present work show that the use of GFRP bars is viable in RC structures, which contributes to more durable structures in long-term. This material can be used as longitudinal and shear reinforcement of new structures and as a rehabilitation solution to replace the corroded steel in deteriorated structures...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 49 dynamic sled tests were {{performed}} with the Hybrid III 10 YO to examine issues relating to child belt fit. The goals of these tests were to evaluate ATD response to realistic belt geometries and belt fit, develop methods for accurate, repeatable evaluation of restraint conditions for older children, identify dependent measures that differentiate between good and poor restraint performance, and relate ATD performance to static belt fit with children. The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} lap belt tension, belt configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat lap belt guides and shoulder belt guides affect performance. In addition, the ATD’s response to different shoulder belt and lap belt geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder belt with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder belt with fixed anchorages. Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder belt load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing lap belt tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the lap belt from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more reclined initial postures and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster lap belt guide can maintain good belt position dynamically, even with poor lap belt geometry. Shoulder belt guide designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder belt from coming out of the shoulder belt guide does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the belt can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder belt dynamically. Shoulder belt scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good belt fit on the 10 YO ATD. Lap belt angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower lap belt angles leading to submarining and more vertical lap belt angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of lap belt anchorages leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both upper and <b>lower</b> belt <b>anchorage</b> locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle lap belt geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder belt geometry to keep the belt on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good static belt fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle upper anchorage locations on belt restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso belt fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|R
