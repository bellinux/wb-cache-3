40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} in men in the Western world and represents a major health problem with substantial morbidity and mortality. Sensitivity and specificity of digital rectal examination (DRE) and evaluation of prostate specific antigen (PSA) are excellent methods for diagnosis of prostate cancer, but have <b>limited</b> <b>value</b> for <b>staging.</b> Imaging of prostate cancer has become increasingly important to improve staging and management of prostate cancer patients. Conventional imaging modalities, such as transrectal ultrasound and computed tomography, show limited accuracy for a reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging has improved by dynamic contrast enhancement (DCI-MRI) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). Recently, substantial {{progress has been made in}} the development of functional and molecular imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography using radiolabeled metabolic tracers, receptor-binding ligands, amino acids, peptides, or antibodies. Here, we review the value of these novel radionuclide imaging techniques in the assessment of prostate cancer. Prostate 72 : 12621272, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|This review {{examined}} whether Loevinger’s {{measure of}} personality (ego) development {{is equivalent to}} the measurement of intelligence. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 52 correlations between ego level scores and intelligence test scores (retrieved from 42 studies involving 5, 648 participants). The weighted average correlation between ego level and intelligence ranged from. 20 to. 34, depending on the intellectual ability assessed (e. g., verbal intelligence). Adjusting for measurement unreliability increased these values only minimally. The authors also reviewed 16 studies that examined the association between ego level and various criterion variables (e. g., aggressive behavior) after statistically controlling for the effects of intelligence. Ninety-four percent of the tests revealed significant relations between ego level and criterion variables after controlling for intelligence, indicating that ego development and intelligence are not interchangeable constructs. These findings do not support recent speculations concerning the <b>limited</b> <b>value</b> of <b>stage</b> models of maturity, social development, and moral reasoning.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Sound of {{motorcycles}} {{plays an}} important role in noise pollution in big cities. This is due to the lack of national law or standards to control the noise of domestic and also imported motorcycles. This study tries to introduce a practical <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> in different <b>stage</b> of motorcycle life cycle by assessing their noise pollution. Materials and Methods: First the motorcycles noise standards at different countries were studied and they were compared with the results from noise level of 622 motorcycles in 3 different groups. The sample volume in each group corresponds to the amount of their annual production rate. Then using statistical tests, a limit was determined in which 90 % of the domestic motorcycles can be covered. The limit is proposed as the standard for domestic motorcycle noise. Results: The limit for motorcycles of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 84, 86 and 87 dB (A),respectively in the TA stage. For the COP stage (Conformity of Production), the limit increases according to certain formula. In the end, a flowchart was proposed as a standard method for measuring the sound of motorcycles in the TA and COP stages was proposed. Conclusion: Noise level of the domestic motorcycles is at least 9 dB (A) higher than the noise <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of European motorcycle. If European <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> is considered for producing the national motorcycle, 90 % of them will get out of production cycle and this would not be practical...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{benefits}} and problems of chronic intermittent treatment with haemofiltration or haemodialysis or both in patients with severe chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV) and oedema refractory to pharmacological treatment. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective case-cohort study. A general hospital in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: The results of chronic intermittent treatment with haemofiltration (n = 10) or haemodialysis (n = 2) were analysed in patients with severe chronic heart failure, predominantly due to coronary heart disease, and oedema refractory to a pharmacological regimen including high dose frusemide. INTERVENTION: Patients {{had an average of}} 25 (SD 38) treatments. RESULTS: There was improvement of NYHA class IV to III in seven patients. However, this was not reflected in a decrease in hospital admission: only two patients could be managed as outpatients. The median survival after start of the treatment was 24 days (varying from 0 to 393 days). In four patients the treatment was discontinued after discussion with the patient and family.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Maintaining {{situational}} awareness {{is a key}} challenge for disaster management officials during typhoon-induced floods. As flooding begins, quickly developing a picture of which areas are affected is key. However, optical satellites are of <b>limited</b> <b>value</b> during this <b>stage</b> since cloud still obscures the area. Satellite RADAR is ideal for this application, since RADAR images can be taken through cloud without any negative effects. Using RADAR-equipped satellites such as RADARSAT- 2, broad-area imagery can be acquired {{within hours of the}} onset of floods, and used to generate flood maps that enable officials to understand which population centres, infrastructure, and transportation routes are affected. This information can enable greatly improved effectiveness for disaster response efforts. Key considerations for the use of satellite RADAR in flood management include satellite acquisition planning, imaging beam mode selection, flood map creation using change detection algorithms, and maintaining a "dry season baseline " for comparison to images during floods that enables automated flood map generation. Advances in satellite RADAR such as the new Extra Fine beam mode on RADARSAT- 2 now enable larger areas to be covered at higher resolution, making it possible to support more detailed disaster response planning over very large areas. 1...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic tri-modal imaging (ETMI) {{incorporates}} high-resolution endoscopy (HRE), autofluorescence imaging (AFI), {{and narrow}} band imaging (NBI). A recent uncontrolled {{study found that}} ETMI improved the detection of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early carcinoma (Ca) in Barrett's esophagus (BE). The aim was to compare ETMI with standard video endoscopy (SVE) {{for the detection of}} HGD/Ca {{with the use of a}} randomized cross-over design. METHODS: Patients referred for work-up of inconspicuous HGD/Ca were eligible and underwent both SVE and ETMI in randomized order within an interval of 6 - 12 weeks. During ETMI, inspection with HRE was followed by AFI. Detected lesions were inspected in detail with NBI and biopsied, followed by random biopsies. During SVE, any visible lesion was biopsied followed by random biopsies. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with BE underwent ETMI and SVE. No significant difference was observed in overall histologic yield between ETMI and SVE. ETMI had a significantly higher targeted yield compared with SVE because of AFI. However, the yield of targeted biopsies of ETMI was significantly inferior to the overall yield of SVE. Detailed inspection with NBI reduced the false-positive rate of HRE + AFI from 71 % to 48 % but misclassified 17 % of HGD/Ca lesions as not suspicious. CONCLUSIONS: ETMI statistically significant improves the targeted detection of HGD/Ca compared with SVE. Subsequent characterization of lesions with NBI appears to be of <b>limited</b> <b>value.</b> At this <b>stage,</b> ETMI cannot replace random biopsies for detection of lesions or targeted biopsies for characterization of lesions in a high-risk populatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{evaluation}} of the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> which are stated in CUR 236 – Micropiles is presented. This evaluation has been done by means of a dataset. The dataset contained information on failure tests performed on four different types of micropiles, and was initially used for research on relations between logged installation aspects and the final capacity of the piles; such relations were however not found. This was mainly caused by the shape in which the data was logged, and the lack of details in the data. During this research, significant differences between raw data and data adapted according the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> stated in CUR 236, were found. This led to a change in research direction towards the evaluation of the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>values</b> are values that are used to build in additional safety in a design, and thus, to prevent unsafe situations. The values are based on the shape of data in which in general a linear relation between maximum mobilized shear stresses (τ_(mob;max)) and cone resistance (q_c). This relation continues up to a certain cone resistance level, after which τ_(mob;max) does not increase significantly anymore. The point where no significant increase in τ_(mob;max) over q_c was seen, was used as the <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> for the cone resistance. The limit for α_t was chosen to be 2. 5 % and the limit for τ_(mob;max) 2. 5 % of the cone resistance <b>limit.</b> Data with <b>values</b> above these <b>limits,</b> has to be reduced to the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> (CUR 236, 2011) Differences were thus found between raw data, the same data but then adapted according the <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> method stated in CUR 236, and values stated in CUR 236 Table 6. 1. For further investigation on how these differences were caused, the available dataset was combined with data from the appendix ‘Bijlage A. Proefbelastingen’ of CUR 236. This showed that the current <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> did not suit the shape of the data very well. Investigation on the usefulness of the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> showed that they are useful for the design process by preventing under- and overestimations of the capacity. <b>Limit</b> <b>values</b> are thus useful, but not in their current form. New <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> were therefore proposed based on a statistical analysis of the available data points. Next to <b>limit</b> <b>values,</b> also design values (expectancy and lower bound) are added. Because no detailed data for all micropile types was available, it is advised to re-elaborate the limit- and design values for the types that were left out of the proposal given in this thesis, in a similar, statistical way. Furthermore is it advised to investigate a different method to estimate the shear stresses that can be mobilized along the anchor body of a micropile, based on a more fundamental approach. Currently are those stresses often based on full-scale tests from which τ_(mob;max) is derived, but bounded by the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> A different approach to this might be more time- and cost-effective.
