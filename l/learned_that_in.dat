Scouts had <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the village Quatliam {{the support of the}} Taliban was not as high as {{in other parts of the}} area, thus this point would be the main focus of the ground attack. The plan was simple: Afghan police, backed by the US Army 1-87 infantry regiment, would march along the eastern flank, along Kunduz River, toward the village of Isa Khel, while German armored troops would secure the trail between Isa Khel and Quatliam. Then the Germans paratroopers, reinforced by a unit of the Afghan army, would come from the north, outflanking the Taliban in Quatliam, with the Afghan army taking positions on the west of the village and the Germans on the east. Afghan militias, supported by 150 American infantry troops would close the circle from the south, forcing the insurgents to give up or flee.|$|E

Broderick denied the charge, conceding that he was on the same plane as Kaye but that it was a [...] "coincidence." [...] He admitted that he knew Madden and [...] "every gangster in New York.

500|$|Author Amish Tripathi is {{a finance}} {{professional}} educated from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). While {{working in the}} insurance industry, Tripathi felt that his life was devoid of any meaning or self. Ultimately {{he decided to take}} the spiritual route. He started reading on the different philosophies and the Indian mythologies. One day, while watching a historical program, Tripathi and his family got into the discussion about consciousness and the evil inside man. In the program they <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> ancient Persia, demons were known as Daeva (a term reserved for the Gods in Indian mythology), and angels were called Asuras (a term reserved for demons in Indian mythology). Tripathi added, [...] "It set me thinking that this was exact opposite of our Vedic etymology where evil was Asura and gods were Devas. It struck me that if the two civilizations were to confront each other, they would be at stark odds and calling each other evil." [...] But when he decided {{to write a book about}} the philosophy of evil, his family discouraged him, saying that the subject itself was not popular and would get a narrow audience. They suggested that Tripathi write a thriller/adventure novel and the philosophy should be a part of the story, hence there would be a mainstream appeal in it. Tripathi felt that no subject was better than Shiva, one of the major Hindu deity and the destroyer of evil; his journey and stories about him would deliver the philosophy that he wanted to convey, to his readers. Once he started to write a book about Shiva, he decided to base it on some fundamental beliefs of his. He noted that the Hindu Gods were probably not [...] "mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination", but rather they were once human beings like the rest. It was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods.|$|E

In July 1877, four months into his term, he <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Martinsburg, Berkeley County, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad workers had been stopping trains to protest wage cuts. He called out a local militia company to disperse the protest. Among the company were several rail workers sympathetic to the strike. The militia acted indecisively until a striker named William Vandergriff fired on the militia and was mortally wounded when a militiaman returned fire. Local papers criticized Gov. Mathews' initiative and deemed Vandergriff a [...] "martyr," [...] and the militia officially conveyed to Mathews that they would thereon refuse his orders.|$|E
2500|$|UNSCOM <b>learned</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> August 1990, after Iraq's {{invasion}} of Kuwait, Taha's team {{was ordered to}} set up a program to weaponize the biological agents. By January 1991, a team of 100 scientists and support staff had filled 157 bombs and 16 missile warheads with botulin toxin, and 50 bombs and five missile warheads with anthrax. In an interview with the BBC, Taha denied the Iraqi government had weaponized the bacteria. [...] "We never intended to use it," [...] she told journalist Jane Corbin of the BBC's Panorama program. [...] "We never wanted to cause harm or damage to anybody." [...] UNSCOM found the munitions dumped in a river near al-Hakam. UNSCOM also discovered that Taha's team had conducted inhalation experiments on donkeys from England and on beagles from Germany. The inspectors seized photographs showing beagles having convulsions inside sealed containers.|$|E

2500|$|The NTSB <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Flight 811's case, the {{aircraft}} had experienced intermittent malfunctions of its forward cargo {{door in the}} {{months prior to the}} accident. [...] Based on this, the NTSB concluded in its April 1990 report that these malfunctions had damaged the door locking mechanism in a manner which caused the door to show a latched and locked indication, without being fully latched and locked. Thus, the NTSB attributed the accident to human error by the ground crew. [...] Based on this hypothesis of in-service damage, the NTSB also faulted the airline for improper maintenance and inspection due to its failure to identify the damaged locking mechanism. [...] Focusing on damage to the door and maintenance procedures, the NTSB concluded that the accident was preventable human error, and not a problem inherent in the design or function of {{the aircraft}}'s cargo door.|$|E
2500|$|Hilberg's work {{received}} a hostile reception from Yad Vashem, particularly over {{his treatment of}} Jewish resistance to the perpetrators of the Holocaust in the book's concluding chapter. Hilberg argued that [...] "The reaction pattern of the Jews is characterized by almost complete lack of resistance...he documentary evidence of Jewish resistance, overt or submerged, is very slight". Hilberg attributed this lack {{of resistance to the}} Jewish experience as a minority: [...] "In exile, the Jews... had learned that they could avert danger and survive destruction by placating and appeasing their enemies...Thus over a period of centuries the Jews had <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> order to survive they had to restrain from resistance". Yad Vashem's scholars, including Josef Melkman and Nathan Eck, did not feel that Hilberg's characterizations of Jewish history were correct, but they also felt that by using Jewish history to explain the reaction of the Jewish community to the Holocaust, Hilberg was suggesting that some responsibility for the extent of the destruction fell on the Jews themselves, a position that they found unacceptable. The 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, and the subsequent publication by Hannah Arendt and Bruno Bettelheim of works that were more critical of Jewish actions during the Holocaust than Hilberg had been, inflamed the controversy. In 1967, Nathan Eck wrote a sharply critical review of Hilberg, Arendt, and Bettelheim's claims in Yad Vashem Studies, the organization's research journal, titled [...] "Historical Research or Slander".|$|E
