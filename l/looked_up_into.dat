2500|$|Like {{most people}} who came to Gettysburg, the Rathvon family was aware that the {{president}} of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, was going to make some remarks. [...] The family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet. [...] At the head of the procession rode Abraham Lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen. [...] Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by Edward Everett of Massachusetts whom Rathvon accurately described as the [...] "most finished orator of the day." [...] Rathvon then goes on to describe how Lincoln stepped forward and [...] "with a manner serious almost to sadness, gave his brief address." [...] During the delivery, along with some other boys, young Rathvon wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of Mr. Lincoln and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> what he described as Lincoln's [...] "serious face." [...] Rathvon recalls candidly that, although he listened [...] "intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly," [...] he explains, [...] "boylike, I could not recall any of it afterwards." [...] But he explains that if anyone said anything disparaging about [...] "honest Abe," [...] there would have been a [...] "junior battle of Gettysburg." [...] In the recording Rathvon speaks of Lincoln's speech allegorically [...] "echoing through the hills." ...|$|E

For example, in one experiment, one or more confederates would <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the sky; {{bystanders}} would then <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the sky {{to see what they}} were seeing. At one point this experiment aborted, as so many people were <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> that they stopped traffic. See conformity, and the Asch conformity experiments.|$|R
