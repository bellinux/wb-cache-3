40|$|Abstract — Repetitive {{tasks are}} {{known as one of}} the {{prevalent}} root causes of muscle fatigue. <b>Light</b> <b>assembly</b> tasks, which are common in electronic and electrical industries, are a class of repetitive tasks with involving light weight (< 1 kg). The upper limb region was reported as most complained of strain by the workers doing this type of job. This study aims to investigate the time to fatigue for upper limb muscles in a <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> task. Twenty subjects (10 males and 10 females) with mean (SD) age of 24. 05 (1. 76) years performed a <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> task continuously for two hours. The time to fatigue was defined by significant changes in RMS of electromyography as well as grip strength. Results from RMS EMG show that upper trapezius muscle (right and left) was the muscle fastest being fatigued the fasted (90 minute), followed the right and the left anterior deltoid (95 minutes), the right and the left brachioradialis (100 minutes) and right and the left bicep brachii muscle (110 minutes). On the other hand, a significant change in grip and pinch strength occurred after 100 minutes and 120 minutes work, respectively.

40|$|Abstract — A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of load on upper limb muscles and brain activities in <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> task. The task was conducted at two levels of load (Low and high). Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure upper limb muscle activities of six subjects. The results found that the Mean Power Frequency (MPF) of the brachioradialis and upper trapezius activities were higher on the low-load task compared to high-load task. The EMG MPF also tended to decrease as time increases, that reflects muscle fatigue. Electroencephalography (EEG) was simultaneously recorded with EMG to record brain activities from Fz, Pz, O 1 and O 2 channels. Mean power of the EEG alpha bands from the channels were found to be higher on the low-load task compared to high-load task. The results indicated that high-load task require more brain activitie than the low-load task. It is also found that there was relation between upper limb muscles and brain activities while performing <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> task. Thus these results can would be potentially useful in the management of fatigue, especially related to muscle and mental workload.

The Sprint also {{received a}} platform upgrade, which was now {{the same as that of}} the Alfa Romeo 33; this entailed modified front suspension, brakes mounted in the wheels instead of inboard like on the Alfasud, and drum brakes at the rear end.Three models made up the Sprint range: 1.3 and 1.5, with engines and performance unchanged from the Alfasud Sprint Veloce, and the new 1.5 Quadrifoglio Verde—1.5 Cloverleaf in the UK.A multitude of changes were involved in the stylistic refresh; there were a new grille, headlamps, wing mirrors, window surrounds and C-pillar ornaments. Bumpers went from chrome to plastic, and large plastic protective strips were added to the body sides; both sported coloured piping, which was grey for 1.3 cars, red for the 1.5 and green for the 1.5 Quadrifoglio.

40|$|As the {{automotive}} industry becomes increasingly competitive, parts manufacturers are under extreme pressure {{to improve the quality}} of their parts, while at the same time reducing costs. The method currently used to detect failures in automotive <b>light</b> <b>assemblies</b> after vibration endurance testing involves manual inspection only after the test is completed. An adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and diagnostic system that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure is desired. This thesis describes accelerometer based, microphone (single and dual-microphone) based and acoustic emission sensor based monitoring systems for automotive light assembly failure detection during endurance testing. Preliminary results from accelerometer based and dual-microphone based diagnostic systems show that significant differences between healthy and faulty fog <b>light</b> <b>assemblies</b> can be detected. Based on these initial testing results, subsequent testing and data analysis were conducted for accelerometer based and dual microphone based systems. Four data analysis methods have been used: (1) Averaging signals in the time domain, (2) FFT of time domain waveforms over a specified time, (3) Averaging frequency spectra, and (4) Statistical methods for time domain signals. Individual frequency spectra (from FFT) and the average of multiple frequency spectra have shown potential to distinguish between signals from faulty and healthy <b>light</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Statistical measures, such as, Arithmetic mean (µ) and Kurtosis (K) can also be used to differentiate healthy and faulty <b>light</b> <b>assemblies.</b> In general, this work has shown the good potential to develop methods for adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and diagnostic systems that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure. i...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the high}} rate of {{failures}} and damages occurring with current traffic <b>light</b> <b>assemblies</b> because of motorists striking them or the nature of the components, {{there is a need for}} optimizing the production rate. This need is specifically aimed at accommodating replacement at a quicker rate as well as a new method of assembly by using different materials and components. Therefore it is necessary to implement a new facilities plan to improve the current situation and reduce costs associated with a prolonged repair programme. A modular replaceable traffic light is an innovative and cost efficient solution to the conventional traffic <b>light</b> <b>assemblies.</b> This report outlines the key principles and activities that occur in optimizing a facilities plan layout for the assembly of a replaceable traffic light. The details of the entire assembly line project and facilities layout are explained and investigated in this report. Facilities layout planning is the critical component in a company’s future growth and development plans; it provides the company with a long-term solution for reaching its desired goals and vision. By implementing the correct facilities planning tools and techniques a number of benefits will be achieved namely a reduction in costs associated with a production line assembly; bottlenecks will be reduced thus increasing material flow and an improved working environment all contribute to the success of a correctly implemented facilities layout. The modular replaceable traffic light is constructed out of the latest polymer plastic which allows for quick assembly due to its light weight and manoeuvrability. By implementing the steps necessary to create an optimal facilities plan layout the replacement time for damaged or broken traffic lights currently on the roads today will be significantly reduced. Facilities’ planning allows managers to do a better job and ensures that all employees are working towards achieving the company’s goals and objectives. Thesis (B Eng.

The task was conducted in two levels of time pressure (No time-stress and time-stress levels). Each task was done for one hour experiment. Surface electromyography (SEMG) measured upper limb muscle activities from six subjects. The results indicated that the biceps brachii and upper trapezius activities tend to increase as the increase of time. It indicated muscle fatigue. Electroencephalography (EEG) was simultaneously recorded with SEMG to record brain activities from Fz, Pz, O 1 and O 2 channels. EEG alphas RMS were higher on the task with time-stress than task without time-stress. The significant correlation was found between SEMG RMS and EEG alpha RMS.

On the far wall another smaller oval dish has a series of diffused moving lights playing across it, accompanied {{by the sound of}} gently whirring motors. Each of these 3 D-printed robotic <b>light</b> <b>assemblies</b> has organic materials mounted within its barrel, and through which light must pass, before it plays on the dish, causing complex, diffused revolving patterns. The sound track that travels {{around the perimeter of the}} room presents a mixture of found and processed nocturnal sounds of the South-Central Queensland/Australian bush at night, recorded during a time of seasonal change. Audience movements (disturbances) within the space are sensed and cause subtle changes in the video mixing, and in the sound mix’s layering and panning, and in the pace of the robotic motors, all of which are computer controlled. By drawing inspiration from the subtle transitions between what Europeans once named ‘Summer’ and ‘Autumn’ and the multiple seasons recognised by indigenous cultures, and by including audience ‘disturbances’ within the work, Seasonal creates a compelling environment that wraps audiences in luscious, yet ominous atmospheres beyond sight and hearing. By amplifying and shining light upon a myriad of mysterious lives lived in blackness, the work presents a sensuous, deep engagement with nocturnal seasonal forms: whilst hinting at a far less comforting background increasingly framed by anthropogenic climate change...|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{currently}} uses General Luminaire Assemblies (GLAs) as {{its primary}} light source. These GLAs {{are composed of}} fluorescent lighting and are integrated into the electrical system on Station. Seventy seven of these units are distributed throughout the vehicle, {{and many of the}} lights, having reached their lifespan, are no longer functional; while backup panels are available on orbit, it is anticipated that the supplies of fluorescents on the station will be exhausted by 2015. The ISS vehicle office is therefore preparing to replace all of the GLAs, with Solid State <b>Light</b> <b>Assemblies</b> (SSLAs) composed of white Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). In the Spring of 2010, an announcement for the replacement lights was released. The announcement specified that proposed lighting systems should use LED technology, given certain power draw restrictions and no changes to how the lights are currently controlled (a central on/off switch per node, and a dial to turn on/off and increase brightness on each lighting unit). The replacement lights are to follow current specifications for brightness levels (lux) and color temperature (degrees Kelvin, or K). Reportedly, the lighting on orbit is dim and suboptimal. The average brightness of the lights (given all lights within a node are operational) is 291 lux; by comparison, recommended office lighting ranges from 200 to 500 lux, and daylight ranges on a typical overcast day, consists of 10, 000 to 25, 000 lux. Representatives from NASA Behavioral Health and Performance Element (BHP) and Human Factors and Habitability identified that maintaining current brightness levels limits visual acuity, work space, and the use of light as a countermeasure for improving circadian entrainment, hastening phase shifting, evoking acute alertness and enhancing performance. Revised lighting specifications are therefore needed to optimize the replacement lights for the ISS...|$|E
