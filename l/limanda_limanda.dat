40|$|This paper {{describes}} ecological {{characteristics of}} the western sand extraction area off the Belgian coast. A review of scientific research is given with special reference to a long term ecological monitoring programme. Relevant clauses concerning the exploration and exploitation of the Belgian continental shelf were elaborated in the law of 13 June 1969. In application to this law two Royal Decrees were published to regulate exploitation. The ecological monitoring programme investigated benthic communities and demersal fish population since 1977. Close {{attention was paid to}} the evolution of dominant species belonging to the epibenthic fauna e. g. the brittle stars (Ophiura texturata and Ophiura albida), the common starfish (Asterias rubens), the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) and the common swimming crab (Macropipus holsatus) in relation to sedimentological features. The southeastern part of this sand extraction area is a nursery ground for dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda)</b> and sole (Solea solea) mostly belonging to the pre-recruit 0 -age group. A small stock of adult dab with commercial size inhabited the area, although the area was dominated by Gadiformes (Merlangius merlangus, Trisopterus luscus, <b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda</b> and Pleuronectes platessa). A change in the distribution of these populations as a consequence of sand extraction was not obvious...|$|E

There was a tendency to increased haematocrits and lymphocyte numbers at low diesel oil doses, whereas high doses (particularly with longer exposure) gave significantly decreased values. Serum lysozyme levels were decreased, but serum bactericidal and anti-protease activities tended to increase following exposure. Kidney phagocyte respiratory burst activity and cell migration also showed a trend to lower levels relative to control fish, whereas the number of antibody-secreting cells from the kidney were increased with high drilling mud concentration.

Concentrations of the main PAH metabolites 1 -hydroxypyrene, 1 -hydroxyphenanthren and 3 -hydroxybenzo(a) pyrene were determined in bile by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Fish species under investigation were dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda),</b> flounder (Platichthys flesus) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus).

40|$|Results {{obtained}} {{during a}} survey of 20 years on plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and 15 years on flounder (Platichthys flesus) and dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda)</b> are reported. With flounder, two periods could be distinguished. In 1975 - 1981, higher mercury concentrations (0. 38 mg/kg on average) with rather large variations were noted. From 1982 on, concentrations fluctuated around the same mean value (0. 23 mg/kg). A gradual decrease of mercury levels in plaice was observed during the twenty years' monitoring period. The mean concentration in 1990 (0. 06 mg/kg) was only one third of that of 1971 (0. 18 mg/kg). In contrast with flounder and plaice, mercury concentrations in dab remained practically {{at the same level}} (0. 09 - 0. 13 mg/kg) ...|$|E
40|$|The myxosporean {{parasite}} Myxobolus aeglefini is {{a marine}} species, {{which can be}} found in the cartilage of mainly gadid fish species.

Therefore a molecular study was conducted to reveal differences at the DNA level between these isolates. PCR was successfully conducted on three different isolates of Myxobolus aeglefini sampled from cod (Gadus morhua), plaice and dab respectively, using 18 S rDNA as template. A PCR product of approx. 1600 base pairs was obtained and RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymerase) was conducted on the fragment with the restriction enzymes Hinf I, Msp I and Hae III.

40|$|Prey {{items of}} 0 - and 1 -group plaice Pleuronectes platessa, sole Solea solea, brill Scophthalmus rhombus, turbot S. maximus and dab <b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda</b> {{of the surf}} zone of a Belgian sandy beach, {{included}} hyperbenthic (e. g; mysids), endobenthic (e. g. Polychaetes) and epibenthic (e. g. shrimps) species. Little dietary overlap was observed. If diet overlap did occur, it mainly involved prey species that are dominant in the surf zone of Belgian beaches, such as shrimps and mysids. These results suggest an opportunistic utilization by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Also, two strategically different feeding habits could be distinguished between the five flatfish species. Turbot and brill mainly fed on large, highly mobile prey (e. g. fish, mysids) and had a rather narrow prey spectrum, whereas plaice, dab and sole ate more benthic prey (e. g.

40|$|North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda)</b> were {{experimentally}} {{stored in}} ice for 6 days during the 181 th cruise of the FRV “Wather Herwig III”.

The quality of both species was determined by sensory assessment of the quality grade, by measuring of the impedance using the German Fischtester VI and the Icelandic RT- tester and pH- and TVB- N- measurements. The average length of North Sea dab is generally small (female: 18, 5 ± 3, 9 cm; male: 17 ± 2, 9 cm), therefore it seemed to be more efficient to process fish portions (eviscerated, head, tail, fins and part of belly flaps removed).

40|$|Abstract Baited {{underwater}} camera (BUC) {{systems to}} estimate demersal fish abundance {{are becoming increasingly}} considered {{as an alternative to}} tradi-tional survey methods, particularly in environments that contain sensitive habitats or protected species. Based on 27 replicate deployments of BUCs at 100 m depth in the northern North Sea, in rank order of abundance, hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), flatfish mainly dabs (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda),</b> whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and haddock (Melanogramus aeglefinus) were observed consistently at baits. Higher maximum numbers (Nmax) occurred during daytime in all species with the most significant effect in flatfish, 18 in daytime and 5 at night-time. Bottom current had no significant effect on numbers of whiting, flatfish or haddock. The Nmax of hagfish was strongly related to current speed in a non-linear way with an increase in numbers up to 10 cm s- 1 and then decrease in Nmax at higher water speeds. Understanding and account-ing for such species-specific influences is important in the design of long term monitoring surveys using baited cameras...|$|E
40|$|Malformation {{rates in}} fish embryos have been {{monitored}} {{for several years}} in the Southern North Sea.

For embryos of all species investigated synchronous trends for the fluctuation of malformation rates over the time were registered in the areas covered with intermediate prevalences {{at the beginning of the}} studies in 1984 and maxima in 1987. Thereafter malformation rates of all species decreased significantly followed by an increase in 1996. It was found that a significant negative correlation between surface water temperature and prevalences of malformed embryos of dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda)</b> and other species existed over time and space. These correlations became increasingly visible with decreasing concentrations of organochlorines in livers of dab. From these findings it is concluded that temperatures possibly predispose developing fish embryos to the impact of pollutants...|$|E
40|$|During cruises with Danish {{research}} vessels {{more than}} 17, 000 wild marine fish belonging to 41 different species were sampled and examined virologically. Birnavirus serogroup B was isolated from 7 marine fish species: plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda),</b> flounder (Platichthys flesus), smear dab (Microstomus kitt), {{long rough dab}} (Hippoglossoides platessoides), cod (Gadus morhua) and grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus) with 43 of the 45 isolations coming from flatfish. Birnavirus serogroup B seems to be endemic in the North Sea close to Denmark and in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. Surveillance of aquacultured fish, mainly rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), for VHS, IHN and IPN, in Denmark during the previous 30 years, have resulted in Birnavirus serogroup B isolations twice. These isolations were from healthy rainbow trout. Samples sent to the Danish Veterinary Laboratory for virological examination and charac-terisation have revealed the presence of Birnavirus serogroup B in haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), plaice and dab from wild marine fish caught by Irish fishermen and from Icelandic farmed halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) ...|$|E
40|$|During the Bremerhaven Workshop an improved, {{fast and}} easy method for the {{determination}} of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in dab <b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda</b> liver was tested. The improvement involved {{the use of a}} 12500 x g supernatant instead of the microsomal fraction, thus omitting the need for long ultra-centrifugations which cannot be carried out aboard a research vessel. EROD activities in the 12 500 x g supernatant and in the microsomal suspension were well correlated. Despite its disadvantages of lower specific EROD activity, higher minimum detection limit and higher analytical variance, the 12 500 x g supernatant was used for further analysis. EROD activity in dab liver showed a spatial trend corresponding to a pollution gradient in the German Bight. EROD activity was highest at sampling sites near to the Elbe and Weser estuaries. The same trend was found in liver concentrations of PCB and lindane, but not of heavy metals and other pesticides...|$|E
40|$|Variability in {{the high}} {{mortality}} rate during early life stages {{is considered to be}} one of the principal determinants of year-class variability in fish stocks. The influence of water column stability on the spatial distribution of fish larvae and their prey is widely acknowledged. Water column stability may also impact growth through the early life history of fishes, and consequently alter the probability of survival to maturity by limiting susceptibility to predation and starvation. As a test of this concept, the variability in condition and growth of dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda)</b> and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) larvae was investigated in relation to seasonal stratification of the water column in the north-western Irish Sea. RNA/DNA ratios and otolith microincrement analysis were used to estimate nutritional status and recent growth rates of larvae captured on four cruises in May and June of 1998 and 1999. Dab and sprat larvae were less abundant in 1999 and were in poorer condition with lower growth rates than in 1998. Dab larvae o...|$|E
40|$|Various {{antarctic}} fish species, particularly Chaenocephalus aceratus, Champsocephalus gunnari and Gobionotothen gibberifrons, from 1987 and 1991 were {{analysed for}} 10 nonpolar xenobiotic compounds. Concentrations expressed {{on the basis}} of extractable organic matter (EOM) were nearly identical in liver and adipose tissue. They were also independent of fish weight. Concentrations of HCB, which were as high as in <b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda</b> of the North Sea (20 ng/g EOM), are interpreted as results of cold condensation. p,p'-DDE, trans-nonachlor and PCB congeners 153, 138, 180 ranged one to two orders of magnitude lower than in North Sea fish. In addition, nonachlor III, octachlorobornane and mirex were roughly quantified. A residual compound comparable in concentration to octachlorobornane and not yet described in the literature was tentatively identified. From chromatographic and mass spectrometric data the elemental composition C sub(10) H sub(3) OCl sub(7) was derived. p,p'-DDE and the three PCB congeners increased in Antarctica between 1987 and 1991 due to global redistribution...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} and discusses {{spatial and temporal}} patterns in the prevalence of major skin diseases (lymphocystis, epidermal hyperplasia/papilloma, ulcers), intestinal parasite Glugea sp., and liver cancer in dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda)</b> and flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Dutch section of the North Sea since the mid- 1980 s. We have attempted to relate disease prevalence trends in both species to chemical contaminant exposure and other relevant environmental factors including fish condition factor, population density, fishing activity, and water temperature. We observed a long-term decline in chemical-related liver cancer in the populations of both species since the early 1990 s. Lymphocystis and skin ulcer (flounder only) have also displayed a significant decrease since then. We conclude that the widespread decline in the prevalence of several skin diseases and liver cancer in dab and flounder in Dutch waters {{in the past two}} decades is most likely due to the improved water quality and health conditions in this region...|$|E
40|$|The {{most obvious}} effect of fishing on non-target species is direct mortality. To {{quantify}} this {{effect on the}} vulnerability of species requires measurement of the current fishing mortality rate and of the tolerance of the species to fishing mortality. These are difficult to estimate for the little-studied non-target species. We describe two potential methods for estimating current fishing mortality rate when data are limited. Their application is illustrated for dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda)</b> and grey gurnard (Eutrigula gurnardus), two common non-target species in the North Sea. We also develop approaches to define tolerance levels for fishing mortality for little-studied and rare species, based on the potential jeopardy level: the fishing mortality that causes a reduction in spawning stock biomass per recruit relative to the unexploited situation. We propose that for non-target species, models founded on basic knowledge of life history parameters, and on generally established relationships between these parameters, may offer the only practical approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{discrimination}} {{of stocks}} and separate reproductive units within fish species to facilitate fisheries management based on biological data {{has always been a}} challenge to fisheries biologists. We describe the use of three different molecular genetic techniques to detect genetic differences between stocks and closely related species. Direct sequencing of the mitochondrial ND 3 gene describes the relationship between different aquaculture strains and natural populations of rainbow trout and revealed genetic homogeneity within the hatchery strains. Microsatellite analyses were used to explore the differences between redfish species from the genus Sebastes and to verify populations structure within S. mentella and S. marinus. This lead to an un equivocal discrimination of the species and an indication of populations structure within those species in the North Atlantic.

This paper concerns the strate gy adopted for the French coast.

Randomization methods were used to test for evidence of non-randomness in patterns of highlighted discard samples, e. g. repeated observations of extreme mean lengths for consecutive discard samples across trips from the same vessel. European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), common dab (<b>Limanda</b> <b>limanda),</b> grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) were considered because these were the most abundant species {{in most of the}} discard samples. A linear mixed model was used to estimate randomsample effects on the estimated mean lengths by species.
