40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether Negative Affectivity (NA) causes bias in self-report measures of activity <b>limitations</b> or whether NA has a real, non-artifactual association with activity <b>limitations.</b> The Symptom Perception Hypothesis (NA negatively biases self-reporting), Disability Hypothesis (activity <b>limitations</b> cause NA) and Psychosomatic Hypothesis (NA causes activity <b>limitations)</b> were examined longitudinally using both self-report and objective activity <b>limitations</b> measures. Participants were 101 stroke {{patients and their}} caregivers interviewed within two weeks of discharge, six weeks later and six months post-discharge. NA and self-report, proxy-report and observed performance activity (walking) <b>limitations</b> were assessed at each interview. NA was associated with activity <b>limitations</b> across measures.

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine whether the onset of functional <b>limitations</b> and their severity is associated with increases in cognitive decline among older adults. Methods: The study sample consists of 3825 (65 % African Americans and 53 % females) participants over the age of 65 with no functional <b>limitations.</b> Cognitive function was assessed using a standardized global cognitive score, and functional <b>limitations</b> using a summary measure of 8 Rosow-Breslau and Nagi <b>limitations</b> (ROS-B/Nagi).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} work-related <b>limitations</b> {{assessed}} using self-report, clinical examination and functional testing {{in patients with}} chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHODS: Work-related <b>limitations</b> of 92 patients were assessed using self-report, clinical examination and functional testing. To obtain the assessed <b>limitations</b> the patient (self-report), the physician (clinical examination) and a trained evaluator (functional testing) completed a scorings form about the work-related <b>limitations</b> of the patient. The Isernhagen Work Systems Functional Capacity Evaluation (IWS FCE) was used to obtain the functional testing results. A kappa value of more than 0. 60, absolute agreement of more than 80 % and ICC of more than 0. 75 were considered as acceptable. RESULTS: Little agreement and correlation among self-report, clinical examination and functional testing were found {{for the assessment of}} work-related <b>limitations.</b> Self-reported <b>limitations</b> were considerably higher than from those derived from clinical examination or functional testing. Additionally, the <b>limitations</b> derived from the clinical examination were higher than those derived from the IWS FCE.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between self-reported and professionally assessed functional <b>limitations</b> in community-dwelling very old individuals. In total, 306 single-living adults aged 81 - 90 years were included in this cross-sectional study. The main outcome measure was the presence and absence of self-reported and professionally assessed functional <b>limitations.</b> A significant correlation was found between the total number of self-reported and professionally assessed functional <b>limitations</b> in the total sample (intraclass correlation= 0. 65) as well as in subgroups with respect to sex, age, and depression.
