30|$|There {{is always}} an {{imperative}} need for cost-effective, eco-friendly, and nontoxic photocatalytic nanomaterials and their photoexcitation using visible (or solar) light. Although plasmonic photocatalysis overcomes the requirement of UV irradiation, it still has concerns with respect to environmental and biomedical utilizations. For example, nano-sized plasmonic photocatalysts (e.g. 1 [*]−[*] 100  nm) could potentially have hazardous and adverse (e.g. carcinogenic and cytotoxic) biological effects, which often result in the <b>limited</b> <b>utilizations</b> for environmental remediation and biomedicine [23, 24]. Noble metals (e.g. Ag, Au, and Pt) also have some drawbacks, including rarity, high cost, and easy dissolution (especially for Ag) upon exposure to air or humidity. In this respect, nontoxic organic photosensitizers (e.g. natural dyes or proteins) could potentially be an excellent alternative to noble mNP-based plasmonic photocatalysts, as photosensitization has a great similarity with visible light-driven plasmonic photocatalysis.|$|R

This {{study was conducted}} to determine differences in carbon source utilization of Salmonella Oranienburg and Salmonella Saintpaul (isolated from tropical river water) as well as the control strain Salmonella Typhimurium exposed to laboratory, river water, and host cells (Hep- 2 cell line) growth conditions. Results showed that Salmonella Oranienburg and Salmonella Saintpaul showed better ability for carbon source utilization under the three growth conditions evaluated; however, S.

In conclusion, this study suggests that environmental Salmonella strains show better survival and preconditioning abilities to external environments than the control strain based on their plasticity on diverse carbon sources use...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{image quality}} of low-dose CT scans {{typically}} suffers greatly from the <b>limited</b> <b>utilization</b> of X-ray radiation. Although {{the harmful effects}} to patient health are reduced, the low quality of the reconstructions makes diagnostics difficult. In previous work, we have demonstrated a method that can restore a low-dose image by ways of a database of reference images.

While effective, the need to store images with {{many different types of}} corruptions and alignments greatly impeded system scalability. In this current work, we have significantly simplified the database which now is comprised of just a set of regular-dose patient scans. Our present scheme performs both alignment and artifact generation on the fly and uses a sophisticated image and feature matching scheme to find good candidates to support our MR-NLM filtering scheme.
