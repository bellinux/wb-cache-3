5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of the gondola structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> the top of the tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED lights on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E

40|$|Artificial <b>light</b> <b>at</b> {{night is}} a rapidly {{increasing}} phenomenon {{and it is}} presumed to have global implications. <b>Light</b> <b>at</b> night {{has been associated with}} health problems in humans as a consequence of altered biological rhythms. Effects on wild animals have been less investigated, but <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night has often been assumed to affect seasonal cycles of urban dwellers. Using light loggers attached to free-living European blackbirds (Turdus merula), we first measured <b>light</b> intensity <b>at</b> night which forest and city birds are subjected to in the wild. Then we used these measurements to test for the effect of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night on timing of reproductive physiology. Captive city and forest blackbirds were exposed to either dark nights or very low <b>light</b> intensities <b>at</b> night (0. 3 lux). Birds exposed to <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night developed their reproductive system up to one month earlier, and also moulted earlier, than birds kept under dark nights. Furthermore, city birds responded differently than forest individuals to the <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night treatment, suggesting that urbanization can alter the physiological phenotype of songbirds. Our results emphasize the impact of human-induced lighting on the ecology of millions of animals living in cities and call for an understanding of the fitness consequences of light pollution...|$|R

5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, the Morgantown {{interchange}} was {{relocated to}} provide a direct connection to I-176; the overhead interchange <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> the new exit were a nuisance to nearby residents. An interchange was also proposed in 1990 with PA 743 between Elizabethtown and Hershey, but a study in 1993 determined {{that it would not}} improve traffic flow on area roads. The turnpike commission celebrated the highway's 50th anniversary in 1990. $300,000 was spent to promote the turnpike through various means including a videotape, souvenirs, and a private party attended by politicians and companies that work with the turnpike.|$|E

40|$|Studies of wild {{populations have}} {{provided}} important {{insights into the}} effects of artificial <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night on organisms, populations and ecosystems. However, in most studies the exact amount of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night individuals are exposed to remains unknown. Individuals can potentially control their nighttime light exposure by seeking dark spots within illuminated areas. This uncertainty {{makes it difficult to}} attribute effects to a direct effect of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night, or to indirect effects, e. g., via an effect of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night on food availability. In this study, we aim to quantify the nocturnal light exposure of wild birds in a previously dark forest-edge habitat, experimentally illuminated with three different colors of street lighting, in comparison to a dark control. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we deployed male great tits (Parus major) with a light logger measuring light intensity every five minutes over a 24 h period. We found that three males from pairs breeding in brightly illuminated nest boxes close to green and red lamp posts, were not exposed to more artificial <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night than males from pairs breeding further away. This suggests, based on our limited sample size, that these males could have been avoiding <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night by choosing a roosting place with a reduced light intensity. Therefore, effects of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night previously reported for this species in our experimental set-up might be indirect. In contrast to urban areas where light is omnipresent, bird species in non-urban areas may evade exposure to nocturnal artificial light, thereby avoiding direct consequences of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of low temperature (3 °C.) on development of submicroscopic structure in plastids of Zea m. leaves was studied. Leaves from 8 -day old etiolated plants, with plastids showing the prolamellar body and few lamellae, were floated for 1 day on tap water {{both in the}} dark and in the <b>light,</b> <b>at</b> 26 ° and at 3 °C. The structures remain unchanged in the dark, independent of temperature. Whereas in the <b>light</b> <b>at</b> 26 °C., normal development of parallel compound lamellae and formation of grana occurs, in <b>light</b> <b>at</b> 3 °C. ring structures are formed. Under the latter conditions protochlorophyll is converted to chlorophyll, although the in situ absorption maximum is different from the one for chlorophyll in plants grown in <b>light</b> <b>at</b> 26 °C. When leaves were transferred from <b>light</b> <b>at</b> 3 °C. to <b>light</b> <b>at</b> 26 °C., ring structures in the plastids disappeared and normal development occurred. The possibility is discussed that development of parallel-arranged compound lamellae is due both to photochemical and synthetic processes, involving not only accumulation of chlorophyll, but also synthesis of other compounds.

5|$|Speakers at {{the inquiry}} have also testified that a {{significant}} volume of city traffic regularly cut across the roof deck as a bypass of the traffic <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> the corner of Hillside Drive and Ontario Avenue, resulting in more stress on the structure {{than it had been}} designed to handle. The NORR report speculated that a heavy vehicle might have contributed to a previously undetected partial failure of the support structure a few months prior to the final collapse.|$|E

5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks at such times. The alternative to the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues. Despite being a shorter and a more direct route, those avenues are much more congested than the bypass at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> some of their junctions.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Transportation then {{planned the}} {{extension}} to Interstate 287 in Piscataway, by upgrading Hoes Lane's arterial boulevard and its 20 intersections to standards, eliminating and upgrading several traffic <b>lights.</b> <b>At</b> the intersection with Centennial Avenue, Route 18 will turn off Hoes and follow Centennial to Possumtown Road, {{where it will}} terminate at Interstate 287 exit 8. On February 15, 2012, the New Jersey Department of Transportation broke ground on the project, which is to cost $28 million and was completed in mid-2016. Although NJDOT's road inventory continues to show Route 18 as ending at Hoes Lane and Buckingham Drive in Piscataway, Route 18 signage is complete along the entire route on Hoes Lane and Centennial Ave. to the terminus at Interstate 287, {{as well as on}} signs for exit 8 of I-287.

5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and signal <b>lights</b> (<b>at</b> night). Signal lights, which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E

5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal <b>lights</b> <b>at</b> his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi.
