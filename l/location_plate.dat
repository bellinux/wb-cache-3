50|$|<b>Location</b> <b>plate</b> {{shooting}} {{took place}} in Chicago in April 2007. Several chase scenes, including one with a low flying helicopter, were shot in Chicago over two days, on Wacker Drive along the Chicago River, between Columbus Drive and LaSalle Street.The opening scene was filmed using the Carbide & Carbon Building.Production moved to the Czech Republic later in May, scheduled for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E

Most of the previous methods are based on gray images but the color information is also an important factor to locate the license plate.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this 10 year, retrospective study is to evaluate the indications {{for the removal of}} titanium miniplates following osteosynthesis in maxillofacial trauma and orthognathic surgery. All patients who had miniplates placed in a Regional Oral and Maxillofacial Department between January 1998 and October 2007 were included. The following variables were recorded: patient gender and age, number of plates inserted, indications for <b>plate</b> placement, <b>location</b> of <b>plates,</b> number and <b>location</b> of <b>plates</b> removed, indications for plate removal, time between insertion and removal, medical co-morbidities, and the follow-up period. During the 10 years of the study, 1247 titanium miniplates were placed in 535 patients. A total of 32 (3 %) plates were removed from 30 patients. Superficial infection accounted for 41 % of all plates removed. All complications were minor and most plates were removed within the first year of insertion.

30|$|In {{addition}} to patient age, we demonstrate {{a statistically significant}} correlation in post-operative delay in function {{with the number of}} <b>plates,</b> <b>location</b> of <b>plates,</b> and patients undergoing a bilateral operation. Based on the results of our study, 83.3  % of patients with four or more plates versus 31.1  % of patients with less than four plates experienced a delay in return of function. We have also demonstrated with statistical significance that the patients undergoing a bilateral operation experienced a delay in function more frequently than patients with a unilateral operation. The rates of delayed return of function for the two groups were respectively 66.7 and 25  %. Burghardt et al. [7] noted that patients with placement of femoral plates were more likely to require physical therapy for lacking knee range of motion at the first follow-up visit. We validated the findings of Burghardt et al., with 18 of 19 patients experiencing post-operative delay in function when there was the placement of at least one distal femur plate. Additionally, we illustrate a statistically significant difference between the rate of delayed return of function in patients with at least one femoral plate (45  %) compared to patients with no femoral plates (9.1  %). Despite the limitation presented by the small number of patients in the conclusion regarding number and <b>location</b> of <b>plates,</b> we are able to validate these conclusions from a prior study.|$|R
40|$|Car Plate Recognition System is {{an image}} {{processing}} system in which it locates and recognizes a car plate. This technology is still new and only few systems are available in Malaysia. The most crucial part in Car Plate Recognition System is <b>plate</b> <b>location.</b> This is because if the system fails to detect {{the location of the}} car plate, then the whole system is a failure because recognition can only be done after successful <b>plate</b> <b>location.</b> Therefore, this research is mainly focused on <b>plate</b> <b>location.</b> In short, this research is entitled Car Plate Detection System. This system will focus on 4 major parts of pre-processing phase which are Image Enhancement using median filtering, Thresholding using global threshold value, Feature Extraction using thresholding, and <b>Plate</b> <b>Location</b> using rule-based conditions. This system was developed as a prototype to fulfill the requirement and prove the correctness of the algorithms used. The data or car plates used are strictly typical Malaysian civilian car plate numbers. Image is acquired using digital camera and fed to the system which thresholds the image to convert it into the binary image. Feature extraction is performed to produce the features of the binary image. Finally, the location of the car plate is located using rule based algorithms. The conditions are set as rule and the system detects the car plate if the condition exists. The results are discussed in Chapter 4...|$|R
