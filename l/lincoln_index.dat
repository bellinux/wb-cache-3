50|$|The BMWP score {{equals the}} sum of the {{tolerance}} scores of all macroinvertebrate families in the sample. A higher BMWP score is considered to reflect a better water quality. Alternatively, also the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) score is calculated. The ASPT equals the average of the tolerance scores of all macroinvertebrate families found, and ranges from 0 to 10. The main difference between both indices is that ASPT does not depend on the family richness. Once BMWP and ASPT are calculated, the <b>Lincoln</b> Quality <b>Index</b> (LQI) is used to assess the water quality in the Anglian Water Authority area.|$|R
40|$|Macroinvertebrates {{are widely}} {{considered}} {{as indicators of}} water quality. The present research work was conducted in Bhalu khola, a tributary of Budhigandaki River, Nepal, to identify water quality using macro invertebrates with Nepalese Biotic Score (NEPBIOS), and examine its applicability by comparing with Water Quality Index (WQI). The diversity of macro invertebrates in the studied river was high as depicted by Shannon Wiener Diversity Index. Altogether, 103 macro invertebrates were identified from 11 families and five orders. There were no dominant species, {{and most of the}} species were in clumped distribution. According to NEPBIOS index, river water was found to comply with the characteristics of WQ class I-II that means water quality of the river was good. Other indices such as Hilsenhoff and <b>Lincoln</b> quality <b>index</b> (LQI) index also supported this result. Similarly, water quality index (WQI) also showed similarity with NEPBIOS index, indicating water appropriate for drinking purpose. Thus, it is concluded that the macro invertebrates can be used as economic tools for determining water quality of streams and rivers as efficient water quality indicators.

40|$|Biotic {{indices are}} {{commonly}} used in biomonitoring programs to assess the quality of surface waters. In the present study, a number of biotic indices based on benthic macroinvertebrates have been applied in assessing the water quality of a mountainous stream (Pelion, Central Greece). Samplings were done in summer and autumn 2012 in two sampling sites (Karamani, Servanates) using two sampling methods: (a) a standard pond net and (b) the Surber method. Invertebrate identification was performed to the family level. The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score, the Average Score Per Taxa (ASPT), the <b>Lincoln</b> Quality <b>Index,</b> {{as well as the}} Iberian BMWP, and the Iberian ASPT were applied to the benthic macroinvertebrate samples to assess the water quality of each site. According to ASPT, IASPT and LQI, the biological water quality of both sampling sites was very good, regardless of the season and the sampling method used, with the exceptions of the summer samplings in Servanates with both sampling methods, and in Karamani with Surber, for which a good water quality was assessed with LQI and IASPT, respectively. In contrast, the BMWP and IBMWP scores for the sampling site Servanates were low, corresponding to fair water quality, but this effect was attributed to the particular hydrological conditions of this site. The sampling method did not significantly affect the sampling efficiency and, consequently, the results of the water quality evaluation...|$|R

50|$|As {{a master}} of the sacred page (manuscripts of {{theology}} in Latin), Grosseteste trained the Franciscans in the standard curriculum of university theology. The Franciscan Roger Bacon was his most famous disciple, and acquired an interest in the scientific method from him. Grosseteste lectured on the Psalter, the Pauline epistles, Genesis (at least the creation account), and possibly on Isaiah, Daniel and Sirach. He also led disputations on such subjects as the theological nature of truth and the efficacy of the Mosaic Law. Grosseteste also preached at the university and appears to have been called to preach within the diocese as well. He collected some of those sermons, along with some short notes and reflections, not long after he left Oxford; this is now known as his Dicta. His theological writings reveal a continual interest in the natural world as a major resource for theological reflection and an ability to read Greek sources (if he ever learned Hebrew, it would be not until he became bishop of <b>Lincoln).</b> His theological <b>index</b> (tabula distinctionum) reveals the breadth of his learning and his desire to communicate it in a systematic manner. However, Grosseteste's own style was far more unstructured than many of his scholastic contemporaries, and his writings reverberate with his own personal views and outlooks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index</b> {{is merely}} an estimate. For example, the species in a given area could tend to be either very common or very rare, or tend to be either very hard or very easy to see. Then it would be likely that both {{observers}} would find {{a large share of}} the common species, and that both observers would miss a large share of the rare ones. Such distributions would throw off the consequent estimate. However, such distributions are unusual for natural phenomena, as suggested by Zipf's Law).|$|E
5000|$|The Lincoln-Petersen method (also {{known as}} the Petersen-Lincoln index or <b>Lincoln</b> <b>index)</b> {{can be used to}} {{estimate}} population size if only two visits are made to the study area. This method assumes that the study population is [...] "closed". In other words, the two visits to the study area are close enough in time so that no individuals die, are born, move into the study area (immigrate) or move out of the study area (emigrate) between visits. The model also assumes that no marks fall off animals between visits to the field site by the researcher, and that the researcher correctly records all marks.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920, Lincoln {{joined the}} U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (at the time, {{a unit of}} the United States Department of Agriculture, and now part of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service [...] ) and was given the task of {{organizing}} and expanding the bird banding program nationwide. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 had established federal responsibility for migratory birds; the result was that the North American Bird Banding Program took the place of earlier smaller-scale efforts by individuals and the short-lived American Bird Banding Association. During the period of his tenure, 1920-1946, Lincoln was highly influential: he improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He proposed a means to estimate the continent-wide population size of a bird species, using reports from hunters and counting [...] "returns" [...] (birds killed that are wearing bands); this metric became known as the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>index.</b> He developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds.|$|E
40|$|Temperate-nesting Canada geese in Arkansas {{have grown}} in {{abundance}} and range since reintroduction in the 1980 s. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission uses harvest and other methods to maintain the population at desired levels. However, continued management of temperate-nesting geese requires knowledge of the population 2 Ì† 7 s demographics and current range to help establish quantifiable management goals. To assess the need and effect of changing hunting regulations, survival and recovery rates and abundance were estimated for this population. Annual survival rates of temperate-nesting Canada geese banded and recovered in Arkansas from 2005 to 2011 were estimated using the Burnham joint live-dead recovery model in program MARK. Candidate models were created to allow survival to vary by age (adult, young), time (year), and potential hunting pressure (pre- vs. post-liberalization). The abundance of temperate-nesting Canada geese in Arkansas from 2002 - 2011 was estimated using the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index</b> and either an unadjusted <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index,</b> using a Mississippi Flyway Canada goose harvest rate, or an adjusted <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index,</b> using a regional harvest rate estimate. Target harvest rates based on the Potential Biological Removal framework were estimated {{for a range of}} recovery factors associated with different potential management strategies using model-averaged survival rates and unadjusted <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index</b> estimates. Despite recent relaxed hunting regulations, neither annual survival rates nor abundance of temperate-nesting Canada geese in Arkansas have declined. Range from 2004 - 2012 was estimated using volume contour maps from citizen science observations using eBird and hunter recovery locations from the U. S. Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory. Dispersal of temperate-nesting Canada geese banded and recovered in Arkansas was examined. Emigration, molt migration, and immigration between Arkansas and other states and provinces was examined using geese banded in Arkansas and recovered elsewhere and geese banded elsewhere and recovered in Arkansas. Emigration and immigration interactions were greatest between Arkansas and Missouri. Molt migrant interactions were greatest between Arkansas and Manitoba and Minnesota. Factors explaining molt migration/emigration were examined, and both age and sex were the best predictors. Overall, geographic analysis indicated the range of temperate-nesting Canada geese in Arkansas is expanding, but individual geese do not frequently move long distances from banding sites...|$|E

The censusing method is an adaptation of the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index</b> estimation where the capture, marking and recapture process was replaced by individual observations in "lekking areas". Since the stay of the bucks in a territory is not uniform, due to the high level of variability of the reproductive strategies, the mixing of the bucks improves the reliability of the method. The estimate of the total population was 189, the sex ratio was 1 : 1 and the yearlings/adults ratio was 1 : 2. 2...|$|E

40|$|The survival, {{absolute}} population size, gonotrophic cycle duration, {{and temporal}} and spatial abundance of Nyssomyia neivai (Pinto) were studied {{in a rural area}} endemic for American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in Conchal, Sao Paulo State, southeastern Brazil, using mark-release-recapture techniques and by monitoring population fluctuation. The monthly abundance exhibited a unimodal pattern, with forest and domicile habitats having the highest relative abundances. A total of 1, 873 males and 3, 557 females were marked and released during the six experiments, of which 4. 1 - 13. 0 % of males and 4. 1 - 11. 8 % of females were recaptured. Daily survivorship estimated from the decline in recaptures per day was 0. 681 for males and 0. 667 for females. Gonotrophic cycle duration was estimated to be 4. 0 d. Absolute population size was calculated using the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index</b> and ranged from 861 to 4, 612 males and from 2, 187 to 19, 739 females. The low proportion of females that reach the age when they are potentially infective suggests that N. neivai has a low biological capacity to serve as a vector and that factors such as high biting rates and opportunistic feeding behavior would be needed to enable Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis Vianna transmission. This agreed with the epidemiological pattern of ACL in southeastern Brazil that is characterized by low incidence, with isolated cases acquired principally within domiciliary habitats...|$|E
40|$|In 1976 an {{experimental}} research project was initiated {{to examine the}} possible effects of the removal of a giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, canopy in a central California kelp bed on Young-of-the-Year (YOY) fish populations.

Pre-canopy removal population estimates were made using the Schnabel method and post-canopy removal population estimates were made using the Petersen method (<b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index).</b> A significant (p <. 0004) reduction of fish occurred immediately after the canopy was removed and the population remained at a reduced level for at least 60 days.

Using the same statistical methods from the 1976 study, a significant reduction was found to occur in fish populations within harvested Area C and unharvested area NC: however, the reductions were not significantly different between the two areas. The large reduction in the fish population in the harvested area occurred when fish moved into the unharvested area.

40|$|Three quadrats, {{one hundred}} meters to the side, were {{located at the}} plains-foothill border region {{southwest}} of Boulder, Colorado, near Bluebell Canyon. One quadrat was in a wooded area, another in a meadow, and the third in an ecotone, half-meadow, half-wooded area. Ants were intensively collected in these quadrats for three summers, from 1965 through 1967. The summer of 1968 was utilized for soil moisture and temperature determinations, {{as well as for}} actual counts of ant colonies. A total of 25 species and subspecies was discovered. Of these 25 species, nine were species found in two quadrats, which provide evidence of a distinct boundary between the lower edge of the foothill zone and the plains, since eight of these nine were found in the ponderosa pine forest and the ecotone, but did not penetrate the meadow. The other species was found in the meadow and ecotone, but did not penetrate the ponderosa pine forest. There were two additional species in the meadow and five in the forest which did not penetrate the ecotone. The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index</b> was utilized in this study to determine its efficacy in estimation of the size of selected ant colonies. It was found to be inaccurate, since use of this index results in great underestimation of ant colony size. Individual nest stability and nest number constancy were also examined. The majority of the 25 species and subspecies are quite unstable in their nesting habits, and nest number was somewhat inconstant. Total counts of ant nests were made, and these, plus the number of nests of the various species, made it possible to determine the ecological dominants in each quadrat for each year. It was also found that there were more species of ants in this study in the wooded quadrat, which had a slope facing north by northwest, than in the ecotone or in the meadow. Observations were also made with reference to compound nests, polydoraous nests, and species which have nuptial flights in late summer...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation:	 Reticulitermes flavipes (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) colonies: {{reproductive}} lifespans, caste ratios, nesting and foraging dynamics, {{and genetic}} architecture 	 Catherine Everitt Long, Doctor of Philosophy, 2005 Dissertation Directed By:	 Professor Barbara L. Thorne Department of Entomology The eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) {{is a major}} decomposer of wood and a significant pest of lumber and paper. Despite its economic and ecological importance, key aspects of its colony dynamics are poorly understood. In 1993, laboratory colonies were initiated with alate pairs. In 2003, the colonies contained an average of 12, 600 individuals. Ninety-seven percent of kings and 72 % of primary queens survived; 29 % of colonies contained replacement female reproductives. In addition to providing unprecedented demographic information regarding colony growth rate and longevity, lifespan of founding reproductives, and the response of colonies {{to the loss of}} primary kings and queens, these complete colonies demonstrated foraging and nesting activities of socially intact families. The laboratory colonies foraged in multi-resource networks. Travel between the resource nodes was observed, and after 30 weeks all spatial networks were censused. None of the castes was distributed equally among the three resources. Reproductives, which were found in a satellite node in 71 % of colonies, and brood did not share the same node {{a significant portion of the}} time, suggesting that the nesting strategy was polydomous rather than monodomous. Mark-recapture data indicate that workers were significantly more likely to be found in the resource where they had been located previously, indicating i) they feed non-randomly among the multiple resources and ii) they feed extensively at one location rather than shuttling regularly between satellite- and central nodes (as in a central-place foraging model). Such site fidelity violates an assumption of the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index,</b> leading to significant misestimation of actual colony population totals established by census. Worker genotypes, as determined by microsatellite markers, indicate that despite the absence of obvious physical isolation, genetic differentiation had occurred among the workers in one of the queenless colonies. Inbreeding coefficients generated by the queenless colony genotypes did not differ significantly from the predicted F-statistics for colonies of similar breeding structure, confirming that sampled workers can accurately estimate the breeding regime of field populations...|$|E
40|$|Extended: The {{hypothesis}} was proposed that woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in North America had declined due to wolf predation and over-hunting {{rather than from}} a shortage of winter lichens (Bergerud, 1974). In 1974, two study areas were selected for testing: for the lichen hypothesis, we selected the Slate Islands in Lake Superior (36 km 2), a closed canopy forest without terrestrial lichens, wolves, bears, or moose; for the predation hypothesis, we selected the nearby Pukaskwa National Park (PNP) where terrestrial lichens, wolves, bears, and moose were present. Both areas were monitored from 1974 to 2003 (30 years). The living and dead caribou on the Slates were estimated by the &lsquo;King census&rsquo; strip transect (mean length 108 &plusmn; 9. 3 km, extremes 22 - 190, total 3026 km) and the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index</b> (mean tagged 45 &plusmn; 3. 6, extremes 15 - 78). The mean annual population on the Slate Islands based on the strip transects was 262 &plusmn; 22 animals (extremes 104 - 606), or 7. 3 /km 2 (29 years) and from the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Index</b> 303 &plusmn; 64 (extremes 181 - 482), or 8. 4 /km 2 (23 years). These are the highest densities in North America and have persisted at least since 1949 (56 years). Mountain maple (Acer spicatum) interacted with caribou density creating a record in its age structure which corroborates persistence at relatively high density from c. 1930. The mean percentage of calves was 14. 8 &plusmn; 0. 34 % (20 years) {{in the fall and}} 14. 1 &plusmn; 1. 95 % (19 years) in late winter. The Slate Islands herd was regulated by the density dependent abundance of summer green foods and fall physical condition rather than density independent arboreal lichen availability and snow depths. Two wolves (1 wolf/ 150 caribou) crossed to the islands in 1993 - 94 and reduced two calf cohorts (3 and 4. 9 per cent calves) while female adult survival declined from a mean of 82 % to 71 % and the population declined &asymp; 100 animals. In PNP, caribou/moose/wolf populations were estimated by aerial surveys (in some years assisted by telemetry). The caribou population estimates ranged from 31 in 1979 to 9 in 2003 (Y= 1267 - 0. 628 X, r=- 0. 783, n= 21, P&lt; 0. 01) and extirpation is forecast in 2018. Animals lived within 3 km of Lake Superior (Bergerud, 1985) with an original density of 0. 06 /km 2, similar to many other woodland herds coexisting with wolves (Bergerud, 1992), and 100 times less than the density found on the Slate Islands. The mean moose population was 0. 25 &plusmn; 0. 016 /km 2 and the wolf population averaged 8. 5 &plusmn; 0. 65 / 1000 km 2. Late winter calf percentages in PNP averaged 16. 2 &plusmn; 1. 89 (25 years); the population was gradually reduced by winter wolf predation (Bergerud, 1989; 1996). The refuge habitat available is apparently insufficient for persistence in an area where the continuous distribution of woodland caribou is fragmented due to moose exceeding 0. 10 /km 2 and thereby supporting wolf densities &ge; 6. 5 / 1000 km 2. A second experimental study was to introduce Slate Island caribou to areas with and without wolves. A release to Bowman Island, where wolves and moose were present, failed due to predation. Bowman Island is adjacent to St. Ignace Island where caribou had persisted into the late 1940 s. A second release in 1989 to the mainland in Lake Superior Provincial Park of 39 animals has persisted (&lt; 10 animals) because the animals utilize off-shore islands but numbers are also declining. A third release to Montr&eacute;al Island in 1984 doubled in numbers (up to 20 animals) until Lake Superior froze in 1994 and wolves reached the island. A fourth release was to Michipicoten Island (188 km 2) in 1982 where wolves were absent and few lichens were available. This herd increased at &lambda;= 1. 18 (8 to &plusmn; 200, 160 seen 2001) in 19 years. This was the island envisioned for the crucial test of the lichen/predation hypotheses (Bergerud, 1974 : p. 769). These studies strongly support the idea that ecosystems without predators are limited bottom&ndash;up by food and those with wolves top-down by predation; however the proposed crucial test which has been initiated on Michipicoten Island remains to be completed and there is a limited window of opportunity for unequivocal results...|$|E
