25|$|On October 9, 2009, a standby {{generator}} on Spirit of Vancouver Island {{caught fire}} {{on an early}} morning sailing out of Swartz Bay Terminal. No one was injured in the incident, but it caused major delays in the ferry system because of the already <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> for Thanksgiving weekend. Eight sailings were cancelled that day, and the ship remained out of service for the weekend.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the huge}} volume of people who {{attended}} the Nambassa 3 day festival in 1979, the organizers were unable to get an accurate census of attendees, but have given estimates of 75,000 people. Some segments of the media, including Television New Zealand who were regularly flying over the festival, were quoting estimates as high as 150,000 people. This event became a free concert, because the police, unable to control the <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> which had closed all roads in a 20 kilometer radius, officially closed the event down mid-morning of the first day.|$|E
25|$|Bourne Market Place {{is at the}} {{crossroads}} of the A15 road and the B1193. Strictly speaking, it was a staggered pair of T-junctions where the A15 was met by the A151 from Spalding to the east and the B676 from the west (the article A151 road explains) before the B676 was redesignated {{as an extension of the}} A151 to Colsterworth. The A151 was diverted from the town centre via Cherry Holt Road and a newly opened relief road in 2005. When the rapid expansion of the town was first proposed in the early 1990s, development was scheduled to the north-east of the town, and part of this would have been a north/south bypass on the A15 under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. However, the chosen site was shifted to the south-west of the town, and the proposed by-pass was lost. A <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> is generated within the town, with the result that the A15 between Bourne and Peterborough is one of the busiest roads in the county. To the west of the town, the A6121 branches from the A151 and takes traffic towards Stamford.|$|E
25|$|The Tauranga Eastern Link, {{completed}} in 2015, moved State Highway 2 away from Te Puke and removed <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> from its streets.|$|R
50|$|Arterials {{are major}} through roads that are {{expected}} to carry <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> Arterials are often divided into major and minor arterials, and rural and urban arterials.|$|R

2500|$|The {{city and}} {{municipality}} still keep {{much of its}} rural nature, lacking the heavy industry that many of its neighbors have. This requires that many residents here commute to other locations to work, such as Mexico City, Ecatepec and Tlalnepantla. The <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> that passes through the municipality via highways results in smog.|$|E
2500|$|The Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, {{opened in}} 1795 between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, {{was the first}} major American turnpike. According to Gerald Gunderson's Privatization and the 19th-Century Turnpike, [...] "In the first three decades of the 19th century, Americans built more than 10,000 miles [...] of turnpikes, mostly in New England and the Middle Atlantic states. Relative to the economy at that time, this effort {{exceeded}} the post-World War II interstate highway system." [...] Because electronics did not exist in that era, all tolls had to be collected by human cashiers at toll booths, creating high fixed costs that could only be covered by a <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> As railroads and steamboats began to compete with the turnpikes, less profitable highways started to shut down or be turned over to governments. (See [...] for a listing.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The road travels for [...] before {{reaching}} junction 9 for the A34 (E05) and the A41. The A34 dual carriageway serves Oxford {{and is a}} trunk route for Newbury, Winchester and Southampton (via the M3) {{as well as the}} rest of the South Coast— for this the reason it is part of the unsigned European route E05. The A41 dual carriageway serves Bicester and Aylesbury, and both roads meet the motorway at Wendelbury roundabout junction. This junction design is very inefficient and cannot cope with a very <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> using the junction. [...] To try to alleviate this problem, there is a temporary lane drop for the London-bound carriageway. The largest exchange of traffic is between the A34 and the M40 north, and traffic on those roads backs up and causes congestion on both roads (going north and south), as well as on the interchange itself. North of the junction, the existing A34 becomes the A3400. This means the A34 is now technically in two halves (it regains status farther up the road at J16, although signs on the motorway do not mention this). Instead, the first signs for the A34 from a motorway are on the M42 at J4, as with the A41. The road also becomes part of the E5 north of J9.|$|E
50|$|County {{roads in}} Minnesota are roads locally {{maintained}} by county highway departments in Minnesota. County roads span {{a wide variety}} of road types, varying from A-minor arterials that carry <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to an improved road.|$|R
50|$|The borough {{contains}} {{most of the}} I-76/I-476/PA-23 interchange, {{which also}} takes up {{a large portion of}} the borough's land.

50|$|Florida {{is prone}} to hurricanes, and many {{widening}} projects and proposed highway corridors {{have focused on the}} need to facilitate <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> away from the coast. At the present time, only Alligator Alley and several two-lane rural roads are able to transport the millions of people living in Collier, Lee, and Charlotte counties away from the coast.|$|R
50|$|In the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) {{system of}} Hong Kong, {{cross-platform}} interchange stations first appeared at Mong Kok and Prince Edward stations when Tsuen Wan Line was opened. The interchange is two stations long, with inverse cross-platform interchange assigned to Prince Edward and same-direction interchange to Mong Kok as <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> had been anticipated in both modes.|$|R
50|$|Using a {{dedicated}} hosting service offers {{the benefits of}} high performance, security, email stability, and control. Due to the relatively high price of dedicated hosting, it is mostly used by websites that receive a <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mutsuai-Nichidaimae Station {{was opened}} on April 1, 1929 as the Mutsuai Station (Mutsuai-eki). Commuter express {{services}} were initiated in 1962 {{to handle the}} <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> commuting towards Tokyo. The station building was reconstructed in 1995. The station received its present name on August 22, 1998.|$|E
50|$|The Expressway has {{witnessed}} {{a large number}} of auto accidents, attributed to human errors and the <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> In the first 10 years since its opening, there were 1,758 accidents with more than 400 fatalities. Sporadic instances of robbery have also been reported in the highway.|$|E

40|$|Detecting network path {{anomalies}} generally requires examining <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> data to find misbehavior. We {{observe that}} wide-area services, such as peerto-peer systems and content distribution networks, exhibit <b>large</b> traffic <b>volumes,</b> spread over <b>large</b> numbers of geographically-dispersed endpoints. This makes them ideal candidates for observing wide-area network behavior. Specifically, we can combine passive monitoring <b>of</b> wide-area <b>traffic</b> to detect anomalous network behavior, with active probes from multiple nodes to quantify and characterize {{the scope of}} these anomalies. This approach provides several advantages over other techniques: (1) we obtain more complete and finergrained views of failures since the wide-area nodes already provide geographically diverse vantage points; (2) we incur limited additional measurement cost since most active probing is initiated when passive monitoring detects oddities; and (3) we detect failures {{at a much higher}} rate than other researchers have reported since the services provide <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to sample. This paper shows how to exploit this combination <b>of</b> wide-area <b>traffic,</b> passive monitoring, and active probing, to both understand path anomalies and to provide optimization opportunities for the host service. ...|$|R
5000|$|The bridge {{comprises}} 28 spans and {{is divided}} into four sections {{by the presence of}} three shallow islets along its length. Its role serving <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> as a communications artery has been taken over by a wide modern road bridge on its seaward side, but the sixteenth-century bridge is promoted for its symbolic and historic resonances.

50|$|Most {{of the air}} {{pollution}} in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic,</b> leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air.
