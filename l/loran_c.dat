5|$|In November 1973, as {{a result}} of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 {{equipped}} No. 543 Squadron, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role. The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important GIUK gap between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan's H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In wartime, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to Buccaneers or Canberras, and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping. Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft, the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2). The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the Terrain Following Radar (and its thimble radome) and adding the <b>LORAN</b> <b>C</b> radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a gloss paint finish, with a light grey undersurface, to protect against sea spray.|$|E
500|$|Vulcan B.2s were {{eventually}} fitted with the twin-gyro free-running gyroscopic heading reference system (HRS) Mk.2, {{based upon the}} inertial platform of the Blue Steel missile, which had been integrated into the system when the missile had been carried. [...] With the HRS a navigator's heading unit (NHU) was provided which enabled the navigator plotter to adjust the aircraft heading, through the autopilot, by as little as 0.1 degrees. The B.2 (MRR) was additionally fitted with the <b>LORAN</b> <b>C</b> navigation system.|$|E
50|$|The Loder {{family from}} Harbour Grace, Newfoundland had {{established}} a fish trading business and constructed premises in the community, now restored it houses exhibits relating the history of St. Lewis. St. Lewis has been a radar site since 1954 when the Americans constructed a radar site {{as part of the}} Pinetree Radar System (DEW Line).. A <b>Loran</b> <b>C</b> station was operated by the Canadian Coast Guard at St. Lewis. In January 2010 it was announced that the <b>Loran</b> <b>C</b> signal would be terminated. The broadcasting of the <b>Loran</b> <b>C</b> signal ceased in August 2010.|$|E
50|$|The LORAN-C {{station was}} disestablished on July 1, 1992 and all Coast Guard personnel, {{electronic}} equipment, and property departed the atoll that month. Buildings on Sand Island {{were transferred to}} other activities. LORAN whip antennas on Johnston and Sand Islands were removed, and the 625-foot LORAN tower and antenna were demolished on December 3, 1992. The <b>LORAN</b> A and <b>C</b> station and buildings on Sand Island were then dismantled and removed.|$|R
5000|$|On January 25, 1957, the Department of Treasury {{was granted}} a 5-year permit for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to operate and {{maintain}} a Long Range Aid to Navigation (LORAN) transmitting station on Johnston Atoll. Two years later in December 1959. The Secretary of Defense approved the Secretary of the Treasury's request to use Sand Island for U.S. Coast Guard <b>LORAN</b> A and <b>C</b> station sites. The USCG was granted permission to install a <b>LORAN</b> A and <b>C</b> station on Sand Island to be manned by U.S. Coast Guard personnel through June 30, 1992. The permit for a LORAN station to operate on Johnston Island was terminated in 1962. On November 1, 1957, a new United States Coast Guard LORAN-A station was commissioned. By 1958 the Coast Guard LORAN Station at Sand Island began transmitting on a 24-hour basis, thus establishing a new LORAN rate in the Central Pacific. The new rate between Johnston Island and French Frigate Shoals gave a higher order of accuracy for fixing positions in the steamship lanes from Oahu, Hawaii, to Midway Island. In the past, this was impossible in some areas along this important shipping route. The U.S. Coast Guard LORAN-A Station on Sand Island ceased transmitting on June 30, 1961 when the station began transmitting from the LORAN-C station and was using a larger 625-foot antenna by 1979.|$|R

50|$|In 1964, {{after some}} delays caused by storms that ravaged the island during construction, the U.S. Coast Guard opened a LORAN-C {{navigation}} station on Marcus Island, whose mast was until 1985 {{one of the}} tallest structures in the Pacific area. Before replacing Loran A for general marine navigation, <b>Loran</b> <b>C</b> was used by submarine launched Polaris missile systems and the existence and location of <b>Loran</b> <b>C</b> stations was classified. LORANSTA Marcus Island was billeted for 23 U.S. Coast Guard personnel. The commissioning commanding officer was U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander Louis. C. Snell. A detachment of SEABEES remained on the island for several months making repairs to the island's air strip.|$|E

50|$|Decca, OMEGA, and LORAN-C {{are three}} similar {{hyperbolic}} navigation systems. Decca was a hyperbolic low frequency {{radio navigation system}} (also known as multilateration) that was first deployed during World War II when the Allied forces needed a system {{which could be used}} to achieve accurate landings. As was the case with <b>Loran</b> <b>C,</b> its primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of moving-map displays.

Decca had previously sued the US government for alleged patent infringements over the <b>LORAN</b> <b>C</b> system in 1967. Decca won its case, but as the navigation system was judged to be a military one, no damages were paid by the US.|$|E
50|$|In 1785, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck {{published}} {{a description of}} a second species of Cannabis, which he named Cannabis indica. Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. Richard Evans Schultes described C. indica as relatively short, conical, and densely branched, whereas C. sativa was described as tall and laxly branched. <b>Loran</b> <b>C.</b> Anderson described C. indica plants as having short, broad leaflets whereas those of C. sativa were characterized as relatively long and narrow. Cannabis indica plants conforming to Schultes's and Anderson's descriptions may have originated from the Hindu Kush mountain range. Because of the often harsh and variable (extremely cold winters, and warm summers) climate of those parts, C. indica is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates.|$|E
5000|$|The CSY Bottomliner was an {{excellent}} fishing platform for the grouper snapper fishery, it would fish in much heavier seas and at much greater depths than the standard vessels of the time. It was rigged with six large commercial bottom fishing reels called [...] "bandits", {{for use in the}} Grouper/Snapper fishery. The vessels had all the very latest electronics of the time dual marine FM radios plus a single side band radio for long distance over the horizon communication. It also had multiple fish finding equipment, a whiteline recorder plus a color video recorder. The Bottomliner also had the latest in navigation with <b>LORAN</b> <b>C</b> which would allow getting back to productive spots within about 100'. The boats were also equipped with radar as an aid to navigation.|$|E
5000|$|Figure 3c is {{an example}} of a continuous, {{narrow-band}} waveform from the emitter. The cross correlation function shows an important factor when choosing the receiver geometry. There is a peak at Time = 5 plus every increment of the waveform period. To get one solution for the measured time difference, the largest space between any two receivers must be closer than one wavelength of the emitter signal. Some systems, such as the <b>LORAN</b> <b>C</b> and Decca mentioned at earlier (recall the same math works for moving receiver & multiple known transmitters), use spacing larger than 1 wavelength and include equipment, such as a Phase Detector, to count the number of cycles that pass by as the emitter moves.

50|$|If the {{receiver}} was also moving {{relative to the}} earth, such as aboard a ship or airplane, this would cause mismatches with the idealized Doppler curves, and degrade position accuracy. However, positional accuracy could usually be computed to within 100 meters for a slow-moving ship, even with reception of just one two-minute Doppler curve. This was the navigation criterion demanded by the U.S. Navy, since American submarines would normally expose their UHF antenna for only 2 minutes to obtain a usable Transit fix. The U.S. submarine version of the Transit system also included a special encrypted, more accurate version of the downloaded satellite's orbital data This enhanced data allowed for considerably enhanced system accuracy unlike Selective Availability. Using this enhanced mode, accuracy was typically less than 20 meters, i.e. the accuracy was between that of <b>LORAN</b> <b>C</b> and GPS. Certainly, Transit was the most accurate navigation system of its day.|$|E

40|$|Generally speaking, {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to evaluate the accuracy of measurement of a ship's position by means of navigational receivers, while the ship is cruising at sea, because we can not know the "true position" of the ship. We recorded continuously the position of the T. S. Kakuyo Maru by the <b>Loran</b> <b>C,</b> 9970 chain and by radar at the same time when the ship voyaged through the Japan Sea in August, 1981 and compared with the data of two positions of the ship in order to evaluate the accuracy of the <b>Loran</b> <b>C</b> System, 9970 chain. The mean distances from the position decided by radar to that by the <b>Loran</b> <b>C</b> system were about 0. 4 nautical miles toward the south west in the sea off the north west of Kyushu, about 0. 1 nautical mile toward the north west in the sea off Yamaguchi Prefecture to Okinosima, and about 0. 1 nautical mile toward the north east in the sea off Noto Hanto. Standard deviation of the distance was 0. 3 - 0. 4 nautical miles in each area. There was a slip in the reading of time difference in 90 % of cases north of 38 Â°N, but the mean distance and standard deviation between two positions of the ship were about the same value as in the area south of 38 Â°N after correction of the slip. The difference between two positions by processer and by the <b>Loran</b> <b>C</b> table varied in each area, but the mean value of distance and standard deviation were 0. 1 Â± 0. 2 nautical miles. ï»¿æ¥æ¬æµ·ã®æ²¿å²¸æµ·åã«ããã 9970 ãã§ã¼ã³ã®èªèµ°ä¸­ã«ãããç²¾åº¦ã«ã¤ãã¦,ã¬ã¼ãã«ããæ¸¬å®ä½ç½®ã¨ã®æ¯è¼ã«ããè©ä¾¡ãè¡ã£ã. ãã®çµæ,ä¹å·åè¥¿é¨ã§ã¯ 9970 ãã§ã¼ã³ã«ããä½ç½®ã¯è¥¿åã,å±±é°æ²ãå¢ã¨ãã¦åæ±é¨ã¸ç§»ãã«ã¤ãã¦æ±åããå¾åããã. å¹³ååä½è·é¢ã¯,æµ·åã«ãã£ã¦å·®ããããã®ã® 0.

Future system activities discussed include analysis of alternative system configurations made up of system elements including VORTAC VOR-DME, OMEGA and differential OMEGA, <b>LORAN</b> <b>C,</b> and GPS. The interrelationships between the near and far term programs are discussed. A helicopter IFR program which includes an assessment of the operational suitability of several navigation system alternatives for meeting helicopter navigation requirements for CONUS and offshore operations is reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrated}} avionics reliability task is {{an effort}} to build credible reliability and/or performability models for multisensor integrated navigation and flight control. The research was initiated by the reliability analysis of a multisensor navigation system consisting of the Global Positioning System (GPS), the Long Range Navigation system (<b>Loran</b> <b>C),</b> and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Markov reliability models were developed based on system failure rates and mission time...|$|E
