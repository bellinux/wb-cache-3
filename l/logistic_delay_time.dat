40|$|The {{availability}} of weapon {{systems such as}} fighter aircraft, battle tanks and warships during high intensity conflicts becomes low. In this paper the {{availability of}} fighter aircraft with five major subsystems (structures, engine, avionics, electrical and environmental) are considered. This depends mainly on attrition factors (failure due to unreliability and failure due to battle damage) and logistic delays, which affect repair process. We develop a simulation model considering the fighter aircraft as the weapon system for arriving at transient solutions for availability with logistic delays. The methodology is based on discrete event simulation using Monte Carlo techniques. The failure time distribution (Weibull) for different subsystems, repair time distribution (exponential) and <b>logistic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> distribution (lognormal) were chosen with suitable parameters. The results indicate the pronounced decrease in availability (to as low as 20 % in some cases) due to logistic delays.

Knowing that the human being {{is one of the}} most expensive and demanding resources, efficient personnel employing becomes significant. Simulation techniques can help accomplish effective staff assignments. The aim of this thesis is to create a simulation tool by using a prototypical model of the computer system specialist non-commissioned officers' jobs on a Turkish Air Force Base, and to identify the effective factors on computer specialist shortage problem. This aim is accomplished by using event graph and discrete event simulation techniques for modeling purposes, and Simkit and Viskit for implementing the created model into simulation code. After evaluating the simulation results from an experiment involving fifteen input factors, it was concluded that the staff shortage problem can be addressed by using this study after updating the parameters used in the model to reflect the most recent distributions. On the other hand, increasing the number of personnel is not the only solution for addressing the problem. There are some other ways suggested by the study to improve the measure of effectiveness values, such as increasing the number of cars that are assigned to repair personnel, reducing <b>logistic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times,</b> or increasing the inter-arrival times for computer and network failures. There are different setups or combinations of the factors that are capable of solving the staff shortage problem, and the most cost effective one can be decided after doing a trade-off analysis.

40|$|Aquaculture within {{offshore}} wind farms {{has been identified}} as one of the many possibilities of smart use of marine space, leading to opportunities for innovative entrepreneurship. Offshore areas potentially pose less conflict with co-users than onshore. At the same time, offshore areas and offshore constructions are prone to high technical risks through mechanical force, corrosion, and biofouling. The expected lifetime of an offshore structure is to a great extent determined by the risk of failures. This chapter elaborates on logistical challenges that the offshore industry faces. Operation and maintenance (O&M) activities typically represent {{a big part of the}} total costs (e. g. 25 – 30 % of the total lifecycle costs for {{offshore wind}} farms). The offshore wind energy sector is considered an industry with promising features for the public and private sector. Large wind farms farther off the coast pose high expectations because of higher average wind speeds and hence greater wind energy yield (in terms of megawatts per capital). These conditions entail additional challenges in logistics, though. One of the main hurdles that hinders use of offshore wind energy is the high cost for O&M. The offshore wind industry will have to solve these problems in order to achieve substantial cost reduction - alone or jointly with other (potential) users. It is precisely the logistical problems around O&M where most likely synergy benefits of multi-use platforms (MUPs) can be achieved. The offshore wind energy industry is eagerly looking for technical innovations. Until now they mostly sought the solutions in their own circles. If the combination of offshore wind energy and offshore aquaculture proves to be feasible and profitable in practice, there may be an additional possibility to reduce the O&M costs by synergy effects of the combined operations. Logistic waiting times, for example, can result in substantial revenue losses, whereas timely spare-parts supply or sufficient repair capacity (technicians) to shorten the <b>logistic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> are beneficial. A recent study suggests that a cost reduction of 10 % is feasible, if the offshore wind and offshore aquaculture sectors are combined in order to coordinate and share O&M together. The presented asset management control model proves useful in testing the innovative, interdisciplinary multi-use concepts, simulating return rates under different assumptions, thus making the approach more concrete and robust...|$|R
40|$|During air-attack {{operations}}, i. e., air-to-air and land-air {{operations in}} battles, maintaining {{a high level}} of availability of weapon systems (aircraft and weapons) becomes important {{from the point of view}} of winning the battle. Availability may depend on severity of combat operations, attrition factors (battle damage failures and reliability related failures), and logistic delays in weapons deployment and in the repair process. In this paper, a simulation model is developed for availability of weapon systems considering air-to-air and land-air combat operations, multiple failures causing aircraft failure and logistic delays in weapons deployment, and in the repair process. The availability of aircraft and the availability of weapons are separately derived from simulation and the product of them is denoted as combined availability for analysis. The results are analyzed in terms of fluctuations in availability on specified days of battle such as 1, 7, 14, and 21 days from the graphical output. The simulation procedure employs discrete event simulation technique using Monte Carlo methods. The time to failure distribution and the time to repair distribution for the major subsystems of the aircraft and helicopters is considered to be Weibull and exponential respectively. The <b>logistic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> distribution for weapons replenishment and for logistic factors, spares, crew, and equipment, is considered to be lognormal. Assuming a certain range of values for air-attack missions and for the number of sorties to be generated and a set of reliability and maintainability parameters for the considered major subsystems of the aircraft, the simulation for availability is analyzed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reducing {{treatment}} delay improves {{outcomes in}} breast cancer. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine factors influencing patient- and system-related delays in commencing breast cancer treatment in different countries. METHODS: A total of 6588 female breast cancer patients from 12 countries were surveyed. Total <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was determined as the sum of the patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (time between onset of the first symptoms and the first medical visit) and system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (time between the first medical visit and the start of therapy). RESULTS: The average patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> and total <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> were 4. 7 (range: 3. 4 - 6. 2) weeks and 14. 4 (range: 11. 5 - 29. 4) weeks, respectively. Longer patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were associated with distrust and disregard, and shorter patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were associated with fear of breast cancer, practicing self-examination, higher education level, being employed, having support from friends and family and living in big cities. The average system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was 11. 1 (range: 8. 3 - 24. 7) weeks. Cancer diagnosis made by an oncologist versus another physician, higher education level, older age, family history of female cancers and having a breast lump as the first cancer sign were associated with shorter system-related <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> Longer patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> and higher levels of distrust and disregard were predictors of longer system-related <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The <b>delay</b> in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer remains a serious problem.

The size, shape and location of these stable and unstable regions depend on the system parameters and the feedback control gains. For systems with multiple stable regions, the boundaries between the stable and unstable regions in the plane of the <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> pair are explicitly obtained. The <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pairs that forms these boundaries are called the critical <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pairs at which the steady-state response becomes unbounded.

To increase the database of auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> for methane-based fuel mixtures characteristic of natural gas, experiments to measure auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> have been performed for a variety of gaseous fuels in an atmospheric flow reactor. Autoignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were measured for pure fuels in air including methane, ethylene, ethane, and propane. The effect of higher hydrocarbon addition on methane-based fuel ignition delay was then investigated for fuel mixtures composed of methane/ethylene, methane/ethane, and methane/propane where methane composition varied from 25 - 95 % by volume. Autoignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were also measured for multi-component methane-based fuels composed of methane/ethane/propane and air. Finally the effect of CO 2 addition on methane autoignition was investigated.

The most dramatic decrease (30 - 60 %) in auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of binary methane-based fuels occurred with the addition of the first 5 - 10 % of a higher hydrocarbon.
