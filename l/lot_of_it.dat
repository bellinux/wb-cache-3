In an interview with The Daily Telegraph he suggests that although relations between the actors were generally cordial [...] "There was bad feeling between the writers and the performers—the writers felt we were unilaterally altering the script and altering it for the worse. At {{end of the first}} day of rehearsals the writers would go away {{and by the time they}} came back we would have changed an awful <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> By the end, they felt we had run away with it.

Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years.

Ramsbottom added, [...] "Tom {{took a lot of}} chances. He took a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> [...] I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event.

[...] Commenting on the legality under international law, University of Michigan Law Professor Steven Ratner said, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> depends on whether you believe Osama bin Laden is a combatant in a war or a suspect in a mass murder."

500|$|Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson {{spent the}} summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to {{complete}} the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, {{or whatever you want}} to call it, that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he could do a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> on his own.

500|$|Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, {{his debut}} album Infinite, which was {{recorded}} at the Bassmint, {{a recording studio}} owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. [...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{was because of the}} feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, {{what the fuck are you}} rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off." [...] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.|$|E

Drummer Art Jenkins admitted that Sun Ra's [...] "nonsense" [...] sometimes troubled his thoughts for days until inspiring {{a sort of}} paradigm shift, or profound change in outlook. Drummer Andrew Cyrille said Sun Ra's comments were [...] "very interesting stuff... whether you believed it or not.

500|$|Some critics {{felt that}} the album's {{production}} was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst. KutMasta Kurt, a frequent collaborator with Thornton, disliked the album's production, stating [...] "The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister, but they turned the album into this dancey electro-pop. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had this Euro-dance feel, and I was like, 'Wait a second, {{not only did they}} change the music, they changed it into something [...] I couldn't relate.'" [...] KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap. They cooked up some electronic stuff, you know, WORD! WORD! WORD! making me sound like triple people. It's interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Chamber pop {{was part}} of a larger trend which {{involved}} musicians who rejected traditional rock conventions, such as Tortoise and Stereolab, although those specific bands are not considered ork-pop. [...] The genre's orchestration is typically more complex than rock music, making extensive use of brass and strings. It drew from the 1990s lounge music revival but avoided any influence from other contemporary styles like grunge, electronica, or alternative music, particularly the lo-fi hiss and distortion of the last. Although modern rock groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis, and R.E.M. occasionally used strings, their approach was considerably less intricate. The High Llamas were one of the first to anticipate the easy-listening fad with their 1993 debut album Gideon Gaye. O'Hagan felt that [...] "There is this whole misconception that American college rock with twisted baseball hats and checked shirts is adventurous, but it's the most conformist, corporate thing out there.... All these bands sound like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It's a shame that it couldn't be discovered from the get-go for what it is. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is just very simple dumb-guy rock." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of her fashion and style {{has been extensively}} written about by both designers and fashion stylists and has generally proved favorable. American designer Marc Jacobs wrote of Sevigny in 2001: [...] "The fashion world is fascinated by her. Because not only is she talented, young and attractive, she stands out {{in a sea of}} often clichéd looking actresses." [...] In terms of her own personal style, Sevigny cited the Australian film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing, as a major inspiration; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films. She has also been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces: [...] "I still prefer to buy vintage over spending it all on one designer", she told The Times. [...] "I'll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like, 'Oh, I'm going to buy everything,' but a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is extremely expensive, so I'll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it's not too hard on the pocketbook.

500|$|All of Ecstasys seven {{tracks were}} written and {{composed}} by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—"The Things I Miss", [...] "Clair" [...] and [...] "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me". Regarding the lyrical {{content of the}} album {{in contrast to the}} music, Shields said that [...] "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere". Ó Cíosóig remarked that [...] "it's more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship" [...] and referred to the lyrics as being marked by [...] "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as [...] "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour" [...] and considered the songwriting process for Ecstasy as [...] "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".|$|E
500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I saw a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> happening and I didn't {{know what to make}} of it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

[...] When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, [...] "A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well." [...] In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had [...] "eight tracks" [...] ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress. It remains unclear who has been involved in the recordings besides Avory and Ray Davies.|$|E
