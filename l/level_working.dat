Additional feedback from the focus groups, subsequently validated by a senior <b>level</b> <b>working</b> group, resulted in the preliminary design of a more professional looking two-piece utility shipboard uniform that can be worn both at sea and operational support jobs ashore.

The first mention of Dudley's status as a borough dates from the mid-13th century, when Roger de Somery, then Baron of Dudley, approved of the establishment of a market in nearby Wolverhampton. An inquisition after his death further established the value and importance of the borough, with mentions to the town's growing coal industry.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1990 United States Census, Texas was {{entitled}} to three additional congressional districts. In a called session in 1991, the Texas Legislature decided to draw one new Hispanic-majority district in South Texas (District 28), one new African-American majority district in Dallas County (District 30), and one new Hispanic-majority district in the Houston area (District 29). In addition, the Legislature decided to reconfigure an existing minority-majority district in the Houston area (District 18) to increase its percentage of African-Americans. The Texas Legislature had developed a state-of-the-art computer system, RedApl, that allowed it to draw congressional districts using racial data at the census block <b>level.</b> <b>Working</b> closely with the Texas congressional delegation and various members of the Legislature who intended to run for Congress, the Texas Legislature took great care to draw three new districts and reconfigure districts that the chosen candidates could win.|$|E

There {{are a number}} of state {{organizations}} which were created mostly in the 1950s specifically for directly promoting and funding R, such as the National Research Council (CNPq), which is now named Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico and the National Agency for Financing Studies and Researches (FINEP), both a part of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT). MCT is a relatively novel ministry, having been created in 1990. Before this, CNPq was the only research granting institution at federal <b>level,</b> <b>working</b> directly under the Presidency of Republic. At state level, almost all states have founded their own public foundations for support of R, following the pioneering (and highly successful) example of São Paulo state, which created the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) in 1962. Usually these foundations are guaranteed by changes in the state constitutions, along the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
500|$|At the {{neighborhood}} level, Hull House established the city’s first public playground, bathhouse, and public gymnasium (in 1893), pursued educational and political reform, and investigated housing, working, and sanitation issues. The playground opened on May Day in 1893, located on Polk Street. Families dressed in party attire {{and came to}} join the celebration that day. Addams became {{the founder of the}} National Playground Association and advocated for playgrounds nationwide. She had studied child behavior and painfully concluded that “children robbed of childhood were likely to become dull, sullen men and women working mindless jobs, or criminals for whom the adventure of crime became the only way {{to break out of the}} bleakness of their lives” [...] Also, one volunteer, Jenny Dow, started a kindergarten class for children left at the settlement while their mothers worked in the sweatshops. Within three weeks, Dow had 24 registered kindergartners and 70 on a waiting list. At the municipal level, their pursuit of legal reforms led to the first juvenile court in the United States, and their work influenced urban planning and the transition to a branch library system. [...] At the state level Hull House influenced legislation on child labor laws, occupational safety and health provisions, compulsory education, immigrant rights, and pension laws. These experiences translated to success at the federal <b>level,</b> <b>working</b> with the settlement house network to champion national child labor laws, women’s suffrage, a children’s bureau, unemployment compensation, workers' compensation, and other elements of the Progressive agenda during the first two decades of the twentieth century.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} called The Return of the King [...] "bigger and better" [...] than The Two Towers. [...] "In The Two Towers {{the player}} would occasionally run into 10 or 15 enemies," [...] said lead game designer Chris Tremmel, [...] "in The Return of the King there are {{areas where the}} player faces up to 40 orcs [...] Fans familiar with The Two Towers will find that the combat experience in The Return of the King feels familiar but much deeper." [...] Before creating levels, the developers would initially look at the script and determine what parts from the film to highlight in that particular level, and how to structure that event as a mission. They would then write in-depth level designs out on paper, going into details such as combat setup, special props and enemy types, all the while using the film as their main reference point. They would then create an animatic of the <b>level,</b> <b>working</b> out problems and fine-tuning design concepts. The levels would then be created in the game environment. The game is also graphically improved over The Two Towers. According to Neil Young, [...] "we've developed some new lighting techniques to allow the characters to look richer. We are pushing 2x the number of polys & 2x the texture density [...] we also stream our geometry and textures from the disc so the game has a much higher density of imagery." [...] Enemy AI was improved, and developers also {{spent a lot of}} time working on the sound of the game, which was THX certified.|$|E

Armitage then flew to London, where he joined a high <b>level</b> <b>working</b> party which drafted a despatch, often known as the Armitage Report, to counter the Devlin Report. In the Commons debate on the report, the government noted that the Commission had found the declaration of a State of Emergency justified, but it attacked {{their use of the}} expression [...] "police state" [...] and its rejection of talk about killings and beatings of Europeans as no more than rhetoric. The government also minimised Devlin's criticisms of handcuffing and gagging prisoners, burning houses and other illegal acts on ilt grounds if necessity. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the government had the right and a duty to reject the Commission's findings where it disagreed with them, and used this argument to justify accepting what little in its report was favourable and rejecting all that was unfavourable, instead of rejecting the whole report.|$|E
2500|$|The Liaison Detachment {{consisted}} of Vietnamese-speaking Australian officers {{trained at the}} RAAF School of Languages in Point Cook, Victoria.

Apart from watching for opportunities for civic action projects, LOs would also deliver mail from Viet Cog prisoners of war incarcerated around the country to their families in Phuoc Tuy Province, and collect mail and gifts from the families for the prisoners to be delivered to them. LOs gave Vietnamese language presentations to former Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army who defected to the south under the Chieu Hoi (Open Arms) program, and disbursed compensation payments to local Vietnamese families when required. On occasions, when visitors to the province required an Australian interpreter, LOs were often tasked. For example, politicians and journalists visiting from Australia often preferred to use Australians as guides and interpreters.|$|E
