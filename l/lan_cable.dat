Foreman, the lead spacewalker wore a suit with solid red stripes while Satcher wore an all-white spacesuit. Inside the space station Atlantis Mission Specialist Randolph Bresnik choreographed the activities and coordinated communications between the spacewalkers and Mission Control. Since Foreman and Satcher completed their chores nearly two hours ahead of schedule, planners decided to add a [...] "get ahead" [...] task; Satcher to lubricate the Kibo robotic arm snares while Foreman to route a <b>LAN</b> <b>cable</b> on Zarya and mate power cables on a patch panel at the S0 truss. Towards the end of EVA 1, while deploying the Payload Attach System (PAS) on the Earth-facing side of the Starboard 3 truss, the crew had difficulty loosening a bolt and removing a diagonal brace on the PAS. After hammering on a bolt and wiggling the brace, they successfully deployed the PAS and reinstalled the brace. The spacewalk marked: 228th spacewalk conducted by U.S. astronauts, the 134th in support of space station assembly and maintenance, 106th spacewalk out of the space station, the fourth for Foreman and the first for Satcher.|$|E

50|$|Net3 was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} means to substitute <b>LAN</b> <b>cabling</b> in problematic buildings, which are especially numerous in the historic centres of Italian cities. In practice this was not a fast-growing or eager market, and the product eventually instead found success when integrated with rugged portable computers on forklift trucks in large warehouses and stockyards.

40|$|Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) {{architecture}} {{is the only}} viable solution to handle the complex interference scenario generated by massive antennas and small cells deployment as required by next generation (5 G) mobile networks. In conventional C-RAN, the fronthaul links used to exchange the signal between Base Band Units (BBUs) and Remote Antenna Units (RAUs) are based on digital baseband (BB) signals over optical fibers due to the huge bandwidth required. In this paper we evaluate the transport capability of copper-based all-analog fronthaul architecture called Radio over Copper (RoC) that leverages on the pre-existing <b>LAN</b> <b>cables</b> that are already deployed in buildings and enterprises. In particular, the main contribution of the paper is to evaluate the number of independent BB signals for multiple antennas system that can be transported over multi-pair Cat- 5 / 6 / 7 cables under a predefined fronthauling transparency condition in terms of maximum BB signal degradation. The MIMO-RoC proves to be a complementary solution to optical fiber for the last 200 m toward the RAUs, mostly to reuse the existing <b>LAN</b> <b>cables</b> and to power-supply the RAUs over the same cable...|$|R

The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., routers, bridges and application layer gateways) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, subnets, map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings {{is to make a}} set of <b>LAN</b> <b>cables</b> in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [...] virtual LAN (VLAN) technology.|$|R

It uses the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) standard to transfer synchronization, radio signals, and {{operation and management}} signals to the IRU. The IRU is a newly designed radio unit that incorporates existing macro software features (e.g., interference coordination, traffic management, and LTE combined cell), extending them with new indoor features (e.g., real-time traffic steering). The IRU connects to each Radio Dot using a proprietary IRU-Radio Dot interface over a conventional twisted pair local area network (<b>LAN)</b> <b>cable.</b> When co-located with the DU, an electrical CPRI interface is used, whereas a CPRI fiber interface is used for remote connection with the DU. Finally, the Radio Dot has two integrated antennas in a 10 -cm form factor and weighs under 300 g. Each Radio Dot {{is connected to the}} IRU through a dedicated <b>LAN</b> <b>cable</b> and remotely powered by Power over Ethernet (PoE). As in ethernet networks, the system employs a star topology, as opposed to the tree topology used in DAS. The ultra-compact design and use of LAN cabling simplify installation.|$|E

40|$|Active {{monitoring}} of TCP connections {{aids in the}} study of the stability of such connections over a given setup. With the advent of access technologies aiming to provide solutions to the last mile problem, there needs to be a method by which an ISP can study TCP connections over such equipment. TCP in itself has been designed to be stable and has been proven to be stable over many access technologies. But in many cases, the connections are not stable enough from a customer’s perspective. Our effort has been to develop a TCP connection monitoring methodology that the ISP can study the rate at which connections are lost. We develop a connection monitoring tool (ConMon) that measures round trip time and throughput apart from detecting connections drops. The path to the end point is also traced in order to study reasons for possible connection drops. We test this tool over wired <b>LAN,</b> <b>cable</b> modem and broadband wireless technologies. 1...|$|E
40|$|Powerline {{communication}} (PLC) {{has seen}} notable demand {{due to its}} efficiency and {{the wide range of}} applications. It is a system for carrying data on a conductor that is also used for electric power transmission. In this thesis, this technique is used to implement a web server using the FPGA development board (DE 2). The information is sent through Ethernet over powerline. Using DE 2 Altera kit, a webserver is created. The implementation of web server is done by first instantiating a Nios II system on the board. Nios II system is built around the Altera’s Nios II processor using the SOPC builder tool of the quartus II CAD tool. The SOPC builder tool generates the VHDL code of the defined system. The developed code is, then, configured in the FPGA board to instantiate the system. After implementing the Nios II system, an application program is run in the system to implement the web server. Ethernet packets are sent through the <b>LAN</b> <b>cable</b> over powerline. The output is taken from the Ethernet port and the fed into the Homeplug adapter. The packets are captured using wireshark packet sniffer and detailed analysis is done. This idea can be used for transmitting Ethernet packets over powerline using Homplug adapters...|$|E
30|$|Flows are probed by constant-temperature (CT) hot-wire {{anemometer}} (HWA) with a cross-wire design to measure streamwise u and vertical w velocity components (Fig.  1 d). The sensing {{element of the}} probe consists {{of a pair of}} 5 -μm (diameter) platinum-plated tungsten wires. By copper electroplating, the active length of the sensing element is 2  mm. The included angle between the two wires is 100 ° that helps reduce the error due to inadequate yaw response in elevated turbulence intensity (Cheng and Castro 2002). The CT HWA probe is positioned by a mechanical traversing system which is controlled by the National Instruments (NI) motion control unit (spatial resolution of 1  mm). The analog CT HWA signal is digitalized by a 24 -bit NI data acquisition module (NI 9239; offset error[*]±[*] 0.05 % for analog input[*]±[*] 10.52  V) mounted in a NI CompactDAQ classis (NI cDAQ- 9188). The NI units are connected to a digital computer via a local area network (<b>LAN)</b> <b>cable</b> and the data sampling is managed by LabVIEW software. The sampling frequency is 2  kHz and the sample size at each point is equal to 217 that are sufficient for repeatability of mean and fluctuating signals. The CT HWA calibration is based on the universal calibration law of the Institute of Sound and Vibration (ISVR; Bruun 1971). Its readings are also compared with those of the pitot tube installed upstream during the experiments.|$|E

The cabling used for data networking {{is similar to the}} phone cabling as it is twisted pair but of a much higher quality. The cable is known as Category (Cat) 5 or Cat 6. The cabling must be installed as a star wired configuration, that is the cabling runs from the point next to the modem, hub, or router uninterrupted up to the outlet next to the device that needs to be connected. Computer network wiring cannot be chained from one outlet to the next; each outlet is wired individually back to the hub or router next to the modem. If only one computer is required,it can be directly plugged into the modem. An alternative to a wired LAN especially useful for mobile devices is a wireless LAN, which can reduce or eliminate all the fixed wiring.|$|R
