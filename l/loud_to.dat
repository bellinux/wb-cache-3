Berry is portrayed as receiving Kelly's now famous Jerilderie Letter and reading it out <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> the officers {{in charge of the}} hunt. (Though in reality, Berry was never sent the letter, nor was it ever intended to be sent to him.) Berry was played by Australian actor, Charles Tingwell.|$|E
25|$|From about 1000Hz, {{the dynamic}} {{range of the}} {{auditory}} system decreases with decreasing frequency. This compression is observable in the equal-loudness-level contours, and it implies that even {{a slight increase in}} level can change the perceived loudness from barely audible to loud. Combined with the natural spread in thresholds within a population, its effect may be that a very low-frequency sound which is inaudible to some people may be <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> others.|$|E

Lagun Ein was {{to lead a}} team that would ambush Minkhaung along the route near the Ava camp that the Ava king was known to frequent. Razadarit also sent along Minkhaung's younger brother Theiddat, who had defected to Pegu, to identify Minkhaung. However, when they met the Ava king and his retinue, Theiddat shouted out <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> warn his elder brother. The assassination attempt failed. Razadarit ordered the execution of Theiddat.|$|E

500|$|What was {{happening}} in the Hole took place out of view of the other staff members at Gold Base, but it was clear {{that it would not be}} a good thing to be sent there. According to Lawrence Wright, [...] "the entire base became paralyzed with anxiety about being thrown into the Hole. People were desperately trying to police their thoughts, but it was difficult to keep secrets when staff members were constantly being security-checked with E-Meters." [...] Wright reports that David Miscavige's statements were transcribed for the executives in the Hole, who would then have to repeatedly read them out <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E

They also commented that the rule is too complicated, unnecessarily prescriptive, and it will cost more than necessary. Some automakers also said {{there is no need for}} electric-drive vehicles to play sounds while not in motion, [...] "since it is not clear that it helps pedestrians to hear cars that are stopped in traffic or parked." [...] In addition, the carmakers requested the NHTSA to make the new sound system required by 2018 instead of 2014.|$|E

[...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic chose [...] "Skin" [...] {{as one of the}} highlights on Loud, writing, [...] "One song that sounds nothing like anything else in Rihanna's past is 'Skin,' a contender for anti-gravity slow jam of 2010 [...] a match for Trey Songz's 'Red Lipstick' and Usher's 'Mars vs Venus. USA Todays Steve Jones also put the song in his list of tracks from <b>Loud</b> <b>to</b> consider downloading. Jerry Shriver of the same publication found [...] "down-and-dirty-ness" [...] in the chorus of the song. James Skinner of BBC Online said that the line [...] "I like it rough" [...] was a little [...] "uncomfortable in the light of her personal history". Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times commented on Rihanna's sex appeal in the song, writing [...] "the art of her seduction is oh-so slow and merciless".|$|E

[...] Patrick and Sandy {{get into a}} fight when Patrick kicks Sandy and, as a result, Sandy sticks him up a trombone. On the second day, while practicing a march, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin the flags too fast (because Squidward scolded them to spin the flags faster), causing them to fly {{into the air and}} crash into a blimp. On day three, Plankton plays his harmonica, but becomes exhausted and collapses from running back and forth, since the harmonica is bigger than he is. On the last day of practice, Squidward says if everyone plays loud, they will be good. However, they play poorly, and Squidward changes the plan of playing <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> quiet. A fish becomes annoyed, saying [...] "Well maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty, claws!" [...] Mr. Krabs is angered by him and attacks, causing everyone to get involved in a huge brawl, smashing the instruments and hurting each other, causing the band to break up. A grieving Squidward expresses his disappointment in all of them and goes home in distress over his failure.|$|E
500|$|The {{electric}} guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification {{has historically been}} the key element in heavy metal. The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion. For classic metal guitar tone, guitarists keep the [...] "...gain at moderate levels", without going [...] "...overboard on the preamp or pedal distortion", to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> produce the characteristic [...] "punch and grind". Thrash guitar tone has [...] "scooped mid" [...] and [...] "tightly compressed" [...] sound with lots of bass frequencies.Guitar solos are [...] "an essential element of the heavy metal code... that underscores {{the significance of the}} guitar" [...] to the genre. Most heavy metal songs [...] "feature at least one guitar solo", which is [...] "a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity". One exception is nu metal bands, which tend to omit guitar solos. With rhythm guitar parts, the [...] "heavy crunch sound in heavy metal... palm muting" [...] the strings with the picking hand and using distortion. Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.|$|E

Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic felt that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] had similarities to [...] "The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot" [...] by Brand New. Freeman stated that on Paramore's All We Know Is Falling, [...] "My Heart" [...] was a [...] "blunt and obvious song" [...] that focused on a [...] "climax to be emotional", but with [...] "The Only Exception", Paramore have [...] "figured out that it doesn't have to finish <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> incite a reaction in the listener". He also noted that the song shows that Williams' lyrics have [...] "definitely improved". Jesse Catalodo of Slant felt that the lyrics to [...] "The Only Exception" [...] may be [...] "irredeemably over-the-top" [...] but its [...] "vocal melodies are the stuff of perfect pop".|$|E

500|$|The album's opening {{series of}} songs have {{straightforward}} lyrics. On [...] "Back to Love", Bilal flatters his date's shoes and {{is backed by}} a bubbling funk groove. The song draws on the music of Prince, while the jazz guitar licks of [...] "Winning Hand" [...] draw on Steely Dan. [...] "Climbing" [...] has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song [...] "Party and Bullshit". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. [...] "Slipping Away" [...] is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song [...] "Lost for Now", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in [...] "a smile that changes everything" [...] as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad [...] "Butterfly" [...] is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents. The album closes with lyrics about the promise of tomorrow: [...] "Woke up this morning {{to the sound of}} a bluebird singing / Suddenly I knew just where to begin / Something so simple / How can it speak so <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> me?" ...|$|E
500|$|Song Ci (1186–1249) was a Chinese {{physician}} and judge during the Southern Song dynasty. His famous work Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified was {{a basis for}} early forensic science in China. Song's predecessor Shen Kuo offered critical analysis of human anatomy, dispelling the old Chinese belief that the human throat had three valves instead of two. A Chinese autopsy in the early 12th century confirmed Shen's hypothesis of two throat valves: the esophagus and larynx. [...] However, dissection and examination of human bodies for solving criminal cases was of interest to Song Ci. His work was compiled {{on the basis of}} other Chinese works dealing with justice and forensics. His book provided a list of types of death (strangulation, drowning, poison, blows, etc.) and a means of physical examination in order to distinguish between murder, suicide, or accident. Besides instructions on proper ways to examine corpses, Song Ci also provided instructions on providing first aid for victims close to death from hanging, drowning, sunstroke, freezing to death, and undernourishment. For the specific case of drowning, Song Ci advised using the first aid technique of artificial respiration. He wrote of examinations of victims' bodies performed in the open amongst official clerks and attendants, a coroner's assistant (or midwife in the case of women), actual accused suspect of the crime and relatives of the deceased, with the results of the autopsy called out <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> the group and noted in the inquest report.

After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, [...] "the police aren't enough. Too many people wanna kill you." [...] When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes {{the owner of a}} security company, which then became [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge." [...] Although current showrunner Al Jean found it [...] "very funny," [...] the episode's first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read out <b>loud</b> <b>to</b> the other writers. During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store, causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was [...] "somewhat obsessed" [...] with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said [...] "I love the idea of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels." [...] While trying to determine who stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa [...] "Look at him over there, eating that apple. What is he planning?" [...] Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because it bothered the character's voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed.
