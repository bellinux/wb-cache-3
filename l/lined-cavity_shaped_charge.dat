40|$|AbstractRocket {{propelled}} grenade (RPG) <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> attack {{threats are}} of particular concern for Insensitive Munitions (IM) development. In response to these threats, the U. S. Project Engineering Office for Ammunition (PEO Ammo) worked with ARDEC to develop a highly reproducible and well characterized standardized 81 mm <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> jet initiation test configuration. This test {{was adopted by the}} U. S. DoD for RPG threat testing as specified in MIL-STD- 2105 D and is completed as per STANAG 4526. Recent U. S. Insensitive Munitions <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> initiation attention has been focused on realistic smaller <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> threats. STANAG 4526 discusses standardized threats related to “Top Attack Bomblets” and SCJ with “Characteristics of 50 mm Rockeye”. As a representative <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> for smaller size threats than the RPG, the 50 mm Rockeye munition has been commonly recommended for testing. However, recent testing of the 50 mm Rockeye munitions has shown a large undesirable variability of jet tip characteristics. This large variability in jet tip characteristics would be consistent with a large variability in munitions response to the 50 mm Rockeye jet attack. Additionally, it has become clear that this <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> does not represent a commonly observed threat. For this reason, an effort is currently underway to identify a dominant smaller <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> threat and to develop a surrogate small <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> threat test configuration that provides very reproducible jet characteristics. The result to date is that 40 mm grenades have been identified as a dominant smaller <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> threat and a surrogate consistent in approach with previous efforts has been designed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Shaped</b> <b>charges</b> {{are used}} for the {{penetration}} of targets in all three dimensions of warfare – land, air and naval. With fillings of high explosives compositions inside, they generate a thin high velocity metal jet, which can perforate the targets. <b>Shaped</b> <b>charges</b> can penetrate tanks with thick armour protection, they can destroy bunkers, they can destroy aircraft and are also useful for attacking ships or submarines. Although <b>shaped</b> <b>charges</b> have a very long history since the Second World War, theoretical modelling efforts started with the steady state theory of Birkhoff in 1948. This theory was modified by the non-steady state theory known as the PER theory of <b>shaped</b> <b>charges.</b> Later, several contributions from experimental evidence were incorporated in the theoretical formulations, and the mathematical models were refined by including the virtual origin, and physical qualities of the jet breakup time, defragmentation into particulates time, {{the diameter of the}} metal jet, wave amplitude etc. To review the development of theoretical modelling of <b>shaped</b> <b>charges,</b> three stages are defined. The first is the development until 1990, when the theory of <b>shaped</b> <b>charges</b> was fully developed and penetration predictions with fairly good accuracy were possible. The second stage reviews work carried out in {{the last decade of the}} 20 th century. During this period good experiments were planned, parametric study was carried out and the results incorporated in the mathematical model of <b>shaped</b> <b>charges.</b> The third stage is all work done in the 21 st century (2000 - 2010), when the tools for advanced diagnostics, new fabrication and inspection, as well as new liner materials were incorporated. The anomalies obtained were resolved by further refinements in the developed theoretical models. The unexplored areas of the theoretical modelling of <b>shaped</b> <b>charges</b> are also enumerated in this paper...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shaped</b> {{explosive}} <b>charges</b> {{with one}} dimension significantly {{larger than the}} other are called linear <b>shaped</b> <b>charges.</b> Linear <b>shaped</b> <b>charges</b> are used in various industries and are applied within specific technologies for metal cutting, such as demolition of steel structures, separating spent rocket fuel tanks, demining, cutting holes in the barriers for fire service, etc. According to existing theories and models efficiency of linear <b>shaped</b> <b>charges</b> depends on the kinetic energy of the jet which is proportional to square of jet velocity. The original method for measuring velocity of linear <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> jet is applied in the aforementioned research. Measurements were carried out for two different linear materials, {{and the results are}} graphically presented, analysed and compared.

Jet radius or liner thickness, shell thickness, liner material density, α angle and stand-off distance are evaluated in purpose to investigate {{their effect on}} performance of <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> jet velocity and jet breakup phenomena, also we investigate the effect of stand-off distance on <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> jet penetration into steel target. We also studied the performance of some protective shields materials in order to assure more protection for vehicle structure against <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> jet penetration. For that, different materials were used as armors such as: kevlar epoxy, polyethylene, glass epoxy, steel- 1006 and Al 2 O 3 ceramic. These protective shields were evaluated {{in order to show}} their performance against <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> penetration into target. To do so, adopted explicit dynamic analyzing program Autodyn basing on finite element were used to simulate <b>shaped</b> <b>charge</b> jet formation and penetration. Autodyn- 2 D simulationshighlight the efficiency of our work comparing with the experiments done in literature and Birkhoff’s theory. In other terms, increasing in shell thickness, alpha angle and liner densityenhance jet breakup time, protective shields layered armor of steel- 1006, steel 1006 with polyethylene and steel- 1006 with Al 2 O 3 ceramic give more protection for structure agains...|$|R
