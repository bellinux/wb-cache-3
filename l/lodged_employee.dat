To attract and keep the talent, hotel starts to work hard on employer brand management. Employer brand creates the uniqueness and recognition to be outstanding from the competitor and enhance company strength, encourage employee loyalty and precieve organization-value. As Sasser (1976) says internal marketing reflects external service to internal service and turns employee as customer. Internal marketing should develop employee-needed product to attract, motivate and remain the talent to build up loyalty. In brand equity research reference, many customer-based data were found and focused on customer satisfaction. Regarding the lack of employee-based brand equity research, this study is interested on discovering the <b>employee’s</b> view. In <b>lodging</b> industry, <b>employee</b> plays the critical role to deliver service and brand commitment to customer directly. The perceived brand equity will affect the serving behavior and customer perceived quality. Therefore, this study would like to investigate the relation between brand equity and intention to stay from employee’s view. This study found that working benefit, brand knowledge, brand commitment and brand congruity will influence the intention to stay. In working benefit, salary, working pressure, over-time work and benefit comparing to others have been proved to encourage employee to stay. However, brand knowledge effect employee stay intention inversely. Better brand knowledge, less stay intention. Brand commitment motivates employee to stay as well. Furthermore, employee is affected by others to influence the working intention, such as others identification and customer comment. Employee has congruity with the colleague and reflects higher intention to stay. 目錄 VI 表目錄 VII 圖目錄 VIII 第一章、	緒論	 1 第一節、	研究背景與動機 1 第二節、	研究目的	 1 第三節、	研究流程	 2 第二章、	文獻探討	 3 第一節、	雇主品牌	 3 第二節、	品牌權益	 4 第三節、	留任意願	 7 第三章、	研究方法	 8 第一節、	研究架構	 8 第二節、	研究假設	 9 第三節、	研究範圍及對象	 10 第四章、	研究分析與結果	 19 第二節、	皮爾森相關分析	 30 第三節、	探索性因素分析	 31 第四節、	信度分析	 33 第五章、結論與建議	 37 第一節、	結 論	 37 第二節、	研究限制及未來研究建議	 38 文獻參考	 39 中文文獻	 39 網站資料	 39 西文部分	 40 附錄一、台灣旅館品牌權益調查問券	 43 附件二、編碼紀錄表	 47 附件三、旅館資料列表	 53 表目錄 表 3. 4. 1 品牌形象之量表 13 表 3. 4. 2 品牌知識之量表 14 表 3. 4. 3 知覺品質之量表 15 表 3. 4. 4 品牌承諾之量表 16 表 3. 4. 5 一致性之量表 16 表 3. 4. 6 留任意願之量表 17 表 3. 4. 7 受訪者基本資料問項 17 表 4. 1. 1 受訪者性別統計表 20 表 4. 1. 2 受訪者年齡統計表 20 表 4. 1. 3 受訪者教育程度統計表 21 表 4. 1. 4 受訪者管理人數統計表 21 表 4. 1. 5 受訪者工作部門統計表 22 表 4. 1. 6 受訪者於旅館業服務年資統計表 22 表 4. 1. 7 受訪者所屬旅館分類統計表 23 表 4. 1. 8 受訪者所屬旅館品牌屬性統計表 23 表 4. 1. 9 受訪者所屬旅館星級統計表 24 表 4. 1. 10 本研究各變項得分平均數 25 表 4. 1. 11 品牌形象各問項得分平均數 26 表 4. 1. 12 品牌知識各問項得分平均數 27 表 4. 1. 13 知覺品質各問項得分平均數 28 表 4. 1. 14 品牌承諾各問項得分平均數 29 表 4. 1. 15 一致性各問項得分平均數 29 表 4. 1. 16 留任意願各問項得分平均數 30 表 4. 2. 1 各變數對留任意願之皮爾森相關係數 31 表 4. 3. 1 KMO與Bartlett檢定 32 表 4. 3. 2 解說總變異量 32 表 4. 3. 3 因素分析轉軸後的成份矩陣 33 表 4. 4. 1 變項間Cronbach’s α值 34 表 4. 5. 1 品牌形象、品牌知識、知覺品質、品牌承諾及品牌一致性對於留任意願之多元迴歸分析 36 表 4. 5. 2 品牌形象、品牌知識、知覺品質、品牌承諾及品牌一致性對於留任意願之模式摘要 36 圖目錄 圖 1. 3 研究流程圖 3 圖 2. 1 雇主品牌發展結果架構圖 4 圖 2. 2 顧客觀點之旅館業品牌權益模型 5 圖 3. 1 研究架構 9 圖 4. 2 研究結果 3...|$|R

In the process of Islamization, the dining table was accepted “Halilİbrahim’s Table” and this approach has strengthened further the hospitality. Eating with people, preparing the table for the guests, travelers and the needywere regarded as a factor increasing the fertility of the table. In addition,these movements were considered an act of social cooperation and deepen thecollective consciousness. Especially the sufis played a dominant role in theprocess of Islamization in Anatolia and depending on this, they undertookvarious social and cultural functions that including catering. In this regard,the lodge was seen as a complex and this structure encompasses different unitssuch as imaret or soup kitchen, mosque, tomb, library, dervish cells, publicfountains, bakery and bathhouse. Travelers stay in the imaret and supply theirneeds, they also nurture themselves spiritually as well. Lodges were a safehaven for these travelers and lodge’s kitchens were open every hour of the daywith serving the delicious “Father’s Soup. ” Therefore, lodges became arepresentative of peace. These kitchens take reference the advices of theprophet about eating and serving meals. In addition, the effects of the oldTurkish culture and of the Yesevī tradition on these kitchens are witnessed. While many documents related to the foodculture in Anatolia could remain to us, regarding the life of lodges especially,information about the kitchens is still limited. Ali Eşref Dede’s cookbook, Yemek Risalesi, is one of the workswritten about the dishes of Ottoman period. This work is very important inrelation to the Mevleviyye as well. This manuscript was written in the 19 thcentury by Sheikh Ali Eşref Dede at Edirne. Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid, one of the other important sources that should be included in theOttoman lodge food literature. This manuscript is registered in the IstanbulMetropolitan Municipality Atatürk Library Muallim Cevdet Yazmaları (number, 224). Two works were written in the same century. In Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid there are some financial and agricultural information concerning to“Hüdâyî Lodge’s Foundation”. This manuscript includes valuable informationabout accounting records and officers employed in imaret and otherinstitutions. On the other hand, there are various recipes in this manuscriptabout the imaret meals, also lists of kitchenware and food materials. Thisrecord is thirty pages and was written during Mahmud II. period. Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid is related to Aziz Mahmud Hudāyī Lodge that is placed in a high andstrategic location in Uskudar that connects Istanbul to Anatolia. This was acomplex structure and established in a place of ten thousand square meters. Itconsisted of imaret, sheikh’s house (haremlik), mosque, tomb, library, dervishcells, bakery and bath. As mentioned above, Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid contains important information about Aziz Mahmud Hudāyī Lodge’s kitchenand recipes. In fact, the manuscript also provides several alternatives to someof the recipes. This record exhibits the structure of the order and thenutritional forms of the Sufis. Thus, to some extent, it is possible to analyzethe theoretical and philosophical direction of the order. Because eating in thelodges is not an action just to satisfy a person 2 ̆ 7 s stomach. Rather there is adining ritual in the lodge. In this frame, the importance of the dining tablewas emphasized in the lodge tradition in the dimension of human education andsocialization. In the sense of Sufism, the information about food revealssymbolic and allegorical meanings, sometimes directly or indirectly. Ritualsrelated to food are closely related to the educational process of thedervishes. In this respect, on the sacred journey of dervish it is necessary toeat food permissible in the religion. In this regard, the books about thecustoms of the order contain considerable information. Giving valuable information about meals Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid contains maincourse and dessert recipes. It revealed the food habits of the dervishes andthe people who were living at that time. The recipes also contain someinteresting features applicable in the Turkish kitchen today. In addition, thenames of meals and desserts contribute to the richness of the Turkic language. There are soups and salads, meat grills and stew varieties, fish dishes, pastryvarieties, dessert varieties, cookies and halvahs. Meals are cooked with buttermainly. Lamb and sheep are preferred in the meals. The use of spices is high. For example, cinnamon is used even when cooking meat and fish. The manuscriptseems to have thirty recipes but there are also different cooking methods inthe manuscript. Different cooking methods were used together in some meals asfrying, boiling and baking. For this reason, the number of recipes in themanuscript increases even more. This article entitled “The Ottoman DervishLodge Cuisine and Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid” has been latinized by simplifying the manuscript based on with a singlecopy. In this article the place and importance of the lodge cuisine in amystical life has been analyzed in addition to presenting valuable informationabout the literature that is related to the Anatolian Lodge Cuisine, theOttoman Cuisine, and recepies cooked in the Ottoman. Furthermore, the workbriefly presents some about the lodge because it is related to Aziz MahmudHudāyī lodge. Moreover, a dictionary section has been added for understandingthe relatively abandoned words in the manuscript. Similarly, measurements andweigh units are briefly given in Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid...|$|R

Lodges were a safe haven for these travelers and lodge’s kitchens were open every hour of the day with serving the delicious “Father’s Soup. ” Therefore, lodges became a representative of peace. These kitchens take reference the advices of the prophet about eating and serving meals. In addition, the effects of the old Turkish culture and of the Yesevī tradition on these kitchens are witnessed. While many documents related to the food culture in Anatolia could remain to us, regarding the life of lodges especially, information about the kitchens is still limited. Ali Eşref Dede’s cookbook, Yemek Risalesi, is one of the works written about the dishes of Ottoman period. This work is very important in relation to the Mevleviyye as well. This manuscript was written in the 19 th century by Sheikh Ali Eşref Dede at Edirne. Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid, one of the other important sources that should be included in the Ottoman lodge food literature. This manuscript is registered in the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Atatürk Library Muallim Cevdet Yazmaları (number, 224). Two works were written in the same century. In Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid there are some financial and agricultural information concerning to “Hüdâyî Lodge’s Foundation”. This manuscript includes valuable information about accounting records and officers employed in imaret and other institutions. On the other hand, there are various recipes in this manuscript about the imaret meals, also lists of kitchenware and food materials. This record is thirty pages and was written during Mahmud II. period. Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid is related to Aziz Mahmud Hudāyī Lodge that is placed in a high and strategic location in Uskudar that connects Istanbul to Anatolia. This was a complex structure and established in a place of ten thousand square meters. It consisted of imaret, sheikh’s house (haremlik), mosque, tomb, library, dervish cells, bakery and bath. As mentioned above, Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid contains important information about Aziz Mahmud Hudāyī Lodge’s kitchen and recipes. In fact, the manuscript also provides several alternatives to some of the recipes. This record exhibits the structure of the order and the nutritional forms of the Sufis. Thus, to some extent, it is possible to analyze the theoretical and philosophical direction of the order. Because eating in the lodges is not an action just to satisfy a person's stomach. Rather there is a dining ritual in the lodge. In this frame, the importance of the dining table was emphasized in the lodge tradition in the dimension of human education and socialization. In the sense of Sufism, the information about food reveals symbolic and allegorical meanings, sometimes directly or indirectly. Rituals related to food are closely related to the educational process of the dervishes. In this respect, on the sacred journey of dervish it is necessary to eat food permissible in the religion. In this regard, the books about the customs of the order contain considerable information. Giving valuable information about meals Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid contains main course and dessert recipes. It revealed the food habits of the dervishes and the people who were living at that time. The recipes also contain some interesting features applicable in the Turkish kitchen today. In addition, the names of meals and desserts contribute to the richness of the Turkic language. There are soups and salads, meat grills and stew varieties, fish dishes, pastry varieties, dessert varieties, cookies and halvahs. Meals are cooked with butter mainly. Lamb and sheep are preferred in the meals. The use of spices is high. For example, cinnamon is used even when cooking meat and fish. The manuscript seems to have thirty recipes but there are also different cooking methods in the manuscript. Different cooking methods were used together in some meals as frying, boiling and baking. For this reason, the number of recipes in the manuscript increases even more. This article entitled “The Ottoman Dervish Lodge Cuisine and Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid” has been latinized by simplifying the manuscript based on with a single copy. In this article the place and importance of the lodge cuisine in a mystical life has been analyzed in addition to presenting valuable information about the literature that is related to the Anatolian Lodge Cuisine, the Ottoman Cuisine, and recepies cooked in the Ottoman. Furthermore, the work briefly presents some about the lodge because it is related to Aziz Mahmud Hudāyī lodge. Moreover, a dictionary section has been added for understanding the relatively abandoned words in the manuscript. Similarly, measurements and weigh units are briefly given in Majmūʿa al-fawāʾid...|$|R
