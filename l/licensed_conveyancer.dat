5000|$|In the United Kingdom, conveyancers are {{regulated}} by an official body {{known as the}} Council for <b>Licensed</b> <b>Conveyancers.</b> Its main purpose is to set entry standards and regulate the profession of <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> effectively {{in order to secure}} adequate consumer protection, promote effective competition in the legal services market and provide choice for consumers.|$|R

50|$|In most Commonwealth countries, a {{conveyancer}} is {{a specialist}} lawyer who specialises {{in the legal}} aspects of buying and selling real property, or conveyancing. A conveyancer can also be (but need not be) a solicitor, <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancer,</b> or {{a fellow of the}} Institute of Legal Executives.|$|E
5000|$|Conveyancing in Australia (also {{called a}} transfer) is usually {{carried out by}} a {{solicitor}} or a <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancer.</b> Kits are available for the buyer to complete the process themselves, but due {{to the complexity of}} varying state and council laws and processes, this is usually not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Section 34 {{establishes}} the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board as a statutory corporation. The Practitioners Board is tasked with developing competition in conveyancing services to avoid monopolies, supervising {{the actions of}} <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> and developing a way of monitoring said conveyancers. The Practitioners Board has the powers to both grant and refuse authorisation to conveyancing practitioners, establish a conveyancing ombudsman and a compensation scheme for parties that suffer {{as a result of}} a conveyancer's actions appoint investigators to look into the behaviour of an authorised conveyancer. There are therefore three regulatory bodies under this Section—the Practitioners Board, the Law Society for regulating solicitors engaged in conveyancing work and the Council for <b>Licensed</b> <b>Conveyancers</b> charged with regulating <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} {{conveyancing}} {{work and the}} responsibility of <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> in carrying out property transactions in New South Wales is examined {{as a consequence of}} new powers of attorney legislation introduced in that state, which provides for <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> to act as prescribed witnesses to enduring powers of attorney. Anomalies in the licensing legislation which defines the nature of legal work available to conveyancers and constrains them in their new role are considered. Some background to the introduction of <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> in New South Wales is provided with an overview of changes to the licensing legislation since its inception in 1992. The issues explored suggest there will be confusion for consumers, potential conduct and disciplinary issues for conveyancers and limited benefits for all parties and lead to the conclusion that legislative change is the only solution. 12 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|A common {{conveyance}} by a solicitor or a <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancer</b> {{usually takes}} 4 to 6 weeks. Most firms offer fixed price services which normally include costs for searches, legal advice and other outlays. In most states and territories a typical conveyance includes, {{but is not}} limited to, the following: ...|$|E
50|$|To {{become a}} <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancer,</b> you are {{required}} to complete the examinations and practical training provided by the CLC. In addition to this, you {{must be at least}} 21 years of age and be considered by the CLC to be a fit and proper person to hold a licence.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Licensed</b> <b>Conveyancer</b> {{holding a}} limited licence is {{required}} to complete eight hours of professional training each year (CPD - Continuing Professional Development training). Licensed Conveyancers with a full licence must complete 12 hours of professional training each year. A large part of this training must relate to property law and practice.|$|E
50|$|However, {{rather than}} being {{qualified}} as a solicitor, they will have completed all of the examinations and practical training provided by a regulatory body for <b>Licensed</b> <b>Conveyancers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{report also}} left the {{conveyancing}} monopoly of solicitors intact, {{although it did}} {{pave the way for}} the system of <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> established by the Access to Justice Act 1975.|$|R
50|$|Like solicitors and barristers, <b>Licensed</b> <b>Conveyancers</b> {{are also}} Commissioners for Oaths. A Commissioner for Oaths {{is a person}} {{appointed}} by the Lord Chancellor with power to administer oaths or take affidavits.|$|R
50|$|Progress was {{haphazard}} and piecemeal, {{but over}} time things became more standard. Improvements became universal as institutional lenders refused to advance money on the security of flats unless certain basic provisions were included. This benefited owners {{whether or not they}} borrowed money since purchase was invariably conducted through a solicitor or <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancer</b> trained to reject leases failing to meet the necessary standards.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{complicated}} legal exchange, or conveyance, of the property, {{one or both}} of the main participants are likely to require legal representation. The agent used for conveyancing varies based on the jurisdiction. In the English-speaking world this means either a general legal practitioner, i.e., an attorney or solicitor, or in jurisdictions influenced by English law, including South Africa, a (<b>licensed)</b> <b>conveyancer.</b> In the United States, real estate agents are the most common. In civil law jurisdictions conveyancing is handled by civil law notaries.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, a local {{authority}} search (also known as local land charges search or local search) {{refers to the}} provision of specific information about a particular property {{and the surrounding area}} for buyers and sellers. This is undertaken as part of the conveyancing process by a solicitor or a <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancer.</b> If you are borrowing money to finance the purchase it will normally be a condition of the advance that you obtain a local search. If you are not having finance it is your option whether to have a local search or not.|$|E
50|$|Complaints {{from the}} public are handled by the Legal Ombudsman which is a single portal for {{complaints}} by the public made against all providers of legal services including the Bar, <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> etc., but excluding unqualified will-writers.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the passing}} of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, solicitors had a near-complete {{monopoly}} on conveyancing work. The introduction of <b>Licensed</b> <b>Conveyancers</b> {{with the passage of the}} Administration of Justice Act 1985 did little to change the situation, with no great switch in conveyancing work from solicitors to <b>Licensed</b> <b>Conveyancers.</b> In an attempt to disrupt this monopoly and act on the conclusions of the Civil Justice Review, the British Government passed the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, one of the aims of which was to widen the field of who could become a conveyancer. As such, Section 34 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 established the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board as a statutory corporation.|$|R
25|$|After {{negotiations}} with the government, Mitchell withdrew his bill {{in exchange for a}} guarantee that the government would allow non-solicitors to undertake conveyancing work once a Committee had set out proposals for protecting consumers who used these new conveyancers against losses. The Committee, known as the Farrand Committee (after its chairman, Julian Farrand), finished its report in September 1984. The government almost immediately changed the rules to allow for <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers,</b> introducing the changes with a section in the Administration of Justice Act 1985. Despite worries that this would bankrupt solicitors who specialised in conveyancing work, very few <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> began practising due to the difficulties in qualifying, and although the field has become more competitive there has been no substantial loss of revenue like that feared.|$|R
50|$|An {{estate agent}} {{is a person}} or {{business}} that arranges the selling, renting or management of properties, and other buildings, in the United Kingdom and Ireland or other countries around the world. An agent that specialises in renting is often called a letting or management agent. Estate agents are mainly engaged in the marketing of property available for sale and a solicitor or <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancer</b> is used to prepare the legal documents. In Scotland, however, many solicitors also act as estate agents, a practice that is rare in England and Wales.|$|E
50|$|The {{solicitor}} or <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancer</b> acts {{on behalf}} of the property buyer or the tenant, and liaises with the local authority who are responsible for carrying out the local authority search. The timescale for the return of the search result depends on which local authority carries out the search. The majority of local authorities return search results in under 5 working days. It is also possible to undertake a personal search of the local land charges register. This can be done by anyone but requires the searcher to have a knowledge of what they are viewing. A personal search is free. A personal search does not include all of the information required to complete a full local search. The remaining information must be acquired from public registers and viewing information under the environmental information regulations.|$|E

[...] Aside from activity in Adelaide, his business established a presence on Kangaroo Island, South Australia from 1963 and is the longest established real estate business on the island. In 1966 he became the youngest ever councillor in the Real Estate Institute of South Australia, and in 1981 its youngest ever life member. In June 1988, he became a Member of the Order of Australia for his service to the real estate industry and the community.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} a {{telephone}} survey of solicitors in England and Wales, this paper presents data {{on the impact of}} deregulation on price discrimination in 27 local conveyancing markets. It is concluded that variations in price discrimination can be explained not only by differences by firm and market structure but also by systematic differences in firm conduct. In particular, the nature of the response within different markets to deregulation in the legal profession (advertising and <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers)</b> has a significant effect on the extent of price discrimination...|$|R

50|$|In England and Wales {{there are}} two main classes of notaries - general notaries and scrivener notaries. Their {{functions}} are almost identical.

They also acquire the same powers as solicitors and other law practitioners, {{with the exception of the}} right to represent others before the courts (unless also members of the bar or admitted as a solicitor) once they are commissioned notaries. In practice almost all English notaries, and all Scottish ones, are also solicitors, and usually practise as solicitors.|$|R
25|$|Another {{aim of the}} Act was {{to widen}} the pool of people {{qualified}} to carry out probate work. Two options were given in the Green Paper The Work and Organisation of the Legal Profession—firstly to allow more legal professionals to engage in probate work, such as <b>Licensed</b> <b>Conveyancers,</b> authorised conveyancers and chartered accountants. The second suggestion was to completely deregulate probate work, which would have allowed anyone to engage in probate work. This was problematic because {{of the possibility of}} fraud and error, but the general conclusion of the report was that there was some deregulation needed, along with a single code of conduct governing all probate work.|$|R
25|$|In {{terms of}} conveyancing, the Green Paper {{proposed}} that the framework in the Building Societies Act would be repealed, and replaced by a system of authorised practitioners, where any person, partnership or corporate body could provide conveyancing services if they met certain standards. The authorised practitioners would have a professional code of conduct, and would be supervised by {{a certain number of}} <b>licensed</b> <b>conveyancers</b> and solicitors. The draft code of conduct had several flaws, however—it allowed practitioners to act for both parties in a transaction, causing issues with conflicts of interest, and failed {{to take into account the}} problems caused by banks and estate agents, who had interests in the housing market, being allowed to act as conveyancers.|$|R
