40|$|An active {{vibration}} control experiment of planar 3 -RRR flexible parallel robots is implemented in this paper. Considering {{the direct and}} inverse piezoelectric effect of PZT material, a general motion equation is established. A strain rate feedback controller is designed based on the established general motion equation. Four control schemes are designed in this experiment: three passive flexible <b>links</b> are <b>controlled</b> at the same time, only passive flexible <b>link</b> 1 is <b>controlled,</b> only passive flexible <b>link</b> 2 is <b>controlled,</b> and only passive flexible <b>link</b> 3 is <b>controlled.</b> The experimental results show that only one flexible <b>link</b> <b>controlled</b> scheme[*][*]suppresses elastic vibration and cannot suppress the elastic vibration of the other flexible links, whereas when three passive flexible <b>links</b> are <b>controlled</b> at the same time, {{they are able to}} effectively suppress the elastic vibration of all of the flexible links. In general, the experiment verifies that a strain rate feedback controller is able to effectively suppress the elastic vibration of the flexible links of plane 3 -RRR flexible parallel robots...|$|R
