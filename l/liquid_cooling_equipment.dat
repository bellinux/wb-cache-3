40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{supported}} by Ericsson to conduct research on immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> of electronics. By this technology, the liquid will be {{in direct contact with}} the electronics. The research begins with investigations in industrial background, literature review and theory in heat transfer. According to the knowledge from those investigations, different <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems including indirect, direct and immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems are introduced. The experiment consists of three parts: air cooling, single-phase and two-phase <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Those three parts are with the same test board with adjustable heat resources in the same geometry. In the first part, an air flow channel is used for testing air cooling, by which immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> can be compared to traditional technology. In the second part, an immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> system is designed and constructed with detailed explanation. Liquid NovecTM 7200 is used as working liquid. In the third part, a huge number of data has been collected during the whole process of boiling, through which a boiling curve for NovecTM 7200 has been acquired. Then comparisons between those three technologies have been made. The feasibility of immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> on an industrial scale has also been discussed. Based on the experiments and analyses, a careful conclusion that electronics with <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> has a larger heat flux limit than with today’s air cooling but with some practical problems can be drawn...|$|R

40|$|A {{spacecraft}} includes heat-generating payload equipment, and a {{heat transport}} {{system with a}} cold plate thermally coupled to the equipment and a capillary-wick evaporator, for evaporating coolant <b>liquid</b> to <b>cool</b> the <b>equipment.</b> The coolant vapor is coupled to a condenser and in a loop back to the evaporator. A heated coolant reservoir is coupled to the loop for pressure control. If the wick is not wetted, heat transfer will not begin or continue. A pair of check valves are coupled in the loop, and the heater is cycled for augmentation pumping of coolant {{to and from the}} reservoir. This augmentation pumping, in conjunction with the check valves, wets the wick. The wick liquid storage capacity allows the augmentation pump to provide continuous pulsed liquid flow to assure continuous vapor transport and a continuously operating heat transport system. The check valves are of the ball type to assure maximum reliability. However, any type of check valve can be used, including designs which are preloaded in the closed position. The check valve may use any ball or poppet material which resists corrosion. For optimum performance during testing on Earth, the ball or poppet would have neutral buoyancy or be configured in a closed position when the heat transport system is not operating. The ball may be porous to allow passage of coolant vapor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Three-dimensional (3 D) {{circuits}} reduce communication de-lay in multicore SoCs, {{and enable}} efficient integration of cores, memories, sensors, and RF devices. However, vertical integration of layers exacer-bates {{the reliability and}} thermal problems, and cooling efficiency becomes a limiting factor. <b>Liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> is a solution to overcome the accelerated thermal problems imposed by multi-layer architectures. In this paper, we first provide a 3 D thermal simulation model including <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling,</b> supporting both fixed and variable fluid injection rates. Our model has been integrated in HotSpot to study the impact on multicore SoCs. We design and evaluate several dynamic management policies that complement <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Our results for 3 D multicore SoCs, {{which are based on}} 3 D versions of UltraSPARC T 1, show that thermal management approaches that combine <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> with proactive task allocation are extremely effective in preventing temperature problems. Our proactive management technique provides an additional 75 % average reduction in hot spots in comparison to applying only <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Furthermore, for systems capable of varying the coolant flow rate at runtime, our feedback controller increases the improvement to 95 % on average.
