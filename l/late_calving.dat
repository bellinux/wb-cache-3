40|$|Variable precipitation, more {{importantly}} drought, impacts profitability for livestock management. Financial outcomes from management decisions related to forage shortages can be exacerbated by price variability. This research examines alternative management strategies {{to determine the}} potential profitability and riskiness over a long-term horizon and across various drought event scenarios. Results indicate that <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> can be a promising strategy, but it also can result in higher variability in profits as compared {{to some of the}} other strategies analyzed. Retaining ownership of steer calves over the winter, with the option to sell if forage supplies become scarce, outperforms both partial liquidation and summer feeding, and it results in less profit variability than <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> or early weaning.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} relationship between date of birth and growth performance of calves born to seasonally-bred range cows. <b>Late</b> born <b>calves</b> exhibited an apparent superiority in preweaning growth over that of their early-born counterparts. This was attributed to a positive residual effect of maternal environment arising {{from the fact that}} <b>calves</b> born <b>late</b> were those whose dams had a substantial proportion of the critical last trimester of the gestation period in a favourable season. This advantage soon disappeared and early-born calves gained more weight and at a faster rate between 90 days and weaning. A combination of the effect of weaning stress and unfavourable nutritional environment in the immediate postweaning period had a check on calf growth but <b>late</b> borne <b>calves</b> suffered most. It was concluded that in this environment, nutrition was most limiting to calf growth between weaning and 12 months of age and it was during this period that a clear advantage of early birth of calves appeared. Under seasonal breeding and group management of calves, all animals from a calf crop are expected to go to market at the same time, therby rendering age-adjustment of liveweights irrelevant. However, the sale of <b>late</b> <b>calves</b> could be delayed by a few months {{to take advantage of the}} rainy season and to exploit compensatory growth. The benefit of this practice should, however, be weighed against both the direct cost (of feeding, veterinary care, labour and so on) and the indirect cost - the competition factor - introduced on the next calf crop...|$|R

40|$|What is calf wastage. Breeding female {{cattle in}} north Australia {{contribute}} best to business success by producing a heavy weaner each {{year at the}} first weaning round. This maximises increase in value by the cow unit over the year, generally from mid-year to mid-year. The ability to cycle in both maiden heifers and lactating cows is the primary limitation to achieving this. Wastage of a calf at any stage between conception and weaning also substantially limits fertility and value increase at a herd level. Embryo loss may result in later calves as cows re-conceive; the calves produced are smaller at weaning {{and have to be}} weaned later into the dry season. Late calf wastage usually results in breeders missing a calf for the year. <b>Late</b> <b>calving</b> often also results in failure to cycle, thus cows rear a calf in the subsequent year...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand (NZ) dairy {{industry}} is reliant on seasonal pasture production and a concentrated calving interval to best match pasture supply and animal demand. To achieve this goal, some farmers induce lactation in <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> cows. This has animal welfare implications, which {{could result in}} non-tariff trade barriers to NZ dairy products (Blackett, Compton and Glassey, C. 2006, Stevens, J., Burton, L, Rendel, J. 2000). Additionally there are concerns with drug residues in the milk from herds where {{a large percentage of}} cows are induced. New standards were introduced in the 2010 - 11 season by the NZ Veterinarians Association (NZVA), Dairy NZ, Dairy Companies Association of NZ (DCANZ) and Federated Farmers. In the 2011 - 12 season the level of inductions within an individual herd will not exceed 8 % reducing to 4 % in 2012 - 13. There will be requirements for information about the stage of pregnancy; the age of the cow (under eight years old) and body condition score (4. 5 to 6. 5). Although this reduction may seem onerous, the NZVA has stated that only 3 % of the national herd was induced in the season just finished, with 98 % of farms being under 15 % (Benny 2011). A survey of Canterbury dairy farmers in 2008 found that 36 % operate a nil induction policy (Pangborn, 2008). With reduced levels of inductions farmers will be forced to adopt an eight week mating system if they are to maintain the traditional calving patterns. If the number of <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> cows cannot be reduced to fewer than 4 %, then a larger number of cows will be culled. If a pregnant cow is worth $ 2, 000 and a non-pregnant cow $ 500 there could be significant capital losses. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the basics of getting cows in calf and strategies for reduced inductions, discuss the results of the nil induction policy of the Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF), and look at the plan of one Canterbury farm to meet the new guidelines...|$|E
40|$|A two-year study (2007, 2008) was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of two calving systems, early (March; Early Calving System (ECS)) vs. late (June; <b>Late</b> <b>Calving</b> System (LCS)) on cow, pre-weaning calf performance and feeding system management and costs. Both early and <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> systems were managed at three locations on the Canadian Prairies: Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) -Brandon Research Centre (Brandon, Manitoba); AAFC-Semi arid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre (Swift Current, SK); and Western Beef Development Centre (Lanigan, SK). Four feeding management systems (drylot (DL), pasture (PG), swath-windrow (SG) and bale grazing (BG)) were utilized at all three locations to maximize grazing systems. 	Management of animals through the four different feeding systems was found to meet or exceed protein and energy requirements according to NRC (2000). Differences in cow body weight (BW) (P= 0. 001; location) were observed across locations at pre-calving and weaning periods although there were no obvious patterns when comparing across calving systems. A significant three way interaction was observed for cow BW at breeding (P= 0. 003), and for cow body condition score (BCS) at breeding (P= 0. 002). Body condition score at breeding indicated {{there was a significant}} (P= 0. 002) three way interaction, where there were no significant interactions when comparisons across calving system within the same year (Y) and location (L) were performed for Brandon and Lanigan in 2007 and for Lanigan in 2008 also, therefore no improvements in one calving system compared to the other. At Brandon in 2007, ECS cow BCS were similar to LCS cows. In 2007 and 2008, the inverse occurred at SC where LCS cows had greater BCS compared to the ECS. The same two way (Calving System x Location) interaction was significant at pre-calving and weaning for both cow rib (P= 0. 003; P= 0. 007) and rump fat (P= 0. 002; P= 0. 02) where Lanigan had significantly lower rib and rump fat for the LCS as compared to the ECS. Rib and rump fat measurements did not follow a typical pattern. Fluctuations in body fat reserves varied depending on the calving system and location. Even though differences (P 0. 05) in reproductive performance between the two calving systems within the management of the current study. Pregnancy rate, calving rate, calving span and weaning rate were similar for both early and <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> systems. In 2007, calf mortality on average was higher for LCS (5 %) vs ECS (1. 7 %) and the inverse occurred in 2008, where LCS had lower calf mortalities than did ECS, 3. 3 % and 4 %, respectively. Most calf mortalities were born dead or weak. There appeared to be no negative impact on calf mortality with early or <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> systems. A significant two way (Calving System x Year) interaction was observed for calf BW at birth (P= 0. 002) (Table 4. 4). Treatment (Calving System) (P< 0. 0001) main effect was significant for ADG (Table 4. 4). The average values for calf birth weights for ECS in 2007 and 2008 were 42. 1 and 41. 2 ± 0. 45 kg and for LCS in 2007 and 2008 were 41. 4 and 44. 1 ± 0. 47 kg, respectively. Birth weights in 2007 between ECS and LCS were not different but in 2008 calf birth weight for LCS was heavier (P< 0. 05) than ECS calves. As expected calf birth weights were affected by L (P< 0. 0001). Calf birth weights were 44. 8, 40. 5 and 41. 5 ± 0. 8 for BR, SC and LA. Weaning rate was not affected by calving system, location or year. Pre-weaning ADG was 1. 13 and 0. 96 ± 0. 01 kg d- 1 for ECS and LCS, respectively. Weaning weights were therefore significantly (P< 0. 05) heavier for ECS as compared to the LCS, 273 and 240 ± 1. 82 kg, respectively. 	The results of cow and calf performance indicate that calving later in the year does not significantly affect cow performance or reproductive efficiency but calf growth rate is significantly affected largely due to the time of year. Labour and feeding system management and costs are typically lower for LCS because of the ability to manage the cow herd on pastures and extended grazing systems which reduces the need for stored feeds during periods of cold weather...|$|E
40|$|Rodents and {{primates}} {{deprived of}} early social contact exhibit deficits in learning and behavioural flexibility. They often also exhibit apparent signs of elevated anxiety, although {{the relationship between}} these effects has not been studied. To investigate whether dairy calves are similarly affected, we first compared calves housed in standard individual pens (n = 7) to those housed in a dynamic group with access to their mothers (n = 8). All calves learned to approach the correct stimulus in a visual discrimination task. Only one individually housed calf was able to re-learn the task when the stimuli were reversed, compared to all but one calf from the group. A second experiment investigated whether this effect might be explained by anxiety in individually housed animals interfering with their learning, and tested varying degrees of social contact in addition to the complex group: pair housing beginning early (approximately 6 days old) and late (6 weeks old). Again, fewer individually reared calves learned the reversal task (2 of 10 or 20 %) compared to early paired and grouped calves (16 of 21 or 76 % of <b>calves).</b> <b>Late</b> paired <b>calves</b> had intermediate success. Individually housed calves were slower to touch novel objects, but the magnitude of the fear response did not correlate with reversal performance.

40|$|Calving date (CD) {{records of}} 68896 polled Hereford dams of 120 682 calves were coded within herd-year-season with date 1 being the date the first calf was born. Factors {{affecting}} CD {{and its relationship}} with production traits were investigated. Early calving {{was found to be}} associated with high performance, conceivably because dams calving early were able to utilize the season-dependent range pastures to their advantage thus providing adequate milk supply to their calves. Weight and age of dam, weight of calf, initial CD, index of milk production potential, and previous CD were found to have significant influence on current CD. Extremely small cows at previous weaning had a tendency to <b>calve</b> <b>late.</b> Cows <b>calving</b> in the spring produced calves with higher overall weight per day of age than did cows calving in other seasons. Initial CD was found to affect CD in subsequent parties. Repeatability of CD was estimated at 0. 23. Heritability was estimated at 0. 16 (s. e. 0. 05) and indicated that additive genetic variance constitutes a moderate proportion of the variation in CD.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the impact of development systems, maternal protein supplementation, and estrus synchronization systems on beef cattle. Experiment 1 evaluated the effects of winter supplementation on cow performance {{and the effects of}} post-weaning management on progeny. <b>Late</b> spring <b>calving</b> cows grazed dormant range or meadow over winter and received either supplementation or no supplementation. Steer and heifer progeny were weaned and placed on dormant meadow or fed hay ad libitum. One half of the steers were placed in the feedlot at the end of treatment and the other half grazed range over summer. Cow winter treatment did not affect cow performance. Steers and heifers fed hay had increased ADG during winter trt compared to calves on meadow. Feedlot system did not {{have a significant effect on}} carcass data. In experiment 2, cows were synchronized for fixed-time AI (TAI) utilizing the CO-Synch and the CO-Synch + CIDR protocols. Cows synchronized with the CO-Synch + CIDR protocol had increased AI pregnancy rates compared to CO-Synch synchronized cows. In experiment 3, heifers were synchronized for TAI using the MGA + PGF 2 α protocol or CO-Synch + CIDR protocol. Half of the CO-Synch + CIDR heifers received PGF 2 α at the time of CIDR insertion. Heifers were time stamped at the time of final PGF 2 α administration and at the TAI. Pregnancy rates were not affected due to PGF 2 α administration at the time of CIDR insertion or time interval between final PGF 2 α administration and TAI. In summary, these experiments provide evidence to support the following findings: (1) there are minimal effects of winter supplementation on <b>late</b> spring <b>calving</b> cows and progeny performance; (2) post-weaning treatment had minimal effects on heifer and steer productivity; (3) cows utilizing CO-Synch + CIDR AI protocol have higher pregnancy rates; (4) fluctuations in time interval from time of PG administration to breeding had no effects on pregnancy rates.

Two groups of HF dairy cows with different mean CD were established from within the existing research herd at Moorepark (Teagasc, Ireland). Animals were assigned either to an early calving (mean CD: 12 February) treatment or a <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> (mean CD: 25 February) treatment. Animals within each CD treatment were randomly allocated to I of 3 SR treatments, Low (2. 51 cows/hectare (ha), Medium (2. 92 cows/ha) and High (3. 28 cows/ha) which were designed to represent 3 alternative whole farm SR in a post-European Union milk quota, spring calving, grass-based milk production system. A total of 138 spring-calving dairy cows, comprised of two strains of HF (North American HF and New Zealand HF genetic strains), were used during 2009 and 2010, respectively. The effects of CD, SR treatment, genetic strain and their interactions on milk production per cow and per ha, body weight and body condition score were analyzed. Although reducing per animal production, increased SR resulted in increased milk and milk solids production per ha.

A total of 138 spring-calving dairy cows, comprising 2 strains of Holstein-Friesian, North American (NA) and New Zealand (NZ), were used in each year (2009 and 2010). The effects of CD, SR treatment, genetic strain, and their interactions on reproductive performance, body weight, body condition score, blood metabolites, hormone and immunological parameters, and health status were analyzed. Stocking rate and CD {{had no effect on}} pregnancy rates, immunological parameters, or health status, although a tendency was observed for more reproductive intervention as SR increased. Earlier calving and increased SR also resulted in reduced body weight, body condition score, and metabolic status in early lactation. Strain of Holstein-Friesian also affected reproductive performance. The NZ strain tended to have a higher submission rate and 42 d pregnancy rate compared with the NA strain, and a strain by SR interaction was observed for pregnancy rate to first service. Earlier calving and increased SR can be achieved without adverse effects on overall pregnancy rates.

Two groups of Holstein-Friesian dairy cows with different mean CD were established from within the existing research herd at Moorepark (Teagasc, Ireland). Animals were assigned to either an early calving (mean CD February 14) treatment or a <b>late</b> <b>calving</b> (mean CD March 2) treatment. Animals within each CD treatment were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 whole-farm SR treatments: low (LSR; 2. 51 cows/ha), medium (MSR; 2. 92 cows/ha), and high (HSR; 3. 28 cows/ha), and animals remained on the same farmlet for the duration of the study. Individual animal DMI was estimated 3 times per year at grass using the n-alkane technique in March (spring), May (summer), and September (autumn), corresponding to, on average, 45, 132, and 258 d in milk, respectively. A total of 138 spring-calving dairy cows were used during each year of the study. The effects of SR, CD, season, and their interaction were studied using mixed models. Individual animal milk production, body weight, body condition score, and the efficiency of milk production were significantly decreased as SR increased due to a reduction in herbage availability. The existence of CD × SR × season interactions for production, DMI, and EB indicate that delaying the herd mean CD can be an effective strategy to minimize the reduction in animal performance, particularly in spring at higher SR. This study further confirms the benefits of a new approach to the evaluation of herbage allowance known as the individual herbage allowance, which encompasses the 3 main factors restricting DMI in rotational grazing; namely, the average daily herbage allowance of the group, the intake capacity of the individual animal within the group, and the relative intake capacity of the animal within the competing herd...|$|E

A subset of the original database was used and then refined to only include Holstein-Friesian cows with between 1 and 5 milk production records during the first 120 days of lactation in seasonal-calving herds which carried out AI {{for at least the}} first 6 weeks of the mating period. This subset comprised of 8, 795 cows in 66 herds. Cows in the subset were categorised into quartiles based on milk protein percentage (low: 2. 36 to 2. 99 %; med-low: 3. 00 to 3. 14 %; med-high: 3. 15 to 3. 29 %; and high 3. 30 to 4. 59 %) and 5 groups based on interval from calving to mating start date (> 12 weeks; 9 - 12 weeks; 6 - 9 weeks; 3 - 6 weeks; ≤ 3 weeks). Cows with low milk protein percent had a different calving pattern from those with higher milk protein percent. Whereas 92. 5 % of cows in the high milk protein quartile had calved at least 3 weeks at mating start date, only 84. 3 % in the low milk protein quartile had calved by the same date. The mean 3 -week submission rate and 6 -week in-calf rate were lower (P 0. 05) between quartile of milk protein percent.

Global positioning satellite (GPS) collars, remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) now {{make it easier to}} examine variation in use and selection by individuals. Resource selection functions, however, are commonly developed for global (all animals pooled) models and important information on individual variability may be lost. Using data from 14 female moose (Alces alces) collared in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area of northern British Columbia, we examined differences among global and individual resource selection models for 5 seasons (winter, <b>late</b> winter, <b>calving,</b> summer, and fall). The global models indicated that moose selected for mid-elevations, and for deciduous burns and Carex sedge areas in all seasons. Resource selection models for individuals, however, indicated that no individuals selected the same attributes as the global models. We also ex-amined selection ratios among seasons with individual moose as replicates, and within individuals with bootstrapping techniques. We discuss the importance of considering individual variation in defining resource selection and habitat use by moose and contrast the results of selection ratios and resource selection models.

40|$|In {{the current}} cow-calf {{production}} {{system in the}} United States when restricted breeding seasons are used a heifer must calve by two years of age to obtain maximum lifetime productivity. Heifers that reach puberty {{at a younger age}} and have ≥ 3 estrous cycles have a greater chance of conceiving early in their first breeding season than contemporaries. Due to the longer postpartum period of an estrus of first-calf cows calving at two years age, heifers that conceive early in the breeding season have a greater opportunity to initiate estrous cycles before the next breeding season and become pregnant. In contrast, heifers that do not reach puberty until after the breeding season starts, conceive later in the breeding season and subsequently calve later the following year. <b>Calving</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>calving</b> season increases the chances of heifers not becoming pregnant during the following breeding season and being lost from the herd. Therefore, age at puberty is an important reproductive trait in developing replacement heifers. Improved management practices and selection of reproductive traits have enhanced the physiological processes associated with attainment of puberty to maximize the number of heifers that reach puberty before the breeding season. Development of replacement heifers {{in the presence of a}} mature sterile bull is a management practice that decreases the age at which puberty is attained compared to heifers developed in the absence of a bull. However. increased selection pressure applied to age of puberty in heifers and the subsequent decrease in age at puberty has some disadvantages. Heifers reaching puberty and initiating estrous cycles at a young age while still suckling their dams are often exposed to fertile bulls during the darns breeding season or to intact male calves before weaning. Exposure to fertile bulls during this time period could result in heifers that become pregnant at a very young age and calve as yearlings. These heifers usually conceive late in the breeding season and <b>calve</b> <b>late</b> or after the normal calving season as yearlings. These heifers are of small body size which increases the chances of dystocia that sometimes results in loss of the calf and/or heifer, increased labor and time required for postpartum recovery. The combination of small body size and increased dystocia result in the majority of these animals failing to conceive during the following breeding season. Money invested in developing the heifer would be lost. In addition, precocious puberty in heifers that are destined to be sold as market animals results in heifers becoming pregnant prior to entering the feedlot. Pregnant feedlot heifers have decreased feed efficiency and growth rate compared to nonpregnant heifers which is a factor for lower prices paid by feedlots for heifers compared to steers. The research objectives were to determine the percentage of heifers developed at the University of Nebraska research station that exhibit precocious puberty and if exposure to bulls would affect the incidence of precocious puberty...|$|R
40|$|Black {{rhinoceros}} were translocated to the Addo Ele- phant National Park from Kenya {{and released}} {{into a small}} fenced enclosure. Serious fighting attributed to {{the conditions under which}} the animals were released, the unusually high population density, the meeting of strange animals, aggression associated with mating and individual temperament resulted in the deaths of three animals within three weeks. Later fighting between bulls accounted for two more animals. A peak in mating activity was recorded during spring to mid-summer, followed by a peak <b>calving</b> period in <b>late</b> summer. The <b>calving</b> interval (35 months) is longer than that of unrestricted populations but ages at first mating in cows (4 years 6 months, 4 years 7 months) are comparable.

40|$|AbstractParturition is a {{necessary}} event for production in dairy cattle, and assistance at calving is common. There is limited use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for the alleviation of calving pain and a paucity {{of research on the}} effects of these drugs on postpartum health and performance. This randomized triple blind clinical trial involved Holstein cows (n= 42) and heifers (n= 61) that experienced an assisted parturition. These animals received either 1 injection of meloxicam (0. 5 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo subcutaneously 24 h following calving. Outcome measures included dry matter intake (DMI) and milk production for the first 14 d in milk, blood metabolites sampled over 12 d, health events for the first 60 d in milk, as well as lying and feeding behavior 24 h following injection. Continuous data were analyzed using multivariable regression models. Binary outcomes were analyzed using a mixed logistic model with cow modeled using a random intercept. This study failed to show any significant effects of treatment on DMI, milk production, blood metabolites, or health events. A possible explanation for the lack of treatment differences could be that the meloxicam was administered too <b>late</b> after <b>calving.</b> Meloxicam increased feeding time as well as bunk visit frequency in the 24 h following injection. Regardless of treatment, animals that had retained fetal membranes produced less milk and had higher serum haptoglobin concentrations.

40|$|Intensive {{biological}} {{accounting methods}} {{were developed to}} measure the health and productivity of cow-calf herds surrounding a new sour gas processing plant. From the fall of 1991 through calving 1997, cow production records from all 7040 recorded bull contacts were examined from seven area cow-calf herds. Detailed information was also collected on other risk factors known to influence beef herd productivity. The median risks for non-pregnancy, abortion, <b>calving</b> <b>late,</b> stillbirth, and calf mortality for local herds {{did not differ from}} other published reports. There was no significant change in the risk of non-pregnancy, abortion, <b>calving</b> <b>late,</b> stillbirth, calf mortality, median calving date or crude weaning weight. Herd average age-adjusted weight for both male and female calves significantly improved. Total sulfation and H 2 S deposition data were used as markers for the complex mixture of compounds found in emissions from sour gas processing plants and sour flares. Cumulative exposure assessments were made from detailed records of individual animal movements between pastures. No consistent associations were found between either total sulfation or H 2 S deposition and productivity parameters across the three cow-calf production cycles examined. There were, however, five examples of associations between increasing exposure to total sulfation and decreased productivity in the 18 models examined for exposure beginning with first bull contact. The association between cow-calf productivity and cumulative animal proximity to petroleum field facilities and gas flared from oil and gas batteries was then examined. Increased risk of non-pregnancy was sometimes associated with exposure to {{one or more of the}} following facility types: sour flaring battery facilities, all battery flaring sites, active gas wells, and larger field facilities. The associations were not however, consistent among years or even among risk periods for the same year. Facility proximity and flaring were not associated with increased abortion risk. Volume of flared sour gas from battery sites was associated with increased risk of stillbirth. Finally, sour flaring was associated with increased calf mortality risk for the 1992 - 93 calf crop. Several examples of associations between exposure and increased productivity were also found in the analysis most of which involved either oil wells or all well sites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the effect of non-genetic factors on {{fertility}} in high-yielding Montbéliarde cows. The length of the rearing period for the Montbéliarde heifers in the herd analysed was found to depend on their origin and on the season in which they were born. Their average age at first calving was 908 days, with imported heifers calving for the first time on average 168 days later than native heifers. Heifers born in autumn months gave birth earliest, while those born from March to May <b>calved</b> <b>latest.</b> The acclimatization process may have negatively affected reproductive performance, as longer calving-to-first-service intervals (CFSI), service periods (SP), calving-to-conception intervals (CCI), and calving intervals (CI) were noted in the imported cows. Delayed first calving in heifers significantly increased the calving-to-first-service interval. In successive lactations a general downward trend was observed in the length of CFSI, SP, CCI and CI. Reproductive efficiency was significantly reduced by 305 -day milk yield exceeding 10 000 kg FPCM. Hence, in the case of record productivity in the Montbéliarde breed, as in Holstein-Friesians...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimated}} {{calving percentage}} of beef cattle is 62 % {{in the commercial}} sector of South Africa. Fertility {{is regarded as the}} main component influencing total herd efficiency in beef cattle. If the long calving seasons can be shortened and the calving percentage increased, more and heavier calves with a more uniform age can be weaned. Cows calving earlier in the season also have an extended “recovery period” and have the opportunity to calve in a better body condition during the next season, compared to cows <b>calving</b> <b>late</b> in the season.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe aspects of case study herds investigated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (DAFF) in which animal welfare incidents occurred and to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be monitored to enhance the Early Warning System (EWS). Despite an EWS being in place for a number of years, animal welfare incidents continue to occur. Questionnaires regarding welfare incidents were sent to Superintending Veterinary Inspectors (SVIs), resulting in 18 herds being chosen as case study herds, 12 of which had a clearly defined welfare incident date. For each study herd, data on six potential KPIs were extracted from DAFF databases. The KPIs for those herds with a clearly defined welfare incident date were studied for a consecutive four year window, with the fourth year being the 'incident year', when the welfare incident was disclosed. For study herds without a clearly defined welfare incident date, the KPIs were determined on a yearly basis between 2001 and 2009. Results We found that the <b>late</b> registration of <b>calves,</b> the use of on-farm burial as a method of carcase disposal, an increasing number of moves to knackeries over time and records of animals moved to 'herd unknown' were notable on the case farms.

30|$|In case of {{dry season}}, calves born in dry season were 2.21 and 3.50  kg heavier at weaning age than short rainy and main rainy season-born calves, {{respectively}} {{which might be}} {{due to the fact that}} dams <b>calved</b> during the <b>late</b> dry season <b>calves</b> exposed to the earlier part of the short rainy season and the coming main rainy season, when the availability of feed resources (grasses and browses) is abundant for prolonged period of time. The combinations of short rainy and main rainy season very often result in excess forage in both quantity and quality leading to high milk production of cows for calf consumption. Similar, higher WW of calves born in dry season than other seasons has also been reported (Ndofor-Foleng et al. 2011) for Gudali calves in Cameroon. This finding disagrees with other workers (Mekonnen et al. 2011; Melaku et al. 2011) who reported higher WW of calves born during the short rains. On the other hand, calves born during the main rains were heavier than those born in the dry and short rainy season by 3.69 and 2.91  kg at YW, respectively. Heavier YW for calves born during main rains might be attributed to the variation in the amount and distribution of rain fall between season that has influence on availability of feed production and performance of cows. This result is in agreement to a number of workers, who reported heavier live weight at yearling (Ebangi et al. 2002; Szabo et al. 2006; Ndofor-Foleng et al. 2011) for calves born during the main rains. Other studies, however, reported heavier YW (Aynalem 2006) for calves born during dry season.|$|R
40|$|The term “Early Weaning” {{tends to}} be used rather loosely in the Beef Industry, and {{producers}} can find many articles claiming benefits of early weaning. A few questions arise. How early is early weaning? Is there economic benefit to weaning early? We will address these questions in this paper. At the Range Beef Cow Symposium XIV, Whittier (1995) categorized early weaning as 1) weaning {{before the start of}} the breeding season (birth to 90 days) or 2) weaning during the breeding season (90 to 160 days). Weaning calves {{before the start of the}} breeding season has shown to improve reproductive performance of cattle during the year in which calves are weaned (Geary et al., 2006; Lusby et al., 1981). Improved reproduction can be due to removal of the sucking stimulus and/or from improved energy balance of the cattle. Cattle that are in marginal to thin body condition score at the start of breeding may benefit more than well conditioned cattle (Whittier, 1995). Weaning <b>calves</b> <b>late</b> in the breeding season likely will not yield any improvements in reproduction during the year in which calves are weaned. While calves can be weaned at 60 - 100 days, more intense calf management is necessary, making the practice unpractical for many producers. Recent worked out of Miles City, MT showed that calves weaned early at 80 days and put on a growing ration until herd-mates were weaned at about 215 days resulted in the early weaning system having significantly less net income than the normal weaning system (Waterman et al., 2006). Weaning towards the end of the breeding season, 120 - 160 days, is more practical and can have benefits in certain situations. This paper will focus on time of weaning calves from 120 days and beyond...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} {{and patterns of}} bacterial isolates, cultures were made from the dry mammary glands of dairy cows in six commercial dairy herds in the UK. Milk samples were taken from all four quarters of 480 cows at drying off and at weekly intervals from 14 days before to seven days after calving. A major mastitis pathogen was isolated from at least one quarter of 220 (45. 8 per cent) of the cows and {{from more than one}} quarter of 90 (18. 8 per cent) of them. During the <b>late</b> dry to <b>calving</b> period, of the 957 quarters with three culture results, a major mastitis pathogen was cultured from 236 (24. 7 per cent) quarters of 186 (88. 8 per cent) cows. The most commonly isolated major pathogen was Escherichia coli, followed by Streptococcus uberis and coagulase-positive staphylococci. There were significant differences between the patterns of isolates from different farms and in different calving months, suggesting that the rate of infection was partially dependent on external conditions. The isolation of E coli, S uberis or coagulase-positive staphylococci from a cow during the late dry/periparturient period was associated with an increased risk of that cow being culled in the next lactation. Bayesian general linear mixed models were used to assess the associations between the different bacterial species. The probability of isolating either E coli or S uberis was significantly greater when the other organism was cultured in a milk sample; this was also true of coagulase-positive staphylococci and S uberis. When Corynebacterium, species were isolated from a milk sample, the probability of isolating coagulase-positive staphylococci or S uberis decreased significantly, and when coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated the probability of isolating coagulase-positive staphylococci was reduced...|$|R
40|$|Our goal at Deseret Land and Livestock is to {{maximize}} long-term profit. Our profit {{is a function}} of the following factors: the prices we receive for our production, our amount of production, the costs of production, and the productive capabilities of our land and labor. Prices, production, and cost are managed on an annual basis. The long-term outcome of one’s management is determined by their attention and skill in enhancing the capability of land and labor. These factors of profit can vary tremendously within and between years. For example, prices for 400 - 500 pound steer calves from 1979 - 1989 varied nearly $. 58 /pound over the period and on average the prices varied $. 17 /pound within any given year during this time, with a maximum within year difference of $. 26 /pound (Cattle-Fax 1991). Our range forage production has varied in the same 10 year period from less than two weeks of active growth to over three months. Finally fuel and interest on borrowed money costs have oscillated dramatically over this same period with all costs tending to increase. The tremendous variability of both the biological and financial environments in which ranchers do business make it a very high risk business. No single fixed strategy, no matter how good, will maximize long-term profitability. We believe that in this type of business environment the key to success is to have the flexibility to adapt. We <b>calve</b> <b>late</b> because it provides us with the best fit between the cattle’s nutritional requirements over their production cycle and the ranch’s naturally produced forage. This match has helped us become a low cost operation, has reduced our susceptibility to inflationary pressures on cost, has increased our production, and has broadened our marketing opportunities. Over the last twelve years, we decreased our total cost per pound of calf produced from over $. 90 to $. 62. We have gone from a cow/calf operation to a cow/calf/yearling operation. Finally we now look for marketing opportunities year-round instead of having to sell the calves each fall...|$|R
40|$|Profitability of calf {{production}} can be greatly increased by improvements in reproductive efficiency. Losses in income {{are associated with}} nonpregnant cows, calves that are born <b>late</b> in the <b>calving</b> season and death of calves at birth. Too many heifers and cows exposed to bulls during a breeding season do not become pregnant and wean a calf the next year. A major reason for the inefficiency is that cows are not pregnant {{at the end of}} breeding because many have not been in estrus and bred by the bulls. In addition, some cows do not start estrous cycles until late in the breeding season, so if they become pregnant calves will be born late the next year. Calves lost at birth are usually associated with difficult or delayed parturition. Two major factors that regulate reproductive performance of beef cows are nutrition and suckling. Nutrient intake influences body energy stores. Body energy stores can be mobilized when a cow receives less than the required amounts of nutrients during pregnancy or lactation. Body fat stores regulate the secretion of hypothalamic (brain) and pituitary hormones to control the functions of the ovary. If cows are too thin at calving, the hormonal signals necessary to stimulate the ovary and start estrous cycles are not released and cows don 2 ̆ 7 t exhibit heat until late in the breeding season, or not at all. The suckling stimulus also delays the release of hormones necessary for the reinitiation of estrous cycles after calving. Cows that lose their calves at birth usually come into heat sooner than cows with suckling calves. Under range conditions we need to utilize cows to convert forage to milk for growth of calves. There are few management options {{that can be used to}} increase reproductive performance by altering suckling. The practical approach to increase pregnancy rate, and time during the breeding season that cows become pregnant, is by strategic use of supplemental feeding during pregnancy...|$|R
