5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E
5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} several missions that the player has to complete while fighting enemies and completing objectives. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to exploring areas and recovering items such as keycards, explosives or <b>laptop</b> <b>computers,</b> which are useful to hack into electronic devices. The player can pick up new weapons, health and ammunition dropped by enemies if necessary. The game also features several mini-games, including a driving level and a sniper mission, as well as numerous boss battles that the player has to defeat in order to progress through the next level. By beating any of these mini-games, the player can access them in the game's extras menu.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch of Windows 8, several {{important}} updates caused problems for some installations of Windows 8 on <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> Some users {{were not able to}} install update KB2756872 unless they rebooted in safe mode and uninstalled audio drivers. Microsoft provided troubleshooting instructions that apparently were initially not easily accessible to many users. For updates KB2769165 and KB2770917, which caused similar issues on some <b>laptop</b> <b>computers,</b> Microsoft did not immediately release workarounds.|$|E
