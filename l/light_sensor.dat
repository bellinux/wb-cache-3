25|$|The smartwatch {{comes with}} a Gorilla Glass 64-color e-paper {{always-on}} display developed by JDI with 144x168 resolution and has a pixel density of 182ppi. This is the first Pebble smartwatch to have a color display, and still retains a LED backlight as well. The watch also has a vibrating motor for silent alarms, and smart notifications. The watch {{comes with a}} redesigned charging cable that, like its predecessor's cable, magnetically attaches itself to the watch {{in order to maintain}} its water resistance. Unlike its predecessor, the cable attaches {{to the back of the}} watch rather than the side, and has the potential to transfer data rather than just power. The band attaches with standard 22mm pins. The watch is also equipped with an ambient <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> and 6 axis accelerometer.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} of the Foveon X3 sensor {{is quite different from}} that of the Bayer filter image sensor more commonly used in digital cameras. In the Bayer sensor, each photosite in the array consists of a single <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> (either CMOS or CCD) that, as a result of filtration, is exposed to only one of the three primary colors, red, green, or blue. Constructing a full color image from a Bayer sensor requires demosaicing, an interpolative process in which the output pixel associated with each photosite is assigned an RGB value based in part on the level of red, green, and blue reported by those photosites adjacent to it. The Foveon X3 sensor creates its RGB color output for each photosite by combining the outputs of each of the stacked photodiodes at each of its photosites. This operational difference results in several significant consequences.|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of {{the capabilities of the}} Mica mote <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> is currently limited. To determine how much information data from the <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> reveals about the environment, we performed a series of experiments designed to test the sensitivity of the <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> to the time of day, the presence/absence of close objects, and different colors. Measuring the ambient light alone, we discovered that the <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> can provide an approximate gauge of the time of day (i. e., morning, noon, evening). Depending on the object size, there is a definite range within which an object’s presence can be detected by the sensor motes. Beyond that range, the object cannot be clearly detected. The <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> can also distinguish between different colored environments. Finally, using a six-sided sensor, we can determine the direction of a light source. We discuss these findings in this paper, as well as the limitations of the mote <b>light</b> <b>sensors.</b> 1...|$|R

Externally, the fourth-generation iPad is identical to its predecessor apart from the differences between dock connectors used and change of manufacturers that produce the display. In addition, the Wi-Fi only version weighs 652 grams while the cellular model weighs 662 grams– 2 grams heavier than their respective predecessors.
