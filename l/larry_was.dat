5|$|Larry drifted {{across the}} Isthmus of Tehuantepec, {{dropping}} heavy rainfall of over 9in (229mm) in places. The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides, causing damage {{to thousands of}} houses. The flooding killed five people and resulted in $53.6million (2003USD) in damage. <b>Larry</b> <b>was</b> one of three tropical cyclones to hit Mexico {{in a short period}} of time, including Tropical Depression Nora and Tropical Storm Olaf in the eastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Larry</b> <b>was</b> {{the twelfth}} {{tropical}} storm in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{was one of}} eight storms to impact Mexico from either the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans in the season, a near-record. Larry formed in early October from an extratropical storm in the Bay of Campeche, and reached a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h). Due to weak steering currents, the storm moved southward, {{which resulted in the}} storm hitting the Tabasco coastline. The storm was the first Tabascan landfall since Tropical Storm Brenda in 1973.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday morning, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as {{a result}} of an {{apparent}} murder-suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio. Roger was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, but died shortly after. Larry's body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene. There were no witnesses at the time, and Larry's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear; however, there were increasingly large troubles over money surrounding Larry who managed the family-run housing company, Troutman Enterprises. The business filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, owing $400,000 in delinquent taxes. <b>Larry</b> <b>was</b> also possibly angry over Roger firing him as manager for his music career, of which Larry had been for several years.|$|E

5|$|The play first premiered at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia on April 6, 1808. In Barker's {{letter to}} Dunlop, he writes the {{performance}} was {{done as a}} benefit for Mr. Bray (who also {{played the role of}} Walter). However, other sources suggest it was a benefit for a Mrs. Woodham. In any case, {{it is clear that the}} performance was interrupted by an offstage commotion which may have cut the performance short. Mr. Webster, a tenor who played the role of <b>Larry,</b> <b>was</b> an object of public scorn at the time because of his effeminate manner and dress, and audience members rioted in outrage at his participation, causing Barker himself to order the curtain to be dropped. The play was subsequently performed again in Philadelphia on February 1, 1809, although it was advertised for January 25.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Larry</b> <b>was</b> one {{of eight}} storms to hit Mexico from either the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, the highest since the record of nine in 1971. The National Hurricane Center {{expected}} the storm to produce a storm surge of 3 to 5feet (.9 to 1.5m), with high waves on top, though no official surge readings were reported. The highest recorded winds on land were 59mph (95km/h) in El Alacrán in Tabasco. The worst of Larry's effects came from its rainfall, peaking at 24.77inches (629.2mm) in Upper Juarez in southeastern Mexico.

Marge discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon their plot, but as they leave the house, they are spotted.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Eve, Edgeworth {{is arrested}} {{for the murder}} of {{attorney}} Robert Hammond. He initially refuses Phoenix's help, but ultimately relents. Manfred Von Karma, Edgeworth's mentor, has himself appointed as a special prosecutor. After Phoenix learns that another man, Yanni Yogi, shot Hammond, he discovers that Von Karma provided him with the gun. Years earlier, Edgeworth's father, Gregory, convinced a judge to penalize Von Karma for misconduct, ruining his spotless record. Unable to deal with such a blemish on his legacy, Von Karma murdered Gregory in cold blood, leaving Edgeworth to believe himself responsible. Phoenix explains that Edgeworth motivated him to become an attorney: When a young Phoenix was accused of stealing money (a crime for which <b>Larry</b> <b>was</b> the true culprit), Edgeworth persuaded his teacher not to punish him. Following his father's murder, however, Edgeworth, motivated by a hatred of criminals, decided to become Von Karma's pupil instead. After Von Karma suffers a breakdown in court and confesses to the cover-up, Edgeworth is set free. Nevertheless, he decides to rethink whether or not he should resume his previous duties. Meanwhile, Maya, who had been acting as Phoenix's assistant, announces that she will be returning to her home village to finish her training as a spirit medium.|$|E

25|$|The Stooges {{attempted}} to make a final film in 1969, Kook's Tour, which was essentially a documentary of Howard, Larry, and Curly-Joe out of character, touring the US, and meeting with fans. But production abruptly halted when on January 9, 1970, Larry suffered a major stroke during filming, paralyzing {{the left side of}} his body. He died on January 24, 1975, at age 72. Enough footage of <b>Larry</b> <b>was</b> shot so that Kook's Tour was eventually released in a 52-minute version to home video.
