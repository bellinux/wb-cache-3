40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} effort specifically examines {{perceptions of}} workplace motivation in Japan between employees and managers while highlighting {{results that are}} somewhat counter-intuitive to the traditional western perception of Japanese ethnography. Specifically, we find some evidence for a potentially shifting movement toward a self-orientation with more emphasis on <b>lifetime</b> <b>employability</b> over lifetime employment. During a period when incremental efficiencies are arguably {{more important than ever}} for the Japanese economy, practitioners therein stand to maintain the highest level of productivity by better understanding exactly how workforce motivation is currently evolving rather than relying on potentially dated assumptions. Specifically this effort advances cross cultural management studies by blending insight from past American research and theory with current research on Japan – which allows the additional benefit of comparing traditional Japanese cultural platforms to potentially more modern, dynamic realities. In partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers Global Human Resource Solutions, a survey was undertaken in the metropolitan Tokyo area that examined motivation of the Japanese worker using the two-factor Herzberg model, which seems to be valid in Japan. The study indicates {{that there has been a}} movement from a more traditional, collective/company orientation toward more self-orientation. The study also demonstrates that Japanese managers seem to have an acceptable understanding of what motivates employees but that there is still room for improvement.

40|$|The {{demands of}} a rapidly {{changing}} future on learners of Higher Education Institutions {{who need to be}} effectively employed, necessitate that these institutions become responsive to the demands and challenges of the future world of work. Employers keep on emphasising that first entry employees not only lack basic skills when entering the world of work, but that they also have difficulty in coping with the accelerated nature of the changing future. In order to address this dilemma, this research firstly focussed on the current state of Academic Development programmes at universities and technikons in South Africa, because these programmes claim to address problems which learners and the institutions might have, such as the support of teaching policies and procedures, quality assurance and advisory services. The documenting of the current state of academic development (AD) revealed that AD of learners focusses on issues such as access, redress, academic performance and throughput. These endeavours constitute a model where remedial, supportive work is done in fragmented fashion, to enable learners to attain the necessary skills to cope with the demands of higher education. It was further indicated that by adopting this aim for AD, higher education is not proactively responsive {{to the needs of the}} future world of work, but rather reactive to the immediate needs of learners and institutions alike. They focus on better results in stead of <b>lifetime</b> <b>employability.</b> A causal action research phase followed to identify what the demands of the future are for man, and to assess the current state of academic development of learners against these demands. The conclusion is that these demands constitute a total paradigm shift and that higher education is not responsive to these challenges. In order for learners to pursue <b>lifetime</b> <b>employability,</b> a totally new, reengineering AD-model should therefore be constructed. It is concluded that only through maximising human potential, which can be attained through facilitating lifelong learning, will leamers be able to meet the challenging demands of the future world of work. This reengineering AD-model contains the guiding idea or purpose and vision of the model namely that it should maximise human potential. It contains the theory, methods and tools, represented in the development of intra-, inter- and supra-personal relationships through facilitating metal earning and cooperative learning, and it contains innovations for the infrastructure to encompass whole institutions. Recommendations for future research fall in two categories, namely the future as source of research, and future research still to be undertaken. In terms of the future as source of research, ongoing research is needed by researchers all over the world to determine what the future holds in store. Regarding the proposed AD-model, future research still needs to be undertaken with regard to the implementation and ongoing reengineering of the model.

40|$|During the {{recession}} of the early 1980 s, the United States experienced a massive industrial downturn. More than 3 million blue-collar jobs permanently vanished from the economic landscape, altering the structure and availability of once-viable career paths. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} project was to learn about the experiences of {{the sons and daughters of}} blue-collar workers who cannot follow in their parents 2 ̆ 7 footsteps, but instead must transition into careers in a postindustrial economy. Guided by life course theory, I interviewed 62 people [...] -sons, daughters, fathers, and mothers [...] -to determine how family-based communication about work and career both helped and hindered one cohort of 2 ̆ 2 blue-collar kids 2 ̆ 2 in their career transitions. ^ The research consisted of two phases, an archival phase and an interview phase. The archival research traced events of {{the recession}} (1979 - 1982), particularly as they related to industrial downturn in a small Michigan mining community. The interview-based research phase delved into the life courses of a cohort of individuals who came of age during that particular period of economic downturn. These individuals 2 ̆ 7 (and their parents 2 ̆ 7) work histories, family messages about work and career, and career and class identities, reveal several important insights into postindustrial career transitions. ^ First, the 2 ̆ 2 kids 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 and parents 2 ̆ 7 constructions of periods of economic downturn serve several notable purposes, including destigmatizing the experience of job loss, offering a viable model of <b>lifetime</b> <b>employability,</b> and backgrounding the politics of economic downturns. Second, family-based messages about work and career do not occur in straightforward, unambiguous memorable messages. Instead, communication about these issues [...] -and ultimately communication about social class mobility and reproduction [...] -emerges and comes to be understood through relational dialectics. Third, this cohort simultaneously must reconcile competing tensions between two macrolevel discourses that dictate, to an extent, how careers should unfold. On one hand, blue-collar kids are driven by the social mobility mandates of the American Dream and, on the other hand, are committed to upholding the values-based obligations of the Working Class Promise. ^ The findings contribute to the literature on organizational socialization, family communication, and career identities. The findings also are suggestive of several interventions for communities facing deindustrialization. ...|$|E
40|$|Superplastic forming (SPF) is an {{advanced}} sheet manufacturing process typically restricted to low volume and high value products. SPF ceramic dies {{have a lower}} production cost than conventional metal tools, and have short lead-times, but their brittle nature is a limiting factor for SPF applications. Suitable surface treatments have a remarkable effect on wear resistance; hence, {{the scope of the}} research is to investigate a suitable coating solution to improve the working surface wear resistance, increasing the lifetime of the SPF ceramic dies. The research is currently focused on the evaluation of a range of coatings for ceramic dies under SPF conditions. The initial trials are in curse using a previously developed test protocol on laboratory scale dies (Staiano et al., 2014). Depending on the resulting coating protection properties, the research project will move into trials under production conditions in a 200 tonn SPF press, or in the optimisation of the coating deposition procedure. The aim of the research is to improve ceramic die <b>lifetime,</b> enabling their <b>employability</b> in hot forming processes...|$|R
