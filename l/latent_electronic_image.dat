5000|$|Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS): a {{national}} automated fingerprint identification and criminal history system {{maintained by the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System provides automated fingerprint search capabilities, <b>latent</b> searching capability, <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> storage, and <b>electronic</b> exchange of fingerprints and responses.

Fingerprints are voluntarily submitted to the FBI by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.

40|$|Abstract. Focused on {{instantaneous}} {{translation of}} image sequences and rotation instability problem {{caused by the}} flight status of the aerial photography process, this paper proposes a dual-mode stabilization method based {{on a combination of}} inertial stability and <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> stabilization. Among them, this paper uses the improved algorithm based on affine transformation model against the traditional <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> stabilization which is more difficult to adapt to the shortcomings of the rotation changes based on planar motion model. The algorithm can not only accurately describe the changes in the image sequence, but also effectively eliminate the interference of the rotation, jitter, etc. Experimental results show the method can improve the accuracy of image stabilization and reduce <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> stabilization processing time, which has broad application prospects in the military and civilian fields...|$|R

30|$|An {{optical image}} was {{obtained}} by a microscope (Leica DM 4500 P) from which a reflected image of a polished coke pellet is converted to an <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> through a camera. The amplitude of the electrical pulses of the <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> {{is a function of}} the light intensities of grey levels, determined by the reflectance of the different phases in the optical image. An analogue of the <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> is transmitted to a discriminator, which contains a densitometer where the image is divided into a matrix of approximately 400, 000 picture points on a hexagonal point raster. Each of these points consists of an electrical signal. The densitometer divides the amplitudes of the electrical signal into intervals of grey level bands on a grey scale with 100 intervals. The grey spectrum is adjustable according to the brightness of the image. Operations such as stage movement, data processing, measurement of variable field data are done automatically (Fig.  3 b).|$|R

50|$|Real-time digital <b>image</b> {{stabilization}}—also called <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> stabilization (EIS) -- {{is used in}} {{some video}} cameras. This technique shifts the <b>electronic</b> <b>image</b> from frame to frame of video, enough to counteract the motion. It uses pixels outside {{the border of the}} visible frame to provide a buffer for the motion. This technique reduces distracting vibrations from videos by smoothing the transition from one frame to another. This technique does not affect the noise level of the image, except in the extreme borders when the image is extrapolated. It cannot do anything about existing motion blur, which may result in an image seemingly losing focus as motion is compensated.|$|R
