[...] However, the ninth person in the Jerusalem Post article was actually John Paulson, and Carl Ichan name was not in the list. In her response Guity Novin wrote on her blog: [...] "I admit that I have many Jewish friends who do like my works, but the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>checked</b> this was not illegal.

5000|$|The {{suspended}} Sierra then {{contacted the}} American Civil Liberties Union, {{who agreed to}} take up her cause. The issue was considered settled after a meeting between Sierra, the ACLU, Sierra's mother and Mann, until {{a meeting of the}} school's board of education on October 29, the day of Sierra's return to school. The meeting discussed the events of the previous week, and some board members were initially sympathetic to Sierra. However, comments turned hostile {{towards the end of the}} meeting, with Sierra being told [...] "this isn't something funny or cute…you're talking about overthrowing the government", and having her actions characterized as [...] "like you stood up and waved a Japanese flag on Pearl Harbor day". In reference to Sierra, president of the board Bill Raglin asked [...] "what the hell is wrong with a kid like that?" [...] and board member John Luoni accused Sierra of committing treason. Sierra fled the meeting in tears. The following day, The Charleston Gazette published comments by Mann to the effect that the messages on Sierra's T-shirts included [...] "I hope Afghanistan wins" [...] and [...] "America should burn."; Mann later claimed he had been misquoted, and that he had taken his information from Jacob Reed. Students spat on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school. Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school; the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town. Sierra voiced her belief that people at Sissonville High were permitted to talk about how they felt about certain things, so long as there were others who agreed with them. She denied being anti-American, and that anarchism implies support for terrorism, countering that it is an anti-authoritarian and non-violent philosophy. As like any war I think it's wrong. I don't believe in fighting and <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>checked</b> war is included. I don't know or have an answer for the war, but I do know that killing people is not right.

His major hip hop music recording career began in 2008 {{with the release of}} the album Definition produced by Pajozo featuring Kanye West' artist KiD CuDi. The album was released to critical acclaim with over 26,300 downloads. His popularity increased after the single release [...] "Take Em High" [...] went viral and led to him being contacted by an A&R from Steve Rifkin SRC Records, a division of Universal Music Group. He started ghost writing and referencing music for several recording artist while creating his own albums. Receiving numerous beat productions from Bad Boy Records Producer EZ Elpee, K.

Sparks to a recording contract with IODA, a division of Sony Music to record and release his album entitled Hip Hop 101. He further cemented his work ethic with a weekly series Manic Mondays in which he recorded and released a new original song every Monday for an entire year. After years of securing music placements, he signed a recording contract with Fat Beats Records to release his album Tomorrow Today produced by Pajozo, released April 5, 2011 featuring Warner Bros recoding artist Sabina Ddumba. The album received critical acclaim and was the first album reviewed by Dead End Hip Hop. The album further received 4/5 spins from DJ Booth staff writer Nathan S stating [...] "Now, more than ever, the correlation between being signed and making dope music, which the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>checked</b> was the actual point of all of this, is tenuous at best.

40|$|In 2014, Jonathan Zimmerman {{published}} an op-ed in the Christian Science Monitor {{in which he}} wrote, “The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>checked,</b> [men] held most of the important positions of power and influence in American society. And yet, college admissions offices lower the standard for young men—effectively raising it for women—simply {{to make sure that}} the men keep coming. ” This comment was not surprising as, seven years earlier, the U. S. News 2 ̆ 6 World Report had published “Many Colleges Reject Women at Higher Rates Than For Men,” in which Alex Kingsbury memorably asserted: Using undergraduate admissions rate data collected from more than 1, 400 four-year colleges and universities that participate in the magazine’s rankings, U. S. News has found that over the past 10 years many schools are maintaining their gender balance by admitting men and women at sometimes drastically different rates. The schools that are most competitive—Harvard, Duke, and Rice for example—have so many applicants and so many high achievers that they naturally maintain balanced student bodies by skimming the cream of the crop. But in the tier of selective colleges just below them, maintaining gender equity on some campuses appears to require a thumb on the scale in favor of boys. It’s at these schools, including Pomona, Boston College, Wesleyan University, Tufts, and the College of William and Mary, that the gap in admit rates is particularly acute...|$|E
40|$|Renewable sources will be {{the future}} of energy {{production}} for the United States. Clean sources of energy like wind and solar have been the topic of conversation for quite some time, and now they’re starting to show their ability to compete economically with fossil fuels. Even as {{renewable sources of energy}} begin to show their gusto, they are still a part of a relatively new industry and new industries always need a little help getting off the ground. There are some forms of aid being provided for renewable sources of energy, like the production tax credit or PTCs, where the federal government provides a little help to renewable energy producers, but this is nothing in comparison to the billions being spent on fossil fuel subsidies. This does not even begin {{to take into account the}} negative impacts that fossil fuels have on our planet. The idea of a subsidy is to give a little extra boost to benefit an industry that appears to be at a disadvantage. This is a great idea when used correctly, but <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>checked,</b> the fossil fuel industry is one of the most profitable industries in the world. That hardly sounds disadvantaged to me. When profitable industries are allowed to reap the benefits of tax breaks, they will just continue to increase profits with federal subsidies as their security blanket. A major reason renewable energy producers are having a hard time catching a larger portion of the market is because they’re competing against highly subsidized fossil fuel prices while they themselves are not receiving the help that a budding industry deserves. Clean energy incentives are typically set and revaluated in 10 -year increments while fossil fuel subsidies have been written into the tax code with no expiration date. Intangible drilling cost credits are an example of a subsidy that has been around since the early stages of oil well drilling in 1913. This subsidy, which still exists today, basically pays oil producers to drill new wells even if the well may not produce any oil. Since incentives for renewable production are not permanent, they are not as appealing to investors because there is less certainty the federal assistance {{will be the}}re in coming years. This is the opposite case for fossil fuel industries where investors know the subsidies will still be there for the entirety of their investment, which makes for a much safer bet. If renewable subsidies are given a longer lifespan, investors would be more comfortable making those investments and the money would begin to pour in. These subsidies on high emission fossil fuels will only increase our reliance on dirty sources of energy and make it much more difficult to transition to a low emission society. Politicians continue to say they want a clean, low emission America, but continue to encourage and literally pay for dirty sources of energy while putting renewables and the well being of future generations on the back burner. According to a 2013 study by World Development, if global fossil fuel subsidies were cut, there would be a 21 % reduction in global carbon emissions leading to a 55 % reduction in fossil fuel pollution related deaths. This alone is reason enough for the United States to begin phasing out fossil fuel subsides and set the standard for the rest of the world to follow. The big problem that is faced when fossil fuel subsidies are cut is the loss of jobs in the industry. This problem can be solved by subsidizing other industries if they choose to build new infrastructure and create jobs in areas negatively affected by the loss of fossil fuel related jobs. This will lead to sustainable economic growth in areas that previously relied on one industry for a majority of their employment. If we continue to spin our tires and subsidize irresponsible energy practices, clean and renewable energy will continue to be a secondary fuel source and there will be no incentive to innovate. The world is changing its views on energy and how it impacts the health of our planet, so it’s about time the United States got up to speed and accepted the fact fossil fuels aren’t the answer to our long-term energy demands...|$|E
