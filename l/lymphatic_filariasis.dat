The two other filarial causes of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia timori, which both differ from B. malayi morphologically, symptomatically, and in geographical extent.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> is {{also known}} as elephantiasis. There are {{approximately}} 120 million individuals infected and 40 million with deformities.

[...] <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> has lifelong implications, such as lymphoedema of the limbs, genital disease, and painful recurrent attacks. Most people are asymptomatic, but have lymphatic damage. Up to 40 percent of infected individuals have kidney damage. It is a vector-borne disease, caused by nematode worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes.|$|E

50|$|Treatments for <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> differ {{depending}} on the geographic location of the endemic area. In sub-Saharan Africa, albendazole is being used with ivermectin to treat the disease, whereas elsewhere in the world, albendazole is used with diethylcarbamazine.

5000|$|<b>Lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> is an {{infection}} of the lymph system by mosquito-borne microfilarial worms which can cause elephantiasis. Studies have demonstrated that transmission of the infection can be broken when a single dose of combined oral medicines is consistently maintained annually for approximately seven years. The strategy for eliminating transmission of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> is mass distribution of medicines that kill the microfilariae and stop transmission of the parasite by mosquitoes in endemic communities. In sub-Saharan Africa, albendazole is being used with ivermectin to treat the disease, whereas {{elsewhere in the world}} albendazole is used with diethylcarbamazine. Using a combination of treatments better reduces the number of microfilariae in blood. Avoiding mosquito bites, such as by using insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets, also reduces the transmission of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis.</b> [...] In the Americas, >90% of the burden of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> is on the island of Hispaniola (comprising Haiti and the Dominican Republic). An elimination effort to address this is currently under way alongside the malaria effort described above; the Dominican Republic expects to eliminate its seven remaining foci by 2010, but <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> is still endemic to 110 of 140 communes in Haiti.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> {{is thought}} to have {{affected}} humans for about 4000 years. Artifacts from ancient Egypt (2000 BC) and the Nok civilization in West Africa (500 BC) show possible elephantiasis symptoms. The first clear reference to the disease occurs in ancient Greek literature, wherein scholars differentiated the often similar symptoms of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> from those of leprosy.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection is often observed with <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis.</b> Rigorous hygiene practices, including washing {{with soap and}} water daily and disinfecting wounds can help heal infected surfaces, and slow and potentially reverse existing tissue damage. Promoting hygiene is essential for <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> patients given the compromised immune and damaged lymphatic systems and can help prevent suffering and disability.|$|E
50|$|GSK {{has been}} active, with the World Health Organization (WHO), in the Global Alliance to Eliminate <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>Filariasis</b> (GAELF). Around 120 million people {{globally}} {{are believed to}} be infected with <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis.</b> In 2012 the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400 million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600 million albendazole tablets every year for <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> until the disease is eradicated. As of 2014 over 5 billion treatments had been delivered, and 18 of 73 countries in which the disease is considered endemic had progressed to the surveillance stage.|$|E

5000|$|Wuchereria bancrofti {{is a human}} {{parasitic}} roundworm that is {{the major}} cause of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis.</b> It {{is one of the}} three parasitic worms, together with Brugia malayi and B. timori, that infect the lymphatic system to cause <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis.</b> These filarial worms are spread by a variety of mosquito vector species. W. bancrofti is the most prevalent of the three and affects over 120 million people, primarily in Central Africa and the Nile delta, South and Central America, the tropical regions of Asia including southern China, and the Pacific islands. If left untreated, the infection can develop into a chronic disease called elephantiasis. [...] In rare conditions it also causes tropical eosinophilia, an asthmatic disease. There is no commercially available vaccine however high rates of cure have been achieved with various anti-filarial regimens and <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> is the target of the WHO Global Program to Eliminate <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>Filariasis</b> with the aim to eradicate the disease as a public health problem by 2020.|$|E

5000|$|Vector {{control has}} been {{effective}} in virtually eliminating <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> in some regions, but vector control combined with chemotherapy produces the best results. It is suggested that 11-12 years of effective vector control may eliminate <b>lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis.</b> [...] Successful methods of B. malayi vector control include residual house spraying using DDT and insecticide treated bednets. Mansonia larvae attach their breathing tubes to underwater roots and plants in order to survive. While chemical larvicides have only provided partial control, plant removal would prevent vector development, but would have potential adverse effects on the aquatic environment. <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>filariasis</b> vector control is neglected {{in comparison to the}} far more established efforts to control malaria and dengue vectors. Integrated vector control methods should be applied in areas where the same mosquito species is responsible for transmitting multiple pathogens.|$|E
