500|$|Historian Hugh Ross {{argued that}} in gaining the nomination, Willkie [...] "gave {{exceptional}} promise of being a winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party, queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership in order to entrust its political fortunes to a man without political experience. [...] In most of the previous instances, the nomination {{had gone to a}} military man. In 1940, it went to a businessman." [...] Richard Moe, in his book on the 1940 election, suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long-lasting scars on the Republican Party, with conservatives angered by the success of its Eastern Establishment wing; [...] "whatever else it did, Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party, one accentuated by ideology and geography, that would define the party for decades to come." [...] Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie's oratory, and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan, was Gerald R. Ford, who wrote many years later in his memoirs, [...] "I now realize that my participation did not make much difference at all to the political fate of Wendell Willkie. But it made a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> to me." ...|$|E

At the age of 19, he left the seminary due to sheer frustration because he was appalled that the rectors ate better food and sat at higher tables than the seminarians. He later confessed that, [...] "I was disillusioned, because there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> between precept and practice where the Church was concerned." [...] He began work at the age of 19, organising exploited workers in the road transport industry and in the hotels and restaurants in Mangalore.|$|E
2500|$|On December 20, 1996, A {{head coach}} R. C. Slocum {{promoted}} Sherman to offensive coordinator to replace dismissed Steve Ensminger. Months later, Sherman resigned {{to start his}} professional coaching career as the assistant offensive line and tight ends coach for the Green Bay Packers. When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: [...] "There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A for and only one professional job that I've ever had any interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers. I've enjoyed the small-town atmosphere of College Station for my family, and Green Bay offers that same atmosphere. If the truth be told, {{there is not a}} whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> between an `Aggie' and a `Cheesehead." [...] He served the position for the 199798 seasons. After Packers head coach Mike Holmgren resigned to accept the Seattle Seahawks head coach position, Holmgren hired Sherman to become the offensive coordinator for the 1999 season.|$|E

2500|$|While Dillon and Miss Kitty {{clearly had}} a close {{personal}} relationship, the two never married. In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, [...] "If they were man and wife, {{it would make a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>difference.</b> The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with." [...] In the episode [...] "Waste", featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist [...] "at the law's discretion" [...] (meaning the marshal's). As an historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS' Green Acres).|$|E

Alternative Press states that Williams [...] "has more charisma than singers twice her age, and her band aren't far behind in their chops, either." [...] Singer-songwriter John Mayer had praised Williams' voice in a blog in October 2007, calling her [...] "The great orange hope"; [...] "orange" [...] in reference to her hair color. Due to the female fronted aspect of the band, Paramore has gained comparisons to Kelly Clarkson and the aforementioned Avril Lavigne, to which one reviewer said was [...] "sorely unfounded." [...] Reviewer Jonathan Bradley noted that [...] "Paramore attacks its music with infectious enthusiasm." [...] However, he also explained that [...] "there isn't a whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> between Riot! and the songs from Kelly Clarkson or Avril Lavigne." [...] A reviewer at NME had likened Paramore's sound to that of [...] "No Doubt (stripped of all the ska bollocks)" [...] and [...] "Kelly Clarkson's wildest dreams." [...] Hayley Williams {{has gone on to}} comment about the female aspect of the band saying that Paramore is not [...] "this girl-fronted band" [...] and it makes [...] "music for people to enjoy music, not so people can talk about my sexuality." ...|$|E
