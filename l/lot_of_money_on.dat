However, the two soon resume their relationship with each other. Furthermore, Anna's opinion of Shuichi presenting as female also changes, she saying that it actually suits Shuichi, and the two even go out together on a date with Shuichi dressed as a girl.

She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible.

500|$|The Beatles' first Hamburg {{residency}} {{took place}} in 1960, with Lennon writing frequent and passionate letters back home to Powell. After returning home, Lennon's aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith, threw a hand-mirror at him for spending a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> a suede coat for Powell. Smith later referred to her as [...] "a gangster's moll", and was often unpleasant towards her. The Beatles went to Hamburg {{for a second time}} in 1961, and both Powell and Dot Rhone (Paul McCartney's girlfriend at the time), visited them two weeks later, during the Easter holidays. They had to stay up all night because of the long sets, both taking Preludin to stay awake, which the group was also taking. Lennon and Powell stayed with Sutcliffe's girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, at her mother's house. After the trip to Hamburg, Powell's mother Lillian said Powell's cousin and husband were emigrating to Canada with their new-born baby, and that she, Lillian, would be going with them while they studied to become teachers. Powell waited until Lennon came back from Hamburg before she asked Smith—who had taken in lodgers before at 251 Menlove Avenue—if she would rent a room to her. Smith rented out the box-room above the front door (which had been Lennon's bedroom), but insisted she also do chores around the house. To pay the rent, she took a job at a Woolworths store in Liverpool, after her student grant had run out. In the same year, when Lennon was 21 years old, he received £100 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). from his aunt Mater who lived in Edinburgh, and went to Paris with McCartney. Powell could not accompany them as she was studying for her final exams.|$|E

On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans.
