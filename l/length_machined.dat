40|$|Machining is {{a dynamic}} process {{involving}} coupled phenomena: high strain and strain rate and high temperature. Prediction of machining induced residual stresses is an interesting objective at the manufacturing processes modelling field. Tool wear results in a change of tool geometry affecting thermo-mechanical phenomena and thus has {{a significant effect on}} residual stresses. The experimental study of the tool wear influence in residual stresses is difficult due to the need of controlling wear evolution during cutting. Also the involved phenomena make the analysis extremely difficult. On the other hand, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool used to simulate cutting processes, allowing the analysis of different parameters influent on machining induced residual stresses. The aim of this work is to develop and to validate a numerical model to analyse the tool wear effect in machining induced residual stresses. Main advantages of the model presented in this work are, reduced mesh distortion, the possibility to simulate long <b>length</b> <b>machined</b> surface and time-efficiency. The model was validated with experimental tests carried out with controlled worn geometry generated by electro-discharge machining (EDM). The model was applied to predict machining induced residual stresses in AISI 316 L and reasonable agreement with experimental results were found.

50|$|Arbitrary-precision {{arithmetic}} {{is considerably}} slower than arithmetic using numbers that fit entirely within processor registers, since {{the latter are}} usually implemented in hardware arithmetic whereas the former must be implemented in software. Even if the computer lacks hardware for certain operations (such as integer division, or all floating-point operations) and software is provided instead, it will use number sizes {{closely related to the}} available hardware registers: one or two words only and definitely not N words. There are exceptions, as certain variable word <b>length</b> <b>machines</b> of the 1950s and 1960s, notably the IBM 1620, IBM 1401 and the Honeywell Liberator series, could manipulate numbers bound only by available storage, with an extra bit that delimited the value.|$|R
25|$|Yet another impetus of both RISC {{and other}} designs came from {{practical}} measurements on real-world programs. Andrew Tanenbaum summed up many of these, demonstrating that processors often had oversized immediates. For instance, he showed that 98% {{of all the}} constants in a program would fit in 13 bits, yet many CPU designs dedicated 16 or 32 bits to store them. This suggests that, {{to reduce the number}} of memory accesses, a fixed <b>length</b> <b>machine</b> could store constants in unused bits of the instruction word itself, so that they would be immediately ready when the CPU needs them (much like immediate addressing in a conventional design). This required small opcodes in order to leave room for a reasonably sized constant in a 32-bit instruction word.|$|R
40|$|In this project, {{the effects}} of {{different}} cutting parameters on surface roughness and power consumption when machining FCD 450 cast iron were studied using coated and uncoated irregular milling tool geometry of variable helix and pitch.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{machining}} of pockets with convex angles and containing no islands. The {{approach is a}} hybrid contouring - staircasing one. Contouring aims at clearing enough space around the boundary to allow efficient staircasing in the interior. Three tools are foreseen: two for contouring and one for staircasing. The algorithm for contouring is based on creating offsets of the pocket boundary and checking them for self-crossing. Staircasing is based on parametrisation of the tool path with respect to its orientation to the pocket, so as to minimise the tool path <b>length.</b> <b>Machining</b> strategy is complemented by choosing the best combination of diameters of the three tools used. This is simply done by first enumerating all available combinations and then excluding the non-feasible ones, in order to compare the rest according to tool path <b>length</b> (or to <b>machining</b> time when individual feed values are known). The output of the program, which was implemented in Fortran, is the tool path, the CNC part program, which is created automatically, and a numerical comparison of all the tool-angle combinations tried out. A machining simulation based on the CNC program output is conducted on commercial CAM software to demonstrate validity of the result. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Vaccination uses this concept to design vaccines to protect our bodies from infectious diseases. Some cells of the immune response cannot recognize antigen fragments unless attached to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. Therefore, predicting peptides that are able to bind to MHC molecules is a key step when designing vaccines. MHC class II is one type of MHC molecules that is characterized by its ability to bind peptides of different <b>length.</b> <b>Machine</b> learning techniques can facilitate discrimination between peptides to classify them into binders or non-binders to MHC class II molecules.
