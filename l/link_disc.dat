40|$|Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC 1) is {{a mental}} illness gene first {{identified}} in a Scottish pedigree. So far, DISC 1 -dependent phenotypes in animal models have been confined to expressing mutant DISC 1. Here we investigated how pathology of full-length DISC 1 protein could be a major mechanism in sporadic mental illness. We demonstrate that a novel transgenic rat model, modestly overexpressing the full-length DISC 1 transgene, showed phenotypes consistent with a significant role of DISC 1 misassembly in mental illness. The tgDISC 1 rat displayed mainly perinuclear DISC 1 aggregates in neurons. Furthermore, the tgDISC 1 rat showed a robust signature of behavioral phenotypes that includes amphetamine supersensitivity, hyperexploratory behavior and rotarod deficits, all pointing to changes in dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. To understand the etiology of the behavioral deficits, we undertook a series of molecular studies in the dorsal striatum of tgDISC 1 rats. We observed an 80 % increase in high-affinity DA D 2 receptors, an increased translocation of the dopamine transporter to the plasma membrane and a corresponding increase in DA inflow as observed by cyclic voltammetry. A reciprocal relationship between DISC 1 protein assembly and DA homeostasis was corroborated by in vitro studies. Elevated cytosolic dopamine caused an increase in DISC 1 multimerization, insolubility and complexing with the dopamine transporter, suggesting a physiological mechanism <b>linking</b> <b>DISC</b> 1 assembly and dopamine homeostasis. DISC 1 protein pathology and its interaction with dopamine homeostasis is a novel cellular mechanism that is relevant for behavioral control and may {{have a role in}} mental illness...|$|R

5|$|Comets {{are thought}} to have two {{separate}} points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two <b>linked</b> flat <b>discs</b> of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30AU and jointly extending out beyond 100AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet Hale–Bopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, {{are thought to}} originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are thought to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is far more likely to be the place of origin for comets. Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs. These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.|$|R
40|$|Observations of warped discs {{can give}} insight {{into the nature of}} angular {{momentum}} transport in accretion discs. Only a few objects are known to show strong periodicity on long timescales, but when such periodicity is present it is often attributed to precession of the accretion disc. The X-ray binary Hercules X- 1 /HZ Herculis (Her X- 1) {{is one of the best}} examples of such periodicity and has been <b>linked</b> to <b>disc</b> precession since it was first observed. By using the current best-fitting models to Her X- 1, which invoke precession driven by radiation warping, I place a constraint on the effective viscosities that act in a warped disc. These effective viscosities almost certainly arise due to turbulence induced by the magneto-rotational instability. The constraints derived here are in agreement with analytical and numerical investigations into the nature of magneto-hydrodynamic disc turbulence, but at odds with some recent global simulations.

40|$|Lesions and {{mutations}} of the DISC 1 (Disrupted-in-schizophrenia- 1) gene {{have been}} linked to major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism, but the influence of DISC 1 on synaptic transmission remains poorly understood. Using two independent genetic approaches-RNAi and a DISC 1 KO mouse-we examined the impact of DISC 1 on the synaptic vesicle (SV) cycle by population imaging of the synaptic tracer vGpH in hippocampal neurons. DISC 1 loss-of-function resulted in a marked decrease in SV exocytic rates during neuronal stimulation and was associated with reduced Ca(2 +) transients at nerve terminals. Impaired SV release was efficiently rescued by elevation of extracellular Ca(2 +), hinting at a <b>link</b> between <b>DISC</b> 1 and voltage-gated Ca(2 +) channels. Accordingly, blockade of N-type Cav 2. 2 channels mimics and occludes the effect of DISC 1 inactivation on SV exocytosis, and overexpression of DISC 1 in a heterologous system increases Cav 2. 2 currents. Collectively, these results show that DISC 1 -dependent enhancement of SV exocytosis is mediated by Cav 2. 2 and point to aberrant glutamate release as a probable endophenotype of major psychiatric disorders...|$|R

Zeeman signatures are detected, both in photospheric lines and in the emission lines formed {{at the base of the}} accretion funnels <b>linking</b> the <b>disc</b> to the protostar, and monitored over the whole rotation cycle of V 2129 Oph.

We find it to be rather complex, with a dominant octupolar component and a weak dipole of strengths 1. 2 and 0. 35 kG respectively, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotation axis. The large-scale field is anchored in a pair of 2 kG unipolar radial field spots located at high latitudes and coinciding with cool dark polar spots at photospheric level.

40|$|Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC 1) {{has emerged}} as a schizophrenia-susceptibility gene {{affecting}} various neuronal functions. In this study, we characterized Mitofilin, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, as a mediator of the mitochondrial function of DISC 1. A fraction of DISC 1 was localized to the inside of mitochondria and directly interacts with Mitofilin. A reduction in DISC 1 function induced mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by decreased mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activities, reduced cellular ATP contents, and perturbed mitochondrial Ca 2 + dynamics. In addition, deficiencies in DISC 1 and Mitofilin induced a reduction in mitochondrial monoamine oxidase-A activity. The mitochondrial dysfunctions evoked by the deficiency of DISC 1 were partially phenocopied by an overexpression of truncated DISC 1 that is associated with schizophrenia in human. DISC 1 deficiencies induced the ubiquitination of Mitofilin, suggesting that DISC 1 is critical for the stability of Mitofilin. Finally, the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by DISC 1 deficiency was partially reversed by coexpression of Mitofilin, confirming a functional <b>link</b> between <b>DISC</b> 1 and Mitofilin for the normal mitochondrial function. According to these results, we propose that DISC 1 plays essential roles for mitochondrial function in collaboration with a mitochondrial interacting partner, Mitofilin...|$|R
40|$|We have {{produced}} updated {{estimates of the}} scale length of the Milky Way stellar disc by applying hierarchical Bayesian (HB) meta-analysis techniques to the extant literature. Our results combine 29 different photometric measurements based {{on a wide range}} of observational datasets, Milky Way models and assumptions, and methodologiesK the HB technique is robust to systematic errors that affect only a subset of measurements. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of these improved disc scale length estimates, including separate analyses of optical and infrared measurements (which prove to be consistent with each other). A key finding is that the Milky Way’s disc scale length is roughly half as large as would be expected from its luminosity (or total stellar mass) and rotation velocity, lying further from the luminosity-velocity-radius relation than roughly 90 % of spirals. Tests with simulations suggest that this result could be connected to the known discrepancies between the properties of the Milky Way’s satellite population and predictions from LCDM models.

40|$|Context. The inner <b>disc,</b> <b>linking</b> {{the thin}} <b>disc</b> with the bulge, has been somehow {{neglected}} {{in the past}} because of intrinsic difficulties in its study, due, e. g., to crowding and high extinction. Open clusters located in the inner disc {{are among the best}} tracers of its chemistry at different ages and distances. Aims. We analyse the chemical patterns of four open clusters located within 7 kpc of the Galactic Centre and of field stars to infer the properties of the inner disc with the Gaia-ESO survey idr 2 / 3 data release. Methods. We derive the parameters of the newly observed cluster, Berkeley 81, finding an age of about 1 Gyr and a Galactocentric distance of 5. 4 kpc. We construct the chemical patterns of clusters and we compare them with those of field stars in the Solar neighbourhood and in the inner-disc samples. Results. Comparing the three populations we observe that inner-disc clusters and field stars are both, on average, enhanced in [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe]. Using the idr 2 / 3 results of M 67, we estimate the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effect on the abundances of Mg and Si in giant stars. After empirically correcting for NLTE effects, we note that NGC 6705 and Be 81 still have a high [α/Fe]. Conclusions. The location of the four open clusters and of the field population reveals that the evolution of the metallicity [Fe/H] and of [alpha/Fe] can be explained within the framework of a simple chemical evolution model: both [Fe/H] and [α/Fe] of Trumpler 20 and of NGC 4815 are in agreement with expectations from a simple chemical evolution model. On the other hand, NGC 6705, and at a lower level Berkeley 81, have higher [α/Fe] than expected for their ages, location in the disc, and metallicity. These differences might originate from local enrichment processes as explained in the inhomogeneous evolution framework. Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures, A&A accepte...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the study}} of Darg et al. (2009; {{hereafter}} D 09 a) we explore the environments, optical colours, stellar masses, star formation and AGN activity {{in a sample of}} 3003 pairs of merging galaxies drawn from the SDSS using visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project. While D 09 a found that the spiral-to-elliptical ratio in (major) mergers appeared higher than that of the global galaxy population, no significant differences are found between the environmental distributions of mergers and a randomly selected control sample. This makes the high occurrence of spirals in mergers unlikely to be an environmental effect and must, therefore, arise from differing time-scales of detectability for spirals and ellipticals. We find that merging galaxies have a wider spread in colour than the global galaxy population, with a significant blue tail resulting from intense star formation in spiral mergers. Galaxies classed as star-forming using their emission-line properties have average star-formation rates approximately doubled by the merger process though star formation is negligibly enhanced in merging elliptical galaxies. We conclude that the internal properties of galaxies significantly affect the time-scales over which merging systems can be detected (as suggested by recent theoretical studies) which leads to spirals being `over-observed' in mergers.

40|$|Young low-mass {{stars are}} {{characterized}} by ejection of collimated outflows and by circumstellar discs which they interact with through accretion of mass. The accretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believed to power the mass outflows, which may in turn remove the excess angular momentum from the star-disc system. However, although the process of mass accretion is a critical aspect of star formation, some of its mechanisms are still to be fully understood. A point not considered to date and relevant for the accretion process is the evidence of very energetic and frequent flaring events in these stars. Flares may easily perturb {{the stability of the}} discs, thus influencing the transport of mass and angular momentum. Here we report on 3 D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the evolution of a flare with an idealized non-equilibrium initial condition occurring near the disc around a rotating magnetized star. The model takes into account the stellar magnetic field, the gravitational force, the viscosity of the disc, the magnetic-field-oriented thermal conduction (including the effects of heat flux saturation), the radiative losses from optically thin plasma and the coronal heating. We show that, during its first stage of evolution, the flare gives rise to a hot magnetic loop <b>linking</b> the <b>disc</b> to the star. The disc is strongly perturbed by the flare: disc material evaporates under the effect of the thermal conduction and an overpressure wave propagates through the disc. When the overpressure reaches {{the opposite side of the}} disc, a funnel flow starts to develop there, accreting substantial disc material on to the young star from the side of the disc opposite to the flare...|$|R

The data were taken from the 2 MASS in the J, H and K_s filters. The sample consists of 175 galaxies in the K_s-filter, 169 galaxies in the H-filter and 165 galaxies in the J-filter. We present bulge and disc decompositions of each galaxy image. All galaxies have been modelled with a Sersic bulge and exponential disc with the BUDDA v 2. 1 package. The main conclusions of our general statistical analysis of the sample are: (1) The distribution of the apparent bulge axis ratio q_b for the subsample with n 2 bulges seem to be oblate spheroids with moderate flattening. (2) For the sample galaxies, the effective radius of the bulge r_{e,b}, the disc scalelength h and the disc scaleheight z_ 0 are well correlated. However, there is a clear trend for the ratio r_{e,b}/h to increase with n. (3) There is a hint that the fundamental planes of <b>discs,</b> which <b>links</b> only <b>disc</b> parameters and the maximum rotational velocity of gas, are different for galaxies with different bulges. (4) The investigation of the Photometric Plane of sample bulges shows that the plane is not flat and has a prominent curvature towards small values of n. For bulges this fact was not noticed earlier. (5) The clear relation between the flattening of stellar discs h/z_ 0 and the relative mass of a spherical component, including a dark halo, is confirmed not for bulgeless galaxies but for galaxies with massive bulges.
