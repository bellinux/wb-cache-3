We examined various <b>lag</b> structures, including both simple single/multi-day <b>lag</b> (for example, PM 2.5 <b>lag</b> 1 is <b>lag</b> 1  day for PM 2.5) and multi-day cumulative <b>lag</b> structures (for example, PM 2.5 <b>lag</b> 4 MA is a 4 -day moving average of PM 2.5). A simple single/multi-day <b>lag</b> structure was used to estimate the <b>lag</b> effect of environmental conditions and a multi-day moving average <b>lag</b> structure was applied to examine the cumulative effect of environmental conditions on pediatric admissions. In our single-pollutant regression model, we tested the 1 -day to 6 -day simple <b>lag</b> effect and 2 -day to 6 -day cumulative <b>lag</b> effect, to determine the optimal <b>lag</b> and cumulative structures for the multi-pollutant model; <b>lag</b> 2 and <b>lag</b> 4 MA were selected for PM 2.5, SO 2, and O 3; <b>lag</b> 1 and <b>lag</b> 4 MA were selected for TDIF 24 H; and <b>lag</b> 1 was selected for PRCP.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} <b>lagged</b> {{effect of}} macroeconomic variables on firm stock returns by employing {{data for the}} period from 1998 to 2012. The macroeconomic variables investigated in this study include: exchange rate, risk free rate, inflation, money supply and oil prices. For this purpose, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is applied. The findings declared that <b>lagged</b> effect of economic factors plays considerable role in explaining the firm stock returns. Such that three and four {{are the most common}} <b>lags</b> indicating significant and positive impact of exchange rate on firm stock returns. While, two and five <b>lags</b> are the most common <b>lags</b> implying statistically significant but negative relation of exchange rate with firm stock returns. However, it is uncovered that overall the statistically significant <b>lagged</b> effect of risk free rate on stock returns is negative in large and is found to be maximized at <b>lag</b> one. More so, <b>lagged</b> effect of inflation rests on quite worthy outcomes; firstly it is noted that its significant effect is shifted from negative to positive with the increase in <b>lags</b> from <b>lag</b> one to <b>lag</b> four. Secondly, it is established that four <b>lags</b> is the most common <b>lag</b> reflecting statistically significant positive impact of inflation on firm stock returns, while one and two <b>lags</b> are the most common <b>lags</b> displaying negative and significant relationship of inflation with firm stock returns. Taken together, money supply indicates significant positive <b>lagged</b> effect on firm stock returns in majority of the cases, that is subject to maximization either at <b>lag</b> two or <b>lag</b> five. However, largely, documenting significant positive <b>lagged</b> effect of oil prices on firm stock returns, it is established that one and two <b>lags</b> are the most common <b>lags</b> at which oil prices has significant and positive impact on firm stock returns.

40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) systems {{enable users}} to {{interact}} with computer-generated objects in a natural manner. However, inevitable time <b>lags</b> occur when a Virtual Reality system responds to dynamic head or hand movements of a user. Many studies have reported the time <b>lag</b> problems with Virtual Reality systems but studies on the combined effects of head and hand movement-related <b>lags</b> are few. The purposes of this research are {{to determine the effects}} of (i) head movement-related <b>lags,</b> (ii) hand movement-related <b>lags,</b> and (iii) combined head and hand movement-related <b>lags</b> on manual task performance. Both discrete and continuous manual tasks have been investigated and the mechanisms responsible for the degraded performance with <b>lags</b> have also been studied and identified. In addition, quantitative models to predict the task performance in the presence of hand movement-related <b>lags</b> and combined hand and head movement-related <b>lags</b> are presented. Four experiments were conducted. With discrete manual tasks, both additional head movement-related <b>lags</b> (≥ 110 ms) and hand movement-related <b>lags</b> ([is more than or equal to 55 ms) significantly increased the task completion times. Effects of hand movement-related <b>lags</b> were found to be significantly greater than the effects of head movement-related <b>lags</b> of the same magnitudes. With continuous manual tracking tasks, tracking errors increased with increasing hand movement-related <b>lags</b> but not with increasing head movement-related <b>lags</b> (up to 440 ms). It was found that the effects of hand movement-related <b>lags</b> had significant interactions with the effects of target width but not with target distance. This contradicts some previous findings. A model explaining this interaction phenomenon has been developed. With the presence of head movement-related <b>lags,</b> the opposite was found. That is, the effects of head movement-related <b>lags</b> had significant interactions with the effects of target distance but not with target width. The interaction results indicate that, in the presence of <b>lags,</b> the effect of target width (W) and distance (D) should not be analyzed as a single effect of 'Index-of-Difficulty, ID' (ID = log 2 2 D/W). This is a new finding. With a constant <b>lag,</b> discrete target-directed hand movement times were found to be consistent with Fitts' laws (R 2 [is more than] 0. 8). Regression models were developed to predict the effects of hand movement-related <b>lags</b> (R 2 [is more than] 0. 9) and the combined effects of hand and head movement-related <b>lags</b> (R 2 [is more than] 0. 9).
