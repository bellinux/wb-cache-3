25|$|It is {{possible}} that some exoplanets may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more <b>like</b> <b>ours.</b> For example, NASA's Kepler Mission seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's light curve as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft.

40|$|International audienceThis study investigates {{whether the}} {{production}} and the recognition of liaison sequences in children depend on the singular/plural orientation of nouns. Certain nouns occur more frequently in the plural (e. g., arbre "tree") whereas others are found more often in the singular (e. g., arc-en-ciel "rainbow"). In the input, children more frequently encounter these plural-oriented nouns after determiners which indicate plurality (e. g., les, des, "the", deux, "two", etc.) and which are often associated with a /z/ liaison [døzarbr],"two trees". In experiment 1, 122 children (aged from 3; 2 to 6; 3) were asked to produce nominal phrases with either /z/ liaisons (i. e., in plural contexts <b>like</b> deux <b>ours</b> [døzurs],"two bears") or with /n/ liaisons (i. e., in singular contexts <b>like</b> un <b>ours</b> [oenurs],"one bear"). We found correlations between the plural-orientation of the nouns and (1) the probability {{that they will be}} preceded by an incorrect /z/ liaison in singular contexts (2) the probability that they will be preceded by a correct /z/ liaison in the plural context. This result was however restricted to the younger children. In experiment 2, 20 children (aged from 5; 5 to 6; 3) were asked to monitor target words in auditorily presented sentences. The results showed shorter responses times for singular-oriented nouns when preceded by singular determiners than when preceded by plural determiners. Conversely, plural-oriented nouns were responded to faster when preceded by a plural determiner than by a singular determiner. Results are discussed within the framework of a two-stage model of liaison acquisition recently proposed by Chevrot, Chabanal and Dugua (2007) and Chevrot, Dugua and Fayol (2009) ...|$|R

500|$|Production on Jurassic Park began {{before the}} {{discovery}} of the large dromaeosaurid Utahraptor was made public in 1991, but as Jody Duncan wrote about this discovery: [...] "Later, after we had designed and built the Raptor, there was a discovery of a Raptor skeleton in Utah, which they labeled 'super-slasher'. They had uncovered the largest Velociraptor to date - and it measured five-and-a-half-feet tall, just <b>like</b> <b>ours.</b> So we designed it, we built it, and then they discovered it. That still boggles my mind." [...] Spielberg was particularly pleased with {{the discovery of}} the Utahraptor because of the boost it gave to the velociraptors in his film. Spielberg's name was briefly considered for naming of the new dinosaur. In reality, Velociraptor, like many other maniraptoran theropods, was covered in feathers. Jurassic Park and its sequel [...] were released before this discovery, so the creatures in both films are depicted as featherless with scales all over in the manner of modern reptiles. For Jurassic Park III, the male Velociraptor was given quill-like structures along {{the back of the head}} and neck. While this was the extent to which CGI effects were able to render feathers at the time, the structures do not resemble the down-like feathers real-life dromaeosaurids bore or the fully developed arm feathers, akin to the wing feathers of modern birds, borne by Velociraptor.|$|E

Robert Christgau remarked that {{because many of}} Manhattan's white youths were wealthy and somewhat artsy, only ill-behaved young people from the outer boroughs such as the band members could [...] "capture the oppressive excitement Manhattan holds for a half-formed human being". [...] "Private World", an escapist plea for stability, was co-written by Kane, who rarely contributed as a songwriter and felt overwhelmed as a young adult in the music business. Johansen, the band's main lyricist, said [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)" [...] was about [...] "how kids come to Manhattan from all over, they're kind of like whipped dogs, they're very repressed. Their bodies and brains are disoriented from each other... it's a love song." [...] According to critic Frank Kogan, the titular monster in the song was the personification of New York City and its ethos—"the ostentation and the terror, the dreams and the fear"—while Johansen asking listeners if they [...] "could make it with Frankenstein" [...] involved more than sexual slang: [...] "David was asking if you—if I—could make it with the monster of life, whether I could embrace life in all its pain and dreams and disaster." [...] Sylvain jokingly said [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)" [...] was titled with a qualifier because rock musician Edgar Winter had released his 1973 song {{of the same name}} before the band could record their own: [...] "Our song 'Frankenstein' was a big hit in our live show...

[...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio.

500|$|Another {{important}} factor was {{the dominance of}} Jews in {{the leadership of the}} Communist Party of Poland (KPP). According to multiple sources, Jews were well represented in the Polish Communist Party. Notably, the party had strong Jewish representation at higher levels. Out of fifteen leaders of the KPP central administration in 1936, eight were Jews. Jews constituted 53% of the [...] "active members" [...] of the KPP, 75% of its [...] "publication apparatus," [...] 90% of the [...] "international department for help to revolutionaries" [...] and 100% of the [...] "technical apparatus" [...] of the Home Secretariat. In Polish court proceedings against communists between 1927 and 1936, 90% of the accused were Jews. In terms of membership, before its dissolution in 1938, 25% of KPP members were Jews; most urban KPP members were Jews—a substantial number, given an 8.7% Jewish minority in prewar Poland. Some historians, including Joseph Marcus, qualify these statistics, alleging that the KPP should not be considered a [...] "Jewish party," [...] as it was in fact in opposition to traditional Jewish economic and national interests. The Jews supporting KPP saw themselves as international communists and rejected much of the Jewish culture and tradition. Nonetheless, the KPP, along with the Polish Socialist Party, was notable for its decisive stand against antisemitism. According to Jaff Schatz's summary of Jewish participation in the prewar Polish communist movement: Throughout the whole interwar period, Jews constituted a very important segment of the Communist movement. According to Polish sources and to Western estimates, the proportion of Jews in the KPP [...] was never lower than 22 percent. In the larger cities, the percentage of Jews in the KPP often exceeded 50 percent and in smaller cities, frequently over 60 percent.
