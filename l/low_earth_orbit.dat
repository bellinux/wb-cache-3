5|$|Other {{proposals}} involved {{launching the}} Gemini spacecraft on a Titan IIIC, and refueling in <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> before proceeding to the Moon, {{and a single}} launch architecture using a three-stage variant of the Saturn IB.|$|E
5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit,</b> and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E

The salient features of a <b>low</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> are discussed in terms of cost reduction efforts...|$|R
25|$|Communications {{satellites}} are satellites {{stationed in}} {{space for the}} purpose of telecommunications. Modern communications satellites typically use geosynchronous orbits, Molniya <b>orbits</b> or <b>Low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R
5|$|Black Arrow, officially capitalised BLACK ARROW, was a British {{satellite}} carrier rocket. Developed {{during the}} 1960s, {{it was used}} for four launches between 1969 and 1971. Its final flight {{was the first and}} only successful orbital launch to be conducted by the United Kingdom, and placed the Prospero satellite into <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 was {{launched}} at 13:57:04 UTC on 8 April 2010. Following a successful launch, CryoSat-2 {{separated from the}} upper stage of the Dnepr into a <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit.</b> The first signals from the satellite were detected by a ground station at the Broglio Space Centre in Malindi, Kenya, seventeen minutes after launch.|$|E
5|$|For {{missions}} beyond <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> (BLEO), NASA {{has been}} directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E

40|$|Miniature space GPS {{receivers}} {{have been}} developed {{by means of a}}utomobile-navigation technology. The weight and power consumption of the GPS receiver are 35 g and 1 W, respectively. We expanded the frequency sweep range in order to cover large Doppler shift in orbit. We tested the performance in <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbits</b> by means of a GPS simulator. The GPS receiver succeeded in cold start acquisition in less than 60 minutes. The GPS receiver for automobile- navigation generates position data with time tag which is not accurate enough to space application. The GPS receiver was modified to output pseudorange data with accurate time tag. The range error caused by the receiver is measured to be 1 meter. The position accuracy is estimated to be less than 20 meters in the <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbits.</b> The GPS receiver can be operated with 20 krad (Co 60) radiation and is SEL-free for 200 MeV proton radiation. SEU may occur in <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbits</b> once a several days. This GPS receiver will be on-boarded on INDEX satellite, which will be launched in 2005...|$|R
40|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) {{receivers}} on <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites {{can provide}} three-dimensional global tracking with sub-decimeter orbit accuracy. The precise GPS data can additionally {{be used to}} refine the Earth's gravity field. Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle (STEP) is a proposed European Space Agency mission which will carry a flight GPS receiver. Using a realistic scenario for processing 5 days of GPS data, a covariance analysis is performed to obtain the expected improvement in the gravity field. Additionally, a similar analysis is then repeated for two <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites, each equipped with GPS receivers and with precise ranging measurements between them...|$|R
5|$|KSAT {{operates}} two polar ground stations {{optimized for}} <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> (LEO) satellites, the other being SvalSat at Longyearbyen in Svalbard, Norway. These {{are the only}} two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of LEO satellites. By using both stations, customers can download data twice per orbit, twenty-six times per day, with only a forty-minute maximum delay.|$|E
5|$|KSAT {{operates}} two polar ground stations {{optimized for}} <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> (LEO) satellites, the other being TrollSat at Troll in Antarctica.

5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the Gemini program {{by the addition of}} various missions, including manned <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit,</b> circumlunar and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, and allowing the crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
50|$|Space Launch Complex 5 (SLC-5) was {{a launch}} pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, United States. It was {{previously}} {{part of the}} Point Arguello Naval Air Station, during which time it was designated Launch Complex D or LC-D. Constructed in 1961, it was used by 69 Scout rockets between 1962 and 1994. Satellites launched from the complex included Transit, OV3, Explorer and P35 spacecraft. Most of the satellites launched from SLC-5 were placed into <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits,</b> or <b>low</b> medium <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in space technology for Earth observations, global communications, and positioning systems have created heavy traffic {{at a variety}} of orbits. These include smart sensors in <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (LEO), internet satellites in LEO and GEO <b>orbits,</b> <b>Earth</b> observing satellites in high <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (HEO), observatory class satellites at Lagrangian libration points, and those heading for deep space...|$|R
50|$|The {{restrictions}} on departure windows arise because <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbits</b> {{are susceptible to}} significant perturbations; even over short periods {{they are subject to}} nodal regression and, less importantly, precession of perigee. Equatorial depots are more stable but also more difficult to reach.|$|R
5|$|Humans {{began the}} {{physical}} {{exploration of space}} during the 20th century {{with the advent of}} high-altitude balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches. Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Kongsfjord Telemetry Station {{constituted}} one of {{the four}} initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and telemetry communication with ESRO's <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> satellites. The ground station communicated with the satellites in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, allowed for a small antenna dish but gave a low bit rate. The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but {{it soon became clear}} that the oxygen radicals in the <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{geostationary}} satellites, <b>low</b> {{and medium}} <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> satellites do not {{stay in a}} fixed position in the sky. Consequently, ground based antennas cannot be easily locked into communication with any one specific satellite. As with GPS, for a receiver the satellites are only visible for {{a part of their}} orbit, therefore multiple satellites are necessary to establish a permanent internet connection, with <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> needing more satellites than medium <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits.</b> The network has to switch data transfer between satellites to keep a connection to a customer.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of Brouwer’s gravity solution is compared with Deprit’s second-order radial intermediary.

50|$|It is {{designed}} to launch small payloads — 300 to 2,500 kg satellites for scientific and Earth observation missions to polar and <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits.</b> The reference Vega mission is a polar orbit bringing a spacecraft of 1,500 kilograms to an altitude of 700 kilometers.|$|R
5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit.</b> The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast {{until they reached the}} Moon. The Agena would then have been used to perform Lunar orbit insertion. Following the completion of activities in Lunar orbit, the Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.|$|E
5|$|Several Gemini Ferry {{spacecraft}} were {{proposed to}} provide transportation of crews and cargo to NASA and USAF space stations in <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit.</b> NASA contracted McDonnell {{to conduct a}} study into what modifications {{would be needed to}} allow the Gemini spacecraft to support this. Three spacecraft were envisioned; a manned spacecraft to transport crew to the stations, a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply the station every three or four months.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space {{telescope}} that was launched into <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> in 1990 and remains in operation. Although {{not the first}} {{space telescope}}, Hubble {{is one of the}} largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. The HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.|$|E
40|$|A {{satellite}} system for optical communications {{such as a}} multi-access laser transceiver system. Up to six <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites send satellite data to a geosynchronous satellite. The data is relayed to a ground station at the Earth's surface. The earth pointing geosynchronous satellite terminal has no gimbal but has a separate tracking mechanism for tracking each <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellite. The tracking mechanism has a ring assembly rotatable about an axis coaxial with the axis {{of the field of}} view of the geosynchronous satellite and a pivotable arm mounted for pivotal movement on the ring assembly. An optical pickup mechanism {{at the end of each}} arm is positioned for optical communication with one of the orbiting satellites by rotation of the ring...|$|R
50|$|The Russian 12KRB {{cryogenic}} {{upper stage}} was planned {{to perform for}} 710 seconds, but its burn apparently lasted only 698 seconds. Another suspect for the shortfall is the launch vehicle navigation system which {{was derived from the}} PSLV which has flown only to <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R
25|$|Equatorial <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (ELEO) are {{a subset}} of LEO. These orbits, with low {{inclination}} to the Equator, allow rapid revisit times and have the lowest delta-v requirement (i.e., fuel spend) of any orbit. Orbits with a high inclination angle to the equator are usually called polar orbits.|$|R
5|$|Two Space Shuttle {{missions}} – {{the ill-fated}} STS-51-L (ended by the Challenger disaster) and STS-61-E – {{were scheduled to}} observe Halley's Comet from <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit.</b> STS-51-L carried the Shuttle-Pointed Tool for Astronomy (SPARTAN-203) satellite, also called the Halley's Comet Experiment Deployable (HCED). STS-61-E was a Columbia mission scheduled for March 1986, carrying the ASTRO-1 platform to study the comet. Due to the suspension of America's manned space program after the Challenger explosion, the mission was canceled, and ASTRO-1 would not fly until late 1990 on STS-35.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit.</b> The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E
5|$|Geospace is {{populated}} by electrically charged particles {{at very low}} densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. During geomagnetic storms two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere, can become strongly disturbed. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, disrupting telecommunications and GPS technologies, and {{can also be a}} hazard to astronauts, even in <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit.</b> They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles.|$|E
