5|$|At episode's end, Rose, Sarah Jane, Mickey, and the Doctor are {{standing}} in the TARDIS. Sarah Jane declines a second chance of travelling in the TARDIS, having finally decided {{to move on with}} her life and stop waiting for the Doctor. Mickey says he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS crew, a suggestion of which Sarah Jane approves. She then asks Rose to stay with the Doctor, and to find her one day if she needs to. Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly with the Doctor, who leaves her with a brand new K9 as a parting gift.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes instead {{started to}} train with A.F.C. Sudbury and {{played in a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Bury Town, during which he scored to help Sudbury win 4–3. However, although Rhodes said he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> semi-professional Isthmian League Division One North side, {{he wanted to keep}} his options open in case he could remain in the professional game. A week later, he was given a trial with League Two Hereford United. Instead, the following week, Rhodes signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Canvey Island and immediately went into the first-team to make his debut on 28 August in a home league match against Carshalton Athletic, which finished 1–1, with Rhodes close to scoring what would have been a late winning goal for his new club. Rhodes' first goals for Canvey Island came in a FA Cup first round qualifying match against Newport Pagnell Town, scoring twice in a 4–1 victory. He scored again in the next round to put Canvey into the third qualifying round. Rhodes signed a contract to keep him with the club {{until the end of the}} season and scored two more in Canvey's ultimate exit from the FA Cup.|$|E
25|$|A node {{that would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> net must first {{go through a}} {{bootstrap}} process. In this phase, the joining node needs to know the IP address and port of another node—a bootstrap node (obtained from the user, or from a stored list)—that is already participating in the Kademlia network. If the joining node has not yet participated in the network, it computes a random ID number that is supposed not to be already assigned to any other node. It uses this ID until leaving the network.|$|E

Angell is a strong skater and plays a physical game. His slapshot is hard and accurate, making him a valuable player on the power play and a threat to goalies.|$|R
5000|$|Orwell was a {{democratic}} socialist and a left-libertarian sympathizer who expressed {{solidarity with the}} anarchist movement and social revolution, later commenting, [...] "I had told everyone {{for a long time}} past that I was going to leave the P.O.U.M.

25|$|Meanwhile, in {{free agency}} they signed Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in a four-year, $24million deal. That was to counter the {{defection}} of Vladimir Radmanović to the Lakers in a similar deal, except Radmanovic signed for an extra year, but both players would make {{the same amount of}} money annually, which would be $6million. Sam Cassell (widely credited as the biggest reason for the Clippers' recent success) signed a two-year, $13million deal. Cassell stated that once he retired he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Clippers' coaching staff under Mike Dunleavy, Sr. The team also signed veteran Aaron Williams to an undisclosed deal.|$|E
500|$|A Day to Remember {{formed when}} guitarist Tom Denney asked Jeremy McKinnon {{if he would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> band as a vocalist. The pair hung out with drummer Bobby Scruggs, who later joined the band. During this period, both Denney and Scruggs were already in a band; Denney was in 2 Days 2 Late, while McKinnon played in All for Nothing. The trio wrote a song which McKinnon said [...] "was better than {{everything}} our other bands had come up with". Shortly afterwards the trio decided to form a band which was called End of An Era in its first week of existence. The name {{was inspired by a}} movie listing in a TV guide found in Denney's home. One day at rehearsal, a friend of Scruggs showed up with his girlfriend, {{who came up with the}} band's name A Day to Remember.|$|E
500|$|Lisa, {{despite being}} a child prodigy, often sees {{herself as a}} misfit within the Simpson family and other {{children}} due to her extremely high level of intelligence. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways, and is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield, with her rebellion against social norms being depicted as constructive and heroic, yet she can be self-righteous at times. In [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father's roast-pig barbecue, an act for which she later apologizes. Episodes often take shots at Lisa's idealism and virtue signalling. In [...] "Bart Star", (season nine, 1997) Lisa, departs from her typically more genuine nature and apparently {{looking for a new}} cause to crusade over, defiantly declares that she, a girl, would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> football team. In the 1990s, it was considered odd to allow a girl to play football. However, when coach Ned Flanders reveals that several girls already play for the team, she hesitates and claims football is [...] "not really [...] thing". She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig's skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to Amnesty International. Upset by being unable to gain moral superiority, Lisa runs off.|$|E
2500|$|George Orwell {{fought in}} the Spanish Civil War in the militia of Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a revolutionary Trotskyst party (and {{therefore}} opposed to the Soviet Union line) whose militants were allied with the CNT during the revolution and to which Andrés Nin belonged. Orwell described in his book Homage to Catalonia the time during which Barcelona rose up with the CNT and anarchism. In the ninth chapter of his book, Orwell commented that [...] "As far as my purely personal preferences went I would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Anarchists." ...|$|R

2500|$|In May 2006, {{thirteen}} {{years after his}} last performance with Guns N' Roses, Stradlin made a guest appearance at the band's show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York; he played on [...] "Patience", [...] "Think About You", and [...] "Nightrain". He then performed with Guns N' Roses for 13 shows during the band's summer European tour. Stradlin said, [...] "Axl [...] and I connected via cell phone this year, I stopped by. It was nice to reconnect with an old friend/war buddy/fellow musician. I told him later I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> fun in some way and he said I was welcome to come and play something, so I did! Took me about three weeks {{to recover from the}} six weeks of touring!" [...] In December, he played three shows with the group at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California.|$|E
2500|$|Inmates {{who work}} in the Prison Blues factory are all volunteers. [...] In fact, there is always a long waiting list of inmates who would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Prison Blues workforce. [...] To be eligible, an inmate must have a record of good conduct and {{successfully}} interview with the factory personnel office, an experience that helps inmates prepare for job interviews outside prison.

60|$|The Wizard hitched the Sawhorse to the Red Wagon, {{which would}} seat four very comfortably. He wanted Dorothy, Betsy, Trot and the Patchwork Girl {{to ride in}} the wagon, but Scraps came up to them mounted upon the Woozy, and the Woozy said he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> party. Now this Woozy was a most {{peculiar}} animal, having a square head, square body, square legs and square tail. His skin was very tough and hard, resembling leather, and while his movements were somewhat clumsy, the beast could travel with remarkable swiftness. His square eyes were mild and gentle in expression, and he was not especially foolish. The Woozy and the Patchwork Girl were great friends, and so the Wizard agreed to let the Woozy go with them.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{unanimous}} exclamation of assent. The plan seemed to offer probabilities of large booty {{with a minimum}} of trouble and risk.

500|$|In December 2014, Hartlepool United manager Ronnie Moore {{said that}} he would <b>like</b> Evans <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> club.

The club later followed up this headline with a statement saying that Hartlepool does not wish to sign Evans.|$|R
2500|$|Orwell details {{noteworthy}} {{changes in}} the social and political atmosphere of Barcelona when he returns after three months at the front. He describes a lack of revolutionary atmosphere and the class division that he had thought would not reappear, i.e., with visible division between rich and poor and the return of servile language. Orwell had been determined to leave the POUM, and confesses here that he [...] "would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Anarchists," [...] but instead sought a recommendation <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> International Column, so that he could go to the Madrid front. The latter half of this chapter is devoted to describing the conflict between the anarchist CNT and the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the resulting cancellation of the May Day demonstration and the build-up to the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. [...] "It was the antagonism between those who wished the revolution to go forward and those who wished to check or prevent it—ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Gee, Oi'd like dat, but it ain't {{for poor}} blokes the loikes of me,' said he. That {{gave me an}} idea. There was a vacancy in the patrol, and at the next meeting I put it right {{straight}} to the fellows. I told them all about Sparrer and got 'em interested, and then I just kind of hinted at the brotherhood and democracy idea of scouting and what a mighty good turn {{it would be if}} Sparrer could be given a chance to get into the game, and then dropped the subject. The hint worked all right. They're a pretty good bunch, these fellows. They talked it all over and then they came around and asked me if I supposed Sparrer would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Blue Tortoise Patrol. I told them that I was sure he wouldn't if he suspected that the invitation was charity on their part. They chewed this over {{for a while and then}} came around and said that they really would like to take him in, and there wasn't any charity about it. I took the invitation to Sparrer and he went up in the air like a rocket, just as I knew he would.|$|E

6000|$|The patriarch had {{a curious}} spice of malice in him, which {{prompted}} him to speak evil of all, and {{to as many as}} he dared. After we had inspected the ruins of the emperor's villa, a clownish imbecile of a woman, professing to be the wife of the peasant who had made the excavations, came forth out of a cleft in the rock and received tribute of us--why, I do not know. The patriarch abetted the extortion, but Parthianly remarked, as we turned away, [...] "Her husband ought to be here; but this is a festa, and he is drinking and gaming in the village," [...] while the woman protested that he was sick at home. There was also a hermit living in great publicity among the ruins, and the patriarch did not spare him a sneering comment. [This hermit I have heard was not brought up to the profession of anchorite, but was formerly a shoemaker, and according to his own confession abandoned his trade because he could better indulge a lethargic habit in the character of religious recluse.] He had even a bad word for Tiberius, and reproached the emperor for throwing people over the cliff, though I think it a sport in which he would himself have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>join.</b> <b>The</b> only human creatures with whom he seemed to be in sympathy were the brigands of the main-land, of whom he spoke poetically as exiles and fugitives.|$|R
