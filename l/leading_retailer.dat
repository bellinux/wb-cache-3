40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} an {{exploratory}} case study of the sustainability agendas being publicly reported by the UK's <b>leading</b> <b>retailers</b> and to offer some wider reflections on the ways these retailers are currently addressing and pursuing sustainability agendas. The paper begins with a short discussion {{of the characteristics of}} sustainability. The paper draws its empirical material from the most recent information on sustainability posted on the UK's top 10 retailers' corporate web sites. The findings reveal that all the UK's top 10 retailers provide information {{on a wide range of}} environmental, social and economic sustainability agendas and that the majority of them essentially argue that by integrating sustainability into their businesses, they are better placed to provide long term growth. More critically, the authors argue that the UK's <b>leading</b> <b>retailers</b> are, at best, adopting a ‘weak’ model of sustainability and that in pursuing continuing growth, they are ignoring the basic fact that present patterns of consumption are unsustainable in the long term. The paper provides an accessible review of, and some reflections on, the sustainability agendas being pursued by the UK's <b>leading</b> <b>retailers</b> and as such it will interest academics and those working in management positions within the retail and the retail supply industries...|$|R
