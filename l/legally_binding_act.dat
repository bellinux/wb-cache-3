The decree [...] "On Separation of Church from State and Schools from Church" [...] outlawed {{connection}} of any public and social acts with religious ceremonies. Since that baptism {{ceased to be}} a <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>act.</b> The right to register names was handed to civil authorities, namely civil registry.As a result the whole conception of name changed. Naming no longer depended on religious traditions and rules.Direct and tight connection with orthodox saints names was lost.Any citizen was free to choose a name he wished for himself and his children. As a matter of fact, any word {{could be used as a}} name; function of civil registry was reduced to proper registration of citizens.|$|E
40|$|The {{treaty of}} Lisbon, which entered into force on 1. 12. 2009, {{represents}} {{a major step}} concerning {{the development of the}} protection of fundamental rights within the European Union. After the Lisbon Treaty entered into force the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has the status of a <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>act.</b> As a result, the Court of Justice of the European Union as well as the national courts have a mechanism available which shall serve as the principal basis on which they carry out their task of ensuring that in the interpretation and application of the EU law the fundamental rights are observed appropriately. Also, the Treaty of Lisbon provides for the European Union to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The legal base regarding the European Union accession to the ECHR is Article 6 (2) of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU, Article 218 (8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Protocol 8 and Declaration 2 to the Lisbon Treaty. A> er the Charter acquired the status of a <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>act</b> as well as if the European Union accedes to the ECHR, this means a major step forward and shall extensively contribute {{when it comes to the}} protection of the fundamental rights within legal order of the European Union. This could be considered the consolidation of a legal framework regarding the protection of the human rights at European Union level. Nevertheless, the main rationale of this article is to consider the formal sources of EU human rights, the application and interpretation of the Charter in the Member States, to whom provisions of the Chapter are addressed, the distinction between rights and principles, some of the ECJ cases regarding protection of human rights a> er the Lisbon Treaty as well as the EU accession to the ECHR...|$|E
40|$|The rule-making {{power of}} the European Commission, {{dissertation}} Mgr. Mgr. Jiří Lenfeld, M. A.; supervisor: doc. JUDr. Richard Král, Ph. D., LL. M. Charles University, Faculty of Law, Department of European Law Prague, March 2013 The aim of the dissertation is to analyse {{the role of the}} European Commission in the legislative process of the European Union with the focus on procedures for adoption of <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> Union <b>acts.</b> The European Commission {{is one of the main}} institutions of the European Union. It represents and upholds the interests of the EU as a whole and manages the day-to-day business of implementing EU policies. However, to limit the role of the European Commission to that of an executive body would be misleading. Its role in the EU institutional system is much broader than that. The European Commission is the most important legislator among the EU institutions and is also empowered with an almost exclusive power to submit drafts of EU legal acts. The rule-making {{power of the}} European Commission could be seen from two different points of view. In a narrow sense of the word it could be seen as a power conferred on the European Commission by the Treaties to propose drafts and to adopt EU legal <b>acts</b> implementing <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> Union <b>acts.</b> However, the exercise of the rule-making power may [...] ...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} decade, {{political}} discussions, briefings, and White Papers have been {{leading up to}} the possibility of drafting a Norwegian climate law in 2017. Norwegian domestic emissions have been on the rise since 1990 due mainly to the oil / gas and transport sectors. This is despite Norwegian participation in EU climate regulations, and a plethora of domestic measures including other <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>acts.</b> Reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is an extremely complex challenge that calls for a varied approach in terms climate policy and governance solutions. This analysis attempts to understand how a carbon budget {{similar to that of the}} United Kingdom Climate Change Act’s carbon budget would function in the Norwegian context. Aside from using the UK carbon budget as a frame of reference, the time inconsistency problem and domestic politics problem (Kydland & Prescott, 1977) are also employed to further understand why broad support may still result in weak measures. It is the aim of this analysis to contribute to the Norwegian climate law conversation by proposing a Norwegian carbon budget. The main findings are that existing Norwegian climate acts consist of some of the structural components of the UK carbon budget however components lacking from Norwegian climate policy has resulted in vulnerability. The currently existing acts are also providing support to the notion that additional domestic climate regulations are not necessary. Therefore attention is being redirected toward international measures to reduce emissions rather than improving domestic conditions. This, however, has the opportunity to change with the development of the Norwegian climate law...|$|R
40|$|The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 which {{received}} Royal Assent on 5 June 2008 aims to re-design the child support system as established in 1993 by the conservative government and amended under the Blair government. Both {{the original and}} the amended version of the system {{proved to be a}} failure. With effect from 14 July 2008, the new Act notably abolished the former requirement that parents with care in receipt of state benefits must apply for child maintenance through the Child Support Agency (CSA). It also replaced the inefficient and long criticised CSA with the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (C-MEC), which is now up and running. One of the main principles upon which the new system is based is that the state should get involved only when parents cannot come to an agreement themselves or when one of them attempts to evade their responsibilities. The Act therefore encourages parents to make private maintenance arrangements for their children. However, these “voluntary maintenance agreements” are not <b>legally</b> <b>binding.</b> The <b>Act</b> also makes a number of changes to the rules on child support maintenance calculations with the view to simplifying and improving the assessment process...|$|R
