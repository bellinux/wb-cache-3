5|$|The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s {{established}} the African-American literary canon in the United States and introduced writers <b>Langston</b> <b>Hughes</b> and Zora Neale Hurston. Manhattan's vibrant visual art {{scene in the}} 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American pop art movement, which gave birth to such giants as Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. The downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s included artist Andy Warhol and clubs like Serendipity 3 and Studio 54, where he socialized.|$|E

Four United States Poet Laureates {{received}} their degrees from Columbia. Columbia alumni have made an indelible mark in the field of American poetry and literature, with such people as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, pioneers of the Beat Generation, and <b>Langston</b> <b>Hughes,</b> a seminal figure in the Harlem Renaissance, all having attended the university.

In 1920, she graduated from the college preparatory school, Spelman Seminary (now Spelman College) in Atlanta, Georgia.

While there, Bailey developed a friendship with Louise Thompson, who would become a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance movement, and encouraged <b>Langston</b> <b>Hughes,</b> inventor of jazz poetry, to read poetry there. She traveled with a quintet giving concerts in Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia, as well as London and Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} a {{collection}} of 13,000 artifacts, books, photographs, art objects, and memorabilia. The DuSable collection has come largely from private gifts.

Tanner, Richmond Barthé, and Romare Bearden, and has an extensive collection of books and records pertaining to African and African American history and culture.|$|E
5|$|Local white {{residents}} of the area objected almost immediately. They complained about black MPs challenging white people and patrolling the town while brandishing their military weapons. The first commanding officer, Major James Ellison, was supportive of his MPs; however, he was soon relieved of his command. A segregationist colonel replaced Ellison, and enforced segregation {{both on and off}} the base. This prompted black newspapers to protest his assignment. The colonel was transferred with a promotion, and Noel Parrish then took command as 'director of training'. The lack of assignments according to background and training led to an excess of non-aviation black officers without a mission. This became disparaging to morale, as the facility became overcrowded. As there was little in the line of recreation, Parrish began to arrange for celebrities to visit and perform at the base. Lena Horne, Joe Louis, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Robinson, Louis Armstrong, and <b>Langston</b> <b>Hughes</b> were among the many guests. Parrish also desegregated the base to a much larger extent than his predecessors.|$|E

25|$|Langston's {{early career}} {{was based in}} Ohio where, with his older brother Charles Henry Langston, he began his lifelong work for African-American freedom, education, equal rights and suffrage. In 1855 {{he was one of}} the first African Americans in the United States elected to public office when elected as a town clerk in Ohio. John was a great-uncle of the renowned poet <b>Langston</b> <b>Hughes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Langstons {{remained}} in Lawrence, Kansas, {{for the rest}} of their lives, moving in 1888 into town, where Charles had a part-interest in a grocery store.

Authors such as Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen and poets such as <b>Langston</b> <b>Hughes,</b> Claude McKay, and Countee Cullen wrote works describing the African-American experience. Jazz, swing, blues and other musical forms entered American popular music. African-American artists such as William H. Johnson and Palmer Hayden created unique works of art featuring African Americans.|$|E
25|$|American poetry arguably {{reached its}} peak in the early-to-mid-20th century, with such noted writers as Wallace Stevens and his Harmonium (1923) and The Auroras of Autumn (1950), T. S.

Other former Yaddo residents include <b>Langston</b> <b>Hughes,</b> Katherine Anne Porter, Truman Capote, and Sylvia Plath.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Langston</b> <b>Hughes,</b> Goldwyn's {{first choice}} for screenwriter, {{proved to be}} unavailable, the {{producer}} approached Paul Osborn, Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, Sidney Kingsley, Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, Clifford Odets, and Rod Serling, all of whom expressed varying degrees of interest but cited prior commitments. Goldwyn finally signed N. Richard Nash, who completed a lengthy first draft by December 1957. For director, Goldwyn sought Elia Kazan, Frank Capra, and King Vidor without success. He finally settled on Rouben Mamoulian, who had directed the original Broadway productions of both the play Porgy and its operatic adaptation.|$|E
