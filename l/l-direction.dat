50|$|In {{combination}} with two skins applied on the honeycomb, the structure offers a sandwich panel with excellent rigidity at minimal weight. The {{behavior of the}} honeycomb structures is orthotropic, meaning the panels react differently depending on {{the orientation of the}} structure. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between the directions of symmetry, the so-called L and W-direction. The <b>L-direction</b> is the strongest and the stiffest direction. The weakest direction is at 60° from the <b>L-direction</b> (in the case of a regular hexagon) and the most compliant direction is the W-direction.Another important property of honeycomb sandwich core is its compression strength. Due to the efficient hexagonal configuration, where walls support each other, compression strength of honeycomb cores is typically higher (at same weight) compared to other sandwich core structures such as, for instance, foam cores or corrugated cores.|$|E
30|$|The edges on top {{and bottom}} of the core running in the W-direction of the core are not critical. They are bonded to the face sheets and {{stabilized}} by the glue. The edges in the <b>L-direction</b> are free and have to be considered in the model.|$|E

In fact, the CAC property of Q 2 indicates its solution u(n,m) can be consistently embedded into a 3 -dimension cube (see Fig.  1 (b)). Although there is no explicit independent variable l in u(n,m), one can introduce a bar shift (shift in <b>l-direction)</b> for it according to [...] [...] or [...] [...] shifts. For example, for w defined in (2.3), we have w= 1 / 2 (A α^nβ^mα+A^- 1 α^-nβ^-mα^- 1) and α is related to p (the spacing parameter of n-direction) as in (2.4). Then w̅ should be accordingly defined as w= 1 / 2 (A α^nβ^m s +A^- 1 α^-nβ^-ms^- 1) and s is related to the spacing parameter k of <b>l-direction</b> by k=(1 -s)^ 2 / 2 s, which is coincident with (2.4). For x_i defined in (2.7), we have x_i=x_i+c^i where we suppose c^ 2 =k to coincide with (2.8).|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{superfluid}} density and the specific heat of the x − y model on lattices L × L × H with L ≫ H (i. e. on lattices representing a film geometry) using the Cluster Monte Carlo method. In the H-direction we applied staggered boundary conditions so that the order parameter {{on the top and}} bottom layers is zero, whereas periodic boundary conditions were applied in the <b>L-directions.</b> We find that the system exhibits a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition at the H-dependent temperature T 2 D c below the critical temperature Tλ of the bulk system. However, right at the critical temperature the ratio of the areal superfluid density to the critical temperature is H-dependent in the range of film thicknesses considered here. We do not find satisfactory finite-size scaling of the superfluid density with respect to H for the sizes of H studied. However, our numerical results can be collapsed onto a single curve by introducing an effective thickness Heff = H +D (where D is a constant) into the corresponding scaling relations. We argue that the effective thickness depends on the type of boundary conditions. Scaling of the specific heat does not require an effective thickness (within error bars) and we find good agreement between the scaling function f 1 calculated from our Monte Carlo results, f 1 calculated by renormalization group methods, and 1 the experimentally determined function f 1...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} left {{ventricular}} (LV) wall mechanics show that fiber stress depends {{heavily on the}} choice of musele fiber orientation in the wall. This finding brought us to the hypothesis that fiber orientation may be such that mechanical load in the wall is homogeneous. Aim {{of this study was}} to use the hypothesis to compute a distribution of fiber orientation within the wall. In a finite element model of LV wall mechanics, fiber stresses and strains were calculated at beginning of ejection (BE). Local fiber orientation was quantified by helix (HA) and transverse (TA) fiber angles using a coordinate system with local r-, c-, and <b>l-directions</b> perpendicular to the wall, along the circumference and along the meridian, respectively. The angle between the c-direction and the projection of the fiber direction on the cl-plane (HA) varied linearly with transmural position in the wall. The angle between the c-direction and the projection of the fiber direction on the cr-plane (TA) was zero at the epicardial and endocardial surfaces. Midwall TA increased with distance from the equator. Fiber orientation was optimized so that fiber strains at BE were as homogeneous as possible. By optimization with TA = 0 °, HA was found to vary from 81, 0 ° at the endocardium to - 35. 8 at the epicardium. Inclusion of TA in the optimization changed these angles to respectively 90. 1 ° and - 48. 2 ° while maximum TA was 15. 3 °. Then the standard deviation of fiber strain (ef) at BE decreased from ± 12. 5 % of mean ef to ± 9. 5 %. The root mean square (RMS) difference between computed HA and experimental data reported in literature was 15. 0 ° compared to an RMS difference of 11. 6 ° for a linear regression line through the latter data...|$|R

The first one ðq 1 Þ; corresponding to the well-known phonon anomalies in the zz 0 TA 2 branch, occurs along the k 110 l direction. The second one ðq 2 Þ; an incommensurate modulation observed for the first time, occurs along the k 211 <b>l-direction.</b> Both modulations change gradually with the premartensitic phonon softening and discontinuously with the MT. Anomalies in magnetic properties emerging around the MT have been briefly discussed...|$|E

For the rectangular bar, the span was 1300  mm and both ends were supported by jigs whose area was 50  mm (<b>L-direction</b> of the bar) ×  200  mm of the apparatus. For the round bar, the span was 1395  mm and both ends were supported by the jigs installed on the apparatus. The contact length between the round bar and jig was 105  mm (Fig.  2 d). Two rubber sheets 5  mm thick were inserted between the round bar and each jig and the test specimen was compressed in the similar way as the four-point bending test.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} {{a recent study of}} multiferroic by means of single crystal neutron diffraction. This system has two close magnetic phase transitions at TN 1 = 24. 2 K and TN 2 = 23. 6 K. The low temperature magnetic structure below TN 2 is unambiguously determined to be a fully 3 -dimensional proper screw. Between TN 1 and TN 2 antiferromagnetic order is found that is essentially 2 -dimensional. In this narrow temperature range, magnetic near neighbor correlations are still long range in the (H,K) plane, whereas nearest neighbors along the <b>L-direction</b> are uncorrelated. Thus, the multiferroic state is realized only in the low-temperature 3 -dimensional state and not in the 2 -dimensional state...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} Potts model (defined geometrically {{in the cluster}} picture) on finite {{two-dimensional}} lattices of size L x N, with boundary conditions that are free in the <b>L-direction</b> and periodic in the N-direction. The decomposition of the partition function {{in terms of the}} characters K_ 1 + 2 l (with l= 0, 1, [...] .,L) has previously been studied using various approaches (quantum groups, combinatorics, transfer matrices). We first show that the K_ 1 + 2 l thus defined actually coincide, and can be written as traces of suitable transfer matrices in the cluster picture. We then proceed to similarly decompose constrained partition functions in which exactly j clusters are non-contractible with respect to the periodic lattice direction, and a partition function with fixed transverse boundary conditions.

40|$|This paper aims at {{gaining a}} betterunderstanding of the atomic-level strain of woodcomponents under static tension. Fourier transforminfrared {{spectroscopy}} (FT-IR) was used toinvestigate load-carrying bonds. When a bond isunder tension, {{the band is}} expected to shift to alower wavenumber due to change of the forceconstant of bonding. This phenomena wassuccessfully observed with several IR bands causedby parallel atomic bonds in a cellulose chain, undertensile stress along the <b>L-direction</b> of a wood. As thelevel of stress increased, the shift increased linearly. Especially, the band occurring at 1161 cm– 1,assigned to bridge C–O–C, showed the largest shiftamong the bands. Because {{it is likely to}} be moreaffected under tensile stress as a load carrier alongthe cellulose chain’s backbone.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} d-cycloserine is {{an effective}} inhibitor of alanine racemase. The lack of inhibition by l-cycloserine of alanine racemase from Staphylococcus aureus led Roze and Strominger to formulate the cycloserine hypothesis. This hypothesis states that d-cycloserine has the conformation required of the substrates on the enzyme surface and that l-cycloserine cannot have this conformation. Alanine racemase from Escherichia coli W has been examined to establish whether these observations are a general feature of all alanine racemases. The enzyme (molecular weight = 95, 000) has Michaelis-Menten constants of 4. 6 × 10 − 4 m and 9. 7 × 10 − 4 m for d- and l-alanine, respectively. The ratio of Vmax in the d- to <b>l-direction</b> is 2. 3. The equilibrium constant calculated from the Haldane relationship is 1. 11 ± 0. 15. Both d- and l-cycloserine are competitive inhibitors with constants (Ki) of 6. 5 × 10 − 4 m and 2. 1 × 10 − 3 m, respectively. The ratio of Kmd-alanine to Kid-cycloserine is 0. 71, and the ratio of Kml-alanine to Kil-cycloserine is 0. 46. Since l-cycloserine {{is an effective}} inhibitor, it is concluded that the cycloserine hypothesis {{does not apply to}} the enzyme from E. coli W...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} Al-Zn-Mg-Cu system alloys with {{different}} microstructures, i. e., a fully recrystallized fine-grain and an un-recrystallized sub-grain, {{were prepared to}} investigate their tensile properties and stress corrosion cracking, SCC, resistance. The former is the superplastic material(SP), and {{the latter is a}} typical one of the commercial materials(CM). The effects of grain shapes and orientation on SCC resistance were discussed {{on the basis of the}} SCC test and fractography. The main results obtained in the present work are as follows:(1) When the orientations, L and T, of specimens were in agreement to rolling direction, the values of mechanical Young's modulus, tensile strength and 0. 2 % proof stress of both SP and CM materials were nearly equal. However, the elongation of CM material was higher than SP one. (2) The nucleation time and life of SCC on L-and T-directions of CM material were longer than those of SP one. SCC resistance in the CM material was superior to that in the SP material. (3) Anisotropy of specimen orientation for SCC life was not observed in the SP material. In the CM material, on the other hand, SCC life on <b>L-direction</b> was longer than that of T-direction. The anisotropy on SCC life observed in the CM material seemed to be related to an easy separation of interfaces between the matrix and the inclusions having Fe and Si elements existing continuously along the grain boundaries by hot rolling...|$|E

Therefore, early detection is essential. We investigated the imaging properties of clinically diagnosed melanocytic choroidal tumors using a nonmydriatic ultra-wide-field scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) with two laser wavelengths to distinguish benign from malignant lesions. Repeated standardized ultrasound (US) evaluation provided reference standard. Methods: In a consecutive series of 49 patients with clinically diagnosed melanocytic &shy;choroidal tumors in one eye, 29 had established melanoma (defined by proven growth on repeated US follow-up) and 20 had nevi (defined by no malignancy according to clinical, US, and growth &shy;characteristics for at least 2 years). All patients underwent clinical examination, undilated Optomap? (Optos PLC, Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, UK) imaging, standardized US &shy;examination, and standard retinal photography. Measurements of the tumor base using the Optomap software were compared with US B-scan measurements. Imaging characteristics from the SLO images were correlated with the structural findings in the two patient groups. Results: Measurements of tumor base correlated well between SLO and US with r = 0. 61 (T-direction) and r = 0. 51 (<b>L-direction).</b> On SLO imaging, typical malignant lesions appeared dark on the red laser channel and bright on the green laser channel. Based on those simple binary characteristics, a sensitivity of 76 % at a specificity of 70 % was obtained for a correct classification of lesions. When analogous to clinical examination lesion size, margin touching the optic disc, and existence of subretinal fluid were additionally considered, 90 % sensitivity at 82 % specificity was obtained. Conclusions: In this first, limited series, nonmydriatic SLO imaging with two laser wavelengths permitted to differentiate malignant ocular tumors from nonmalignant lesions with high &shy;diagnostic accuracy. Additional parameters may further enhance diagnostic properties, but larger patient series are required to validate our findings and prove the diagnostic properties.
