40|$|During the 20 th century, the Beduâ€™s {{environment}} was fragmented to form parts of Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This process has restricted their nomadic way of life. In Jordan, the Bedu {{were encouraged to}} settle in newly built towns {{on the edge of}} the desert and to exercise irrigated agriculture. Groundwater contamination has recently been recognized as a problem in Jordan. This paper attempts to estimate nitrate leaching to groundwater in part of the Azraq Basin using Geoinformatics. Data were gathered from fieldwork, secondary sources and remote sensing. GIS was used to estimate nitrate leaching to groundwater from cesspools and agriculture. Estimated <b>leaching</b> from <b>cesspools</b> ranged from approx. 800 to 1990 kg / year (approx. 0. 3 to 0. 7 kg per household per year). The estimated loss from agricultural land was from approx. 222 600 to 358 800 kg / year. In Jordan, water resources are scarce and are being degraded, while the demand for water use is increasing. This study indicates the urgent need to manage the expansion of agriculture in the region...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} study {{was made to}} determine the ability of three Oahu soils, Wahiawa, Lahaina, (both Low Humic Latosols), and Tantalus cinder to prevent possible contamination of the basal-water lens by the passage of virus. The study was performed utilizing columns containing the selected soils and subject to intermittent percolating water containing a known concentration of Poliovirus Type 2, simulating the action of a <b>cesspool</b> <b>leaching</b> into the ground. The effluent from the soil column was collected and analyzed for viral content by the plaque forming techniques. Breakthrough of the virus occurred in both Wahiawa and Lahaina soils at soil thicknesses of 6 -inch, 2 1 / 2 -inch, and 1 1 / 2 -inch at applied concentration of 1. 5 x 10 ^ 5 pfu/ml of feed solution. The virus removal was over 97 percent of the applied titer. The Tantalus cinder proved ineffective in withholding the virus at the applied concentration of 1. 5 x 10 ^ 5 pfu/ml of feed solution. The virus breakthrough varies between 39 percent to 78 percent of the applied titer. U. S. Department of the Interior Grant/Contract No. 14 - 01 - 0001 - 1630; A- 000 -H...|$|R
