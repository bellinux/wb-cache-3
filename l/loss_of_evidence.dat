For over five years, the murder case remained unsolved and with several irregularities, including the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> In 1989, {{several members of the}} extinct Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's top police force, were arrested for their involvement in the murder of Buendía.

Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion which upheld the search. Due to the specific circumstances of the case, the police needed to prevent the investigation scene from being contaminated. Breyer wrote that the Court found [...] "no case in which [...] held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time." [...] Moreover, McArthur's argument that his decision to remain on his porch and not allow the police entry did not amount to [...] "a constructive eviction". Instead, Breyer noted that the Court found in a prior case that the doorway of a house is in a 'public place' and thus not subject to warrant rules. He noted in conclusion that the hard-to-contest fact of probable cause made it difficult to accept McArthur's claims.|$|E

50|$|Many of the men's {{supporters}}, {{and opponents}} who still believe them guilty, were {{unhappy with the}} unusual plea deal. In 2011, supporters pushed Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe to pardon Echols, Baldwin, and Misskelley based on their innocence. Beebe said he would deny the request unless there was evidence showing someone else committed the murders. Prosecutor Scott Ellington said the Arkansas state crime laboratory would help seek other suspects by running searches on any DNA evidence produced in private laboratory tests during the defense team's investigation. This would include running the results through the FBI's Combined DNA Index System database. Ellington said that, although he still considered the men guilty, the three would likely be acquitted if a new trial were held because of the powerful legal counsel representing them now, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> over time, and the change of heart {{among some of the}} witnesses.|$|E

5000|$|When police {{confiscate}} {{and destroy}} a citizen's photographs or recordings of officers' misconduct, the police's act of destroying the evidence may be prosecuted {{as an act}} of evidence tampering, if the recordings being destroyed are potential evidence in a criminal or regulatory investigation of the officers themselves. [...] In a notable case in Nebraska, officers were charged with the felony charge of evidence tampering, as well as misdemeanor obstruction and theft, when they committed brutality and forcibly stole and destroyed the recordings, which was exposed due to a third party's recording. [...] On the other hand, when police departments lose exonerating evidence that would create reasonable doubt for defendants in the cases they prosecute, such as dashboard-camera footage from patrol cars, it may be regarded as spoliation of evidence, potentially justifying motions to dismiss and/or mistrials. Police's <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> such as footage may be considered as both spoliation and tampering, if it both exonerates the defendant and proves police misconduct. Spoliation of exonerating evidence in criminal cases may also constitute prosecutorial misconduct if the prosecutor is complicit in doing so.|$|E

He became head of the order {{commission}} of the AKCR in 1970, a position he held until 1985. From this work evolved the book Die Träger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes, 1939-1945 (The bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939-1945). For many years this book was considered a reference work on this topic. Fellgiebel himself indicated that the book was not official. The deteriorating situation of Nazi Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process; <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> of the presentation was also an issue in the verification process.

Failures result in process documentation not being recorded, thereby causing the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that a process occurred. We have designed F-PReP, a protocol to guarantee the recording of process documentation {{in the presence of}} failures. This paper discusses its implementation and evaluates its performance.

50|$|Change happens {{continually}} to languages, but {{not usually}} {{at a constant}} rate, with its cumulative effect producing splits into dialects, languages and language families.

Finally there could be <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> any <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> relatedness. Changes of one type may not affect other types, for example sound changes do not affect cognancy.

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> much <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|R

40|$|Currently, network {{evidence}} {{used in a}} {{court of}} law can be lacking and inadequate for prosecution purposes, due to a loss of packets during the network transmission. This packet loss in turn may be caused by the congestion of data transmitted over the network, further delaying the transmitted data. This paper extends the work on a forensic model for traffic isolation based on Differentiated Services (DiffServ). This model intends to solve the packet loss problem that can result to insufficient evidence. It isolates suspicious traffic from the normal flow by placing it on the dedicated route using DiffServ prioritising characteristics. This avoids traffic congestion of the suspicious traffic. The LTI model further includes the preservation station which serves to record all suspicious traffic before it is forwarded to its destination. This paper looks at the analysis and design of the logical traffic isolation model using various UML design artefacts. By incorporating various design algorithms, this paper aims at designing the more flexible and reliable system, with a minimal <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence...</b>|$|E
