40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "NGA modified the original scope of work for the Technology Center but met the original data-storage requirement. DOD has <b>limited</b> <b>written</b> <b>guidance</b> on what constitutes a complete and usable facility. However, NGA, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and Army officials believe the Technology Center constitutes a complete and usable facility because it meets its intended purpose of creating 10 petabytes of data storage to replace the data-storage capabilities at the sites that were closed by the implementation of BRAC Recommendation 168. Although the construction of NGAs new Technology Center was planned {{as part of the}} implementation of a BRAC recommendation to consolidate various NGA satellite locations at a new NGA facility, advances in data-storage technology led NGA to revise downward the space in the Technology Center that it would need to fit out to accommodate its data-storage needs. NGA also increased the electrical density in the new facility, even though the amount of space was reduced. As a result, NGA modified the original scope of work for the center {{during the course of the}} BRAC construction project, and one of the two floors of the new building originally planned for data storage was not fitted out. NGA officials told us that they believed completing both floors would have provided more data-storage capability than their identified requirements called for and therefore would have gone beyond the intent of the BRAC recommendation to consolidate existing capability. The original documentation of the requirements for the NGA construction project lacked some details such as the identification of the Technology Center as a primary or supporting facility, and there was a lack of clarity regarding which DOD organization should be responsible for oversight of this project. As a result, the original decision to change the scope of the project by not fitting out the third floor of the Technology Center was not communicated to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, to the projects business managerthe Department of the Armyor to Congress. Therefore they were unable to participate in that decision. NGA did provide these officials with information regarding the decision at a later date. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to measure potential research subjects’ {{participation in a}} survey research design, based on level and type of informed consent required before enrollment. In this prospective, randomized trial, 300 eligible Emergency Department participants were randomized {{to one of three}} groups: verbal consent (n = 100), <b>limited</b> <b>written</b> consent (n = 100), and detailed written consent with signature (n = 100). The consent was related to a self-administered patient satisfaction survey. The primary outcome was level of participation, where participation was categorized as full, limited, or refusal. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CI) constructed about proportions were used to assess differences in participation rates between the three consent groups. Among 300 participants, no demographic differences were found between groups for age or gender. Participants who were randomized to complete the detailed written consent had a significantly lower rate of full participation (72 %) when compared to those randomized to verbal consent (85 %; mean difference between groups 13 %, 95 % CI 2 % to 24 %) and to those with <b>limited</b> <b>written</b> consent (84 %; mean difference between groups 12 %, 95 % CI 1 % to 23 %). Participants randomized to detailed written consent also had a significantly higher refusal rate (23 %) when compared to those in the <b>limited</b> <b>written</b> group (12 %; mean difference between groups − 11 %, 95 % CI − 21 % to − 1 %). The length and type of informed consent required affected potential research subject participation in a survey research design.
