30|$|During the Roman period {{lead was}} cheaper and more easily {{obtainable}} than zinc or other metals, and high lead contents are often observed in casted objects.

40|$|A {{large number}} of Cu-based archaeological {{artefacts}} from the Mediterranean basin have been selected for investigation of their chemical composition, metallurgical features and corrosion products (i. e. the patina). The guidelines for {{the selection of the}} Cu-based artefacts have taken into account the representativeness of the Mediterranean archaeological context, the manufacturing technique, the degradation state and the expected chemical composition and structure of the objects. The results show wide variation of the chemical composition of the alloys that include all kinds of ancient Cu-based alloys such as low and high tin, and also <b>leaded</b> <b>bronzes,</b> copper and copper-iron alloys. The examination of the alloy matrix shows largely different metallurgical features thus indicating the use of different manufacturing techniques for producing the artefacts. The results of the micro-chemical investigation of the patina show the structures and the chemical composition of the stratified corrosion layers where copper or tin depletion phenomenon are commonly observed with a remarkably surface enrichment of some soil elements such as P, S, Ca, Si, Fe, Al and Cl. This information indicates the strict interaction between soil components and corrosion reactions and products. In particular, the ubiquitous and near constant presence of chlorine in the corrosion layers is observed in the patina of the archaeological Cu-based artefacts found in different contexts in Italy, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Spain and Tunisia. This latter occurrence is considered dangerous because it could induce a cyclic corrosion reaction of copper that could disfigure the artefact. The micro-chemical and micro-structural results also show that another source of degradation of the bronze archaeological artefacts, are their intrinsic metallurgical features whose formation is induced during the manufacturing of the objects, carried out in ancient times by repeated cycles of cold or hot mechanical work and thermal treatments. These combined treatments induce crystallisation and segregation phenomena of the impurities along the grain boundaries and could cause mechanical weakness and increase the extent of the inter-granular corrosion phenomena...|$|R

40|$|The role of iron in the {{emergence}} of Iron Age states in North Africa and the Near East has been poorly understood due to a paucity of contemporary, diachronic ferrous archaeometallurgical data.

Analysis of the materials employing metallography, portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF), and variable pressure scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy x-ray dispersive spectroscopy (VPSEM-EDS) indicates that Carthaginian smiths were smelting and smithing wrought iron and steel as an exchange good or tribute commodity to Tyre and the Assyrian empire, as well as producing, refining, and consuming tin and arsenical <b>bronzes,</b> <b>leaded</b> <b>bronzes,</b> lead, and cobalt. Archaeological evidence demonstrates a state industry of iron production, including the commissioning, decommissioning, and outsourcing of metallurgical precincts. There is an overwhelming difference exhibited between output capacity at industrial and household production sites. Epigraphic evidence in Punic illustrates the inherent economic and familial affiliations between the Carthaginian state and metalworkers. Ironsmiths, bronze casters, and goldsmiths were privileged engineers of one of the state's most strategic industries, and were stratified in a hierarchy of technical specialties and ranks. In order to conserve fuel and succeed in properly vitrifying ore or bloom impurities into slag, they recycled industrial byproducts in the form of murex shells from purple dye production as a metallurgical flux and lined the furnaces with quartz-rich heat insulation. Carthage was one colony in the Phoenician commodity procurement network, whose task it was to convert iron blooms into final products. By the time this colony became independent of Tyre ca. 650 - 550 BC, the smiths of Carthage already had around a century of expertise in the production of iron and steel implements which gave the state a competitive advantage in the strategic arena of ferrous technologies and the formation of empire...|$|R

The addition of bi-triazole (BiTA) in this test solution showed a marked decrease of the anodic peak current. This compound therefore stabilises the patina covering the bronze artefact. The impedance spectra obtained with cavity microelectrode were interpreted by an equivalent circuit comprising the charge transfer resistance, the double layer capacitance, the resistance and capacitance representing the reversible process taking place at the electrode surface, and the spherical diffusion of the dissolved oxygen.

When applied in China {{to the use of}} <b>leaded</b> tin <b>bronze</b> to cast the large and numerous ritual vessels of the Shang (c. 1500 - 1045 BC) and the Zhou dynasties (c. 1045 - 771 BC), the methodology reveals the complexity of the copper sources on which the major late Shang capital at Anyang depended for its bronze workshops. This has been recognised by many in the past, but has yet to prompt a full reassessment of the organisation of the Shang bronze industry. Here we point out the possibility of a need to transport copper from distant regions in the south, on the Yangzi, and even from far to the north, in northeast China. Using lead isotope data, presented in a new format, we attempt to enlarge the understanding of this organisation, demonstrating that, while the Zhou took over some of the range of copper available to the middle Anyang period, the lead sources exploited in early and middle Anyang phases differed from those taken up by the Zhou. The methodology enables a further understanding of the network on which the major dynasties depended for supplies of copper, lead and tin, and can thus lead us towards one of the major objectives of the new interpretational system - to give equal weight to archaeological and chemical data...|$|R

Blue and blue-green carbonyl corrosion of bronze is a recent discovery {{in part due to}} its mistaken attribution over the years to bronze disease, chalconatronite, and azurite. This project examines sources of acetic acid, and evaluates the environmental conditions in which acetate corrosion develops and the influence of alloyed lead and sodium contaminants in this process. Case studies identifying corrosion by XRD on predominantly Egyptian archaeological bronzes, with a focus on Saqqara, revealed a preponderance of a sodium copper carbonate acetate and copper sodium formate acetate. These were identified on the majority of Saqqara bronzes sampled in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Ashmolean Museum, Liverpool Museum, Petrie Museum and British Museum. Unknown compounds not included in the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) catalogue were also discovered. Due to the novelty of this discovery, the conservation of bronze with carbonyl corrosion is as yet an unexplored area. This project examines passive and active means of conservation.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the modes of {{production}} and the sources of metal supply for Migration period bow brooches, concentrating on a single form, the Anglian cruciform brooch. The thesis is in two volumes; text and bibliography (volume 1), catalogues, tables, illustrations (volume 2). The text is in six chapters. Attitudes to artefact studies are briefly discussed in Chapter 1 and the techniques employed {{in this study are}} outlined. Chapter 2 places the cruciform brooch forms into a simple hierarchical typology by formal similarity. A relative chronology is gained by contextual evidence, with absolute dates given by associations with other artefact types. Similarities between early English and continental forms are shown to be adequate to suggest importation, {{during the first half of}} the fifth century. Frisian and north German brooches have a special place in this system. Parallel stylistic development persisted during the second half of the fifth century but sixth-century English brooches are well distinguished from their continental contemporaries. Simple brooch types are thought to have had a long period of production and use. By examining methods of casting and assembling cruciform brooches, Chapter 3 establishes the types and ranges of technical variation observable. Some of these technical attributes provide links between England, Frisia, northern Germany and Denmark. English brooch manufacture is diverse throughout the period under study. Norwegian metalworkers developped a very different style and the technical evidence suggests a movement towards standardisation and mass production. In Chapter 4 we discover the types of alloy used and discuss the likely sources. Initially the alloys used were <b>leaded</b> brasses or <b>bronzes.</b> By the sixth century, copper alloys were commonly very impure. It is suggested that recycling provided a major part of the raw materials for cast copper alloys. Imports of copper alloys from France or the Celtic regions of Britain are relegated to a position of minor importance. The chemical compositions of Norwegian, Frisian, north German and Dutch cruciform brooches demonstrates access to high-tin, high-purity bronzes prevailed throughout the period. Brasses and mixed alloys were also available, probably originating from scrap. With the exception of Frisia, which appears to be more similar to Kent, alloy supplies were similar throughout the Scandinavian and continental cruciform brooch production. Chapter 5 provides a synthesis for these findings. Plans are given for a project extension into other regions (Chapter 6). </p...|$|R
