40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to clarify the}} relation between self-esteem level (high vs. low) and perceived self-esteem stability (within-person variability) by using a behavioral genetics approach. We tested whether the same or independent genetic and environmental influences impact on <b>level</b> and <b>stability.</b> Adolescent twin siblings (n = 183 pairs) completed <b>level</b> and <b>stability</b> scales at two time points. Heritability for both was substantial. The remaining variance in each was attributable to non-shared environmental influences. Shared environmental influences were not significant. <b>Level</b> and <b>stability</b> of self-esteem shared common antecedents via genetic and non-shared environmental influences. Nonetheless, stability was influenced by substantial unique genetic and non-shared environmental influences.

50|$|Wicksell's most {{influential}} contribution was {{his theory of}} interest, originally published in German language as Geldzins und Güterpreise, in 1898. The English translation Interest and Prices became available in 1936; a literal translation of the original title would read Money Interest and Commodity Prices. Wicksell invented the key term natural rate of interest and defined it at that interest rate which is compatible with a stable price level. If the interest rate falls short of the natural rate, inflation is likely to arise; if the interest rate exceeds the natural rate, this will tend to produce deflation. An interest rate that coincides with the natural rate ensures equilibrium in the commodity market and produces price <b>level</b> <b>stability.</b> This theory {{was adopted by the}} Austrian School, which theorized that an economic boom happened when the interest rate fell short of the natural rate.|$|E

40|$|The rule bounded {{currency}} board-system is {{a contribution}} to a process of convergence between the price level of the currency board-country and the anchor currency-country. However this strategy includes the risk of an inadequate provision with liquidity in the currency board-country. In the long run this corresponds {{to the risk of}} increasing the structural unemployment. Keeping up the currency board-principle of a sufficient reserve backing, the orientation of the monetary expansion to the inevitable inflation rate may reduce this risk. However it also raises the risk of a reduced credibility concerning monetary policy and price <b>level</b> <b>stability.</b> In conclusion there exists a trade-off between the credib ility of monetary discipline and therefore price <b>level</b> <b>stability,</b> and the monetary flexibility and employment and therefore the credibility of keeping up the currency board-system in the long run. ...|$|E
40|$|The European Central Bank (ECB) has price <b>level</b> <b>stability</b> as {{its primary}} target, and {{operates}} via an interest-rate measure {{to achieve its}} target over the short term.

We analyzed the behavior of monetary aggregates, {{and concluded that the}} ECB's use of M 3 may have some merit over the medium to longer-term as an indicator of price pressure from a quantity theory of money perspective. But {{there appears to be a}} question as to stability of money demand since it is not clear if there is a constant interest-rate elasticity. So, in practice, it remains unclear if the ECB gives much credence to any of the monetary aggregates. In particular, this applies to M 3 since the ECB cannot directly control that measure...|$|E

40|$|Software Stability Modeling (SSM) is a {{promising}} software development methodologybased on object-oriented programming to achieve model <b>level</b> <b>stability</b> and reusability. Among the three critical categories of objects proposed by SSM, the businessobjects {{play a critical}} role in connecting the stable problem essentials (enduringbusiness themes) and the unstable object implementations (industry objects). Thebusiness objects are especially difficult to implement and often raise confusion inthe implementation because of their unique characteristics: externally stable andinternally unstable. The implementation and code <b>level</b> <b>stability</b> is not the majorconcern. How to implement the objects in a stable model through object-orientedprogramming without losing its stability is a big challenge in the real softwaredevelopment. In this paper, we propose new methods to realize the businessobjects in the implementation of stable model. We also rephrase the definition ofthe business objects from the implementation perspective, in hope the newdescription can help software developers to adopt and implement stable modelsmore easily. Finally, we describe the implementation of a stable model for a balloonrental resource management scope to illustrate the advantages of the proposedmethod...|$|E

Despite the sophistication of many of the available programs, there exists a class of problem for which they remain, as yet, unsuited. [Continues. ...|$|E

40|$|In the paper, {{we provide}} a {{critical}} and selective survey of arguments relevant {{for the assessment}} of the case for price level path stability (PLPS). Using a standard hybrid new Keynesian model we argue that price <b>level</b> <b>stability</b> provides a natural framework for monetary policy under commitment. There are two main arguments in favour of a PLPS regime. First, it helps overall macroeconomic stability by making expectations operate like automatic stabilizers. Second, under a price level path stability regime, changes in the price level operate like an intertemporal adjustment mechanism, reducing the magnitude of required changes in nominal interest rates. Such a property is particularly relevant as a means to alleviate the importance of the zero bound on nominal interest rates. We also review and discuss the arguments against price level path stability. Finally, we also found, using the Smets and Wouters (2003) model which includes a wide variety of frictions and is estimated for the euro area, that the price level is stationary under optimal policy under commitment. The results obtain when the quasi-difference of inflation is used in the loss function, as in the hybrid new Keynesian model. Overall, the arguments in favour of or against price level path stability depend on the degree of dependence of private sector expectations on the characteristics of the monetary policy regime.
