25|$|The P7 is a {{semi-automatic}} blowback-operated firearm. It {{features a}} unique gas-delayed blowback <b>locking</b> <b>system</b> {{modeled on the}} Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5), which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and fed them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} piston contained inside a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined—after the bullet has left the barrel—hence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Glock {{announced}} the Internal <b>Locking</b> <b>System</b> (ILS) safety feature. The ILS is a manually activated lock {{located in the}} back of the pistol's grip. It is cylindrical in design and, according to Glock, each key is unique. When activated, the lock causes a tab to protrude from the rear of the grip, giving both a visual and tactile indication as to whether the lock is engaged or not. When activated, the ILS renders the Glock unfireable, as well as making it impossible to disassemble. When disengaged, the ILS adds no further safety mechanisms to the Glock pistol. The ILS is available as an option on most Glock pistols. Glock pistols cannot be retrofitted to accommodate the ILS. The lock must be factory built in Austria and shipped as a special order.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} secure storage {{stretches}} {{far back in}} time. The earliest known locks {{were made by the}} Egyptians. Ancient Romans used a more sophisticated <b>locking</b> <b>system,</b> called warded locks. Warded locks had special notches and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient India, Russia, and China, where the combination lock is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron safes fitted with a key lock up until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century. After the Gold Rush of 1849, unsuccessful prospectors turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break into the bank using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief could get it out a window, and take it to a secluded spot to break it open.|$|E
25|$|Locks can {{be applied}} on {{different}} levels of granularity—on entire tables, pages, or even on a per-row basis on tables. For indexes, it can either be on the entire index or on index leaves. The level of granularity to be used is defined on a per-database basis by the database administrator. While a fine-grained <b>locking</b> <b>system</b> allows more users to use the table or index simultaneously, it requires more resources, so it does not automatically yield higher performance. SQL Server also includes two more lightweight mutual exclusion solutions—latches and spinlocks—which are less robust than locks but are less resource intensive. SQL Server uses them for DMVs and other resources that are usually not busy. SQL Server also monitors all worker threads that acquire locks {{to ensure that they}} do not end up in deadlocks—in case they do, SQL Server takes remedial measures, which in many cases are to kill one of the threads entangled in a deadlock and roll back the transaction it started. To implement locking, SQL Server contains the Lock Manager. The Lock Manager maintains an in-memory table that manages the database objects and locks, if any, on them along with other metadata about the lock. Access to any shared object is mediated by the lock manager, which either grants access to the resource or blocks it.|$|E
500|$|Just Cause 2 was {{developed}} by the Swedish Avalanche Studios, with Square Enix London Studios providing additional support. The game's predecessor, Just Cause, was a moderate commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. The team thought that although it had potential, it was an opportunity missed and described Just Cause 2 as a [...] "sequel waiting to be made". Shortly after the start of development, the team begin analyzing the first game's strengths and weaknesses with the intention of improving it. They wanted to use the large open world to create rewarding quests and missions, dropping the first game's side missions in favor of faction missions, stronghold takeovers and race challenges to increase gameplay density (keeping players occupied, even when simply exploring the world). This density increased the connectivity between the faction and Agency missions. Another goal was to improve the game's combat and artificial intelligence, so action stunts would be easier to perform and the game's tactical element would increase. The team overhauled the artificial intelligence, improving enemy characters' reaction to player action and their environment. The game [...] features a Hybrid <b>Locking</b> <b>System,</b> which make aiming easier, and a real-time destruction system. The team refined the game's driving mechanics to make them feel more realistic.|$|E

500|$|Kingda Ka's over-the-shoulder {{restraint}} system {{consists of a}} thick, rigid lap bar and two thin, flexible over-the-shoulder restraints. Because the over-the-shoulder portions of the restraint are not rigid, the hand grips are mounted to the lap bar. Kingda Ka's restraints are also held down by a belt, in case the main <b>locking</b> <b>system</b> fails. To speed loading, riders are asked to secure their own restraints if possible.Kingda Ka's station has two parallel tracks, with switch tracks at the entrance and exit. Each of the station's tracks is designed to accommodate two trains, so {{each of the four}} trains can be operated from its own station. While all of the trains are mechanically identical and able to load and unload at each of the four individual station bays the original plan was for all trains to operate {{at the same time and}} for each train to load and unload at their own station. During normal operation, trains on one side are loaded while trains on the other side are launched. When both sides of the station are in use an employee directs riders in line to go to a particular side, where they can choose to sit in the front or rear of the train. During recent seasons it has become common that only one train bay (the forward one on the side opposite of the parking lot) be used for the loading, unloading, and dispatching of trains and that the other train or trains in operation on any given day wait either in the station behind a loading/unloading train or outside of the station on the brakes that follow the second hill. Two operators load, check and dispatch each train; another launches the trains. Kingda Ka's music is by Safri Duo; almost their entire Episode II album is played in the queue and station. The other is the remix version of Survivor's [...] "Eye of the Tiger", played by DJ Quicksilver. Both of these may be heard during the queue and in the station.|$|E
500|$|The Type 94 pistol is {{operated}} by a different mechanism than previous Japanese sidearms. Unlike previously designed Nambu pistols, the Type 94 operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer. According to authors, Harry L. Derby and James [...] D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point. The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu. The <b>locking</b> <b>system</b> is a rising-block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel. The single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel instead of {{to the rear of}} the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols. [...] The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood but according to author Jeff Kinard, are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands. The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol. The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the [...] pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface. The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster. The manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame. The front blade sight on the muzzle of the Type 94 pistol and the rear fixed V were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed. The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed.|$|E

40|$|A passive {{decomposition}} {{framework for}} the formation and maneuver controls for multiple rigid bodies is proposed. In this approach, the group dynamics of the multiple agents is decomposed into two decoupled systems: The shape system representing internal group formation shape (formation, in short), and the <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> abstracting the overall group maneuver as a whole (maneuver, in short). The decomposition is natural in that the shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> have dynamics similar to the mechanical systems, and the total energy is preserved. The shape and <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> can be decoupled {{without the use of}} net energy. The decoupled shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> can be controlled individually to achieve the desired formation and maneuver tasks. Since all agents are given equal status, the proposed scheme enforces a group coherence among the agents. By abstracting a group maneuver by its <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> whose dynamics {{is similar to that of}} a single agent, a hierarchical control structure for the multiple agents can be easily imposed in the proposed framework. A decentralized version of the controller is also proposed, which requires only undirected line communication (or sensing) graph topology. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2764507...|$|R

40|$|ASSA ABLOY [1] {{is today}} the global leader in door opening {{solutions}} dedicated to satisfying end-user needs for security, safety and convenience. Their <b>lock</b> <b>systems</b> are certified together with different doors against break-ins according to SS-EN 1630 : 2011 +A 1 : 2016 [2]. This standard specifies how long time the tests maximum should take and what tools that {{are allowed to}} be used. These tests are, however, very expensive though both a new door and a new <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> are destroyed. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to develop a method for analyzing the <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> in a door {{with the help of}} commercial computational software in the specific case of a break-in with a crowbar. A model of one of ASSA ABLOY's <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> and a steel door with glass window are created in the commercial Multi-Body Dynamics software Adams. A convergence study is performed on the model with help of optimization methods in the software HEEDS. This model's purpose is to compute stresses and deformations in the <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> and from that analyze sensitive and exposed areas. With further development the model can be used to do a design optimization on the <b>lock</b> <b>system.</b> To get a better visualization of the break-in simulation the MaxFlex tool in Adams, a tool that can handle non linearity, is introduced. The knowledge about the tool is very limited from the beginning and after some simulations a conclusions that Adams is not the optimal software for this problem is drawn. Without any movements and mechanisms in the model a commercial Finite Element software is more appropriate due to shorter simulation time. Adams is adapted to relatively short time steps which is needed when movements and mechanisms are involved, but unnecessary for this model. A new model of the <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> is created in the Finite Element software Abaqus. This model is compared to measured data from a physical test and {{it can be seen that}} the deformation on the <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> has similar shape as in the physical test, but with a smaller total deformation...|$|R
