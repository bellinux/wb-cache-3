As a result of Renault's purchase of interest, Yanase canceled its <b>licensing</b> <b>contract</b> with Renault in the spring of 2000, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee, hence sales of the Lutecia II in Japan were transferred from Yanase Store locations to Nissan Red Stage Store locations.|$|E

Our empirical results suggest that strategic behaviour seems to be relevant {{for the design of}} <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts,</b> whereas inventor moral hazard and risk aversion of licensor or licensee seem to be irrelevant. Moreover, our results suggest that uncertainty regarding the profitability of licensed technology influenced the design of <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts.</b> More specifically, profit sharing agreements or producer milestones were typically included into <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts.</b> Economic History, Germany, pre- 1913, <b>Licensing</b> <b>contracts,</b> Technology transfer...|$|R

Suppose patent disclosure enables imitation, a <b>license</b> <b>contract</b> with a lower fixed feemay discourage imitation.

Industry, firm, and contract characteristics are used to explain differences between the forms of payment in <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts.</b> Our findings support theoretical arguments; <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts</b> {{are more likely to}} use royalties when sales are relatively high, while increased volatility of sales and greater profitability favor fixed fee contracts. We also find that firms are more likely to use output based payments to control the sale and diffusion of R&D or brand intensive know-how to unaffiliated firms.

25|$|In 1985, Disney and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{entered into}} a <b>licensing</b> <b>contract</b> that gave Disney {{worldwide}} rights to use the MGM brand and logo for what would become Disney-MGM Studios, which included working production facilities for movies and television shows and a satellite animation studio, which began operation prior to the park's debut. In 1988, MGM/UA responded by filing a lawsuit that claimed Disney violated the agreement by operating a working movie and television studio at the resort. On May 1, 1989, the theme park opened adjacent to the production facilities, with MGM's only affiliation being the original licensing agreement that allowed Disney to use MGM's name and lion logo in marketing, and separate contracts that allowed specific MGM content {{to be used in}} The Great Movie Ride. When the park first opened, the only two attractions were the Studio Backlot Tour and the Great Movie Ride.|$|E

This supports Jensen and Thursby's (2001) model, who propose equity-sharing <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts</b> to solve moral hazard problems. Moreover, we show that milestones were a substitute for profit shares. Furthermore, exclusive licences offered a significantly higher profit share to the licensor...|$|R
