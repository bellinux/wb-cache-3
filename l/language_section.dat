The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing English names which seem bizarre to native English speakers. Names like Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale are pretty common, and even the real English names chosen by Chinese often tend to be rarely used by native English speakers.|$|E
