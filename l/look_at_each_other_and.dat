5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} the third episode of the series {{directed}} by Greg Daniels. Daniels had previously directed the episodes [...] "Basketball" [...] and [...] "The Dundies". [...] "The Client" [...] was written by Paul Lieberstein, who acts on the show as human resources director Toby Flenderson. The idea for Jan and Michael to have a romantic relationship was conceived by Steve Carell {{as far back as}} the filming of the pilot episode. According to writer and producer Greg Daniels [...] "it was like he (Michael) was turned on by his teacher." [...] Writer and actor Paul Lieberstein said that the first idea that anybody came up for the episode was the final shot, where Jim and Michael <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> shake their heads, suggesting that they had been through similar experiences. The rest of the episode was written to lead to that scene. The scene where Oscar tells a story about a date getting a background check on him was based on an actual date that Paul Lieberstein went on.|$|E
2500|$|It becomes {{apparent}} {{that there is}} a huge social gulf between Jimmy and Alison. Her family is upper-middle-class military, perhaps verging on upper class, while Jimmy is decidedly working class. He had to fight hard against her family's disapproval to win her. [...] "Alison's mummy and I took one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> from then on the age of chivalry was dead", he explains. We also learn that the sole family income is derived from a sweet stall in the local market—an enterprise that is surely well beneath Jimmy's education, let alone Alison's [...] "station in life".|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{entering}} college, Robinson held {{a short-term}} job as shoeshine man before {{getting a job}} as warehouse personnel. [...] After finishing his college degree, Robinson {{was unable to find}} a suitable career in his hometown of Gulfport. Robinson attributed this to racial discrimination as many of the local garages were under white ownership; speaking to his father, he said, [...] " [...] give me a job sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man... When I talk to [...] about automotive science they smile, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> then look at me like I belong behind a mule and a plow." ...|$|E
6000|$|The mate flushed darkly. [...] "I don’t {{know much}} about such things," [...] he said at length; [...] "but we’ll have to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> {{all that sort of}} thing, you know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... (The {{old friends}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> {{there is a}} silence. VALENTINE feels that all the fine tales and merry jests he has brought back for the ladies have turned into dead things. He wants to go away and think.) ...|$|E
60|$|The {{men would}} not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> if Eleanor {{had left them}} then {{it would have been}} a relief to both.

6000|$|From {{behind the}} horizon, a dozen miles off, between {{the din of}} guns [...] in the visible battle, there can be heard an ominous roar, as of a [...] second {{invisible}} battle in progress there. Generals and other [...] officers <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> hazard conjectures between whiles, [...] the French with exultation, the Prussians gloomily.|$|E

60|$|The {{party was}} now in full swing and proved a big success. The boys and girls played all sorts of games, and also did a little dancing. Then {{refreshments}} were served.

60|$|Whatever of import has {{happened}} since the ball, Patty knows it, and is enjoying it. We see this as she ushers in Miss Willoughby. Note also, with concern, that at mention of the visitor's name {{the eyes of the}} sisters turn affrightedly, not to the door by which their old friend enters, but to the closed door of the spare bed-chamber. Patty also gives it a meaning glance; then the three <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> two of them blanch.|$|E
6000|$|He took up an {{unlocked}} leather bag, {{which opened}} by touching a brass knob, and {{showed us the}} shawl, the linen (sadly faded by time) and the letter. We were puzzled by the shawl. My uncle, who {{had served in the}} East, thought it looked like a very rare kind of Persian work. We examined with interest the letter, and the fine linen. When Michael quietly remarked, as we handed them back to him, [...] "They keep the secret, you see," [...] we could only <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> own there was nothing more to be said.|$|E

60|$|They stood silent, {{not looking}} at each other, but looking at the evergreens which were being tossed, and were showing the pale {{underside}} of their leaves against the blackening sky. Will never enjoyed {{the prospect of a}} storm so much: it delivered him from the necessity of going away. Leaves and little branches were hurled about, and the thunder was getting nearer. The light was more and more sombre, but there came a flash of lightning which made them start and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> then smile. Dorothea began to say what she had been thinking of.|$|E
60|$|And {{about these}} additional, miscellaneous, and even {{inferior}} works of Dickens there is, moreover, another use and fascination which all Dickensians will understand; which, after a manner, {{is not for}} the profane. All who love Dickens have a strange sense that he is really inexhaustible. It is this fantastic infinity that divides him even from the strongest and healthiest romantic artists of a later day--from Stevenson, for example. I have read Treasure Island twenty times; nevertheless I know it. But I do not really feel as if I knew all Pickwick; I have not so much read it twenty times as read in it a million times; and it almost seemed as if I always read something new. We of the true faith <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> understand; yes, our master was a magician. I believe the books are alive; I believe that leaves still grow in them, as leaves grow on the trees. I believe that this fairy library flourishes and increases like a fairy forest: but the world is listening to us, and we will put our hand upon our mouth.|$|E
6000|$|Two o'clock came; and in {{a quarter}} of an hour {{afterward}} the visitors had arrived. Short as the notice had been, cheerless as the Sanitarium looked to spectators from without, the doctor's invitation had been largely accepted, nevertheless, by the female members of the families whom he had addressed. In the miserable monotony of the lives led by a large section of the middle classes of England, anything is welcome to the women which offers them any sort of harmless refuge from the established tyranny of the principle that all human happiness begins and ends at home. While the imperious needs of a commercial country limited the representatives of the male sex, among the doctor's visitors, to one feeble old man and one sleepy little boy, the women, poor souls, to the number of no less than sixteen--old and young, married and single--had seized the golden opportunity of a plunge into public life. Harmoniously united by the two common objects which they all had in view--in the first place, to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and,</b> in the second place, to look at the Sanitarium--they streamed in neatly dressed procession through the doctor's dreary iron gates, with a thin varnish over them of assumed superiority to all unladylike excitement, most significant and most pitiable to see! ...|$|E

60|$|Another day (it was Bryan's birthday) we {{were giving}} a grand ball and gala at Hackton, {{and it was}} time for my little Bryan to make his {{appearance}} among us, as he usually did in the smartest little court-suit you ever saw (ah me! but it brings tears into my old eyes now to think of the bright looks of that darling little face). There was a great crowding and tittering when the child came in, led by his half-brother, who walked into the dancing-room (would you believe it?) in his stocking-feet, leading little Bryan by the hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the elder! 'Don't you think he fits my shoes very well, Sir Richard Wargrave?' says the young reprobate: upon which the company began to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> to titter; and his mother, coming up to Lord Bullingdon with great dignity, seized the child to her breast, and said, 'From the manner in which I love this child, my Lord, you ought to know how I would have loved his elder brother had he proved worthy of any mother's affection!' and, bursting into tears, Lady Lyndon left the apartment, and the young lord rather discomfited for once.|$|E
60|$|Adam sat down, {{and they}} {{remained}} opposite {{to each other}} in uneasy silence, while Arthur slowly drank brandy-and-water, with visibly renovating effect. He began to lie in a more voluntary position, and looked as if he were less overpowered by bodily sensations. Adam was keenly alive to these indications, and as his anxiety about Arthur's condition began to be allayed, he felt more of that impatience which every one knows who has had his just indignation suspended by the physical state of the culprit. Yet there was one thing on his mind to be done before he could recur to remonstrance: it was to confess what had been unjust in his own words. Perhaps he longed all the more to make this confession, that his indignation might be free again; and as he saw the signs of returning ease in Arthur, the words again and again came to his lips and went back, checked by the thought {{that it would be better}} to leave everything till to-morrow. As long as they were silent they did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> a foreboding came across Adam that if they began to speak as though they remembered the past--if they looked at each other with full recognition--they must take fire again. So they sat in silence till the bit of wax candle flickered low in the socket, the silence all the while becoming more irksome to Adam. Arthur had just poured out some more brandy-and-water, and he threw one arm behind his head and drew up one leg in an attitude of recovered ease, which was an irresistible temptation to Adam to speak what was on his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{arrive at}} a just {{appreciation}} of the dangerous scoundrel whom {{we have to deal}} with," [...] this gentleman said. [...] "His preliminary experiment with the dog; his resolution to make suspicion an impossibility, by drinking from the same tea which he had made ready for you; his skilled preparation of an antidote, the color of which might court appearances by imitating water--are there many poisoners clever enough to provide themselves beforehand with such a defence as this? How are you to set the circumstances in their true light, on your side? You may say that you threw out the calculations, on which he had relied for securing his own safety, by drinking his second dose of the antidote while {{he was out of the}} room; and you can appeal to the fainting-fits from which you and he suffered on the same evening, as a proof that the action of the poison was partially successful; in your case and in his, because you and he were insufficiently protected by half doses only of the antidote. A bench of Jesuits would understand these refinements. A bench of British magistrates would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> say: Where is the medical evidence? No, Mr. Roylake, we must wait. You can't even turn him out of the cottage before he has had the customary notice to quit. The one thing to take care of--in case some other suspicions of ours turn out to be well founded--is that our man shall not give us the slip. One of my clerks, and one of your gamekeepers shall keep watch on his lodgings, turn and turn about, till his time is up. Go where he may after that, he shall not escape us." ...|$|E
