Lactic acid bacteria potentially can be introduced to inhibit pathogenic bacteria in the tapioca production at the extraction stage, especially during the settling process since there is possibility of starch slurry to be contaminated by pathogenic bacteria from water. The objectives of this research were to design a solid starter of LAB through encapsulation by using modified starch includes sour cassava starch, lintnerized cassava starch and nanocrystalline starch, utilize the starter for suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria in the production process of tapioca and characterize the functional properties of tapioca. The encapsulation of lactic acid bacteria was conducted by freeze drying at a temperature of - 50 °C for 48 hours. The viability of LAB after freeze drying with sour cassava starch matrix was 92 % of the <b>liquid</b> <b>starter,</b> with lintnerized cassava starch matrix was 93 %, while that with nanocrystalline matrix was 96 %. After application of the LAB culture during settling process for tapioca extraction and the tapioca was stored {{at room temperature for}} 6 months, it was shown that E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella were  detected in the native tapioca starch (without treatment) while the starch added with lactic acid bacteria starter was not absent for the pathogenic bacteria. The addition of lactic acid bacteria in extraction process can suppress the growth of pathogenic bacteria in tapioca. The results showed that lintnerized cassava starch matrix is the best matrix because after 6 months it still contained lactic acid bacteria as compared to <b>liquid</b> <b>starter</b> and that encapsulated with other matrixes. </p...|$|E

Results from this study showed that grain yield, early plant growth, and early N and P uptake often were greater with tillage than with no-tillage. Yield responses to starter fertilization occurred mainly in areas with soil-test P optimum for crop or lower (3 ̆c 21 mg kg- 1, Bray-P 1). Responses were less frequent and smaller than for tillage, and did not substitute for tillage effects on yield. Early growth and nutrient uptake responses to starter were large and occurred independently of soil-test values or other soil properties.

40|$|Numerous microorganisms, {{including}} bacteria, yeasts, and molds, {{are present}} in cheeses, forming a complex ecosystem. Among these organisms, bacteria are {{responsible for most of}} the physicochemical and aromatic transformations that are intrinsic to the cheesemaking process. Identification of the bacteria that constitute the cheese ecosystem is essential for understanding their individual contributions to cheese production. We used temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) to identify different bacterial species present in several dairy products, including members of the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus. The TTGE technique is based on electrophoretic separation of 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments by using a temperature gradient. It was optimized to reveal differences in the 16 S rDNA V 3 regions of bacteria with low-G+C-content genomes. Using multiple control strains, we first set up a species database in which each species (or group of species) was characterized by a specific TTGE fingerprint. TTGE was then applied to controlled dairy ecosystems with defined compositions, including <b>liquid</b> (<b>starter),</b> semisolid (home-made fermented milk), and solid (miniature cheese models) matrices. Finally, the potential of TTGE to describe the bacterial microflora of unknown ecosystems was tested with various commercial dairy products.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of Tasmanian and Victorian potatoes are grown on ferrosols, which have the highest Phosphorus (P) fixing capacities of any agricultural soils in Australia. Phosphorus rates well in excess of maintenance dressings are commonly used on potato crops grown on ferrosols. This is an increasing economic cost to growers and a cost to soil and potato quality because of the significant addition to soil P and cadmium (Cd) loads. Starter fertilisers have proved successful at improving the initial P nutrition and subsequent fertiliser efficiency of crops but have not been extensively trialed with potatoes. Field trials investigating the use of starter fertilisers on cv. Russet Burbank potatoes were conducted over three years on ferrosol soils on the North West Coast of Tasmania. Granular starter bands {{were used in the}} first year and <b>liquid</b> <b>starter</b> treatments were applied in the second year. In the final year granular starter bands in combination with hill-placed dripper and standard sprinkler irrigation were trialed. The distribution of potato roots was measured and correlated with soil strength and moisture properties and the fate of irrigation water applied to the potato canopy was studied on field grown plants and by a computer model. The effects of P rate and irrigation method on ground cover development were also measured. Glasshouse and laboratory trials were conducted to investigate the effects of starter fertiliser treatments and soil conditions on plant and root growth. No starter phosphorus application improved final tuber yield. Initial petiole weight and nutrient responses were found in the first year to starter P application and from drip irrigation of conventionally banded P, but not from the starter P band. <b>Liquid</b> <b>starter</b> P improved the P nutrition of glasshouse grown plants but had no effect on early plant nutrition or final tuber yield of field grown potatoes. Subsequent glasshouse experiments indicated that higher strength liquid solutions could be used without long term injury to potato plants. Ground cover development was hastened by P applications of 100 kg P ha- 1 or more and by drip irrigation in the absence of applied P. Total tuber yield was moderately correlated to ground cover measurements and there were indications that higher P applications improved the utilisation of solar radiation. There was evidence of root proliferation in the region of conventionally banded fertilisers but no indications of proliferation in the region where starter fertilisers were applied. When potato plants were left unhilled roots were able to grow out to and beyond the perimeter of the canopy. There was a prominent absence of root growth in the wheel-compacted soil of both unhilled and hilled potatoes with only sparse root growth into soil regions with bulk densities of 1. 05 Mg m- 3 and greater. Penetration resistance of soils with bulk density> 1. 1 Mg m- 3 increases sharply with drying to reach strengths capable of restricting root growth. Soils of lower bulk density are unable to reach penetration resistances that could inhibit potato root growth at any moisture content. Up to 20...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} whether starters used in {{the production}} of DOP Montasio cheese, whether prepared in liquid milk or reconstituted dried milk, can be regarded as a true ingredient, bearing in mind that all its components (particularly the casein) are found in the curd, 2 batches of cheese were made using approx. 3600 l milk plus 1 % (v/v) <b>starter</b> in either <b>liquid</b> or reconstituted dried milk form; batch milk without starter was used as control.

40|$|Use {{of surplus}} colostrum, which was {{collected}} from the first eight milkings postpartum, in calf rearing programs was investigated in two trials. In trial 1, 18 Holstein calves were assigned at three days of age {{to one of two}} liquid diets consisting of acidified colostrum stored at summer ambient temperatures (ACAT), or acidified milk replacer (AMR). In trial 2 (ACRE), 10 Holstein calves were fed acidified colostrum stored in refrigerator (2 to 4 �C). When surplus colostrum from their own dam was depleted, calves on ACAT and ACRE were fed acidified whole milk until weaning. Liquid diets were acidified with formic acid at 0. 23 % vol wt 1. Colostrum diets were offered to calves at 9 % of body weight per day and whole milk and milk replacer at 10 % of body weight per day. Liquid diets were fed twice daily. The amounts of liquid diets offered were adjusted weekly according to body weight. Calves were offered pelleted starter and water for ad libitum intake throughout the trials. The trials continued for six weeks. All calves were weaned {{at the end of the}} fifth week (at 37 days of age) and calves received only water and starter during the sixth week of the trials. All calves were housed in individual pens. On an average, surplus colostrum was sufficient to feed calves for 17 days. Refusals of colostrum by calves on ACAT were high due to undesirable fermentation of colostrum. Refusals of liquid diets were minimal for calves on ACRE and AMR throughout the trials. Dry matter intakes from <b>liquid</b> diet and <b>starter</b> were lower for calves on ACAT. Body weight gain was also lower for calves on ACAT. Mean daily gains for calves on AMR, ACAT and ACRE during liquid diet period (3 to 37 days of age) were 463. 3, 200. 8 and 468. 8 g, respectively. Reasons for decreased weight gains on ACAT were reduced intakes of <b>liquid</b> diet and <b>starter</b> and higher incidence of scours. Four calves (three males and one female) on ACAT were treated for scours. Based on feed expenses, cost of 1 kg weight gain during the trials was estimated to be TL 2, 935, 764 ($ 1. 86), TL 2, 967, 282 ($ 1. 88) and TL 1, 745, 220 ($ 1. 10) for calves on AMR, ACAT and ACRE, respectively.

40|$|In the 1970 s {{the sugar}} {{industry}} began {{moving away from}} steam turbine driven shredders in favour of electric motor drives. Due to the high inertias of the shredders, long starting times and high starting torque requirements, the preferred electric motor drives have been slip ring motors with liquid starters. With the demand for higher Preparation Indices the shredder motor powers gradually increased. These ever-larger motors together with the power swings generally associated with shredders began to impact negatively on the sugar mill power houses and {{had the potential to}} cause loss of synchronism of the TAs and factory blackouts. The accepted solution was to engineer an increase in the rotor resistance and thus motor slip in order to relieve the stress on the power supply of the large power swings. Increasing motor slip is easily carried out with slip ring motors and external wire wound resistances left in the rotor circuit during normal running. This solution has been the standard adopted in virtually all new southern African mills from then to the present day. Pressure is being brought to bear by the large motor manufacturers in that slip ring motors and <b>liquid</b> <b>starter</b> applications are falling out of favour and being replaced with reliable, medium voltage, variable speed drives connected to robust, simple and low maintenance squirrel cage motors.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Stand {{establishment}} plays {{a significant}} role in the development and yield of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Availability of soil moisture to the germinating seed is one of the most critical factors affecting stand establishment. Water injection is a method of applying supplemental moisture to the soil in direct contact with the seed by injecting small amounts of water into seed-zone at planting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate water injection as a means of enhancing stand establishment by improving soil moisture conditions surrounding the germinating seed. Several water injection and combinations of water with <b>liquid</b> <b>starter</b> fertilizer treatments were compared with a check which received no water, under different soil water potential treatments in growth chambers and in field studies. Two soft white winter wheat cultivars, Faro and Stephens, were compared. In preliminary experiments water was added to the seed-zone of dry soil (- 11 bars) at rates of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 ml/m row in one experiment 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 ml/m row in another (soil at - 15 bars). These treatments increased seed-zone moisture content immediately after adding water and the moisture remained higher for 9 days. Thus, it appeared that water injection should be effective in hastening imbibition by seeds. Subsequently, 40, 50 and 60 ml/m row water only and combination of each water rate with 5 ml/m row of a liquid fertilizer mixture, 10 - 34 - 0, improved stand establishment over the check under - 11 and - 15 bars soil moisture potentials. Higher concentrations of liquid fertilizer depressed germination and emergence rate. These studies were done in growth chambers. Water alone at rate of 50 ml/m and the combination of 50 ml/m water plus 5 ml/m 10 - 34 - 0 treatments, resulted in greater stand establishment, plant growth and yield compared to the check under - 11 bars tension in 1979 - 80 field study. Cultivars did not differ in stand establishment and plant growth due to water or water plus fertilizer injection. Both 20 and 40 ml water only treatments improved stand establishment over the check, but the 40 ml water/m row rate resulted in the greatest emergence and gave the highest emergence rate index under - 11 and - 9 bars tension in 1980 growth chamber study and 1980 - 81 field study, respectively. The 40 ml water/m row alone and the combination of 40 ml water/m row with low rates of fertilizer improved plant development, leaf P content and yield over the checks under - 9 bars tension in 1980 - 81 field study. All three water injections at rates of 20, 40 and 60 ml/m in 1981 - 82 field study increased seed-zone moisture content, and improved imbibition, stand establishment and seedling growth over the check in fallowed (- 6 bars) and non-fallowed (- 8 bars) ...|$|E
40|$|Sourdough is {{the dough}} {{containing}} natural LAB and yeast. Several products made from sourdough which are naturally fermented including the Chinese steamed bread and dumplings made in traditional ways and rye and wheat sourdough {{bread in the}} West. The distinguished taste, bigger size, extension of shelf life and higher nutrient facts feature the natural sourdough bread which is made from sourdough. However, developing the natural sourdough bread is complicated {{and it is hard}} to control the quality of bread because of its longer fermented time and complicated process. In this study two kinds of fruit, peach and grape, and two methods, refrigerated starter in bag method and continuous <b>liquid</b> <b>starter</b> method, are used to ferment sourdough bread. In the experiment of refrigerated starter in bag method peach is the major fruit to develop natural microorganisims and the sourdough starter is fermented in a bag at 10 ℃. After the natural microorganisms growing in the fermented liquid, two kinds of whole wheat flour are added to develop starter. Next, strong flour and water are both added into starter to make a dough style starter. Then, the dough style starter have been placed in a bag at 10 ℃ for 0, 5, 7 and 9 days before they are made into sourdough bread. Microorganisms like LAB and yeast, chemical quality factors like pH, TTA and sugar and components like soluble sugar, organic acid and alcohol are all investigated to know their immediate changes during fermentation processes. Through this investigation, two matters are understood including the meaning of every step in the process of bread making and how important a part each step plays in the process. Simultaneously, the fermented liquid, <b>liquid</b> <b>starter</b> and dough style starter are stored at - 20 ℃ to investigate if the sourdough microorganisms can be preserved. The test is to shorten some of steps in the process The results show that the better quality of sourdough bread making and stability of fermentation during processes is the refrigerated starter in bag method. The refresh process can be last for more than 25 times. So, the method shall be applied to natural bread making in bakeries. The phase of microorganisms changed after the dough style starter is stored at 10 ℃ and - 20 ℃, respectively for couple days. The sorts can contribute itself to baking size and taste and yeast is active. Additionally, LAB has a better production of acid. After freeze drying of pre-starter, the amount of LAB and yeast can be preserved better and longer than those in the fermented liquid and pre-starter frozen directly at - 20 ℃. Therefore, in the future, preserving the developed natural LAB and yeast can be done by using freeze dried pre-starter. Therefore the whole process can be shorten. In the whole process, a key to make the sourdough bread containing unique tastes consists in long-time fermentation. Because longer time is required for yeast to ferment, this feature also offers LAB enough time to grow and metabolize. Thus, the organic acid and volatile flavor both are made. This made the sourdough bread unique sour and sweet taste. 酸麵糰(sourdough)

，化性(pH、TTA、糖度) 以及成分(可溶性糖、有機酸、酒精) 的變化，以求了解天然酵母麵包製程中每一步驟的意義與對麵包品質與風味的貢獻，實驗同時進行綜合發酵液、液種和團狀原種的冷凍貯藏試驗，探討冷凍對酸麵糰中菌種保存的可行性，以縮短整個繁複的製程。 實驗結果顯示袋裝冷藏方式培養的天然酵母製作出來的麵包品質與發酵穩定性(比體積差異性) 較好，可連續添種達 25 次以上，適合應用於烘焙麵包店的製備。團狀原種經適當天數的袋裝冷藏(10 ℃) 與冷凍(- 20 ℃) 後，可以改變微生物的菌相，相對的篩選出對烘焙體積及風味具貢獻性的菌種，即存活的酵母菌菌種具有較好的發酵能力，乳酸菌有適當的產酸性。經過冷凍乾燥的液種，其酵母菌與乳酸菌的存活率明顯的較直接冷凍的液種與綜合發酵液好，因此未來可以發展成以冷凍乾燥液種的方式，保存階段性已培養好的天然酵母與乳酸菌，縮短整個繁複的製程。整個製程中的長時間發酵是醞釀天然酵母麵包獨特風味最關鍵之所在，由於其酵母菌需要較長時間之發酵，恰好也提供了乳酸菌充分的時間進行生長與代謝，以產生有機酸和風味物質，使得天然酵母麵包具備獨特的酸甜口味與風味。中文摘要…………………………………………………………………

Foram utilizados 20 animais em delineamento {{experimental}} em blocos completos aleatorizados, distribuídos nos seguintes tratamentos: 1) controle; 2) substâncias húmicas, via concentrado inicial. Os animais receberam 4 L d - 1 da dieta líquida e concentrado inicial ad libitum. Diariamente foram realizadas análise de escore fecal, e semanalmente foram realizadas pesagens, medidas de crescimento corporal e colheita de sangue para a determinação de glicose, N-ureico e β-hidroxibutirato (BHBA). Os animais foram desaleitados na oitava semana de idade e foram abatidos para análise do desenvolvimento do trato digestório superior. Não houve efeito significativo (p > 0, 05) entre os tratamentos ou interação tratamento x idade para os parâmetros consumo de concentrado, ganho de peso, medidas de crescimento corporal e parâmetros sanguíneos. Entretanto, foi observado efeito de idade (p 0, 05). Não houve efeito da inclusão de substâncias húmicas na dieta quanto ao desempenho e desenvolvimento ruminal de bezerros leiteiros. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the inclusion of humic substances in starter concentrate {{on the performance of}} dairy calves and rumen development. Twenty Holstein calves were used in a completely randomized block design and distributed in two treatments according to inclusion of humic substances in concentrate: 1) Control; 2) Humic substances. Animals received 4 L d - 1 <b>liquid</b> diet and <b>starter</b> concentrate ad libitum. Fecal score analyses were carried out daily, and calves were weighed weekly and growth measurements and blood samples for glucose, urea-N and β-hidroxibutyrate (BHBA) were taken. The calves were weaned at eight weeks of age and slaughtered for evaluation of forestomach development. There were no effects (p > 0. 05) between treatments or treatment x age interaction for concentrate intake, weight gain, growth measurements or blood parameters. Fecal scores and rumen development were not affected (p > 0. 05) by the inclusion of humic substances. There were no benefits from the inclusion of humic substances in starter concentrate on performance or rumen development of dairy calve...|$|R
