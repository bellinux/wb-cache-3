5|$|Following this failure, Krugers {{made the}} {{documentary}} Atma De Vischer (1931), which followed Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik {{on a trip}} through the Hague, before being signed to Tan's Film. With Tan's, Krugers made two films. First {{he was asked to}} handle cinematography on Bachtiar Effendi's 1932 talkie Njai Dasima, an adaptation of G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima (Story of Njai Dasima). He then directed and produced Huwen op Bevel (Forced to Marry; 1931), which was advertised as featuring songs and comedy. The film was a commercial failure, leading to all rights being acquired by Tan's. He is recorded as planning a further two films, De Nona (Of <b>Ladies)</b> <b>and</b> Raonah, but neither was made.|$|E

5|$|Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences {{a further}} four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the {{intention}} of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: One Arabian Night was a reworking of Aladdin and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill, while Harlequinade visited the roots of pantomime. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film Don Quixote, for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> walked out of the family home.|$|E

5|$|Time {{spent in}} {{religious}} gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> children who made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During {{a period of}} food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had {{to spend the day}} preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{began her}} {{football}} career playing at primary school {{in her hometown}} of Bermondsey. At the age of ten, she joined leading women's club Millwall Lionesses. In the 1996–97 season, Chapman made her senior team debut at the age of14. She became a regular starter in the team and also participated in the 1997 FA Women's Premier League Cup and FA Women's Cup final wins. In the 1998–99 campaign, Chapman won FA Young Player of the Year award. Already a full England international, she left Millwall in 2000 to sign a professional contract with Fulham. She played on the teams that won back-to-back promotions, as well as the 2001–02 Premier League Cup and FA Women's Cup. In June2001 Chapman was again named FA Young Player of the Year. After two years with Charlton Athletic from 2004, Chapman joined Arsenal <b>Ladies</b> <b>and</b> reached prominence with the team in her first season, winning a domestic treble as well as the UEFA Women's Cup. She had missed significant sections of the 2002–03 and 2007–08 seasons through pregnancy, and spent a single season with WPS team Chicago Red Stars in 2010, before returning to Arsenal Ladies. After another pregnancy truncated her 2013 season, Chapman moved across London to sign for Chelsea Ladies in January 2014.|$|E
5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos with {{keyboard}} accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.|$|E
5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree {{to listen to the}} <b>ladies,</b> <b>and</b> follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E
