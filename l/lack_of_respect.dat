5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the arrival}} of the Invalid Corps at West Point, the charges were dropped, and Nicola was cleared of all charges. On August 4, 1781, Nicola complained to George Washington that the Corps would have great {{difficult}} during the winter time. Two months later on September 19, Nicola complained to General Horatio Gates about McDougall's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> to the Corps. Eventually, Nicola proposed to Washington that the Invalid Corps should move back to Philadelphia; however, for various reasons, Washington denied it.|$|E
5|$|As freshmen {{struggled}} with the Athenian curriculum, he reverted to classification by academic discipline and offered companion texts {{in the field of}} the current work studied. In their dorms, the college students were known for their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for property, with three times the breakage in dorm assets {{than the rest of the}} university. Meiklejohn saw this as desirable and indicative of abetting nonconformity, and did not attempt to curb it. Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could not intervene. Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities. By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe.|$|E
40|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that actions to benefit the next generation would not lead to well-being unless they {{are perceived to be}} valued and respected and that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>respect</b> would further lead to disengagement from generative goals. Older persons responded to measures of generative concern, action, perceived respect, and psychological well-being at 2 time points 12 months apart. Structural equation modeling showed that at both time points, the effect of action on well-being was completely mediated by perceived <b>respect.</b> Moreover, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>respect</b> at baseline predicted a decrease in generative concern 12 months later, suggesting that, in later life, continuing concern is partly dependent on the attitudes of younger generations. When their attitudes are unfavorable, a downward spiral in generativity development and well-being is possible. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. The real power lay with Diệm's younger brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well as giving orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had shown him a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect.</b> Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him {{to take part in}} major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country. Thơ had a rapport with the military officers, having befriended Minh years earlier. He was regarded as a genial and affable administrator with a reputation for making compromises.|$|E

50|$|Many {{survivors}} are adolescent girls, leading to Guatemala having the highest teen pregnancy and preteen pregnancy rates in Latin America. Girls {{as young as}} 10 years old are impregnated by rape, and they usually carry these pregnancies to birth. Most of these instances of sexual violence are perpetrated by the girl's father or other close male relative (89%). These men do not suffer consequences largely because <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> education, poverty, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> social <b>respect</b> for women. According to photo activist Linda Forsell, most young girls face expulsion from school if they are visibly pregnant.|$|R
50|$|What Marcus learns is {{that all}} those whose lives were touched by Jesus are changed in some way, in varying degrees, but all remain human, with human flaws and frailties. Mary Magdalene, for example, is envious of the disciples and their special {{relationship}} to Jesus, resentful at what she sees as their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sufficient <b>respect</b> for her, and contemptuous of what she considers their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sophistication. And Zaccheus, the man Jesus called down from the tree, is much more generous {{than he had been}} before his encounter with Jesus, but is also vain of the special favor shown to him.|$|R

Interviewees regard of this ‘click’ as a fundamental building block of thriving collaborations (e.g. TUE 2 A- 2 and TUE 3 A- 2). When partners do not enjoy each other’s company, they <b>lack</b> positive reinforcement <b>of</b> the collaboration by personal proximity. A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>respect</b> (e.g. TUD 2 A- 2) or differences of working style (e.g. UT 1 B) can be true deal breakers for collaborations.|$|R

40|$|The most {{coherent}} {{explanation of}} segregation is {{in terms of}} classed practices but not crudely as the middle class abandoning the working class. The great social distance between the most advantaged and the least, the benefits of solidarity and the restrictive effects of social policing lead the majority of both affluent and poor parents to opt for segregated schooling. School segregation first expresses and then sustains great social distance and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>respect</b> and civility that it engenders. It is more symptom than cause...|$|R
