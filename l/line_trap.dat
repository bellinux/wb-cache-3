50|$|The <b>line</b> <b>trap</b> acts as {{a barrier}} or filter to prevent signal losses. The {{inductive}} reactance of the <b>line</b> <b>trap</b> presents a high reactance to high-frequency signals but a low reactance to mains frequency. This prevents carrier signals from being dissipated in the substation or in a tap line or branch of the main transmission path and grounds {{in the case of}} anything happening outside of the carrier transmission path. The <b>line</b> <b>trap</b> is also used to attenuate the shunting effects of high-voltage lines.|$|E

50|$|The main coil is {{the outer}} part of the <b>line</b> <b>trap</b> which is made from {{stranded}} aluminum cable. The reactor coil, depending on the device, {{can be made up}} of several aluminum wires, allowing equal distribution amongst the parallel wires. The stranded aluminum coil is wound in one layer. However, when the application of more than one layer is necessary, separation between layers is required to provide a cooling duct between them to avoid overheating. The cooling duct is created with spacer bars made out of epoxy resin and fiberglass. The coil carries rated continuous power frequency currents, therefore this is the power inductor in this system. It provides a low impedance path for the electricity flow. Since the power flow is rather large at times, the coil used in a <b>line</b> <b>trap</b> must be large in terms of physical size. Hence, a <b>line</b> <b>trap</b> unit is inserted between the busbar and connection of coupling capacitor to the line. It is a parallel tuned circuit containing inductance and capacitance. It has low impedance for power frequency and high impedance to carrier frequency. This unit prevents the high frequency carrier signal from entering the neighboring line.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{observational}} and theoretical {{study of the}} optical emission from nonradiative shocks in three supernova remnants: the Cygnus Loop, RCW 86 and Tycho. The spectra of these shocks are dominated by collisionally excited hydrogen Balmer lines which have both a broad component caused by proton-neutral charge exchange and a narrow component caused by excitation of cold neutrals entering the shock. In each remnant we have obtained the broad to narrow flux ratios of the Halpha and Hbeta lines and measured the Halpha broad component width. A new numerical shock code computes the broad and narrow Balmer line emission from nonradiative shocks in partially neutral gas. The Balmer line fluxes are sensitive to Lyman <b>line</b> <b>trapping</b> {{and the degree of}} electron-proton temperature equilibration. The code calculates the density, temperature and size of the postshock ionization layer and uses a Monte Carlo simulation to compute narrow Balmer line enhancement from Lyman <b>line</b> <b>trapping.</b> The initial fraction of the shock energy allocated to the electrons and protons (the equilibration) is a free parameter. Our models show that variations in electron-proton temperature equilibration and Lyman <b>line</b> <b>trapping</b> can reproduce the observed range of broad to narrow ratios. The results give 80 %- 100 % equilibration in nonradiative portions of the NE Cygnus Loop (v_shock ~ 300 km/s), 40 %- 50 % equilibration in nonradiative portions of RCW 86 (v_shock ~ 600 km/s) and <~ 20 % equilibration in Tycho (v_shock ~ 2000 km/s).

50|$|Line traps {{are places}} that a line can pass through but are too tight for a diver, making it {{impossible}} to follow the line by feel. Avoiding line traps is {{a large part of the}} skill of laying line, and generally require the line to be tied off in such a way that it does not enter <b>line</b> <b>trap</b> areas when under the necessary tension to prevent slack.

40|$|Summary: Eradication of rodent {{species from}} some {{offshore}} islands {{has proved to}} be an effective means of conserving native animal communities and restoring natural ecological processes on the islands. As methods of eradication differ for different rodent species, a truthful monitoring method to detect species presence and relative density is essential for a successful eradication programme. This study compared two spatial arrangements (line vs. grid), 5 different baits (chocolate, cheese, soap, wax, oiled wood) and 3 cover types (transparent plastic, wire netting, galvanised iron) on the detection of 2 species of rodents on Browns (Motukorea) Island in June and August. The two species of rodents present on the island were Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and mice (Mus musculus). Trapping using conventional <b>trapping</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>trapping</b> grids was carried out in June and August, respectively. The traps were set for 8 nights for both <b>lines</b> and grids. <b>Trap</b> <b>lines</b> caught 12. 40 rats per 100 corrected trap-nights (100 ctn- 1) and no mice; trap grids caught 5. 3 rats 100 ctn- 1 and 0. 2 mice 100 ctn- 1. Trap grids appeared to be better than <b>trap</b> <b>lines</b> for detecting the presence/absence of rodent species when two species coexist and one appears subordinate to the other. On <b>trap</b> <b>lines</b> the <b>trapping</b> rate of rats was consistently high for five of the first six nights.

50|$|Power line carrier {{communication}} (PLCC) {{technology has}} been frequently used since 1950 by the grid stations to transmit information at high speed. Transmitting information along high-voltage lines, at high frequency, {{has been one of}} the main means of communication in electric power for over fifty years. This technology is finding wide use in building and home automation, as it avoids the need for extra wiring. The data collected from different sensors is transmitted on power lines thereby reducing the maintenance cost of the additional wiring. In some countries, this technology is also used to provide Internet connection. In order to communicate, high-frequency <b>line</b> <b>traps</b> are used as they allow substations to communicate with each other through the power lines at the same time as they transmit electrical power. In order to separate power from messages being sent, different frequencies are used. Electrical power has a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz in most places, and the communication waves use frequencies such as 150 kHz and 200 kHz. <b>Line</b> <b>traps</b> consist of filter circuits that allow only power frequency waves to travel to that of electrical equipment.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} complexities of power system control, protection, operation and SCADA, {{there is a}} need to have a very reliable telecommunication network to provide data transmission in steady state and transient conditions of the system. Integrity of the data should be verified with the use of different back-up communication systems eg. microwave, power line carrier (PLC), fibre optic and private telecommunication networks etc. PLC is a very convenient back-up and is available at a very low cost, as it uses the same line for power transmission and PLC signal propagation. Due to the presence of ehv signal on the line, PLC equipment eg. <b>line</b> <b>trap</b> shows inefficient behaviour in providing appropriate attenuation to the PLC signal at busbars. As a result, leakage signal interferes with the PLC signal on adjacent line sections, operating at the same fi^equencies, which ultimately limits the utility of the available PLC spectrum. In this thesis, adaptive interference cancellation schemes based on adaptive identification, fuzzy logic and artificial neural network theories have been implemented on PLC systems. Studies of these cancellation schemes were also extended on a laboratory model of power line, which was designed based on Modal Analysis. The development of these techniques can help in providing extra attenuation to the PLC signal at the busbars and hence the power industry could use the same frequencies on adjacent line sections to make the maximum use of PLC for the power system utilities...|$|E

Investigate wether the ground-state transition of ortho-H 2 O (110 → 101) at 557 GHz can be used to measure the column density throughout an interstellar cloud. Methods. We make use of a multi-zone escape probability code suitable for the treatment of molecular line emission. Results. For low abundances, i. e., X(H 2 O) � 10 − 9, the intensity of the 110 → 101 transition scales with the total column of H 2. However, this relationship breaks down with increasing abundance, i. e., optical depth, due to <b>line</b> <b>trapping</b> and, – for Tdust� 25 K, X(H 2 O) � 10 − 8 and n∼ 10 4 cm − 3, – absorption of the dust continuum.

An observed decline in intensity per column, expected if H 2 O is a surface tracer, {{does not necessarily mean that}} the water is absent in the gas phase at large columns, but can be caused by <b>line</b> <b>trapping</b> and subsequent collisional de-excitation.
