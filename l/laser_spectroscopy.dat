In 1999, Kerstel et al. successfully applied this technique to determine D/H in water sample. The system consists of a laser and a cavity equipped with high finesse reflectivity mirrors. Laser light is injected into the cavity, at which the resonance takes place due to the constructive interference. The laser then is turn off. The decay of light intensity is measured. In the presence of a water sample, the photo-absorption by water isotopologues follows the kinetic law. The optical spectrum is obtained by recording ring-down time of the H2O spectral features of interest at certain laser wavelength. The concentration of each isotopologue is proportional to the area under each measured isotopologue spectral feature.|$|E

In nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging, radiofrequency radiation is most commonly used.|$|E

25|$|Determination of D/H ratio can be {{performed}} {{with a combination of}} different preparation techniques and instruments for different purposes. There are several basic categories of hydrogen isotope measurements: (i) organic hydrogen or water are converted to H2 first, followed by high precision IRMS (Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry) measurement with high precisions; (ii) D/H and 18O/16O are directly measured as H2O by <b>laser</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> also with high precisions; (iii) the intact molecules are directly measured by NMR or mass spectrometry with relatively lower precision than IRMS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> is a {{quick and}} simple procedure, {{relatively}} lower cost and the equipment is portable. So {{it can be used}} in the field for measuring water samples. D/H and 18O/16O can be determined simultaneously from a single injection. It requires a small sample size of < 1 μL for water. The typical precision is ~ 1‰. However, this is the compound-specific instrument, i.e. only one specific compound can be measured. And coexisting organic compounds (i.e. ethanol) could interfere with the optical light absorption features of water, resulting in cross-contamination.|$|E
25|$|Mechanisms of {{monitoring}} chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate. Relatively slow processes {{can be analyzed}} in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients. Important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of pH and analysis of optical absorption (color) and emission spectra. A less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to; this method {{is often used to}} analyze redistribution of substances in the human body. Faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast <b>laser</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> where utilization of femtosecond lasers allows short-lived transition states to be monitored at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds.|$|E
