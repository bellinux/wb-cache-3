60|$|The other {{objection}} to this definition of {{truth is that}} it assumes the meaning of 'coherence' known, whereas, in fact, 'coherence' presupposes {{the truth of the}} laws of logic. Two propositions are coherent when both may be true, and are incoherent when one at least must be false. Now in order to know whether two propositions can both be true, we must know such truths as the law of contradiction. For example, the two propositions, 'this tree is a beech' and 'this tree is not a beech', are not coherent, because of the law of contradiction. But if the law of contradiction itself were subjected to the test of coherence, we should find that, if we choose to suppose it false, nothing will any longer be incoherent with anything else. Thus the laws of <b>logic</b> <b>supply</b> the skeleton or framework within which the test of coherence applies, and they themselves cannot be established by this test.|$|E

Despite the developing body of literature on S-D logic, the concept seems {{to remain in the}} hands of relatively few. This leaves the vast majority, especially academics and practitioners in Africa and other developing countries, in oblivion. Thus, the paper assesses the level of dissemination of S-D logic in the West African sub-region, and also examines the applicability of the logic to logistics and supply network management in the sub-region. The study adopts an exploratory qualitative approach on grounds that the area under study is relatively new and requires researcher engagement with participants to better understand the phenomenon under investigation. The findings show that all research participants interviewed had no prior knowledge about S-D logic's concepts, let alone their applicability to logistics and supply network management. Research participants were taken from academics and practitioners in Ghanaian universities, for this reason the authors acknowledge the limitation of geographical boundary for this study. The research addresses the deficiency of S-D logic's dissemination to academics and practitioners in developing countries. Attempts are made in these countries towards linking the significance of S-D logic to economic growth and development, where there is no extant research about the uptake of S-D logic.

40|$|Purpose: To empirically {{investigate}} the impact of: institutional pressures; institutional logics; and institutional complexity; on Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) practices across mixed {{public and private}} sector supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Multi-case study data was collected from three tiers of food and catering supply chains: the customer/consumer tier; focal public sector UK Universities; and private sector suppliers / contractors. Findings: The findings indicate that: normative and mimetic pressures are more prevalent in focal Universities, compared to suppliers; there is typically no single dominant <b>logic</b> across these <b>supply</b> chains; and the multiplicity of institutional logics (e. g., sustainability logic versus financial logic) increases institutional complexity. Therefore, in the atypical case of homogeneity in terms of institutional pressures and logics, e. g. with a dominant sustainability <b>logic</b> throughout the <b>supply</b> chain, radical change in SSCM practices is facilitated. In contrast, in the more typical case when there is heterogeneity, with competing <b>logics</b> at different <b>supply</b> chain tiers, this limits SSCM to more incremental changes in practices. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to three tiers {{of the food and}} catering supply chains of UK Universities. Practical implications: To aid in the successful implementation of SSCM, this study suggests a need for managers to develop an initial understanding of the prevailing institutional logics and pressures at different tiers of the supply chain.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{question}} of characterizing first-order LFIs (logics of formal inconsistency) by means of two-valued semantics. LFIs are powerful paraconsistent logics that encode classical logic and permit a finer distinction between contradictions and inconsistencies, with a deep involvement in philosophical and foundational questions. Although focused on just one particular case, namely, the quantified logic QmbC, the method proposed here is completely general {{for this kind of}} logics, and can be easily extended to a large family of quantified paraconsistent <b>logics,</b> <b>supplying</b> a sound and complete semantical interpretation for such logics. However, certain subtleties involving term substitution and replacement, that are hidden in classical structures, have {{to be taken into account}} when one ventures into the realm of nonclassical reasoning. This paper shows how such difficulties can be overcome, and offers detailed proofs showing that a smooth treatment of semantical characterization can be given to all such logics. Although the paper is well-endowed in technical details and results, it has a significant philosophical aside: it shows how slight extensions of classical methods can be used to construct the basic model theory of logics that are weaker than traditional logic due to the absence of certain rules present in classical logic. Several such logics, however, as in the case of the LFIs treated here, are notorious for their wealth of models precisely because they do not make indiscriminate use of certain rules; these models thus require new methods. In the case of this paper, by just appealing to a refined version of the Principle of Explosion, or Pseudo-Scotus, some new constructions and crafty solutions to certain nonobvious subtleties are proposed. The result is that a richer extension of model theory can be inaugurated, with interest not only for paraconsistency, but hopefully to other enlargements of traditional logic...|$|R
