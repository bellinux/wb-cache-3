5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). This {{suggests that}} the ancestral deuterostome <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a sessile lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, {{the transition is}} more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E

25|$|The Gol Henai small repeating {{pattern is}} named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Garden balsam, and in the Western {{literature}} is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.|$|E
25|$|A rock {{arch and}} several notable bluffs are formed of late Whaingaroan Ahirau Sandstone formed about 28 million years ago. Although {{classified}} as sandstone, it <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> limestone, with 40-60% calcium carbonate content and lapiez features in massive (lacking internal structures), blue-grey, calcareous, fine sandstone.|$|E
25|$|The rostrum (snout) {{is unlike}} that of undisputed crown mammals; in fact it <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of a pelycosaur, such as Dimetrodon. The multituberculate rostrum is box-like, with the large flat maxillae forming the sides, the nasal the top, and the tall premaxilla at the front.|$|E

25|$|Bartlett met John Miller in 1928, {{and they}} {{commenced}} building the new ride. When the ride went into production, {{much of the}} idea was the same, but the cars <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> monoplanes, which Bartlett designed. Miller worked on the loading station, supporting structure, braking system and incline.|$|E
25|$|A {{transfer}} caboose <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a {{flat car}} with a shed bolted {{to the middle of}} it than it does a standard caboose. It is used in transfer service between rail yards or short switching runs, and as such, lacks sleeping, cooking or restroom facilities. The ends of a transfer caboose are left open, with safety railings surrounding the area between the crew compartment {{and the end of the}} car.|$|E
25|$|Die {{deterioration}} doubling is {{a result}} of a few simple causes, but {{it can be difficult to}} positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, it <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a weak strike than doubling.|$|E

25|$|The Atlantis DHD is {{more similar}} to the Earth's dialing {{computer}} than an actual DHD, and <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a set of crystal panels. It can block out certain gate addresses. The Atlantis DHD also has an extra control-crystal allowing the dialing of an eighth chevron during the dialing sequence {{and is the only}} DHD in the Pegasus Galaxy capable of dialing Earth. A similar DHD is also used on Puddle Jumpers, where the set of used glyphs corresponds to the galaxy of the Puddle Jumper. The Wraith also travel through Stargates in small spacecraft called darts and have some means of remote-dialing them {{in a manner similar to}} Ancient ships.|$|E
25|$|Based on this, Burley's account <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> one of mistaken {{identity}} because, while his story matches {{the account of the}} Cordova's demise and subsequent rescue of four crew members in September 1888, the date of the Cordova's foundering was about 26 July 1888. The crew of the Cordova were rescued {{a year and a half}} before the Marlborough might have sailed through the area. Burley, who was born in England in 1871 arrived in Washington in 1890. He may have got the two dates muddled as the report was over 20 years after the event. Even as far back as 1913 Burley's account was thought to have been one of {{mistaken identity}}.|$|E
25|$|In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the hen; {{it is more}} {{uniform in}} colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, {{somewhat}} darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks {{on the head and}} neck, and scaly spots {{on the rest of the}} body; overall they look much like a tiny mallard (A. platyrhynchos) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake's, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen's rectrices have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with some dark streaking.|$|E

500|$|U.S. President Jimmy Carter {{surveyed}} {{the damage and}} said, [...] "Someone said this area looked like a moonscape. But the moon <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a golf course compared to what's up there." [...] A film crew, led by Seattle filmmaker Otto Seiber, was dropped by helicopter on St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. Their compasses, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred on May 25, but the crew survived and was rescued two days later by National Guard helicopter pilots. Their film, The Eruption of Mount St. Helens, later became a popular documentary.|$|E
500|$|The script {{comments}} cheekily on the Beatles' fame. For instance, at {{one point}} a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only [...] "you are...". He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for [...] "him", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan agreeing that Lennon doesn't [...] "look like him at all", and Lennon saying to himself that [...] "she <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> him than I do". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a mod or a rocker, he replies: [...] "Uh, no, I'm a mocker", a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!. The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a [...] "clean old man" [...] sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, as a [...] "dirty old man".|$|E
500|$|The {{early months}} of 1706 also proved {{frustrating}} for the Duke as Louis XIV's generals gained early successes in Italy and Alsace. These setbacks thwarted Marlborough's original plans for the coming campaign, but he soon adjusted his schemes and marched into enemy territory. LouisXIV, equally determined to fight and avenge Blenheim, goaded his commander, Marshal Villeroi, to seek out Monsieur Marlbrouck. The subsequent Battle of Ramillies, fought in the Spanish Netherlands on 23 May, was perhaps Marlborough's most successful action, and {{one in which he}} had himself characteristically drawn his sword at the pivotal moment. For the loss of fewer than 3,000 dead and wounded (far fewer than Blenheim), his victory had cost the enemy some 20,000 casualties, inflicting in the words of Marshal Villars, [...] "the most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs". The campaign was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English general. Town after town subsequently fell to the Allies. [...] "It really <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a dream than truth", wrote Marlborough to Sarah. With Prince Eugene's rout of the French army at Turin in September, 1706 proved a miraculous year for Allied arms.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the density}} of a gas is persistent, then it isn't really {{behaving}} like a gas. [...] Instead it is behaving like an incompressible fluid, or liquid, and this situation <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an ocean. [...] Assuming density is constant, then a graph of pressure vs altitude will have a retained slope, since {{the weight of the}} ocean over head is directly proportional to its depth.|$|E
2500|$|During the 19th century, the {{population}} {{began to grow}} around the palace, but this remained generally a rural community (a aspect that would continue until the 20th century). José Mangens in 1936 echoed similar indications of Mafra in writing about old Rua dos Arcipestres, noting: [...] "...Mafra offers nothing interesting and <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a hinterland village with its huts and ruined portals typical backyard, shielded with old cans...".|$|E
