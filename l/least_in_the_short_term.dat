5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil {{could be used as}} both a political and economic weapon against other nations, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term.</b> In 217 BC, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of the}} state, which it did not have to do in the past.|$|E

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term.</b> In 217BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service; around 213BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 asses. Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed that, at this point, the proletarii of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses. By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into the adsidui.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of Europe lay the Byzantine Empire, {{composed}} of Christians who had long followed a separate Orthodox rite; the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches had been in schism since 1054. Historians {{have argued that the}} desire to impose Roman church authority in the east may {{have been one of the}} goals of the crusade, although Urban II, who launched the First Crusade, never refers to such a goal in his letters on crusading. The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan. A dramatic collapse of the empire's position on the eve of the Council of Clermont brought Byzantium to the brink of disaster. By the mid-1090s, the Byzantine Empire was largely confined to Balkan Europe and the northwestern fringe of Anatolia, and faced Norman enemies in the west as well as Turks in the east. In response to the defeat at Manzikert and subsequent Byzantine losses in Anatolia in 1074, Pope Gregory VII had called for the milites Christi ("soldiers of Christ") to go to Byzantium's aid. This call was largely ignored and even opposed. The reason for this was that while the defeat at Manzikert was shocking, it had limited significance and did not lead to major difficulties for the Byzantine empire, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{phase one}} of the Ivanhoe Line was {{completed}} in the mid-1990s, it was originally planned that phase two would extend the line west to Burton upon Trent on the current freight-only line via Coalville and Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

50|$|Though Maryland {{traditionally}} votes Democratic {{and had not}} {{elected a}} Republican Governor in almost 40 years, Townsend lost the race, gaining 48% of the vote to Ehrlich's 51% and Lancaster's 1%.

The consortium also included the Myer family, who held a 5% stake. The new owners, who also secured the freehold on the flagship Bourke Street store, {{indicated that they would}} not radically change the business, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term,</b> and had no plans to redevelop the Bourke Street site as this would impact too heavily on profitability during the construction period. Texas Pacific also have interests in UK department store Debenhams and high-end US retailer Neiman Marcus. This sale was completed for A$1.4 bn on 2 June 2006.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> model-based {{estimation}} {{of the cost of}} capital, the common practice uses the average historical factor premiums as a proxy for the estimated factor premiums. But evidence shows that the common practice generates very inaccurate estimates. I propose an alternative way to estimate factor premiums by using business cycle variables. Based on the out-of-sample results from a simple trading strategy, my estimation procedure beats the common practice for both Fama and French three-factor model and the CAPM. Also, the Fama and French three-factor model performs better than <b>the</b> CAPM, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> run. Moreover, <b>the</b> conditional mean dominance (CMD) confirms the better performance of Fama and French three-factor model under all the market situations. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run, neither asset-pricing model, using either estimation procedure, has good performance. As a result, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> run, <b>the</b> Fama and French three-factor model with factor premiums estimated from business cycle variables should be recommended for capital budgeting decisions...|$|R

2500|$|German {{planners}} in November 1939 {{called for}} [...] "the complete destruction" [...] of all Poles. Poland under German occupation {{was to be}} cleared of Poles and settled by German colonists. The Polish political leadership and other leaders were the targets of an organized campaign of murder. But German planners decided against a genocide of ethnic Poles on the same scale as against Jews, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term.</b>|$|E

2500|$|According to the IPCC's 2014 {{assessment}} report, [...] "Mitigation is {{a public}} good; climate change {{is a case of}} the 'tragedy of the commons'. Effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent (individual, institution or country) acts independently in its own selfish interest (see international cooperation and emissions trading), suggesting the need for collective action. Some adaptation actions, on the other hand, have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals, regions, or countries that undertake them, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term.</b> Nevertheless, financing such adaptive activities remains an issue, particularly for poor individuals and countries." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{prominent}} financial economists (including Eugene Fama) have recently advocated the strong {{form of this}} view - that of no possible impact. However, it is categorically rejected by Keynesian macroeconomics, which holds that economic activity depends on aggregate spending (at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> run). It is related to, and at times equated with, theories of Say's law, Ricardian equivalence, and the Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition.|$|R
2500|$|By mid October 2010, {{the dollar}} had dropped 7% since a 27 August speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke {{in which he}} said there was a {{possibility}} of further easing monetary policy. On 18 October, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner stated [...] "It is very important for people to understand that the United States of America and no country around the world can devalue its way to prosperity and competitiveness."

2500|$|Recent {{reviews of}} the project have been positive, {{generally}} {{in keeping with the}} post-GAO Rebaseline schedules and budgets. However, there were lingering concerns about the NIF's ability to reach ignition, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term.</b> An independent review by the JASON Defense Advisory Group was generally positive about NIF's prospects over the long term, but concluded that [...] "The scientific and technical challenges in such a complex activity suggest that success in the early attempts at ignition in 2010, while possible, is unlikely". The group suggested a number of changes to the completion timeline to bring NIF to its full design power as soon as possible, skipping over a testing period at lower powers that they felt had little value.|$|E
