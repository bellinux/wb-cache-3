25|$|On 15 December 1918, {{only two}} days from New York, Yellowstone sighted a {{derelict}} three-masted schooner and altered course to close. She discovered the water-logged Joseph P. Cooper of Mobile, Alabama, abandoned with her decks and cabin awash and with her forerigging gone and her forecastle smashed in. Joseph P. Cooper <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had been adrift from six to eight weeks. After leaving the derelict, Yellowstone continued her passage and arrived at Pier 5, Bush Terminal, in Brooklyn on 17 December 1918. Shifting to Pier 1 {{at the end of}} December, she spent a week at anchor off the Statue of Liberty before returning to Bush Terminal and, later, shifting to the U.S. Army docks at Brooklyn. There, from 17 to 25 January 1919, Yellowstone took on board 5,150 tons of supplies and, on 25 January 1919, got underway for France.|$|E
500|$|Barbara Cloud of the Pittsburgh Press gave {{attribution}} to Hershey {{for starting}} a trend {{when she had}} collagen injected into her lips {{for her role in}} Beaches (1988). Humorist Erma Bombeck said of the movie, which also starred Bette Midler, [...] "I have no idea what Beaches was all about. All I could focus on was Barbara Hershey's lips. She <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> stopped off at a gas station and someone said, 'Your lips are down 30 pounds. Better let me hit 'em with some air.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Some fans {{attending}} the show were dissatisfied with its short length, with one quoted afterward as saying, [...] "That was so disappointing." [...] Some fans were also {{disappointed by the}} performance quality, with one quoted as saying, [...] "It <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> lip-synched {{her way through the}} whole thing." [...] Other fans were more accommodating, pleased to be seeing her in good health and appearance and with one quoted as saying, [...] "Whatever, we love her. She's amazing." [...] One group of female fans wore matching pink tops that said [...] "Bald Ambition" [...] on one side and [...] "The Comeback 2007" [...] on the other. [...] Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel summed up some of the reaction by writing that fans {{at the tail end of}} the tour [...] "knew that the show would be short. ... They also knew that she would be lip-synching, but this wasn't about music as much as it was about celebrity, loyalty and beating adversity." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Harrington of The Oakland Tribune {{described}} {{the show as}} a human embodiment of Britney Spears' [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] (2002). He presumed [...] that the tour was a conscious transition for fans {{who did not want}} Cyrus to separate herself from the Hannah Montana franchise. Kirsty Cameron of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Despite her relatively young age, Cyrus showed her unfailing capability as performer. With the help of her back-up dancers, Cyrus provided her audience with choreographed set pieces and a different spectacle for each song." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted that the Wonder World Tour presented Cyrus as both a [...] "PG-rated tween pop star and an edgy rocker eager". He stated that although she played both roles well, it was apparent that she was more at ease with the latter. Reed also felt the concert did little to display Cyrus' personality and ability to engage with the audience. [...] "We know she's got impressive vocal chops, but now we need to feel what she's trying to put across in her songs, something beyond the standard 'You guys are awesome!' banter." [...] Scott Iwasaki of Deseret News reviewed a concert in which Cyrus was ill. He mentioned that because of her illness, her voice went flat. Iwasaki also expressed his viewpoint that [...] "if there [...] any worries that Miley Cyrus would become another Britney Spears train wreck, those worries were quelled during Tuesday night's show. She kept the show family-friendly and, although obviously sick, <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had a good time." [...] Marlin Levison of The Star Tribune believed the concert lacked much profundity until the last performance.|$|E

2500|$|About {{four hours}} later at 1:30am, she was found naked, gagged, tied up, and covered in mud and blood. [...] Meili was {{discovered}} in a shallow ravine in a wooded area of the park about [...] north of the 102nd Street Transverse.

2500|$|Initially, Chibnall {{wanted to}} reveal the murderer's {{identity}} to the entire cast and crew at an all-hands meeting on the Harbour Cliffs Beach {{a few days before}} releasing the final three scripts. A short film of completed footage had been edited together to show the cast and crew how the series was coming together. It was his intent {{to reveal the}} secret {{at the end of the}} screen. The night before the meeting, the cast and crew filmed the [...] "re-creation scene" [...] where Tom Miller skateboards through Broadchurch in an attempt to jog people's memories. But some individuals approached Chibnall during the night's shoot and said they enjoyed the suspense, so Chibnall decided not to tell. Reaction by the cast was mixed to his decision. [...] "Olivia Colman, who plays one of the investigating police officers, <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was ready to murder me," [...] Chibnall later joked, [...] "while David Tennant grabbed hold of me and said he couldn't believe I wasn't going to tell him. But then he admitted he was actually glad." [...] Chibnall finally told the remaining key actors who the murderer was a few days later during late-night phone calls, just hours before they were due on the set.|$|E
2500|$|Gina Sepre of E! Online {{praised the}} {{performance}} saying, [...] "When Adele {{took the stage}} to perform her understatedly stripped-down and hugely impactful performance of 'Someone Like You,' there were no pyrotechnics, no acrobatics, no lavender hair, and no autotune. And guess what? We didn't miss it. There may be hope yet for MTV to remember just what the 'M' in their name actually stands for." [...] Writing about the performance, Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound concluded that [...] "Someone like You", [...] "highlighted the power a bare-bones, booming performance can have in netting people's attention. Simple {{is not a bad}} word, pop music." [...] Giving the performance an A+, Lindsey Ward of Jam! said: [...] "When I learned British chart-topper Adele would be performing at Sunday's awards I thought, 'Whew â€“ at least we're guaranteed five solid, meaningful minutes of quality music television'. I was right; her frill-free performance of breakup ballad Someone Like You was just that." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the performance calling it [...] "one of the best performances of the show." [...] Another writer of the same publication gave the performance a grade of A+ and wrote: [...] "It takes a real super power to make the seizure-inducing lasers stop, and that power's name is Adele. The broadcast temporarily abandoned its frantic mission of nonstop overstimulation, bowing to the 23-year-old English soulstress's soaring, nearly a cappella (well done, subtle piano man) rendition of her heart-wrecking ballad [...] "Someone Like You." [...] In a modest black dress and with a few spare hand movements, she delivered all the shock and awe of a million-watt showstopper. Who needs special effects, when God gave you your own? Even Britney Spears <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had to fix her mascara when it was all over." ...|$|E

60|$|CÃ©cile Renault {{was a young}} {{seamstress}} who {{was found}} one evening {{at the door of}} Robespierre's lodging, calling out in a state of exaltation that she would fain see what a tyrant <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> was arrested, and upon her were found two little knives used for the purposes of her trade. That she should be arrested and imprisoned was natural enough. The times were charged with deadly fire. People had not forgotten that Marat had been murdered in his own house. Only a few days before CÃ©cile Renault's visit to Robespierre, an assassin had fired a pistol at Collot d'Herbois on the staircase of his apartment. We may make allowance for the excitement of the hour, and Robespierre had as much right to play the martyr, as had Lewis the Fifteenth after the incident of Damiens' rusty pen-knife. But the histrionic exigencies of the chief of a faction ought not to be pushed too far. And it was a monstrous crime that because Robespierre found it convenient to pose as sacrificial victim at the Club, therefore he should have had no scruple in seeing not only the wretched CÃ©cile, but her father, her aunt, and one of her brothers, all despatched to the guillotine in the red shirt of parricide, as agents of Pitt and Coburg, and assassins of the father of the land. This was exactly two days after he had shown his decisive power in the affair of the religious illuminists. The only possible conclusion open to a plain man after weighing and putting aside all the sophisms with which this affair has been obscured, is that Robespierre interfered in the one case because its further prosecution would have tended to make him ridiculous, and he did not interfere in the other, because the more exaggerated, the more melodramatic, the more murderous it was made, the more interesting an object would he seem in the eyes of his adorers.|$|E
6000|$|... "At this I {{sat down}} by her. 'I am that person,' I said, {{and handed her}} my card. 'But before I say any more, please tell me who you are.'--'I am Marie Dorfler. My father's house {{is on the other}} side of this piece of woodland; you cannot see it from here; this is part of his estate. And now tell me why you live all by {{yourself}} in that old ruin.'--'It is not altogether a ruin,' I answered; 'part of it is in very good condition.' And then I proceeded to give her an account of my method of life and my reasons for it. 'It is interesting,' she said, 'but it is very odd.'--'I do not think it half so odd,' I answered, 'as that you should be here by yourself.'--'That is truly an out-of-the-way sort of thing,' she said; 'but just now I am doing out-of-the-way things. If I do not do them now, I shall never have the opportunity again. In two weeks I shall be married, and then I shall go to Prague, and everything will be by line and rule. No more delightful rambles by myself. No more sitting quietly in the woods watching the little birds and hares. No more making a sketch just where I please, no matter whether the ground be damp or not.'--'I wonder that you are allowed to do these things now,' I said.--'I am not allowed,' she answered. 'I do them in hours when I am supposed to be painting flower pieces in an upper room.'--'But when you're married,' I said, 'your husband will be your companion in such rambles.'--'Hardly,' she said, shrugging her shoulders; 'he will be forty-seven on the thirteenth of next month, which I believe is July, and he is a great deal more grizzled than my father, who is past fifty. He is very particular about all sorts of things, as I suppose he has to be, as he is a Colonel of infantry. Nobody could possibly disapprove of my present performances more than he would.' I could not help ejaculating, 'Why, then, do you marry him?' She smiled at my earnestness. 'Oh, that is all arranged,' she said, 'and I have nothing to do with it. I have known for more than a year that I'm to marry Colonel Kaldhein, but I cannot say that I have given myself much concern about it until recently. It now occurs to me that if I expect to amuse myself in the way I best like I must lose no time doing so.' I looked at the girl with earnest interest. 'It appears to me,' said I, 'that your ways of amusing yourself are very much like mine.'--'That is true,' she said, looking up with animation, 'they are. Is it not delightful to be free, to go where you like, and do what you please, without any one to advise or interfere with you?'--'It is delightful,' said I; and for half an hour we sat and talked about these delights and kindred subjects. She was much interested in our castle, and urged me to make a sketch of it, so that she may know what it now <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> had seen it when a little girl, but never since, and had been afraid to wander very far in this direction by herself. I told her that it would be far better for her to see the castle with her own eyes, and that I could conduct her to an eminence, not half a mile away, where she could have an excellent view of it. This plan greatly pleased her; but looking at her watch she said that it would be too late for her to go that morning, but if I happened to come that way the next day, and she should be there to finish her sketch, she would be delighted to have me show her the eminence." ...|$|E

By setting up a contest and awarding $10,000 for a depiction of the Prophet Mohammed, the American Freedom Defense Initiative spurred a violent attack. (...) Insulting a religion with more than a billion followers does not advance the cause of defeating the fanatical jihadists. It hurts the cause." ...|$|R
