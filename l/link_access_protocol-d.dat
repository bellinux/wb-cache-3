40|$|The {{wireless}} {{medium is}} a scarce shared resource in mobile computing. Consequently, the {{media access control}} (MAC) layer influences the fairness and robustness of the wireless network. According to the current MAC protocols, stations {{are not able to}} gain access equally to the shared wireless medium. This problem is commonlyknown as the fairness problem. The fairness problem occurs mostly because of the existence of hidden stations and the presumption of a non-fully connected wireless network topology. This paper addresses solutions to the fairness problem in wireless networks. p-persistent carrier sense multiple access based algorithms are proposed in which a fair wireless access for each user is accomplished using a pre-calculated <b>link</b> <b>access</b> probability, p ij, that represents the <b>link</b> <b>access</b> probability from station i to j. <b>Link</b> <b>access</b> probabilities are calculated at the source station in two ways using connection-based and time-based media access methods.

We formulate the problem as a utility maximization problem with routing and <b>link</b> <b>access</b> constraints.

The resulting algorithm directly translates into a distributed cross-layer scheme for joint congestion control, routing and link scheduling of the wireless links which revolves around link layer pricing. The convex problem formulation {{and the use of the}} sub-gradient algorithm ensures that the solution converges within an interval of the optimal value.

40|$|Malware-contaminated hosts {{organized}} as a ``bot network'' can target and flood network links (e. g., routers). Yet, {{none of the}} countermeasures to link flooding proposed to date have provided dependable <b>link</b> <b>access</b> (i. e., <b>link</b> <b>access</b> guarantees) for legitimate traffic during such attacks. Network-layer capabilities offer strong protection against link flooding by authorizing individual flows with unforgeable credentials (i. e., capabilities). However, network-layer capabilities are insufficient for dependable <b>link</b> <b>access,</b> for several reasons: (1) the capability-setup channel is vulnerable to flooding attacks that prevent legitimate clients from acquiring capabilities; i. e., Denial of Capability (DoC) attacks, (2) compromised attack sources that have acquired capabilities in a legitimate way can flood the privileged channel reserved for capability carrying packets, and (3) the global effects of flooding attacks are still unavoidable with ``per-flow'' based capabilities. In this dissertation, we present a router-level design that confines the effects of link flooding attacks to specified locales or neighborhoods (e. g., one or more administrative domains of the Internet) based on network-layer capabilities. Our design provides differential guarantees for <b>access</b> to network <b>links</b> that favor packets from uncontaminated domains by attack sources (e. g., bots) and yet do not deny access to packets from contaminated domains. For connection-request packets (i. e., capability requests), differential access guarantees are defined as the probabilistic lower bounds for link access: requests from uncontaminated domains have higher probabilistic lower bounds for <b>link</b> <b>access</b> than those from contaminated domains. For all other packets, differential access guarantees are {{defined in terms of}} the the bandwidth allocated to packet flows; i. e., flows of malware-uncontaminated domains receive higher bandwidth guarantees than flows of contaminated ones, and legitimate flows of contaminated domains are guaranteed substantially higher bandwidth than attack flows. Potential side-effects of attack flows (e. g., multiple congested links) are mitigated by a differential routing scheme, whereby flows of malware-uncontaminated domains are routed through less congested paths while those of contaminated domains are routed through the ``pinned'' default paths. We present analytical models for the proposed notions of dependable <b>link</b> <b>access,</b> and evaluate our router design both by comprehensive simulations under different attack scenarios and by comparisons with other flooding-defense schemes...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} gathering correlated sensor data by a single sink node in a wireless sensor network. We assume that the sensor nodes are energy-constrained and design efficient distributed protocols to maximize the network lifetime. Many existing approaches focus on optimizing the routing layer only, {{but in fact the}} routing strategy is often coupled with power control in the physical layer and <b>link</b> <b>access</b> in the MAC layer. This paper represents a first effort on network lifetime maximization that jointly considers the three layers. We first assume that <b>link</b> <b>access</b> probabilities are known and {{consider the}} joint optimal design of power control and routing. We show that the formulated optimization problem is convex and propose a distributed algorithm, JRPA, for the solution. We also discuss the convergence of JRPA. When the optimal <b>link</b> <b>access</b> probabilities are unknown, as in many practical networks, we generalize the problem formulation to encompass all the three layers of routing, power control, and link-layer random access. In this case, the problem cannot be converted into a convex optimization problem, but there exists a duality gap when the Lagrangian dual method is employed. We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, JRPRA, to solve the general problem, and show through numerical experiments that it can significantly narrow the gap between the computed and optimal solutions. Moreover, even without a priori knowledge of the best <b>link</b> <b>access</b> probabilities predetermined for JRPA, JRPRA achieves extremely competitive performance with JRPA. Beyond the metric of network lifetime, we also discuss how {{to solve the problem of}} correlated data gathering under general utility functions. Other numerical results are provided to show the convergence of the algorithms and their advantages over existing solutions...|$|R
