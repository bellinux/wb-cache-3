Methods To investigate whether cholesterol could regulate uPAR and MMP- 9 in breast carcinoma, we used MβCD (methyl beta cyclodextrin, which extracts cholesterol from lipid rafts) to disrupt lipid rafts and studied its effect on breast cancer cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis and signaling. Results Morphological evidence showed the association of uPAR with lipid rafts in breast carcinoma cells. MβCD treatment significantly reduced the colocalization of uPAR and MMP- 9 with lipid raft markers and also significantly reduced uPAR and MMP- 9 at both the protein and mRNA <b>levels.</b> <b>Spheroid</b> migration and invasion assays showed inhibition of breast carcinoma cell migration and invasion after MβCD treatment. In vitro angiogenesis studies showed a significant decrease in the angiogenic potential of cells pretreated with MβCD. MβCD treatment significantly reduced the levels of MMP- 9 and uPAR in raft fractions of MDA-MB- 231 and ZR 751 cells. Phosphorylated forms of Src, FAK, Cav, Akt and ERK were significantly inhibited upon MβCD treatment. Increased levels of soluble uPAR were observed upon MβCD treatment. Cholesterol supplementation restored uPAR expression to basal levels in breast carcinoma cell lines. Increased colocalization of uPAR with the lysosomal marker LAMP 1 was observed in MβCD-treated cells when compared with untreated cells. Conclusion Taken together, our results suggest that cholesterol levels in lipid rafts are critical for the migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of breast carcinoma cells and could be a critical regulatory factor in these cancer cell processes mediated by uPAR and MMP- 9. </p...|$|R

40|$|The liver {{is a key}} organ in drug {{bioavailability}} including uptake, metabolism, and excretion as well as drug toxicity. Thus, {{a robust}} liver in vitro model that resembles in vivo micro environment with improved predictive capabilities is highly warranted. The focus in this thesis has been to develop and characterize a 3 D liver spheroid model {{for the study of}} long-term drug uptake, metabolism, and transport. The bipotent progenitor cell line HepaRG has been used as it is known to express various liver specific markers and function in its differentiated state similar to primary human hepatocytes. Culturing these cells onto ultra-low attachment plates derived spheroid formation after 3 days independent of cellular concentration. Various staining techniques were used to investigate long-term sustainability of 2000 and 4000 cell spheroid culture. The gene expression analysis of the drug metabolizing cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes illustrated higher expression <b>level</b> in <b>spheroid</b> formation compared to 2 D control while drug transporter, MRP 2, hepatocyte markers Ki 67, albumin, and CK 19 all showed moderate to low expression.

40|$|Abstract Background Cell-based therapies such as {{autologous}} chondrocyte implantation {{are promising}} therapeutic approaches to treat cartilage defects {{to prevent further}} cartilage degeneration. To assure consistent quality of cell-based therapeutics, {{it is important to}} be able to predict the biological activity of such products. This requires the development of a potency assay, which assesses a characteristic of the cell transplant before implantation that can predict its cartilage regeneration capacity after implantation. In this study, an ex vivo human cartilage repair model was developed as quality assessment tool for potency and applied to co. don’s chondrosphere product, a matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implant (chondrocyte spheroids) that is in clinical use in Germany. Methods Chondrocyte spheroids were generated from 14 donors, and implanted into a subchondral cartilage defect that was manually generated in human articular cartilage tissue. Implanted spheroids and cartilage tissue were co-cultured ex vivo for 12  weeks to allow regeneration processes to form new tissue within the cartilage defect. Before implantation, spheroid characteristics like glycosaminoglycan production and gene and protein expression of chondrogenic markers were assessed for each donor sample and compared to determine donor-dependent variation. Results After the co-cultivation, histological analyses showed the formation of repair tissue within the cartilage defect, which varied in amount for the different donors. In the repair tissue, aggrecan protein was expressed and extra-cellular matrix cartilage fibers were present, both indicative for a cartilage hyaline-like character of the repair tissue. The amount of formed repair tissue was used as a read-out for regeneration capacity and was correlated with the spheroid characteristics determined before implantation. A positive correlation was found between high level of aggrecan protein expression in spheroids before implantation and a higher regeneration potential after implantation, reflected by more newly formed repair tissue. Conclusion This demonstrated that aggrecan protein expression <b>levels</b> in <b>spheroids</b> before implantation can potentially be used as surrogate potency assay for the cartilage cell transplant to predict its regenerative capacity after implantation in human patients...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To obtain {{unambiguous}} {{evidence for}} the putative role of E-cadherin in the selective accumulation of hypericin after intravesical instillation in humans we investigated the accumulation of hypericin in spheroids from 3 clones of the human bladder carcinoma cell line T- 24 that express different levels of E-cadherin, as determined by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clones of T- 24 cells transfected with the E-cadherin gene were analyzed for E-cadherin expression and 3 cell lines with different expression <b>levels</b> were selected. <b>Spheroids</b> of these cell lines were incubated with 10 muM hypericin in cell culture medium supplemented or not with fetal calf serum for 2 hours. After the incubation period centrally cut sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy. An imaging software system {{was used to measure}} average fluorescence in concentric layers from rim to center. RESULTS: Data showed that in the presence of serum the accumulation of hypericin in spheroids was inversely associated with the level of E-cadherin expressed by the T- 24 transfectants used, whereas in the absence of serum differential accumulation of the compound was completely abolished. CONCLUSIONS: Spheroids composed of cancer cell lines expressing variable levels of E-cadherin represent an excellent model in which to study the role of intercellular adhesion in bladder cancer. The outcome of this study strongly suggests that E-cadherin is the key mediator in the selective accumulation of hypericin in superficial bladder cancer after intravesical instillation in humans. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Iron is an {{essential}} nutrient for normal cellular functioning, but excess iron retention is a hallmark of breast cancer, used to fuel cancer cells proliferative demands. Breast cancer cells alter genes that control iron metabolism to promote accumulation of cellular iron. One way breast cancer cells retain iron is through decreased iron export. Breast cancer cells have reduced expression of the iron efflux pump, ferroportin (FPN). FPN is reduced by the iron regulating peptide hepcidin, which binds to FPN and triggers its degradation, resulting in decreased iron export. Hepcidin is elevated in breast cancer to promote accumulation of cellular iron. However, the pathways responsible for elevated hepcidin in breast cancer cells have never been investigated. In this thesis we utilize several culture methods to examine {{the full spectrum of}} hepcidin regulation in breast cancer including two- and three-dimensional culture of established cell lines and primary breast cells, as well as co-culture systems with stromal cells. Ultimately, we reveal a complex hepcidin regulatory network involving protein molecules and spatial cues, consisting of changes at the cellular, dimensional and microenvironmental levels. Specifically, we found regulation of hepcidin by ligands including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and growth-differentiation factor- 15 (GDF- 15) in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, as well as novel regulation by the microenvironment, specifically by contribution of tumor associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix proteins. Additionally, we reveal global changes in iron metabolism in breast cancer spheroids and that targeting enhanced iron <b>levels</b> present in <b>spheroids</b> results in disaggregation and spheroid cell death. Thus, targeting iron in breast tumors may be an attractive molecular strategy for selective killing of breast cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|Nanomaterials can be {{synthesized}} from a {{wide range}} of material systems in numerous morphologies, creating an extremely diverse portfolio. As result of this tunability, these materials are emerging as a new class of nanotherapeutics and imaging agents. One particularly interesting nanomaterial is the gold nanoparticle. Due to its inherent biocompatibility and tunable photothermal behavior, it has made a rapid transition from the lab setting to in vivo testing. In most nanotherapeutic applications, the efficacy of the agent is directly related to the target of interest. However, the optimization of the AuNP size and shape for efficacy in vitro, prior to testing in in vivo models of a disease, has been largely limited to two dimensional monolayers of cells. Two dimensional cell cultures are unable to reproduce conditions experienced by AuNP in the body. In this article, we systematically investigate the effect of different properties of AuNP on the penetration depth into 3 D cell spheroids using two-photon microscopy. The 3 D spheroids are formed from the HCT 116 cell line, a colorectal carcinoma cell line. In addition to studying different sizes and shapes of AuNPs, we also study the effect of an oligo surface chemistry. There is a significant difference between AuNP uptake profiles in the 2 D monolayers of cells as compared to the 3 D cell spheroids. Additionally, the range of sizes and shapes studied here also exhibit marked differences in uptake penetration depth and efficacy. Finally, our results demonstrate that two-photon microscopy enables quantitative AuNP localization and concentration data to be obtained at the single <b>spheroid</b> <b>level</b> without fluorescent labeling of the AuNP, thus, providing a viable technique for large scale screening of AuNP properties in 3 D cell spheroids as compared to tedious and time consuming techniques like electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Cells are {{frequently}} studied {{because they are}} basic structural, functional, and biological units of living organisms. Extracting features from cellular behaviors can facilitate decision making in medical diagnoses and represents an important aspect {{in the development of}} biomedical engineering. Previous studies have just focused on either the individual cell or cell clusters separately, which leads to a great lack of information. Microwell technologies could address the challenges of in vitro cellular studies, from individual cell studies to 3 D functional assays, by providing more information from smaller sample volumes and enabling the incorporation of low-cost high-throughput assays in the drug discovery process. To this end, the present study describes an easy-to-use method for fabricating a versatile microwell chip that utilizes a digital micro-mirror device printing system, and the chip can be employed in multidimensional cellular analysis, ranging from the single cell to the 3 D <b>spheroid</b> <b>level.</b> The microwell manufacturing process, using a digital mask in place of a conventional physical mask, is based on shadowed light and is full of flexibility. Three different dimensions (single cell (1 D), cell monolayer (2 D) and cell spheroid (3 D)) of one cell type can be formed using a microwell array and the analyses of biological characteristics are achieved separately. Single cells and cell clusters can be controlled via customized geometries of microfabricated selectively adhesive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) wells. The effects of shape on cellular growth and hybrid tissue layers were investigated by peeling off the microwells. Furthermore, 3 D multicellular spheroids were successfully established in a controllable and high-throughput format. Preclinical drug screening was investigated and distinct differences were observed in the tolerance response to drug testing between the 2 D and 3 D conditions. The study results further demonstrate that the high-density microwell chip is an easy-to-use multidimensional cellular analysis and rapid drug screening technique, and it could be easily adapted {{for a wide range of}} biological research applications...|$|R
