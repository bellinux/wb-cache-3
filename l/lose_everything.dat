5|$|Babe starts serving breakfasts in the pub, {{putting her}} in direct {{competition}} with the local caf√©, which starts a feud with its owner, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). Babe tries to sabotage Kathy's business by poisoning her coffee machine, disgusting the Carter family. Babe creates a scheme to illegally serve alcohol with breakfast and unwittingly serves beer to a police detective who is working undercover. Days later, Babe, Mick and Shirley are arrested for breaching the licence laws, but Babe lies to the police that it was Mick's plan that she was following. Mick, Shirley and Babe are ordered to pay a fine. When Sylvie belittles Babe, she leaves Sylvie by the canal in the rain, although Sylvie is found and Shirley realises that Babe left Sylvie to die and disowns her. When Shirley finds Babe stealing from the Vic, she physically throws her out and explains to Mick. Babe pleads with him to let her stay, but Mick rejects her so she insults Linda. Mick ejects Babe from the Vic and she curses the family, hoping they <b>lose</b> <b>everything.</b>|$|E

Maggie, unaware when finding Bianca in bed with Babe earlier {{that it was a}} ploy to trap JR into confessing that he framed Jamie, wraps herself deeply into Jonathan's life. It is not long before Jamie goes on the run with Babe, leaving Maggie without a roommate. She has Jonathan move in with her. Everything goes well with Jonathan at first, their relationship seeming to be more about sex in the beginning. Jonathan is even aware of Maggie's sexual confusion and asks her how she could have ever thought she was gay. Maggie says she was wrong. Although Bianca and Maggie share a second kiss together, Maggie stresses to Bianca that she is not a lesbian. Things begin to fall apart for Jonathan and Maggie's romance when she finds him destroying the shirt Bianca wore the night Miranda was born. Jonathan convinces Maggie that the shirt would have provided the evidence needed to prove that the Cambias heir, Ethan, is really a Cambias, and would have resulted in Jonathan's brother, the current heir to the Cambias fortune, Ryan, to <b>lose</b> <b>everything.</b> Maggie covers for him with Bianca.|$|E

25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will <b>lose</b> <b>everything,</b> if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

500|$|Babe {{made her}} final {{appearance}} on 9 February 2017. In the episode, Babe {{tries to make}} amends with her family by taking care of Sylvie, but instead takes her to the canal and tells her that Stan {{is on the other}} side, before leaving her alone. Badland explained that Babe [...] "would not have actually killed" [...] Sylvie, but instead [...] "enticed her to do something and then walked away from it". When Shirley discovers Babe's actions, she tells her to leave so Babe tries to steal money from the pub's safe. Shirley catches her in the act and announces her actions to Mick. Babe pleads with Mick for another chance, but when she calls Linda a [...] "stuck-up cow", Mick escorts her out. Badland explained that Babe does this because she is [...] "absolutely desperate". Outside the pub, Babe curses the family and exclaimed, [...] "I hope you <b>lose</b> <b>everything</b> and your precious pub", which caused media outlets to question whether it foreshadows speculation the family would lose their pub. Badland believed that [...] "with all the threats she made, Babe might be back at some point." [...] She added that, [...] "She's cursed the Carters, and you don't cross Aunt Babe and get away with it!" ...|$|E

500|$|Majora's Mask {{imposes a}} time limit of three days (72 hours) game-time, which is about 54 minutes in real time. An {{on-screen}} clock tracks the day and time. Link can return to 6:00am {{on the first day}} by playing the [...] "Song of Time" [...] on the Ocarina of Time. If he does not before the 72 hours expire, then the moon will destroy Clock Town, including all the surrounding regions of Termina and Link will <b>lose</b> <b>everything</b> he accomplished during these three days. A real-time countdown will begin when only 6 hours remain. However, returning to the first day saves the player's progress and major accomplishments permanently, such as the acquisition of maps, masks, musical tracks, and weapons. Cleared puzzles, keys, and minor items will be lost, as well as any rupees not in the bank, and almost all characters will have no recollection of meeting Link. Link can slow down time or warp to the next morning or evening by playing two variations of the Song of Time. Owl statues scattered across certain major areas of the world allow the player to temporarily save their progress once they have been activated, and also provide warp points to quickly move around the world.|$|E
500|$|Cross, a {{resolute}} Christian, {{converted to}} Christianity while {{on leave from}} a posting to Cyprus in 1981. He visited Jerusalem over the Easter weekend and {{was inspired by a}} retired British Army officer he met there to convert. After converting, he considered leaving the Army, but has said in interviews that he reconciled his beliefs with his military service, contending that [...] "the British Army as a community [...] recognises the issue of spirituality and goodness and righteousness and justice and evil and wrong probably far more than most". He is a licensed lay reader in the Church of England and has involvement with a number of Christian organisations, including as a trustee of the British and Foreign Bible Society and {{a former president of the}} Armed Forces Christian Union. In an interview for the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2009, he said [...] "The moral component of fighting power is about leadership, it's about ethics, it's about culture, it's about how do you get people to fight and embedded within that is an element of justice and righteousness. f you lose the moral component, you <b>lose</b> <b>everything.</b> I think we ‚Äì collectively in the West ‚Äì have gone through 30 - 40 years really of pretending that this moral component is not important, and that I don't need to have a biblical foundation in my life. And I challenge that." [...] He has written on the subject in the British Army Review, an in house publication aimed at generating professional debate, where he described ideas of a secular Army as 'tripe' and 'dangerously wrong' and the rewrite of the motto of the Girl Guides, removing reference to God, as 'vapid and anodyne'.|$|E
500|$|The glamorous {{world of}} Hollywood also {{reflected}} in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that [...] "in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future. You can <b>lose</b> <b>everything</b> because you can lose yourself." [...] The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate {{on the things that}} did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track [...] "Mother and Father". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was [...] "a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on." [...] According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , another concept of American Life was about [...] "nothingness". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But [...] "Nothing Fails", along with tracks [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track [...] "Easy Ride," [...] which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.|$|E

Cerebus is befriended by the legendary Regency Elf as he adjusts to his new circumstances. He meets and soon finds himself maneuvered into a political campaign by the mysterious Astoria, who is also manipulating Artemis into pseudo-super hero identities that are parodies of Moon Knight and later Sergeant Preston of the Mounties.

2500|$|He {{points out}} that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of {{happiness}} and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness {{for the possibility of}} gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since [...] "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or <b>lose</b> <b>everything.</b> You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, [...] "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub {{felt the}} remake {{departed}} from the traditional template used by more recent remakes‚Äî"include twice as many kills, [...] boring young actors from TV shows, rewrite the script so you <b>lose</b> <b>everything</b> interesting about the original, [...] make up an excuse to add cell phones"‚Äîwhich ultimately made it far more effective. Hartlaub cited the script, which he felt devoted as much time to character development as [...] "carnage", and the [...] "good acting", particularly Tony Goldwyn, as reasons why this remake succeeds. Kyle Smith, of the New York Post, agreed that the film succeeded where other remakes had failed. For Smith, it was {{the replacement of the}} [...] "quick-cutting, loud noises and camera tricks" [...] clich√©s with [...] "long takes, genuinely disturbing violence and stretches with no dialogue to pin you to the story", which made this film more effective. Smith also commended Dillahunt's acting, as well as Iliadis's [...] "casual, matter-of-fact approach that multiplies the horror to an almost unbearable level". In contrast, USA Today's Claudia Puig stated that director Dennis Iliadis failed at trying to keep the film from becoming another [...] "torture porn". Puig felt that the killing scenes were too drawn out, noting the technique was down to heighten the effect, but actually comes across more as [...] "repugnant and fetishized violence". She also noted that the parents seemed to find enjoyment in exacting their revenge, even when their daughter lay dying in the next room. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News was in agreement with Puig when he referred to the film as [...] "stomach-churningly anti-human" [...] because of its violence, and questioned why Goldwyn and Potter even signed on to the film. Neumaier suggests that the film's violence fails to create the sense of [...] "theatricality of the Saw or Hostel films", or even provide audiences with [...] "the unkillable-monster nostalgia of [...] Friday the 13th re-do". Neumaier also states that the 2009 film lacks the reasoning to exist that Craven's 1972 original had, which was to push the [...] "boundaries of cinema's new permissiveness".|$|E
