25|$|Latino sine flexione ("Latin without inflections"), Interlingua de Academia pro Interlingua (IL de ApI) or Peano’s Interlingua (abbreviated as IL), is an {{international}} auxiliary language compiled by the Academia pro Interlingua under chairmanship of the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) in 1887-1914. It is a simplified version of Latin, and retains its vocabulary. <b>Language</b> <b>codes</b> ISO 639: ISO 639-2 and -1 were requested on 23 July 2017 at Library of Congress (proposed: IL and ILA); ISO-639-3 was requested on 10 August 2017 at SIL (proposed: ILA). Interlingua-IL {{was published in the}} journal Revue de Mathématiques (meaning Mathematical Review), in an article of 1903 entitled De Latino Sine Flexione, Lingua Auxiliare Internationale (meaning Latin Without Inflection, International Auxiliary Language), which explained the reason for its creation. The article argued that other auxiliary languages were unnecessary, since Latin was already established as the world’s international language. The article was written in classical Latin, but it gradually dropped its inflections until there were none.|$|E
2500|$|Interlingua ( [...] ; ISO 639 <b>language</b> <b>codes</b> ia, ina) is an Italic {{international}} auxiliary language (IAL), {{developed between}} 1937 and 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA). It {{ranks among the}} top most widely used IALs (along with Esperanto and Ido), and is {{the most widely used}} naturalistic IAL: in other words, its vocabulary, grammar and other characteristics are derived from natural languages rather than a centrally planned grammar and vocabulary. Interlingua was developed to combine a simple, mostly regular grammar with a vocabulary common to the widest possible range of western European languages, making it unusually easy to learn, at least for those whose native languages were sources of Interlingua's vocabulary and grammar. Conversely, it is used as a rapid introduction to many natural languages.|$|E

The analysis of the data revealed the following three aspects of participants’ orientations: (a) speakers’ orientation to both <b>language</b> <b>code</b> and actions within a single strip of talk, (b) differential orientations between speakers and listeners, and (c) the lack of a clear distinction and irrelevance (for the participants) of the boundary between participants’ orientations to <b>language</b> <b>code</b> and actions.
