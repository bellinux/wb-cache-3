25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while {{the participant was}} led to believe they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones they were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought {{at the time of the}} action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E

25|$|Continuity of supply. The 2015 Impact Report reports {{an average}} supply of 18 hours per day, up from 14 hours in 2006-07. Only in nine mostly small WSPs water is {{provided}} continuously 24 hours per day. In Nairobi water is provided on average for 18 {{hours a day}} and in Mombasa for 6 hours. Nonetheless, instances of water scarcity (defined as more than five days without or with insufficient water supply) still occur in Kenya. In 2006 in Kisumu over 40% of households (both poor and non-poor) connected to water mains reported scarcity. The greatest difference between the poor and non-poor was recorded in Nairobi, where poor households were more than twice as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they experienced scarcity. A higher percentage of kiosk users reported scarcity than households with mains connections, suggesting that in times of scarcity kiosks are less likely to receive water than domestic connections.|$|E

40|$|These are {{the results}} of two surveys of relatives, and others who knew people who had died, {{describing}} events {{in the year before}} death and their views on the time of the person's death. Those surveyed were identified from death certificates in England. The main focus is on a sample of 3696 people dying in 1990 in 20 health authorities, with supporting analysis from an earlier national sample of 639 people dying in 1987. Variation in peoples' views about whether an earlier death would have been better is reported, in the context of debate about euthanasia. Spouses were less <b>likely</b> than others <b>to</b> feel {{that it would have been}} better if the person had died earlier, and this held true even when controlling for the deceaseds' levels of pain, distress, dependency and age. Spouses were more <b>likely</b> than others <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a later death would have been better, though not in cases where the deceased was reported as having said they wanted to die sooner. Spouses were influenced by the loss which the death of the person represented for them, being more <b>likely</b> than others <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they missed the person who died a great deal, and feel loneliness was a big problem. Non spouses (children and other relatives of the deceased, friends, neighbours and a few officials) on the other hand were more <b>likely</b> than spouses <b>to</b> <b>say</b> an earlier death would have been better, even when levels of pain, distress, dependency and age were controlled for. They were also more <b>likely</b> than spouses <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this when the deceased was not said to have wanted to die earlier. This was influenced by the fact that they experienced care as more burdensome than spouses, finding that it restricted their lives. The consequences of all this is that the very old were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be cared for by people who, in retrospect, felt that it would have been better if the old person had died earlier. The views of the very old, particularly of women, suggest that they themselves often take on the view that they are 'too old'. death euthanasia age caring...|$|R
40|$|This {{bulletin}} {{addresses the}} issue of reporting crimes against juveniles, describing findings from the National Crime Victimization Survey, which gathers information from citizens on crime, including whether {{and how they are}} reported. The survey also collects information about characteristics of victimizations, the nature of the incident location, and the incident itself. This analysis discusses the information gathered on juvenile and adult reporting of sexual assaults and thefts. Results indicate that crimes involving juveniles are under-reported in absolute terms and in comparison with adults. This is not explained by the victimization of juveniles being less serious or by the tendency of juveniles to report crimes to school authorities rather than police. Under-reporting is evident even for the most serious offenses. This is partly because juvenile victims are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be victimized by other juveniles, and crimes committed by juveniles are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be reported. Juveniles were more <b>likely</b> than adults <b>to</b> discount their violent victimizations as minor or kid stuff. Juveniles were no more <b>likely</b> than adults <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they thought the police would not take the incident seriously, nor were they more <b>likely</b> than adults <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they were afraid of reprisals. Implications are discussed. (SM) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document...|$|R

2500|$|Where {{classical}} hypnosis is authoritative {{and direct}} and often encounters {{resistance in the}} subject, Erickson's approach is permissive, accommodating and indirect. For example, where a classical hypnotist might say [...] "You are going into a trance", an Ericksonian hypnotist would be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "you can comfortably learn how {{to go into a}} trance". In this way, he provides an opportunity for the subject to accept the suggestions they are most comfortable with, at their own pace, and with an awareness of the benefits. The subject knows they are not being hustled and takes full ownership of, and participates in, their transformation. [...] Because the induction takes place {{during the course of a}} normal conversation, Ericksonian hypnosis is often known as Covert or Conversational Hypnosis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{emotional}} Stroop effect {{serves as}} an information processing approach to emotions. In an emotional Stroop task, an individual is given negative emotional words like [...] "grief," [...] "violence," [...] and [...] "pain" [...] mixed in with more neutral words like [...] "clock," [...] "door," [...] and [...] "shoe". [...] Just like in the original Stroop task, the words are colored and the individual is supposed to name the color. Research has revealed that individuals that are depressed are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{the color of a}} negative word slower than the color of a neutral word. [...] While both the emotional Stroop and the classic Stroop involve the need to suppress irrelevant or distracting information, there are differences between the two. The emotional Stroop effect emphasizes the conflict between the emotional relevance to the individual and the word; whereas, the classic Stroop effect examines the conflict between the incongruent color and word.|$|E
2500|$|Some market {{organizations}} {{may give}} rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty.

Information asymmetry arises here, if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it.

2500|$|There is a {{progression}} from this {{opening of the}} nominal group, with the greatest specifying potential, through items that have successively less identifying potential and are increasingly permanent as attributes of the head. As Halliday points out, [...] "the more permanent the attribute of a thing, the less likely it is to identify it in a particular context" [...] (that is, of the speech event). The most permanent item, of course, is the head itself. This pattern from transient specification to permanent attribute explains why the items are ordered {{as they are in}} a nominal group. The deictic ("those") comes first; this is followed by the numerative, if there is one ("five"), since the number of apples, in this case, is the least permanent attribute; next comes the interpersonal epithet which, arising from the speaker's opinion, is closer to the speaker–now matrix than the more objectively testable experiential epithet ("shiny"); then comes the more permanent classifier ("Jonathon", a type of apple), leading to the head itself. This ordering of increasing permanence from left to right is why we are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "her new black car" [...] than [...] "her black new car": the newness will recede sooner than the blackness.|$|E

[...] College visits (including overnight ones), interviews, attending College Fair days, comments in the essay, contacting college faculty members, answering and opening emails, place position of the college on the FAFSA form or its FAFSA position, and other indications of interest can be a factor for many colleges concerned about their yield—the percent of students who accept an offer of enrollment. According to Andover's college counseling director Sean Logan, {{it is important to have}} numerous contact points with colleges to show demonstrated interest: visiting, phone contact, emailing, visits to websites (including number of clicks as well as length of time on the website), whether a college visit included a tour and interview, and whether a college-recommended off-campus personal interview was done.
