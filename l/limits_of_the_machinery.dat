At present, Kazakhstan’s machinery industry is {{closely linked to}} the revitalization process that is taking place in the agricultural and mining sectors. Notwithstanding <b>the</b> large endowment <b>of</b> mineral resources and the vast arable land area, the economy has experienced a difficult economic transition from the former centrally planned system to a market economy. Although the situation in the mining and mineral processing industry is not as severe as that in the agriculture and agro-industrial activities, enterprises operating in this area lack expertise in operating within a free market system. In agriculture and agro-industrial activities <b>the</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machinery</b> industry has been <b>limited.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machinery</b> has been imported from other countries, with local manufacturers currently supplying about 15 percent of domestic requirements.

Replication-dependent variants and those caused by episodical DNA damage enhance {{the probability that}} a small fraction of a cell population may survive a sudden (physical or biological) change of environmental conditions. Replication-independent variants arise during persistent but not immediately lethal stress (e. g. starvation) of a non-dividing population.

40|$|This report {{describes}} <b>the</b> microinjection <b>of</b> a purified peroxisomal protein, alcohol oxidase, from Pichia pastoris into mammalian {{tissue culture}} cells and <b>the</b> subsequent transport <b>of</b> this protein into vesicular structures. Transport was into membrane-enclosed vesicles as judged by digitonin-permeabilization experiments. The transport was {{time and temperature}} dependent. Vesicles containing alcohol oxidase could be detected as long as 6 d after injection. Coinjection of synthetic peptides containing a consensus carboxyterminal tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal resulted in abolition of alcohol oxidase transport into vesicles in all cell lines examined. Double-label experiments indicated that, although some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alcohol oxidase was transported into vesicles that contained other peroxisomal proteins, <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alcohol oxidase {{did not appear to}} be transported to preexisting peroxisomes. While <b>the</b> inhibition <b>of</b> transport of alcohol oxidase by peptides containing the peroxisomal targeting signal suggests a competition for some <b>limiting</b> component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machinery</b> involved in <b>the</b> sorting <b>of</b> proteins into peroxisomes, the organelles into which <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein is targeted appear to be unusual and distinct from endogenous peroxisomes by several criteria. Microinjected alcohol oxidase was transported into vesicles in normal fibroblasts and also in cell lines derived from patients with Zellweger syndrome, which are unable to transport proteins containing the ser-lys- leu-COOH peroxisomal targeting signal into peroxisomes (Walton et al., 1992). <b>The</b> implications <b>of</b> this result for <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> peroxisomal protein transport are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In vitro, the TAFII 60 {{component}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TFIID complex {{contributes to}} RNA polymerase II transcription initiation by {{serving as a}} coactivator that interacts with specific activator proteins and possibly as a promoter selectivity factor that interacts with the downstream promoter element. In vivo roles for TAFII 60 in metazoan transcription are not as clear. Here we have investigated the developmental and transcriptional requirements for TAFII 60 by analyzing four independent Drosophila melanogaster TAFII 60 mutants. Loss-of-function mutations in Drosophila TAFII 60 result in lethality, indicating that TAFII 60 provides a nonredundant function in vivo. Molecular analysis of TAFII 60 alleles revealed that essential TAFII 60 functions are provided by two evolutionarily conserved regions located in <b>the</b> N-terminal half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein. TAFII 60 is required at all stages of Drosophila development, in both germ cells and somatic cells. Expression of TAFII 60 from a transgene rescued <b>the</b> lethality <b>of</b> TAFII 60 mutants and exposed requirements for TAFII 60 during imaginal development, spermatogenesis, and oogenesis. Phenotypes of rescued TAFII 60 mutant flies implicate TAFII 60 in transcriptional mechanisms that regulate cell growth and cell fate specification and suggest that TAFII 60 is a <b>limiting</b> component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machinery</b> that regulates <b>the</b> transcription <b>of</b> dosage-sensitive genes. Finally, TAFII 60 plays roles in developmental regulation of gene expression that are distinct from those of other TAFII proteins...|$|R

5000|$|The T2 and its {{variants}} (see [...] ) however used conventional geared {{steam turbine}} propulsion, and with <b>the</b> massive expansion <b>of</b> US shipbuilding, a production bottleneck developed: <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precision <b>machinery</b> needed to manufacture reduction gearing. The Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Chester, Pennsylvania worked around {{this problem by}} designing a T2 variant which used turbo-electric propulsion; that is, the steam turbine ran a generator, which in turn powered electric drive motors {{without the need for}} gearing. Compared to conventional geared turbines turbo-electric systems produced less power for the same size and weight, so Sun's T2-SE (steam-electric)-A1 design could only develop 6,000 shaft horsepower for 14 knots, but since commercial tankers typically only did 12-13 knots this was acceptable. Acknowledging <b>the</b> practicality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design for merchant service, the Maritime Commission ordered 72 T2-SE-A1s from four shipyards in May 1941.

Stress-stabilized WT Cx 32 and CFTR, but not the mutant/unassembled proteins examined, could traverse the secretory pathway. Heat shock also slowed the otherwise rapid UPS-mediated turnover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cytosolic proteins myoD and GFPu, but not <b>the</b> degradation <b>of</b> an ubiquitination-independent construct (GFP-ODC) closely related to <b>the</b> latter.

It is clear that in these machines energy should be used efficiently. In this dissertation {{the aim is to}} improve <b>the</b> design process <b>of</b> high-speed electrical machines especially from the mechanical engineering perspective in order to achieve more reliable and efficient machines. <b>The</b> design process <b>of</b> high-speed machines is challenging due to high demands and several interactions between different engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical and energy engineering. A multidisciplinary design flow chart for a specific type of high-speed machine in which computer simulation is utilized is proposed.

40|$|Gene {{activators}} contain activation domains {{that are}} thought to recruit <b>limiting</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transcription <b>machinery</b> to a core promoter. VP 16, a viral gene activator, {{has served as a}} model for studying <b>the</b> mechanistic aspects <b>of</b> transcriptional activation from yeast to human. The VP 16 activation domain can be divided into two modules—an N-terminal subdomain (VPN) and a C-terminal subdomain (VPC). This study demonstrates that VPC stimulates core promoters that are either independent or dependent on TAFs (TATA-box Binding Protein-Associated Factors). In contrast, VPN only activates the TAF-independent core promoter and this activity increases in a synergistic fashion when VPN is dimerized (VPN 2). Compared to one copy of VPN (VPN 1), VPN 2 also displays a highly cooperative increase in binding hTFIIB. The increased TFIIB binding correlates with VPN 2 's increased ability to recruit a complex containing TFIID, TFIIA and TFIIB. However, VPN 1 and VPN 2 do not increase <b>the</b> assembly <b>of</b> a complex containing only TFIID and TFIIA. The VPN subdomain also facilitates assembly of a complex containing TBP:TFIIA:TFIIB, which lacks TAFs, and provides a mechanism that could function at TAF-independent promoters. Taken together, these results suggest the interaction between VPN and TFIIB potentially initiate a network <b>of</b> contacts allowing <b>the</b> activator to indirectly tether TFIID or TBP to DNA...|$|R

In crewed situations where sensors, computation capabilities, and other necessary instrumentation are unavailable, manual control is the only alternative.

We found the exocytic protein Munc 18 b {{to be highly}} expressed in mouse airway epithelial cells and MCs, and localized to <b>the</b> apical pole <b>of</b> airway secretory cells. To address its functions, we created a mouse with a severely hypomorphic Munc 18 b allele such that protein expression in heterozygotes was reduced by∼ 50 %. Homozygous mutant mice were not viable, but heterozygotes showed a ∼ 50 % reduction in stimulated release of mucin from epithelial cells and granule contents from MCs. The defect in MCs affected only regulated secretion and not constitutive or transporter-mediated secretion. <b>The</b> severity <b>of</b> passive cutaneous anaphylaxiswas also reduced by ∼ 50 %, showing that reduction of Munc 18 b expression results in an attenuation of physiological responses dependent on MC degranulation. The Munc 18 b promoter is controlled by INR (initiator), Sp 1 (specificity protein 1), Ets, CRE (cAMP-response element), GRE (glucocorticoid-response element), GATA and E-box elements in airway epithelial cells; however, protein levels did not change during mucous metaplasia induced by allergic inflammation.

40|$|Human {{chorionic}} gonadotropin (hCG) is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest signals secreted by the implanting embryo. In {{addition to}} its well-known luteotropic function in early pregnancy, hCG also acts directly on decidualizing endometrium. Recently, we demonstrated that recombinant hCG (rhCG) prevented apoptosis in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) exposed to oxidative stress. Two hCG preparations are widely used clinically: rhCG, produced by recombinant DNA technology, and urinay hCG (uhCG), extracted from urine of post-menopausal women. However, an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct effects <b>of</b> rhCG and uhCG on <b>the</b> decidual phenotype <b>of</b> HESCs {{has not yet been}} done. In this study, we investigated <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> uhCG and rhCG on the morphological and functional profiles of decidualizing HESCs. We demonstrate that neither rhCG nor uhCG alter <b>the</b> morphological appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decidual HESC cultures, although rhCG but not uhCG attenuated prolactin expression, a major decidual marker protein. Moreover, rhCG, but not uhCG, protected decidualizing HESCs from oxidative cell death, mediated at least in part by two major mechanisms. First, rhCG, but not uhCG, enhances <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> manganese superoxide dismutase, a cardinal enzyme in the cellular defense against oxidative damage. Second, rhCG signaling selectively <b>limits</b> activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apoptotic <b>machinery</b> in decidualizing HESCs by enhancing Bcl- 2 expression whereas uhCG induces <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> Fas ligand.

40|$|Cryptosporidium parvum is {{recognized}} as an enteropathogen of great worldwide medical and veterinary importance, yet understanding of its pathogenesis has been hampered in part by <b>limited</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invasion <b>machinery</b> <b>of</b> this parasite. Recently, genes containing thrombospondin type 1 (TSP 1) domains {{have been identified in}} several genera of apicomplexans, including thrombospondin-related adhesive proteins (TRAPs) that have been implicated as key molecules for parasite motility and adhesion onto host cell surfaces. Previously, a large-scale random survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C. parvum genome conducted in our laboratory revealed <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> multiple genomic DNA sequences {{with a high degree of}} similarity to known apicomplexan TRAP genes. In the present study, TBLASTN screening of available C. parvum genomic sequences by using TSP 1 domains as queries identified a total of 12 genes possessing TSP 1 -like domains. All genes have putative signal peptide sequences, one or more TSP 1 -like domains, plus additional extracellular protein modules such as Kringle, epidermal growth factor, and Apple domains. Two genes, putative paralogs CpTSP 8 and CpTSP 9, contain predicted introns near their amino termini, which were verified by comparing PCR products from cDNA versus genomic DNA templates. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of transcript levels reveals that C. parvum TSP genes were developmentally regulated with distinct patterns of expression during in vitro infection. TRAPC 1, CpTSP 3, and CpTSP 11 were expressed at high levels during both early and late stages of infection, whereas CpTSP 2, CpTSP 5, CpTSP 6, CpTSP 8, and CpTSP 9 were maximally expressed during <b>the</b> late stages <b>of</b> infection.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{quantum confinement}} effects on silicon (Si) light source electroluminescence (EL) properties like quantum efficiency, external power efficiency and spectral emission, thin Si finger junctions with nanometre-scale dimensions were designed and manufactured in a fully customized silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor production technology. Since commonly available photolithography is unusable to consistently define and align nanometre-scale line-widths accurately and electron-beam lithography (EBL) {{by itself is}} too time-expensive to expose complete wafers, the wafer manufacturing process employed a selective combination of photolithography and EBL. The SOI wafers were manufactured in <b>the</b> clean-rooms <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Carl and Emily Fuchs Institute for Microelectronics (CEFIM) at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Pretoria (UP) and <b>the</b> Georgia Institute <b>of</b> Technology’s Microelectronic Research Centre (MiRC), which made a JEOL JBX- 9300 FS electron-beam pattern generator (EPG) available. As far as is known {{this was the first}} project in South Africa (and possibly at the MiRC) that employed EBL to define functional nanometre-scale semiconductor devices. Since no standard process recipe could be employed, the complete design and manufacturing process was based on self-obtained equipment characterization data and material properties. The manufacturing process was unprecedented in both the CEFIM and MiRC clean-rooms. <b>The</b> manufacture <b>of</b> nanometre-scale Si finger junctions not only approached <b>the</b> manufacturing <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employed processing <b>machinery,</b> but also had to overcome undesirable physical effects that in larger-scale semiconductor manufacture usually are negligible. The device design, mask layout and manufacturing process therefore had to incorporate various material, equipment limitation and physical phenomena like impurity redistribution occurring during the physical manufacturing process. Although the complicated manufacturing process allowed many unexpected problems to occur, it was expected that at least the simple junction breakdown devices be functional and capable of delivering data regarding quantum confinement effects. Although due to design and processing oversights only 29 out of 505 measured SOI light sources were useful light emitters, the design and manufacture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SOI light sources was successful in the sense that enough SOI light sources were available to conduct useful optical characterization measurements. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that the functional light sources did not achieve the desired horizontal (width) confinement, measured optical spectra of certain devices indicate that vertical (thickness) confinement had been achieved. All spectrometer-measured thickness-confined SOI light sources displayed a pronounced optical power for 600 nm < λ < 1 μm. The SOI light source with the highest optical power output emitted about 8 times more optical power around λ = 850 nm than a 0. 35 μm bulk-CMOS avalanche light-source operating at the same current. Possible explanations for this effect are given. It was shown that the buried oxide (BOX) layer in a SOI process could be used to reflect about 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light that would usually be lost to downward radiation back up, thereby increasing the external power efficiency of SOI light sources. This document elaborates on the technical objectives, approach, chip and process design, physical wafer manufacture, production process control and measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nanometre-scale SOI light sources.
