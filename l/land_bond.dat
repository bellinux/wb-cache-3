50|$|Producer Harry Alan Towers {{denied the}} films {{were made to}} cash in on the James Bond craze:No relationship. Action, adventure, open-air, escapism - yes - but nothing to do with Bond-ism - Fu Manchu's {{atmosphere}} is a kind of timeless Never Never <b>land.</b> <b>Bond</b> is gimmicky and with-it.The film was shot on location in Ireland. Towers:It's a good country for location work; the British quota helps; on costs, there is not much difference between making a film here and in Britain - both sets of unions see to that. Ardmore? It seems to be doing alright with the present film - and Ireland will always be attractive as long as filmmakers and their artists are seeking refuge from super tax.The prison sequences were shot at Kilmainham Gaol.|$|E

The plaintiff was against investing money into federal <b>land</b> <b>bonds</b> ($10,000 into bonds of the federal land banks and $10,000 into bonds of the joint-stock land banks) because he alleged that the Congress's undertaking to organize new banks, based on the Federal Farm Loan Act, was unconstitutional.

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a masking method generally and, more particularly to {{a method of}} masking perforated titanium sheets having laminar control suction strips. As illustrated in the drawings, a nonaerodynamic surface of a perforated sheet has alternating suction strip areas and <b>bonding</b> <b>land</b> areas. Suction strip tapes overlie the <b>bonding</b> <b>land</b> areas during application of a masking material to an upper surface of the suction strip tapes. Prior to bonding the perforated sheet to a composite structure, the <b>bonding</b> <b>land</b> tapes are removed. The entire opposite aerodynamic surface is masked with tape before bonding. This invention provides a precise control of suction strip porosities by ensuring that no chemicals penetrate the suction strip areas during bonding...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new database on Irish <b>land</b> <b>bonds</b> {{listed on the}} Dublin Stock Exchange from 1891 to 1938 : it outlines {{the nature of these}} bonds and presents data on their size, liquidity and market returns. These government-guaranteed bonds arose during a period when the possibility of Irish secession from the United Kingdom appeared ever more likely, and were used to finance the transfer of land ownership from landlords to tenants in Ireland (North & South). Movements in the prices of these bonds can help to understand how financial markets responded to events in the early economic and political history of the Irish Free State, including Irish partition, Independence, Civil War and de facto default. Understanding these issues has contemporary relevance for regions in Spain (Catalonia, Euskadi), Great Britain (Scotland) and Belgium (Flanders) ...|$|R
5000|$|Egan-Jones’ sub-investment grade {{sovereign}} ratings for Peru were {{primarily due to}} weak institutions. Egan-Jones cites the spotty track record of the government, specifically the ongoing default on the agrarian reform bonds. Their press release states, “The <b>Land</b> Reform <b>Bonds</b> were issued between 1969 and 1982 and remain unpaid. Through a recent administrative decree, Peru has made a unilateral offer to pay the <b>Land</b> Reform <b>Bonds</b> in an amount equal to less than 0.5% of the amount owed (i.e. a 99.5% haircut). In addition, Peru’s proposed process subordinates both holders of the bonds who are entities rather than individuals, and purchasers of the bonds on the secondary market. The process also requires bondholders to waive all rights to future legal remedies as a precondition to register their Land Reform Bonds.” ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} a specific area of local public finance, namely the non-rated land secured market in California as comprised primarily of the Community Facilities District (CFD) bonds. That market has become of growing importance but has not been widely studied until now. In this dissertation we analyze the performance and default experience of that market, examine its specific characteristics and determine the major factors contributing to the default of the non-rated CFD bonds. The results we present provide important new information for assessing the credit quality of the California non-rated <b>land</b> secured municipal <b>bond</b> market and should be beneficial for investors for the better understanding and analysis of that market.
