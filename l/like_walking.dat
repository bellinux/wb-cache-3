They appeared at village fêtes and town fairs across Cornwall and the Westward region, and soon the station started {{to build up a}} loyal following. Although Westward made few programmes for the ITV Network, it produced many regional programmes which covered topics specific to Cornwall, including The Farming Programme and Look Westward as well as features, <b>like</b> <b>walking</b> the South West Coast Path. By 1969, Westward had more than 100 correspondents across the region informing Westward of newsworthy local events and eight film cameramen who would travel the region gathering news.|$|E

25|$|Musculoskeletal imaging: PET {{has been}} shown to be a {{feasible}} technique for studying skeletal muscles during exercises <b>like</b> <b>walking.</b> One of the main advantages of using PET is that it can also provide muscle activation data about deeper lying muscles such as the vastus intermedialis and the gluteus minimus, as compared to other muscle studying techniques like electromyography, which can be used only on superficial muscles (i.e., directly under the skin). A clear disadvantage, however, is that PET provides no timing information about muscle activation because it has to be measured after the exercise is completed. This is due to the time it takes for FDG to accumulate in the activated muscles.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Carrington takes the Doctor {{to meet the}} astronauts a {{criminal}} named Reegan has organised their abduction, killing the soldiers and scientists guarding them. When the Doctor and Liz examine the site, they realise that human tissue could not have withstood the degree of radiation being emitted by the mysteriously irradiated astronauts. The Doctor believes the real astronauts are still in orbit, and that the three space suits contain alien beings. Reegan engineers the kidnapping of Liz Shaw to aid his own scientist, Lennox, a disgraced Cambridge professor, in keeping the alien astronauts alive. Reegan has even been supplied with a device {{to communicate with the}} aliens, and sends them to the Space Centre to kill Quinlan. It now becomes clear to UNIT that the aliens are emitting radiation <b>like</b> <b>walking</b> reactors, and that to touch them brings instant death. It is also evident, to Liz, that Reegan is taking orders from someone else. She helps Lennox escape, and he tries to reach the Brigadier, but his bid for freedom is cut short by Reegan’s merciless revenge.|$|E

(MGM) in 1949; she later remarked, [...] "Joining Metro was <b>like</b> <b>walking</b> into a dream world." [...] Her combination of attractive appearance—centered on her large eyes—and somewhat distant and understated manner made her hard at first for MGM to cast and publicize. Davis appeared in eleven feature films, usually typecast as a [...] "loyal housewife", [...] "responsible young mother", or [...] "the steady woman". Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, Leslie Caron, and Janet Leigh were among the actresses with whom she competed for roles at MGM.|$|E

He said there were times when he felt <b>like</b> <b>walking</b> out. He found a valuable ally in Eric Sawyer, of the Littlewoods pools organisation, who joined the board not long after Shankly's appointment and shared Shankly's vision of Liverpool as the best club in England. At one board meeting in 1961 when Shankly insisted the club make offers for two players in Scotland, the board's initial response was that [...] "we can't afford them" [...] but Sawyer stepped in and said: [...] "We can't afford not to buy them".|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{begins this}} track with a spoken intro where he {{describes}} the origins of folk songs in a satirical vein: [...] "most of the songs that are written uptown in Tin Pan Alley, that's {{where most of the}} folk songs come from nowadays". What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as [...] "a really off-the-cuff-song. I start with an idea and then I feel what follows. Best way I can describe this one is that it's sort of <b>like</b> <b>walking</b> by a side street. You gaze in and walk on." [...] Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, absurdist humor into more complex songs, such as [...] "I Shall Be Free No.10" [...] (1964).|$|E

500|$|Farmer {{recorded}} {{only twice}} with Horace Silver's group, as Silver recorded for Blue Note Records, while Farmer was signed to Prestige. Feuds between the label bosses ruled out extensive cross-label collaboration. The transition from Silver's piano-led quintet to Mulligan's piano-less quartet was not straightforward: [...] "to suddenly {{find yourself in}} a pianoless group was <b>like</b> <b>walking</b> down the street naked", commented Farmer. As a member of Mulligan's band, Farmer appeared on film twice – in I Want to Live! (1958) and The Subterraneans (1960) – and again toured Europe, {{as part of a}} Jazz at the Philharmonic tour, helping him to develop an international reputation. In New York, Farmer worked with Lester Young, who told him to [...] "tighten up and tell a 'story' in each solo". At this time, Farmer also rented his trumpet on a nightly basis to Miles Davis, who had pawned his own due to his drug dependency.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{considered}} a successful adaptation of licensed material to a video game, with critics describing {{it as one of}} the most faithful video game adaptations ever, such that moving the player-character was <b>like</b> <b>walking</b> on the set of the show. GamesRadar said that The Stick of Truth was to South Park as [...] was to the Batman franchise in terms of reverence to the source material while breaking new ground in video games. They praised the [...] "open-world South Park to explore, with a solid 12–14 hours of inside jokes, obscure references, and humor that pulls from 17 TV seasons' worth of social commentary and offensive humor." [...] Computer and Video Games said that the game contained so many references to the show's history that it made [...] appear sparse. Destructoid said that the ability to walk around the detailed town provided a sense of wonderment similar to exploring The Simpsons home town in [...] The visual translation was highlighted as a significant component of the game's success, appearing indistinguishable from an episode of the show and providing a consistent aesthetic that remained faithful to the series while being original to gaming. Some reviewers said that the art style was occasionally detrimental, obscuring objects and prompts, and that repetitive use of animations grew stale over the course of the game. Computer and Video Games said that Obsidian had built a game world that seemed as though it had always existed.|$|E

Diamondbacks outfielder Luis Gonzalez said of Howell, [...] "We didn't have much of {{anything}} on him going in. It was <b>like</b> <b>walking</b> down a dark alley." [...] He made a total of 15 starts for the Royals in 2005 and was 3-5 with a 6.19 ERA.

[...] Similarly, economist Edward Glaeser, author of Triumph of the City (2011), wrote that [...] "Manhattan's grid imposes clarity on the island's burbling chaos and enables ordinary pedestrians to negotiate New York's complex ecosystem. [...] While many city plans are more beautiful in the abstract, none has dome more to facilitate the magnificent energy of the flowing human city. [...] The grid makes manageable the messy humanity of millions. ... It may not be every urban planner's beau ideal, but as a machine for urban living, the grid is pretty perfect." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} {{was built by}} Cecil B. DeMille in 1928.

[...] Others claim that DeMille intended it {{as a gift for}} his daughter Frances. [...] Whichever version is correct, DeMille was responsible for a building that {{became one of the most}} fashionable addresses in Hollywood. [...] The building's notable features include its Spanish-style courtyard and fountain, hand-made tiles, large fireplaces, and high-beamed ceilings. [...] According to The New York Times, DeMille used set craftsmen to construct [...] "the phantasmagorial sense of architectural detail at El Cabrillo, which includes a central outdoor Moorish fountain, timbered ceilings, Catalina tile work, swashbuckling wrought-iron hardware and scaled-down versions of Citizen Kane-like carved concrete fireplaces in each apartment."

Munch also produced multi-colored versions of [...] "The Sick Child", concerning tuberculosis, which sold well, {{as well as several}} nudes and multiple versions of Kiss (1892). Many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch's work [...] "violent and brutal" [...] but his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance. His financial situation improved considerably and in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman's cabin built in the late 18th century, {{in the small town of}} Åsgårdstrand in Norway. He dubbed this home the [...] "Happy House" [...] and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years. It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted.
