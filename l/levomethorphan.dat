25|$|Dextromethorphan (the {{stereoisomer}} of <b>levomethorphan,</b> a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its metabolite dextrorphan have no {{opioid analgesic}} effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent NMDA antagonists and sigma 1 and 2-receptor agonists {{and are used}} in many over-the-counter cough suppressants.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan is the {{dextrorotatory}} enantiomer of <b>levomethorphan,</b> {{which is}} the methyl ether of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid. Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20°C, Sodium D-line).|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan was {{excluded}} from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 and was specifically {{excluded from the}} Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As of 2010, Dextromethorphan was still excluded from U.S. scheduling of controlled substances; however, officials have warned that it could still be added if increased abuse warrants its scheduling. The motivation behind its exclusion from the CSA was that, under the CSA, all optical isomers of listed Schedule II opiates are automatically Schedule II substances. Since dextromethorphan is an optical isomer of the Schedule II opiate <b>levomethorphan</b> (but does not act like an opiate), an exemption was necessary {{to keep it a}} non-controlled substance. The Federal Analog Act does not apply to dextromethorphan because a new drug application has been filed for it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levomethorphan</b> is a prodrug to levorphanol, analogously to DXM {{acting as}} a prodrug to {{dextrorphan}} or codeine behaving as a prodrug to morphine. As such, <b>levomethorphan</b> has similar effects to levorphanol but is less potent as it must be demethylated to the active form by liver enzymes before being able to produce its effects. As a prodrug of levorphanol, <b>levomethorphan</b> functions as a potent agonist of {{all three of the}} opioid receptors, μ, κ (κ1 and κ3 but notably not κ2), and δ, as an NMDA receptor antagonist, and as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Via activation of the KOR, <b>levomethorphan</b> can produce dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects such as dissociation and hallucinations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Levomethorphan</b> {{is listed}} under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and is {{regulated}} like morphine in most countries. In the United States it is a Schedule II Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9210 and 2014 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 195 grammes, up from 6 grammes the year before.

5000|$|<b>Levomethorphan</b> (INN, BAN) is an opioid {{analgesic}} of the morphinan {{family that has}} never been marketed. It is the L-stereoisomer of racemethorphan (methorphan). The effects of the two isomers of the racemethorphan are quite different, with dextromethorphan (DXM) contrarily being an antitussive at low doses and a dissociative hallucinogen at much higher doses. It is about five times stronger than morphine.|$|E
5000|$|Chemically, {{levorphanol}} {{belongs to}} the morphinan class and is (−)-3-hydroxy-N-methyl-morphinan.It is the [...] "left-handed" [...] (levorotatory) stereoisomer of racemorphan, that is the racemic mixture of the two stereoisomers with differing pharmacology. The [...] "right-handed" [...] (dextrorotatory) enantiomer of racemorphan is dextrorphan (DXO), an antitussive, potent dissociative hallucinogen (NMDA receptor antagonist), and weakly active opioid. DXO is an active metabolite of the pharmaceutical drug dextromethorphan (DXM), which, analogously to DXO, is an enantiomer of the racemic mixture racemethorphan along with <b>levomethorphan,</b> the latter of which has similar properties to those of levorphanol.|$|E

De. xtrorphan tartrate, 4 which, like levorphan and racemorphan, was synthesized by Schnider and associates (1949, 1950), has also received the at-tention of Fromherz (1951), Pellmont (1951), Isbell and Fraser (1951), Benson et al. (1952) and Slomka and Gross (1952). More recently, the corresponding methyl ethers, <b>levomethorphan</b> hydro-bromide, 5 racemethorphan hydrobromide 6 and dextromethorphan hydrobromide 7 were prepared by Schnider and GrUssner (1951). These have been pharma-cologically investigated in animals by Fromherz, Peilmont and B#{ 228 }chtold (1950 - 1953) and by Benson et al. (1952). Slomka and Gross (1951) reported upon the analgesic activity of racemethorphan administered orally to man and Isbell and Fraser (1951) have discussed the addiction liability of this agent. These latter workers (1952) similarly reported upon the addiction liability of <b>levomethorphan</b> {{and the absence of}} addiction liability of dextromethorphan.
