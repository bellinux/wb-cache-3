Astonishingly, there are both Greek and Oriental types present at the site, juxtaposing Parthian history in almost all eras in one spot. There is only another find <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> Susa, where similar discoveries were made.|$|E

25|$|This facade {{can be seen}} as the {{foundation}} for many other buildings, including both French and English Gothic churches. While the form is typical of northern France, its various components were common to many Romanesque churches of the period across Europe. Similar facades are found in Portugal. In England, Southwell Cathedral has maintained this form, despite the insertion of a huge Gothic window between the towers. Lincoln and Durham must once have looked <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> Germany, Limburg Cathedral has a rich variety of openings and arcades in horizontal storeys of varying heights.|$|E
25|$|Some people, {{including}} former Pope Benedict, find Centering Prayer controversial. These authors argue that Centering Prayer contradicts {{the teachings of}} the Carmelite saints. They also argue that Centering Prayer is a distortion of {{the teachings of the}} Desert Fathers and The Cloud of Unknowing, and nearly the opposite in method to Lectio Divina. Furthermore, they claim that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) cautioned against prayer forms <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation.|$|E
25|$|In these lectures, Newman denounced various anti-Catholic utterances. These {{included}} {{those of}} the Maria Monk, the allegation of cells under his own Oratory on Hagley Road, Birmingham and those of Giacinto Achilli. Newman emphasises the importance of responding to Achilli: For how, Brothers of the Oratory, can we possibly believe a man <b>like</b> <b>this</b> , <b>in</b> what he says about persons and facts, and conversations, and events, when he is of the stamp of Maria Monk, of Jeffreys, and of Teodore, and of others who have had their hour, and then been dropped by the indignation or the shame of mankind.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} modes of play within ChuChu Rocket! {{including}} a single-player puzzle mode, a puzzle editing mode, a cooperative challenge mode, and competitive multiplayer modes. In the puzzle mode, the player is provided a limited set of arrows to {{place on the}} field to save all the ChuChus in play. The puzzle editing mode allows players {{to create their own}} puzzles <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> the challenge mode, players are given 30 seconds to save the ChuChus in play without any arrow limitations as in puzzle mode. In the competition modes, each player has a rocket and must guide as many ChuChus as possible into their rocket in the time limit. This mode supports up to four players, either in free-for-all or team-based fashion.|$|E
25|$|Toronto looked sure {{to suffer}} a similar fate in 1942, down three games to none in a best-of-seven final in 1942 against Detroit. However, fourth-line forward Don Metz would {{galvanize}} the team, coming from nowhere to score a hat-trick in game four and the game-winning goal in game five, with the Leafs winning both times. Captain Syl Apps had won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season, not taking one penalty and finishing his ten-season career {{with an average of}} 5 minutes, 36 seconds in penalties a season. Goalie Turk Broda would shut out the Wings in game six, and Sweeney Schriner would score two goals in the third period to win the seventh game 3–1 and the stanley cup. No other team has repeated a comeback <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> a stanley cup final since.|$|E
25|$|One {{must not}} mistake the Mozartian {{dramatic}} coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and {{are most often}} sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with a voice that can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> his early years.|$|E

25|$|Pope John Paul II Park Reservation: The Pope John Park Reservation is {{approximately}} 66 acres in size, {{and is also}} open year-round for the residents of Dorchester. In its earlier times it {{was used as a}} landfill and also a drive-in theatre. It also serves as a barricade between the Town of Dorchester, Boston and Neponset River waterfront. This park now gives residents various resources such as; Picnic facilities, soccer fields, play areas, paths for walking, and also spacious land to plant trees and shrubs. Unfortunately, it was not always <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> May 2015, According to James W. Dolan, Pope John Paul Park Reservation was not the same as it used to be. The State Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is responsible for the park, is not really doing its job. The plants are either dead or overgrown. There are no gardens or trees that would catch anyone's eye and also no picnic tables or grills where families could gather around and do a cookout. Dolan states that he wants to see people of the community planting vegetables and tending flower beds in the park, paddling canoes in the river, and also a grove of trees so people could sit in the shade and look out at the river.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{acclaimed}} Depp and Rush's performances, with [...] "It can be {{said that}} [...] performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> any other movie... his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal." [...] However, he felt the film went for too long, a criticism shared by Kenneth Turan's negative review, feeling it [...] "spends far too much time on its huge supporting cast of pirates (nowhere near as entertaining as everyone assumes) and on bloated adventure set pieces," [...] despite having also enjoyed Depp's performance.|$|E
500|$|Indian firm Prasad EFX {{assigned}} {{a team of}} more than 100 VFX specialists to work with Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma to create the visual effects for the film. Included were sophisticated 3D modelling and computer animation, including whole body scans, 3D replicas of vehicles, fire sequences, complicated wire removals and compositing work. They prepared over 1,200 VFX shots, accounting for approximately 90 minutes of screen time. Describing the effects, Rakesh Roshan stated, [...] "If you liked the visual effects in Koi...

500|$|Atlanta's climate {{was cited}} as a {{potential}} issue that would hinder production. Darabont recalled that he {{found it difficult to}} adjust to the sweltering heat, adding that he [...] "never had clothes stick to me <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> my life". Lincoln retorted that it was [...] "becoming a running joke that people arrive on set ready for the day and then they are battered and beaten up by the weather." [...] Despite such assertions, he opined that it added to the episode's overall emotion. [...] "There's a lot of hard-earned sweat on camera. It's not comfortable and it's not pleasant, but it's as you would imagine it would be trying to survive in this world." ...|$|E
500|$|Depp's {{performance}} won acclaim from film critics. Alan Morrison {{found it}} [...] "Gloriously over-the-top... In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it's a master-class in comedy acting." [...] Roger Ebert praised Depp for drawing {{away from the}} character as written and found Depp's performance [...] "original in its every atom. There {{has never been a}} pirate, or for that matter a human being, <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> any other movie... his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal". Depp won a Screen Actor's Guild award for his performance, and was nominated for a Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Actor, the first in his career. Film School Rejects argued the film made Depp as much a movie star as he was a character actor.|$|E
500|$|Director Rian Johnson {{praised the}} film, as did Japanese game {{director}} Hideo Kojima, who {{called it the}} [...] "ultimate otaku film" [...] and stated he [...] "never imagined [...] would be fortunate enough to see a film <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> [...] life". Go Nagai, who pioneered the idea of mecha piloted from an interior cockpit, praised the film's fun and intense action, while game developer Fumito Ueda said its battle scenes surpassed memories of the tokusatsu films he saw as an impressionable child. Science fiction author William Gibson called the film [...] "A ravishing display of intelligent, often wonderfully witty visual design, every frame alive with coherent language, {{in the service of}} what is at heart a children's story… A baroque that doesn't curdle, that never fetishizes itself." ...|$|E
