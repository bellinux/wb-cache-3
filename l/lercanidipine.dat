50|$|<b>Lercanidipine</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of essential hypertension (high blood pressure).|$|E
50|$|Blood plasma {{concentrations}} of <b>lercanidipine</b> {{can be detected}} by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{substance}} is metabolised by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. In a study, the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased the maximal blood plasma concentrations of <b>lercanidipine</b> {{by a factor}} of eight, and the area under the curve {{by a factor of}} 15. In another study, ciclosporin increased <b>lercanidipine</b> plasma levels threefold when given at the same time. Other inhibitors of this enzyme, such as itraconazole, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice, are also expected to increase plasma concentrations and thus amplify the antihypertensive effect. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors such as carbamazepine, rifampicin, and St John's wort probably lower plasma levels and effectiveness of <b>lercanidipine.</b> By comparison, amlodipine has a lower potential for CYP3A4 mediated interactions.|$|E
50|$|The drug acts {{more slowly}} than older dihydropyridines. It {{probably}} has fewer adverse effects, but a comparatively high potential for drug interactions. <b>Lercanidipine</b> was first marketed in 1997.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lercanidipine</b> {{molecule}} has got one asymmetric carbon atom. While the S-enantiomer is {{more effective}} than the R-enantiomer, marketed formulations contain a 1:1 mixture of both (i.e., the racemate).|$|E
50|$|<b>Lercanidipine</b> (trade name Zanidip, among others) is an {{antihypertensive}} (blood pressure lowering) drug. It {{belongs to}} the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which work by relaxing and opening the blood vessels allowing the blood to circulate more freely around the body. This lowers the blood pressure and allows the heart to work more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lercanidipine</b> is {{generally}} well tolerated; no single adverse effect {{has been observed}} in more than 1% of patients treated with this drug. Typical side effects {{are similar to those}} of other drugs of this class and include headache, dizziness, tachycardia (fast heartbeat), palpitations, flush, and oedema. Hypersensitivity reactions occur in less than one patient in 10,000.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{dihydropyridine}} class calcium channel blockers, <b>lercanidipine</b> blocks L-type calcium channels in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, relaxing them and thus lowering blood pressure. In {{contrast to the}} non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem, it does not significantly act on calcium channels in the atrioventricular node, and therefore does not decrease heart rate, in usual therapeutic doses.|$|E
50|$|Like other dihydropyridines, <b>lercanidipine</b> is {{contraindicated}} unstable in angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac failure, {{shortly after}} a myocardial infarction, and {{in patients with}} left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. It is also contraindicated during pregnancy and in women who may become pregnant, because data regarding safety for the unborn are lacking, {{as well as in}} patients with severe liver and renal impairment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lercanidipine</b> {{is slowly}} but {{completely}} absorbed from the gut. It has a total bioavailability of 10% {{due to an}} extensive first-pass effect, or up to 40% if taken after a fatty meal. Highest blood plasma levels are reached after 1.5 to 3 hours. The substance is quickly distributed into the tissues and bound to lipid membranes, where it forms a depot. The circulating fraction is almost completely (>98%) bound to plasma proteins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lercanidipine</b> {{is used in}} form of the hydrochloride, {{which is}} a {{slightly}} yellow crystalline powder and melts at 197 to 201 C in crystal form I or 207 to 211 C in crystal form II. It is readily soluble in chloroform and methanol, but practically insoluble in water. This high lipophilicity (compared to older dihydropyridines) is intentional because it causes the substance to bind to lipid membranes, allowing for a longer duration of action.|$|E
50|$|Overdosing {{of up to}} 80 {{times the}} usual {{therapeutic}} dose has been described. Expected symptoms include severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and reflex tachycardia. Bradycardia (slow heartbeat) can also occur due to blockage of calcium channels in the atrioventricular node of the heart. There is no treatment besides monitoring blood pressure and heart function. Dialysis is likely ineffective {{because most of the}} <b>lercanidipine</b> is bound to blood plasma proteins and lipid membranes of cells.|$|E

40|$|Two accurate, precise, {{sensitive}} and economical spectrophotometric methods were developed and validated for simultaneous estimation of <b>Lercanidipine</b> hydrochloride and Atenolol in tablet dosage form.

The first method employs 261 nm as λ 1 (Isobestic point) and 273 nm as λ 2 (λmax of Atenolol) for formation of equations. The second method employs estimation of a drug concentration by selecting λmax where the absorbances of these drugs were maximum. So λmax for <b>Lercanidipine</b> hydrochloride and Atenolol is 242 nm and 273 nm respectively. <b>Lercanidipine</b> hydrochloride and Atenolol obey Beer’s law in the concentration range 10 - 50 μg mL- 1 (r 2 = 0. 9999) and 50 - 250 μg mL- 1 (r 2 = 0. 9999) in 0. 1 N HCL.
