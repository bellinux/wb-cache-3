This contribution contains the version of M. 3108. 2 that will be submitted for approval. It incorporates comments from the Q 15 / 4 experts meeting in Darmstadt, 8 - 16 to 8 - 20, 1999. The following paragraphs provide {{a brief description of the}} context for and the content of M. 3108. 2. Recommendation M. 3208. 1 specifies functions that support customer management of <b>leased</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>services.</b> Recommendation M. 3208. 2 applies these management functions to the case in which service customers manage pre-provisioned resources. In M. 3208. 2, the service creation process from the submission of the customer request to create a service until the service is available for use only involves connecting existing, pre-provisioned resources. The connection of the pre-provisioned resources is normally completed within a very short time interval, i [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|BTC has a {{telecommunications}} infrastructure {{that is one}} of the most modern in Africa. Its network, composed of an all-digital microwave and fibre optic system with digital exchanges at the main centres, provides a high quality service. The current network comprises 7 300 kilometers of microwave radio and fibre optic links between 12 main processors, each serving a specific area of the country. The switching units have a capacity of about 117 000 lines. Current services provided include national and international telephony, managed and data networks, very small aperture terminal (VSAT), private wires, <b>leased</b> <b>circuits,</b> toll free <b>services,</b> Internet, paging, public telephones, voice messaging, telex, packet switching, telegraph and customer premises.

40|$|Fibre Channel (FC) based Storage Area Networks (SANs) {{have gained}} great success in local data centers (accounting {{for more than}} 90 % of all SAN {{installations}} world wide). However, recent developments in e-commerce applications make it necessary to extend SANs across wide area. There are two approaches currently available, one is through IP networks called Storage over IP (SoIP), the other is through <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> (SONET/SDH circuits or WDM lightpaths). The former is low-cost and low-performance while the latter is high-performance and high-cost. We propose an approach between these two, {{which is based on}} dynamic SONET circuits. We introduce a novel <b>circuit</b> <b>service</b> called CHEETAH, and discuss how to apply the CHEETAH concept to extend Class 2 and Class 3 FC services across wide area...|$|R

40|$|Data {{delivery}} in the Deep Space Network (DSN) involves transmission {{of a small}} amount of constant, high-priority traffic and a large amount of bursty, low priority data. The bursty traffic may be initially buffered and then metered back slowly as bandwidth becomes available. Today both types of data are transmitted over dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>circuits.</b> The authors investigated the potential of saving money by designing a hybrid communications architecture that uses <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> for high-priority network communications and dial-up circuits for low-priority traffic. Such an architecture may significantly reduce costs and provide an emergency backup. The architecture presented here may also be applied to any ground station-to-customer network within the range of a common carrier. The authors compare estimated costs for various scenarios and suggest security safeguards that should be considered...|$|R

By 1995, NASCOM was the largest of five wide-area networks operated by NASA, with 900 <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> and a budget of $63 million. It employed 21 civil servants and 210 contracted personnel under two contracts. Soon after, NASA undertook an effort to consolidate these networks, in order to realize cost savings. In its FY1995 Nascom System Development Plan, the NASA Communications Division underwent reorganization, with contractors taking over operations and maintenance roles previously performed by civil servants. The plan expressed the need to convert to standardized network systems.|$|R

Three cable ships-CS Mercury, CS Retriever, and HMTS Monarch-did the job.

50|$|As pair gain {{electronics}} and point-to-point microwave radio links came into widespread use throughout the public switched telephone network, telephone companies filed tariffs to eliminate their past responsibility of providing <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> with direct current continuity. If {{the base station}} were located across town in an area served by a different telephone exchange, the only available circuits reaching the distant exchange might be a single voice-grade channel in a D-4 channel bank on a DS-1 or a single microwave radio baseband channel. Tone remotes became necessary with the wide use of telephone carrier or multiplexing equipment. They require only a voice-grade audio path with roughly flat equalization from 300-3,000 Hz. A circuit that could pass audio in both directions {{could be used for}} remote control.|$|R

Ten {{years have passed}} since the first liberalization opened up the public networks for data communication. The newly revised Law paves the way for more liberal use of <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> and networks from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (NTT). Further, it permits activities of specialized telecommunications service agencies to compete with the government-owned and monopolized NTT in the domestic data communication market. Industrial and financial circles have demanded both, as they would like to spread their computer communication networks more extensively, and offer some specialized telecommunication services within their own community. The historical and social background to this remarkable liberalization were discussed in a recent article in Telecommunications Policy. ...|$|R
