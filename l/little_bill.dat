His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel (1863), starring Lydia Thompson in the title role, which found audiences {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For Ixion this brought him a total of around £3,000. Other notable early works included an opéra bouffe, Windsor Castle (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including Helen, or, Taken from the Greek, and Guy Fawkes, or The Ugly Mug and the Couple of Spoons, both in 1866. Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the <b>Little</b> <b>Bill</b> that Was Taken Up, parodying the three-act melodrama by Douglas Jerrold, Black-Eyed Susan; the show ran for 400 nights at the Royalty Theatre, was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.|$|E
500|$|Having {{portrayed the}} {{character}} for eight years, Rashad remains {{best known for}} her role as Clair; the actress established herself as a both household name and television icon during the 1980s for portraying [...] "the working mom who had it all". In 1993, Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun wrote that Rashad and her character [...] "appear to be inextricably entwined: Just as no one remembers Clair, the super-woman of The Cosby Show without thinking of the actress who played her, few think of Ms. Rashad without flashing on Clair". At the 42nd NAACP Image Awards in 2010, the organization dubbed Rashad [...] "mother" [...] of the African-American community. Rashad and Cosby's professional relationship continued beyond The Cosby Show. After The Cosby Shows conclusion, Rashad would similarly portray Cosby's wife, Ruth Lucas, on his sitcom Cosby for four years. Cosby would again recruit Rashad to voice <b>Little</b> <b>Bill</b> Glover's mother, Brenda Glover, in Cosby's animated series <b>Little</b> <b>Bill.</b> In 2016, Esquire included Rashad on their list of [...] "75 Greatest Women of All Time" [...] for portraying [...] "the perfect mother".|$|E

In 1999, Cosby's 25th year as spokesman for Jell-O, was also the final year he appeared in its advertising. The company distributed 120,000 copies of his picture book series, <b>Little</b> <b>Bill,</b> into American public libraries. [...] Despite the transitions of advertising agencies and the 1989 merger of General Foods into Kraft, Cosby remained with Jell-O. [...] He appeared at the Utah State Senate in 2001 to designate Jell-O the official state snack, and made a promotional visit to the Jell-O Gallery in 2004. In 2010, Cosby returned to Jell-O as executive producer for the company's [...] "Hello Jell-O" [...] campaign. In return, the brand sponsored his weekly web show OBKB, a children's interview series similar to Kids Say the Darndest Things. As of 2002, Cosby's time with Jell-O was considered the longest-standing celebrity endorsement in American advertising history.|$|E

From his schooldays he had written comic plays, and from 1860 {{until the end of}} the 19th century, he produced a series of more than 200 Victorian burlesques, farces, pantomimes and other stage works. His early successes included the burlesques Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel (1863) and The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the <b>Little</b> <b>Bill</b> that Was Taken Up (1866). [...] Also in 1866, he adapted the popular farce Box and Cox as a comic opera, Cox and Box, with music by Sullivan. The piece became a popular favourite and was later frequently used by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a curtain raiser; it remains regularly performed today.|$|E

2500|$|The Pinkerton agents {{attempted}} to disembark, and shots were fired. Conflicting testimony exists {{as to which}} side fired the first shot. John T.

[...] I am willing to take an oath that the workmen fired first, and that the Pinkerton men did not shoot until some of their number had been wounded." [...] But according to The New York Times, the Pinkertons shot first. The newspaper reported that the Pinkertons opened fire and wounded William Foy, a worker. Regardless of which side opened fire first, the first two individuals wounded were Frederick Heinde, captain of the Pinkertons, and Foy. The Pinkerton agents aboard the barges then fired into the crowd, killing two and wounding 11. The crowd responded in kind, killing two and wounding 12. The firefight continued for about 10 minutes.|$|E
