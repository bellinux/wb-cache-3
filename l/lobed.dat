5|$|Grebes {{are small}} to medium-large {{freshwater}} diving birds. They have <b>lobed</b> toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, {{they have their}} feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.|$|E
5|$|The ovary is {{inferior}} (below {{the floral}} parts) and trilocular (three chambered) {{and there is}} a pistil with a minutely three <b>lobed</b> stigma and filiform (thread like) style, which is often exserted (extending beyond the tube).|$|E
5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are toothed and less deeply <b>lobed</b> or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the rachis, the upper pinnae lack stems, and the overall shape of the leaf blade is parallel-sided, rather than lance-shaped. A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (although their ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped leaf blade, more deeply cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are <b>lobed),</b> and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E
5|$|Grebes {{are small}} to medium-large diving birds that breed on fresh water. They have <b>lobed</b> toes and are {{excellent}} swimmers and divers. However, {{they have their}} feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.|$|E

However, {{they have their}} feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. Five species have been recorded in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Grebes {{are small}} to medium-large diving birds with <b>lobed</b> toes and pointed bills. They are seen mainly on lowland waterbodies and coasts. They feed on aquatic animals and nest on a {{floating}} platform of vegetation. There are about 19 species worldwide with five in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|The hindwing is {{frequently}} caudate, i.e. the veins {{near the end}} of the tornus have one or more tails. The tornus itself being often produced and frequently <b>lobed.</b> Along the hindwing termen there are tightly-packed scales in a double row. The underside of the scales project and form a regular narrow fringe referred to as cilia.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the section}} Mycena, M.multiplicata {{is similar to}} the Malaysian species M.obcalyx in having a grayish-white cap, <b>lobed</b> cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and a lignicolous habitat. M.obcalyx may be {{distinguished}} by forming much smaller fruit bodies (with caps 2–4mm wide) with subdecurrent gills, a pruinose, hyaline white stem, and broadly ellipsoid spores.|$|E
5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were most probably used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A pair of short <b>lobed</b> structures (possible antennules) are also present, their position corresponding {{to the location of}} the second pair of antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum is {{classified}} in the family Bankeraceae, which was circumscribed by Marinus Anton Donk in 1961. The genus was not in Donk's original family concept, which included only Bankera and Phellodon, genera whose species produce hyaline (translucent), and ornamented spores. Donk left Hydnellum in the tribe Hydnelleae of the family Thelephoraceae, along with Sarcodon and Hydnodon. In 1981, however, Walter Jülich emended Donk's concept of the Bankeraceae, adding hydnoid genera that produced brown, <b>lobed</b> spores—Hydnellum and Sarcodon.|$|E
5|$|The towers are semi-circular. Their inner flanks have <b>lobed</b> arches as decorations, a North African motif {{introduced}} to Egypt by the Fatimids. The vestibule {{to the right}} contains a half-domed recess with elegantly carved arches at each corner. The gates were massive, weighing four tons. The gates today have two minarets, open to visitors, from which the area may be viewed. Additions were made during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Two plants {{found near}} Twilight Cove are {{regarded}} as hybrids between A.cuneatus and A.forrestii, the only two Adenanthos species {{to occur in the}} area. One was discovered by Nelson in 1972, the other by Alex George in 1974. They are about 5km apart, and differ somewhat. The leaves are triangular and flat like those of A.cuneatus, but the leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow, and the leaves of younger shoots are deeply <b>lobed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gynoecium : Superior ovary (hypogynous), syncarpous (with fused carpels), {{with three}} connate (fused) carpels and is trilocular (three locules, or chambers) or unilocular (single locule, as in Scoliopus and Medeola). There {{is a single}} style and a three <b>lobed</b> stigma or three stigmata more or less {{elongated}} along the style. There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The embryo sac (megagametophyte) varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. Fritillaria). Embryo sacs in which {{three of the four}} megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus, are referred to as Fritillaria-type, a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales.|$|E
5|$|In mass, {{the spores}} are whitish. The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, devoid of oil {{droplets}} (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13–18 by 7–9µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. The asci are 190–225 by 9–10µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown granules, with tips up to 5µm wide, and are not forked or <b>lobed.</b> The hypothecium, the layer of cells below the hymenium, is made of densely packed, small irregular cells.|$|E
5|$|Mercury (0.4AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the closest}} planet to the Sun and the {{smallest}} planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses). Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are <b>lobed</b> ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle {{have not yet been}} adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.|$|E
5|$|Monocytes {{develop in}} the bone marrow and reach {{maturity}} in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, <b>lobed</b> nuclei and abundant cytoplasm that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present antigens to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to tissues and organs {{and in doing so}} transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive. There are about 500 million monocytes in one litre of human blood.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum, {{commonly}} known as the Queensland tree waratah or red silky oak, is a medium-sized tree of the family Proteaceae found in the Queensland tropical rain forests of northeastern Australia. It has shiny green elliptical leaves up to 18cm (7.2in) long, and prominent orange-red inflorescences that appear from August to October, followed by rectangular woody seed pods that ripen in February and March. Juvenile plants have large (up to 25cm (10in) long) deeply <b>lobed</b> pinnate leaves. Previously known as Oreocallis wickhamii, the initial specimen {{turned out to be a}} different species to the one cultivated and hence a new scientific name was required. Described formally by Peter Weston and Mike Crisp in 1991, A. flammeum was designated the type species of the genus Alloxylon. This genus contains the four species previously classified in Oreocallis that are found in Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Individual archaea {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (μm) to over 15μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped <b>lobed</b> cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments {{that are less}} than half a micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E
5|$|As a builder, Hugh {{built the}} New Bridge, now Elvet Bridge, in Durham, the second stone {{bridge in the}} town. Hugh also oversaw work on Durham Cathedral, decorating the inside with marble, {{installing}} stained glass windows, putting in a shrine for the bones of Bede, and building the Galilee Chapel on {{the west end of}} the cathedral. Originally, Puiset had planned to put in a Lady Chapel {{on the east side of}} the cathedral, but the ground was unsuitable, and instead work began on the Galilee Chapel on the west side of the cathedral. The Galilee Chapel is unusual in that it has five aisles, and quatrefoil, or four <b>lobed,</b> piers. A model for the chapel may have been the work being done on York Minster in rebuilding the choir. The current Norman doorway and the gallery that is above the doorway in Durham Castle were also the work of Hugh, which was part of a hall built in the bailey of the castle. Along with the king of Scots, he built the first bridge over the River Tweed at Berwick. He also rebuilt Norham Castle, replacing the previous buildings built by Ranulf Flambard, an earlier bishop, with a stone castle.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} leaf blade, the pinnae are more shallowly <b>lobed</b> and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the leaf blade, the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly lance-shaped, and the fronds are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On close examination, its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Dál Riata {{has been seen}} as a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots {{settlers}} in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements. This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the 7th century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the Hunterston brooch, found in Ayrshire, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed. In the 8th and 9th centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular brooches with <b>lobed</b> terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish pseudo-penannular brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The 8th century Monymusk Reliquary has elements of Pictish and Irish style.|$|E

25|$|Asplenium pinnatifidum {{is a small}} fern {{with bright}} green, wrinkled, pinnatifid (<b>lobed)</b> fronds. These form evergreen, {{perennial}} tufts. Notable characteristics are the shiny stem, dark only at the base, and the long-tapering, variably <b>lobed</b> leaf blades. The fronds are monomorphic, the sterile and fertile fronds appearing {{the same size and}} shape.|$|E
25|$|The third {{subgroup}} {{is formed}} by the four species with a bifurcated stipe: Bifrenaria atropurpurea, {{the only one with}} a cuneated viscidium; B. tyrianthina, the only to have rounded viscidium; B. inodora with greenish flowers and two <b>lobed</b> callus; and B. harrisoniae, highly variable species of several colors, that always has three <b>lobed</b> callus on the labellum. The species of this group are often or exclusively lithophytes.|$|E
25|$|Its thick, ridged bark is {{characteristic}} and resembles alligator hide. The valley oak's deeply <b>lobed</b> leaves assist in identification.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lobed</b> stingaree {{is often}} caught {{incidentally}} by scallop and prawn trawlers operating off Perth and Mandurah {{in the northern}} part of its range. It usually survives to be released alive, though stingarees have a tendency to abort their young upon capture. As the number of vessels that catch this species is small, and it faces no other significant conservation threats within its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the <b>lobed</b> stingaree as of Least Concern. It would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E
25|$|The skull may be {{diagnosed}} by specific dental features. The second premolar and molars are markedly <b>lobed.</b> This feature is specific for this genus, {{and no other}} African fruit bats have this characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Leaves {{are usually}} alternate, and palmately <b>lobed</b> or pinnate, often on long stalks, and {{sometimes}} with light or dark patterns. The leaves of Pelargonium peltatum (Ivy-leaved Geranium), have a thick cuticle better adapting them for drought tolerance.|$|E
25|$|A benthic predator, the <b>lobed</b> stingaree feeds {{mostly on}} crustaceans, {{and to a}} much lesser extent on small bony fishes, polychaete worms, and molluscs. It is aplacental viviparous, with females {{typically}} bearing a single pup every October or November after a gestation period of ten months. Developing embryos are nourished by maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk") after they exhaust their supply of yolk. In the northern portion of its range, the <b>lobed</b> stingaree is frequently caught incidentally by trawlers. Though it generally survives the experience, it {{has a tendency to}} abort its young when captures. However, this species is not greatly affected by human activity overall, and it has been listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×trudellii {{is a small}} fern, with {{evergreen}} fronds {{growing in}} tufts. It is similar to A.pinnatifidum, with a triangular leaf blade, pinnatifid (<b>lobed)</b> in the upper part, with a long, drawn-out tip. The fronds are monomorphic, showing little or no difference between sterile and fertile fronds.|$|E
25|$|Medallion Ushak carpets {{usually have}} a red or blue field {{decorated}} with a floral trellis or leaf tendrils, ovoid primary medallions alternating with smaller eight-lobed stars, or <b>lobed</b> medallions, intertwined with floral tracery. Their border frequently contains palmettes on a floral and leaf scroll, and pseudo-kufic characters.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium pinnatifidum, {{commonly}} known as the <b>lobed</b> spleenwort or pinnatifid spleenwort, is a small fern found principally in the Appalachian Mountains and the Shawnee Hills, growing in rock crevices in moderately acid to subacid strata. Originally identified as a variety of walking fern (Asplenium rhizophyllum), it was classified as a separate species by Thomas Nuttall in 1818. It is believed to have originated by chromosome doubling in a hybrid between walking fern and mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum), producing a fertile tetraploid, a phenomenon known as alloploidy; however, the hypothesized parental hybrid has never been located. It is intermediate in morphology between the parent species: while its leaf blades are long and tapering like that of walking fern, the influence of mountain spleenwort means that the blades are <b>lobed,</b> rather than whole. A.pinnatifidum can itself form sterile hybrids with several other spleenworts.|$|E
25|$|The Canary creeper (Tropaeolum peregrinum) is a {{trailing}} {{and climbing}} half-hardy annual species with wiry stalks and palmately <b>lobed</b> leaves. The pale yellow, fringed flowers are borne on long stalks. It originated from Peru but may first have been cultivated in the Canary Islands before being introduced into Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×kentuckiense, {{commonly}} known as Kentucky spleenwort, is a rare, sterile, hybrid fern. It is formed by the crossing of <b>lobed</b> spleenwort (A.pinnatifidum) with ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron). Found intermittently where the parent species grow together in the eastern United States, it typically grows on sandstone cliffs, but is known from other substrates as well.|$|E
25|$|The Coryphoideae are {{the most}} diverse {{subfamily}}, and are a paraphyletic group, meaning {{all members of the}} group share a common ancestor, but the group does not include all the ancestor's descendants. Most palms in this subfamily have palmately <b>lobed</b> leaves and solitary flowers with three, or sometimes four carpels. The fruit normally develops from only one carpel.|$|E
