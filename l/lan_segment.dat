5000|$|... "Data Centre virtualisation" [...] articulates {{the desire}} to {{flexibly}} and efficiently harness available compute resources {{in a way that}} may rapidly be modified to respond to varying application demands, without the need to dedicate physical resources to a specific application. One aspect of this is server virtualisation. The other is connectivity virtualisation, because a physically distributed set of server resources must be attached to a single IP subnet, and modifiable in an operationally simple and robust way. SPBM delivers this; because of its client-server model, it offers a perfect emulation of a transparent Ethernet <b>LAN</b> <b>segment,</b> which is the IP subnet seen at layer 3. A key component of how it does this is implementing VLANs with scoped multicast trees, which means no egress discard of broadcast/unknown traffic, a feature common to approaches that use a small number of shared trees, hence the network does not simply degrade with size as the percentage of frames discarded goes up. It also supports [...] "single touch" [...] provisioning, so that configuration is simple and robust; the port of a virtual server must simply be bound locally to the SPBM I-SID identifying the <b>LAN</b> <b>segment,</b> after which IS-IS for SPB floods this binding, and all nodes that need to install forwarding state to implement the <b>LAN</b> <b>segment</b> do so automatically.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the implementation effort of supporting end-to-end performance guarantees over a heterogeneous local-area network comprising of both wired and wireless <b>LAN</b> <b>segments.</b> Most {{of the earlier}} works [3] [4] [5] [6] [9] on real-time performance guarantees over wireless LANs are based on simulation or analytical studies. One of the exceptions is the ATM wireless LAN testbed effort in NEC &C Lab [7]. However, none of these works focused on the design and implementation of real-time protocols for off-the-shelf wireless LAN technology without special hardware support. In addition, none of the previous works discussed how performance guarantees mechanisms for wired and wireless networks should be integrated to form an end-to-end solution. Fundamentally {{the goal of this}} work is to provide real-time performance guarantees to interactive multimedia applications over a LAN environment, which could consist of wired as well as wireless <b>LAN</b> <b>segments.</b> This work also addresses the performance guarantee issues associated with mobility or roaming. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide a brief overview of the original REther protocol for wired Ethernet. Then we describe in detail the wireless REther protocol in Section 3 with the design choices and the internal workings of the protocol. The measurement results for the wireless REther prototype are also reported to justify these design decisions. Section 4 discusses the support provided by wireless REther for ensuring uninterrupted flow of real-time streams in presence of host mobility across the wireless network, and the associated design choices therein.

The proposed protocols are based on CSMA/CD with deterministic collision resolution and belong to the dynamic planning based category, where an admission test is performed for guaranteeing message transmission. This test is based on the worst case channel access time that can elapse before a particular node can transmit its message. We also compute the worst case buffer requirement at the switch and nodes.
