50|$|The M-46 was {{developed}} from the M-36 130 mm naval gun used on ships and for coast defence. It is a true gun, being unable to fire much above 45° and having a long barrel and a single propelling charge. In contrast, most Western field guns of this period had a dual high and <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire</b> capability, a gun-howitzer.|$|E
50|$|The gun {{remained}} in Royal Navy anti-aircraft use, {{in the form}} of the new Mk V version, on smaller ships in World War II because of its dual capability of both <b>low</b> and high <b>angle</b> <b>firing.</b>|$|R
50|$|In World War I the {{principal}} practitioner of naval bombardment (the term used {{prior to the}} Second World War for what was later designated naval gunfire support - NGS) was Britain's Royal Navy (RN); and the main theatres in which RN ships fired against targets ashore were the Aegean—Dardanelles/Gallipoli, and later the Salonika Front—and along the Belgian coast. In the Aegean the enemy coastal defences (forts, shore-batteries etc.) were fairly unsophisticated; however, on the Gallipoli peninsula these still proved to be difficult targets for the navies <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>firing</b> guns. Here, the fortresses outline tended to blend into the hillside making identification difficult and the guns themselves presented small targets. Mobile howitzers on the plateau presented even greater problems, since these were higher still, and being completely shielded from view proved almost impervious to naval bombardment. For RN ships bombarding German targets along the Belgian Coast the situation was altogether different from the autumn of 1915 until the enemy withdrawal in October 1918.|$|R
50|$|Infantry guns drew much {{interest}} in course of World War I because of the developments in trench warfare. In addition to the usual requirements {{that they needed to}} be portable enough to be carried by infantry, two separate capabilities were desired. First, it needed to engage in high <b>angle</b> indirect <b>fire,</b> especially given the prevalence of trenches. Second, it needed to be capable of <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> direct <b>fire,</b> while being carried by assault infantry, to engage strongpoints, bunkers, and other fortifications. Some infantry guns that appeared between world wars, such as the German 7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegeschütz 18 and Japanese Type 92 battalion gun, were designed to meet all these requirements simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Depending {{on the gun}} mount, {{there is}} usually a choice of two trajectories. The {{dividing}} angle between the trajectories is about 45 degrees, it varies slightly due to gun dependent factors. Below 45 degrees the trajectory is called [...] "low angle" [...] (or lower register), above is [...] "high angle" [...] (or upper register). The differences are that <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire</b> has a shorter time of flight, a lower vertex and flatter angle of descent.|$|E
50|$|The Type 92 {{battalion}} gun {{was designed}} {{in response to}} issues with the Type 11 37 mm infantry gun and the Type 11 70 mm infantry mortar. Both lacked sufficient firepower and range, and infantry divisions {{did not like the}} fact that they had to carry two different types of weapons with different ammunition into combat. As a result, the army technical bureau developed a design which could be used either at <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> direct <b>fire</b> to take out fortified positions, machine gun nests and light armor, but also could be used at high <b>angle</b> indirect support <b>fire.</b> The caliber of the new weapon was increased to 70 mm to address the issue of inadequate firepower. The new design was available to front line divisions by 1932.|$|R
2500|$|USS Ronald Reagan {{departed}} San Diego on 4 January 2006, on {{her maiden}} deployment to conduct naval operations {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, {{as well as to}} conduct maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf. On 28 January 2006, an F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter attempting a night landing aboard Reagan crashed into the ship's flight deck about [...] southeast of Brisbane, Queensland. The aircraft struck the ramp at a <b>low</b> <b>angle,</b> caught <b>fire,</b> and skidded overboard. The pilot ejected safely, but the aircraft was lost. While in the port of Brisbane, the carrier's condensors became fouled with jellyfish, causing minor problems. The ship entered the Persian Gulf on 22 February 2006, and returned from deployment on 6 July 2006.|$|R

5000|$|The Woodlark Basin {{is one of}} {{very few}} places on the earth to have active <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults. A <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal fault is a normal fault that has a dip of less than thirty degrees (dip <30°). This is a topic that is {{currently}} debated heavily, the <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal fault paradox. <b>Low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults have been proposed {{to be a key}} structural feature for crustal extension. In the Woodlark Basin the active <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults have a dips between 15°-35°, and are all located in the small range of 150.5° E to 152.5° E. [...] This is a very interesting area in the Woodlark because it is the area where sea-floor spreading makes the transition to continental rifting. However, some scientist do not believe that <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults exist actively in the world. They instead believe that the <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults found are old normal faults that are no longer active and have been rotated to a different orientation. This would make a normal fault look like it was a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal fault that is no longer active.|$|R

50|$|Traditional light {{scattering}} instruments worked by taking readings from multiple angles, each being measured in series. A <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> {{light scattering}} system {{was developed in}} the early 1970s that allowed a single measurement to be used to calculate the molar mass. Although measurements at <b>low</b> <b>angles</b> are better for fundamental physical reasons (molecules tend to scatter more light in lower angle directions than in higher <b>angles),</b> <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> scattering events caused by dust and contamination of the mobile phase easily overwhelm the scattering from the molecules of interest. When the low-angle laser light scattering (LALLS) became popular in the 1970s and mid-1980s, good quality disposable filters were not readily available and hence multi-angle measurements gained favour.|$|R

40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{hydrogenated}} nanocrystalline silicon are prepared at reasonably higher deposition rates (9 - 13 Å/s) by indigenously fabricated hot-wire {{chemical vapor deposition}} system at various substrate temperatures (Ts). In this paper we report extensively studied structural, optical and electrical properties of these films by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> X-ray diffraction (<b>low</b> <b>angle</b> XRD), micro-Raman spectroscopy and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> XRD and micro-Raman spectroscopy analysis indicate amorphous-to-nanocrystalline transition occurred at Ts = 300 °C. It is observed that volume fraction of crystallites and its size increases with increase in Ts. The <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> XRD study also shows nc-Si:H films with well-identified lattice planes of (111) orientation. In addition, it is observed from the FTIR spectroscopy that the hydrogen is incorporated in the film mainly in Si-H 2 and (Si-H 2) n complexes. The nc-Si:H films with low hydrogen content (< 4 at. %) and wide band gap (1. 83 - 1. 89 eV) and low refractive index (< 3) is useful for various device applications...|$|R
