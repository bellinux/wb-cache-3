500|$|In July 1651, the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{was visited}} by three Rhode Islanders {{who had become}} Baptists: [...] John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall. [...] Massachusetts reacted harshly against the visit, imprisoning the three men, while Cotton preached [...] "against the heinousness" [...] of the Anabaptist {{opinions}} of these men. [...] The three men were given exorbitant fines, despite public opinion against punishment. [...] Friends paid the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but Holmes refused to allow anyone to pay his fine. [...] As a result, he was publicly whipped in such a cruel manner that he could only sleep on his elbows and knees for weeks afterwards. [...] News of the persecutions reached England and met with a negative reaction. [...] Sir Richard Saltonstall, a friend of Cotton's from Lincolnshire, wrote to Cotton and Wilson in 1652 rebuking them for the practices of the colony. [...] He wrote, [...] "It doth not a little grieve my spirit to heare what sadd things are reported dayly of your tyranny and persecutions in New-England as that you fyne, whip and imprison men for their consciences." [...] He continued, [...] "these rigid wayes have <b>layed</b> you very lowe {{in the hearts of}} the saynts."

Almost all the reasons for including <b>lay</b> decision makers are served somehow by the existing forms, including providing different experiences and perhaps expert knowledge. The article concludes, citing non-EU states and <b>lay</b> participation in criminal and administrative courts as further evidence, that <b>lay</b> judges {{in one form or another}} are an element of European legal systems...|$|R
