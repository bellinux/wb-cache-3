40|$|Objective. We {{present the}} clinical, biochemical, and imaging {{findings}} {{of a woman with}} vitamin D deficiency and severe osteomalacia related to intravenous heroin addiction. Results. A 54 -year-old woman with a medical history significant for <b>long-standing</b> heroin <b>abuse</b> presented with complaints of bone pain, muscle cramping, and a left hip ulcer. She had been bed bound for approximately 1 year secondary to pain of uncertain etiology, and her husband was bringing her both food and drugs. She was admitted to the hospital for debridement of a right ischial ulcer. Further workup revealed osteomyelitis of the left hip and severe vitamin D deficiency. Radiologic evaluation demonstrated diffuse osteopenia with pseudofractures, as well as true fractures. Conclusion. This is the first case reported in the English literature of advanced osteomalacia resulting from a debilitating narcotic dependency. Vitamin D deficiency should be considered in patients with poor nutrition and prolonged sunlight deprivation from any cause...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Agnes’ legal {{career has been}} spent on the Worcester Superior Court in Massachusetts, {{to which he was}} appointed in 2000 by then-Governor Paul Cellucci. It was on this seat that Justice Agnes molded his reputation, as Worcester Superior Court Judge John McCann notes, “…as a judge who does not shy away from ‘the tough calls’ and is fair and thoughtful in all his rulings”. One such case involves a 59-year-old man twice convicted of child rape. Loran D. Scott, admitting, during a jury-waived trial in front of Judge Agnes, that he was “likely to re-offend if released from custody” due to “a <b>long-standing</b> substance <b>abuse</b> problem,” and recurring “sexual ‘thoughts and fantasies.’” Admitting, among other things, psychological evaluations — which ultimately diagnosed Scott with schizophrenia and a personality disorder — Justice Agnes found that Scott is a “sexually dangerous person as defined by the law” and committed him to the Massachusetts Treatment Center for Sex Offenders. Straight interpretation and appropriate rulings in cases such as these were what elevated Agnes’ ability as a jurist in the eyes of his peers and in the eyes of those among the public who paid attention.|$|R
40|$|A 44 -year-old female {{presented}} with a 3 -month history of headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Her past medical history was significant for <b>long-standing</b> intravenous drug <b>abuse.</b> Shortly after admission, the patient became hypertensive and febrile, with fever as high as 38. 8  °C. The lumbar puncture profile supported an infectious process; however multiple cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) did not initially show growth of organisms. Finally after 9 days of incubation, a CSF culture showed evidence of a few colonies of Candida albicans. To confirm the diagnosis, preserved CSF from that sample was tested for (1 → 3) -β-d-glucan, showing levels > 500  pg/ml. This report illustrates a rare complication of intravenous drug use in an immunocompetent patient and demonstrates the utility of (1 → 3) -β-d-glucan testing in possible Candida meningitis...|$|R

5000|$|... "Victims of {{trafficking}} often endure brutal {{conditions that}} result in serious {{physical and mental health}} problems. These include HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as other serious communicable diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis. Rape, assault, battery, and other forms of violence are also common. Victims of human trafficking also have reproductive problems such as pelvic inflammatory disease, forced abortion, and/or abortion related complications. Unwanted pregnancies are common. Many trafficking victims become addicted to alcohol or other drugs, used to numb the physical pain of <b>long-standing</b> <b>abuse.</b> Finally, the health implications of sex trafficking extend not only to victims and their children, but also to the customers/users, who can be infected or become carriers and transmitters of these diseases. In the U.S., victims are being trafficked from countries as disparate as India, Thailand, Russia, Cameroon, Mexico, Honduras, and many more. Most often, they are from resource poor countries with more than their share of serious health problems. Some of these countries have a thriving sex industry make them epicenters for epidemics. And where people are being moved vast distances around the globe to do someone else's bidding for someone else's gain, the epidemics are moving with them, thereby having a direct impact on the health of the destination country." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Abuse of doping agents {{may pose}} {{a higher risk}} for heart disease {{including}} acute myocardial infarction. We report the case of a 50 -year-old body-builder Caucasian man with a <b>long-standing</b> <b>abuse</b> of nandrolone and erythropoietin that developed a ventricular septal defect following acute myocardial infarction. This mechanical complication led to cardiogenic shock ultimately treated with the implantation of a circulatory support by means of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The patient subsequently underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. The association of intense isometric exercise, abuse of erythropoietin and nandrolone is likely to have predisposed to coronary thrombus formation and acute myocardial infarction, as the patient presented no traditional cardiovascular risk factors...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This paper {{describes}} {{the components of}} the Caribbean Institute on Alcoholism and Other Drug Problems (CARIAD), a <b>long-standing</b> substance <b>abuse</b> training programme. It seeks to explain how certain strategies and pedagogic techniques may be contributing to its success. Methods: Authors deconstruct the core elements of CARIAD to demonstrate how the programme effectively meets the characteristics of a community of practice. The processes used to develop the learning community and the specific pedagogic strategies and techniques that foster collaborative knowledge construction and sharing are described. Results: Caribbean Institute on Alcoholism and Other Drug Problems brings together a multi-disciplinary, multi-national group of individuals with interest in substance abuse. The programme provides a range of formal and informal learning activities which focus on sharing best practices and creating new sociocultural relevant knowledge to advance the domain of professional practice in substance abuse. The components of CARIAD promote interactivity, rapid bonding and a sense of identity. Caribbean Institute on Alcoholism and Other Drug Problems provides a unique platform for cultural sharing that gives participants an opportunity to reveal insights into local and regional expressions of substance abuse challenges. Participants, however, recognize the absence of structured continuity and the diminution of what could be accomplished by graduates over time. Conclusion: The success of CARIAD as a regional learning platform may be related to its success as a Caribbean community of practice for substance abuse. Caribbean Institute on Alcoholism and Other Drug Problems would do well to sustain the community of practice, generating and maintaining ongoing participation and collaboration among graduates. This can potentially serve to create new strategies for advancing the region in the area of substance abuse...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} from 1984 to 1994 great changes {{occurred}} in the situation for drug addicts In Stockholm. The HIV-infection among intravenous drug addicts was detected in 1984 and a general HIV-screening started in 1985. In order {{to prevent the spread}} of the HIV-infection among drug addicts the medical and social drug treatment services were enlarged. A new methadone maintenance programme was started in Stockholm in 1987. There were approximately 4, 500 IDUs in Stockholm 1992 and about 50 % of them were opiate users. The rest mainly used amphetamine. The purpose of the thesis was to evaluate all drug-related deaths that occurred in the Stockholm area during a ten-year period, 1985 - 1994, in relation to main drug of abuse, HIV-infection and methadone treatment. The material comprises 830 drug-related deaths and 21 suicides among HIV-infected persons, examined at the Department of Forensic Medicine in Stockholm 1985 - 1994, 74 HIV-infected addicts who had died in hospital during the same period and 547 HIV-infected persons who were registered in the County of Stockholm between 1984 and 1994. Two cohorts were followed up: 101 compulsory treated drug addicts, 1986 - 93, and 1640 hospitalised drug users, 1985 - 92. Both the number of deaths among drug addicts in general and among HIV-infected drug addicts increased during the period. There were different causes and manners of death in relation to main drug of abuse. The majority of the heroin-related deaths were in connection with intravenous injection and there were few deaths from external violence. Amphetamine-related deaths were often due to accidents, homicides, suicides and somatic disease caused by <b>long-standing</b> drug <b>abuse.</b> Many of the cannabis-related deaths were due to traffic accidents, homicides and impulsive and violent suicides. There were few suicides among HIV-infected persons. Among the infected drug addicts there was no relation between suicide and the duration of infection. No addicts with an AIDS-diagnosis died from suicide. The majority of the HIV-infected heroin users died from injection after a short infection time and most amphetamine users died from somatic complications after a relatively long time of infection. The results from the two cohort studies show a lower mortality among those in the methadone programme from violent causes and poisoning among both HIV-seronegative and infected heroin users including those with a very long-standing and intensive drug abuse who had undergone coercive treatment. Most deaths in the methadone programme were due to HIV-related disease. A forensically based register of drug-related deaths in Stockholm 1985 - 94 has been established and it is concluded that this register gives a more comprehensive picture of drug-related deaths than the official cause-of-death register...|$|R
40|$|From about 1950, {{doctors in}} Switzerland were {{becoming}} {{aware that the}} pattern of renal disease was changing. In 1953, Spühler and Zollinger described 44 cases of chronic interstitial nephritis [1]. Papillary necrosis was observed in 22 cases, and {{it was noted that}} many of the patients had taken antibiotics and/or an analgesic containing phenacetin. Subsequently, it became clear that a pathologic entity of chronic interstitial nephritis with papillary necrosis was associated with <b>long-standing</b> <b>abuse</b> of analgesics [2, 3]. Spühler and Zollinger's necropsy cases had bilateral contracted kidneys with surfaces presenting extensive areas of atrophy with some intervening nodular areas. Although the papillary necrosis was thought to be ischemic in origin. Gloor [4], as early as 1960, pointed to some special features of this lesion and suggested that papillary changes preceded the chronic interstitial nephritis. Reported from Switzerland were many cases, commonly linked with the consumption of a mixture of phenacetin, caffeine, isopropyl-antipyrine, and pyrithildion. It then became apparent that this form of kidney disease, which was associated with the phenacetin in the mixtures taken, was common in Scandinavia [5], where a popular mixture contained phenacetin, caffeine, and phenazone (antipyrine) [6], In 1957, Schourup made a clear distinction between the classical acute type of papillary necrosis, seen with diabetes or obstruction and infection, and the new chronic and insidious form associated with analgesic abuse [7]. With the exception of Gloor, European pathologists tended to believe that the papillary necrosis resulted from compression of vasa recta in the outer medulla, as an expression of a cortical and outer medullary inflammatory process. It was recognized, however, that urinary tract infection, though common, was often a late development or might not occur at all [8]...|$|E
