The editors {{and most of the}} writers of this book were members of the organizing and program committees of the 18 th Annual Conference of the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing (SHARP), Book Culture from Below, that took place in Helsinki in 2010. This book provides, {{for the first time in}} English, an overview of an important epoch in Finnish book and reading history. Besides depicting book culture at the periphery of Europe, it contributes to our understanding of the power of the urbanized European literary world of the 1700 s. The new reading culture that emerged in Finland during the 1700 s affected readers and all levels of society in many ways. Along with other trends, the arrival of translated fiction and Enlightenment literature from Europe opened and irrevocably altered the Finns’ world view. The change was especially pronounced in cities. Scholars, merchants, craftspersons, as well as military officers stationed at Helsinki’s offshore Sveaborg fortress, acquired world literature and guides intended for professionals at, for example, book auctions. In this book, researchers from different fields examine the significance and influence of that era’s books from cultural, historical, ideological, and social perspectives. What kinds of books did the citizens of Helsinki really buy, loan, and read during the 1700 s? What topics and ideas introduced by the new literature were discussed in salons and reading circles?

Pellets are a quite new product whose production has risen exponential in recent years. Today there are small-, medium-and large-scale users, where the <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumers</b> are the heating sector. The heating sector is mainly using oil to cover the increased demand during cold periods. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the potential of pellets if it would replace thermal power plants oil and coal. The study will also analyze the economic impact a conversion would mean for a heating plant and if the pellet is a reasonable substitute. 2008 statistics from the Swedish district heating association were analyzed and a calculation was performed to determine how many tons of pellets is needed to replace coal and oil. Fuel costs for oil and coal were compared with the costs to produce the equivalent amount of heat with pellets. In order to analyze the economic impact an investment calculation was made. The payback period was calculated for a new wood powder boiler if it was to replace an existing oil boiler. The study includes a qualitative research interview, which was addressed to the largest users of fuel oil and coal for district heating. Policy influences and the heat plant's environmental policy will lead to a gradually phasing out of fossil fuels. The greatest compliment to the non-renewable energy is biofuel where pellets are a possible substitute. A pellets-consuming wood powder boiler can replace the fossil fuel consumption. The readjustment will lead to a great investment and requires that the energy sector prioritize pellets ahead of other alternative fuels...|$|R

A novel representation, the Audio-Visual Grouplet (AVG), is extracted {{by studying the}} statistical temporal audio-visual interactions. An AVG {{is defined as a}} set of audio and visual codewords that are grouped together according to their strong temporal correlations in videos. The AVGs carry unique audio-visual cues to represent the video content, based on which an audiovisual dictionary can be constructed for concept classification. By using the entire AVGs as building elements, the audio-visual dictionary is much more robust than traditional vocabularies that use discrete audio or visual codewords. Specifically, we conduct coarse-level foreground/background separation in both audio and visual channels, and discover four types of AVGs by exploring mixed-and-matched temporal audio-visual correlations among the following factors: visual foreground, visual background, audio foreground, and audio background. All of these types of AVGs provide discriminative audio-visual patterns for classifying various semantic concepts. We extensively evaluate our method over the <b>large-scale</b> Columbia <b>Consumer</b> Video set.

40|$|<b>Large-scale</b> <b>consumers</b> of {{information}} such as lecturers and researchers have nowadays widely adopted the digital document. These professionals cannot suffice with disaggregate data but instead need full text documents. These documents include the research production of their colleagues and the teaching resources designed {{both within and outside}} their institution – be they commercially published or not. The main source {{of information}} for these professionals is the Internet, which has become a victim of its own success. If lecturers and researchers claim to have gained better information accessibility, thanks to the Web, they still must account for the time needed to examine the results obtained. Moreover, many of these net-users still camp with difficulties in information retrieval, where all too often their results are unsuccessful or unsatisfactory. University lecturers and researchers at an Engineering College in Nantes on the West coast of France base this paper on a survey that examines the use of and performance with digital documents. The study was conducted during the year 2003 with about 70 persons from various fields and disciplines including physics, computer science, sociology, etc. This study looks at the lecturer-researcher in the capacity of information seeker and reveals a rather sedentary and autonomous figure, one who first relies on the resources offered by his/her own computer. Even though they are partly unsatisfied, they claim no time to waste on improving their information search skills. New tools bringing relevant, rich, and reliable scientific information and documentation are of interest to them. Certainly, if this would help them capture that which would otherwise have been neglected when only classical search techniques are applied. However, these tools must be simple to use, fast, and available where and when needed.

One of the issues in realizing such a large {{accelerator}} facility in Japan would be assuring a satisfactory supply of electrical power. As is well known, after the Tohoku - Pacific Ocean Earthquake in March 11, 2011, most Japanese nuclear power plants have been off-line. Prior to that, up to 30 % of the demand on the electrical grid was supplied by nuclear power. While there is no prospect for resumption of reactor operations, a rapid increase of the generation capacity of fossil fuel plants has allowed Japanese industries and domestic life to survive without major disruption, thought it has worsened the trade imbalance. In any case, we must be realistic in preparing an energy management plan for our Research Institutes where <b>large-scale</b> energy <b>consumers</b> are. Already for many years laboratories such as TRISTAN, KEKB and J-PARC have scheduled their operations {{so that they could}} contract to draw minimal power during the summer cooling season which causes the peak demand on the system. However, it is still crucial to continue systematic efforts to (1) improve the overall design in order to get better “luminosity/unit power consumption” and to (2) improve the power efficiency of all accelerator components. For a third attack on the problem, energy recovery from the cooling water system should be studied, in spite of its relatively-low energy density.

It is shown that under suitable assumptions (primarily ignorability of panel membership conditional upon the match-ing variables), the resulting survey estimates are consistent with an asymptotic normal distribution. Simulation {{results show that the}} matched sample estimators are superior to weighting a random sub-sample from the panel and have a similar sampling distribution to simple random sampling from the population.

Finally, energy storage facilitates the integration of variable renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Despite this potential, the implementation of many types of storage technology is limited today, primarily due to the high cost of research and development for utility-scale storage implementation.

The re-sults were compared to those from a stan-dard laboratory analysis of compost respira-tion. Table 1 provides a summary of the test methods. For simplicity, feedstocks tested were limited to source separated yard trim-mings composted under rigorous process controls by Land Recovery, Inc. at its indoor composting facility in Puyallup, Washing-ton.

Evaluation both on the public KITTI benchmark and our own dataset show that this is a viable approach for visual odometry which outperforms basic 3 D pose estimation due to the exploitation of the largely planar structure of road environments...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Although {{awareness}} of environmental sustainability has {{increased over the}} past few decades, the current market share of sustainable products remains low. Because of their market position, <b>large-scale</b> and high-volume <b>consumer</b> interactions, food retailers are appropriate venues to entice consumers to buy more sustainable foods. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the extent to which food retailers are perceived to have embedded sustainability initiatives in their marketing strategies and to have taken sustainable tactical measures on the store floor. In addition, the study considered the roles played by social identification (SI) and by perceived external prestige (PEP). Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review and semi-structured qualitative interviews with the chief executive officers (CEOs) of Dutch food retailers, the authors conducted an online panel survey among the managers of these food retailers. Findings – The results of the study show the positive impacts of managers’ SI with a sustainable consumer group and managers’ PEP on the perceived environmental sustainability initiatives of Dutch food retailers. The study finds that managers’ SIs are powerful ways to engender employee loyalty. Moreover, organisations that are perceived to have more external prestige are perceived as being more capable of developing sustainability policies. Originality/value – The current study combines views from CEOs of large Dutch food retailers with supermarket manager’s perceptions of sustainability initiatives on a strategical and tactical level of an organisation. It uses insights from CSR, food retail and SI theory literature to explain these perceptions...|$|R
