5|$|Politically, Crease {{presented}} {{himself as a}} foe of the Hudson's Bay Company's hegemony over the colony, and in 1860 {{was elected to the}} Vancouver Island House of Assembly as an independent member representing Victoria. However, he was soon criticised by the British Colonist (a paper run by opposition leader Amor de Cosmos) for being too cozy with the HBC-backed government. The following year, as if to prove de Cosmos right, governor Sir James Douglas appointed Crease Attorney-General of British Columbia, and Crease resigned his seat in the Assembly. He was a key member of the government, responsible for pushing literally hundreds of laws through the legislature, in between his continuing circuit tours, most of which was concerned with regulating the resource-based economic activity of the colony, including <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> and gold mining. His legislation cemented his reputation as an advocate of free trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} {{plan was}} put into action on 16August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. At this time the military had a strength of 598,300 men and women. Of these, 310,600 were in Australia, 224,000 were serving in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and 20,100 were in Britain {{and other parts of}} the world. The only personnel to be discharged during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service, however, as general demobilisation did not begin until 1October 1945. During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory's capital city. These centres were to provide information on employment, <b>land</b> <b>settlement,</b> housing, training, loans, tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed. Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige was appointed the Coordinator of Demobilisation and Dispersal in September.|$|E
5|$|Peasant {{society is}} much less {{documented}} than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed {{for a wide variety}} of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. <b>Land</b> <b>settlement</b> also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.|$|E

40|$|Indonesia is {{entering}} {{an era of}} urban settlement transformation from horizontal <b>landed</b> living <b>settlement</b> to low-rise settlement, into the construction of vertical high-rise settlement. This resulted in the <b>landed</b> <b>settlement</b> residents that being moved to high-rise settlement, they have encountered a change of high-rise vertical living culture that different from their living culture before. This study aims {{to find out the}} use of shared space in landed living and high-rise settlement. The research method used in this research is qualitative descriptive study. The site of the research is in the <b>landed</b> <b>settlement</b> of Kampung Pulo and the high-rise settlement of Jatinegara Barat. Kampung Pulo settlement is a residence of Jatinegara Barat residents before they are moved. The result of the research shows the change of space use for shared space from landed to high-rise settlement; (1) <b>landed</b> <b>settlement</b> more accommodate the diversity of communal activities than high- rise settlement. (2) in the <b>landed</b> <b>settlement</b> there is a territory transition space that accommodates the needs of interaction, homebased business activities, and play, whereas high-rise settlement there is no more transition space, so the need for interaction and play is contained in the public space, while the trading activities needs are mostly found within the private area. (3) In <b>landed</b> <b>settlements,</b> the shared space used for communal activities is more multifunctional than high rise settlement...|$|R

5|$|After British {{victory in}} World War II, Kenyatta {{received}} a call to return to Kenya in September 1946, sailing back that month. Edna was pregnant with a second child, although she expected to never see her husband again; Kenyatta was aware that if they joined him in Kenya their lives would be made very difficult by the colony's racial laws. On his arrival in Mombasa, Kenyatta was greeted by his first wife and their children. He built a bungalow at Gatundu, near {{to where he was}} born, and began farming his 32-acre estate. Kenyata met with the new Governor of Kenya, Philip Euen Mitchell, and in March 1947 accepted a post on an African <b>Land</b> <b>Settlement</b> Board, holding the post for two years. He also met with Mbiyu Koinange to discuss the future of the Koinange Independent Teachers' College in Githungui, with Koinange appointing Kenyatta as its Vice-Principal. In May 1947, Koinange moved to England, leaving Kenyatta to take full control of the college. Under Kenyatta's leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. It was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers' strikes over non-payment of wages. Gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell. Kenyatta built a friendship with Koinange's father, a Senior Chief, who gave Kenyatta one of his daughters to take as his third wife.|$|E

25|$|Citing for the {{potential}} of the area for settlement and agricultural development, President Quezon declared the entire land area of Mallig Plains as project site for his program on rural development. In support of this declaration, he created the Office of National <b>Land</b> <b>Settlement</b> Administration which was renamed to <b>Land</b> <b>Settlement</b> Development Corporation (LaSeDeCo). Subsequently, this corporation was reorganized. At that time, the primary objective of LaSeDeCo was basically to oversee and facilitate the distribution of lands to qualified settlers. With the development of this opportunity for rural and agricultural development and with the completion of the Balete Pass Road in the 1920s that runs through the hinterlands of the Caraballo Mountains, hundreds of inhabitants from the Ilocos and Central Luzon regions opted to settle and avail of the program of the government in the Mallig Plains area.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, {{during the}} Commonwealth period, agrarian {{problems}} persisted. This motivated {{the government to}} incorporate a cardinal principle on social justice in the 1935 Constitution. Dictated by the social justice program of the government, expropriation of landed estates and other landholdings commenced. Likewise, the National <b>Land</b> <b>Settlement</b> Administration (NLSA) began an orderly settlement of public agricultural lands. At {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, major settlement areas containing more than 65,000 hectares were already established.|$|E

The 62 pioneers, mostly agricultural and trade graduates, were the first large batch of settlers to land in the area with the mission to industriously cultivate the region. After this first influx of pioneers, thousands more Christians from Luzon and the Visayas have subsequently moved into the area, gradually driving some of the resident B'laan to the mountains, {{who have lost their}} livelihood.|$|E
25|$|The State Records Authority of New South Wales (commonly {{known as}} State Records NSW) is the {{archives}} and records management {{authority of the}} Government of New South Wales in Australia. It can trace its history back {{to the establishment of}} the office of Colonial Secretary and Registrar of the Records of New South Wales in 1821. However, {{in the early years of}} the Colony's history, little attention was paid to the management and preservation of non-current public records. This was mainly because the government of the day was fully focussed on the administration of the convict system, law and order, immigration and <b>land</b> <b>settlement.</b> Documents which were not required for the day-to-day running of the government were usually neglected or were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|White {{immigration}} to the Company realm was initially modest, but intensified during the 1900s and early 1910s, particularly south of the Zambezi. The economic slump in the Cape following the Second Boer War motivated many white South Africans to move to Southern Rhodesia, and from about 1907 the Company's <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> programme encouraged more immigrants to stay for good. The Southern Rhodesian mining and farming industries advanced considerably during this period; Southern Rhodesia's annual gold output grew in worth from £610,389 in 1901 to £2,526,007 in 1908. The territory first balanced revenue and expenditure in 1912. There were 12,586 whites in Southern Rhodesia in 1904, and 23,606 in 1911; in 1927, {{four years after the}} end of Company rule, the black and white populations in Southern Rhodesia were respectively 922,000 and 38,200.|$|E

After federation, he moved to federal politics, where he was at various times postmaster-general, Minister for Defence, Minister for Home Affairs, Treasurer and acting Prime Minister. He was affiliated with the Protectionist Party from 1901 to 1906, the Western Australian Party from 1906 to 1909, the Commonwealth Liberal Party from 1909 to 1917, then the Nationalist Party of Australia from 1917 to 1918.|$|E
25|$|In 1513, Ferdinand II of Aragon {{issued a}} decree {{establishing}} the encomienda <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> {{system that was}} to be incorporated throughout the Spanish Americas. Velázquez, who had become Governor of Cuba relocating from Baracoa to Santiago de Cuba, was given the task of apportioning both the land and the indigenous peoples to groups throughout the new colony. The scheme was not a success, however, as the natives either succumbed to diseases brought from Spain such as measles and smallpox, or simply refused to work, preferring to slip away into the mountains. Desperate for labor to toil the new agricultural settlements, the Conquistadors sought slaves from surrounding islands and the continental mainland. However, these new arrivals followed the indigenous peoples by also dispersing into the wilderness or dying of disease.|$|E
25|$|Land revenue {{settlements}} {{constituted a}} major administrative {{activity of the}} various governments in India under Company rule. In all areas other than the Bengal Presidency, <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> work involved a continually repetitive process of surveying and measuring plots, assessing their quality, and recording landed rights, and constituted {{a large proportion of}} the work of Indian Civil Service officers working for the government. After the Company lost its trading rights, it became the single most important source of government revenue, roughly half of overall revenue in the middle of the 19th century; even so, between the years 1814 and 1859, the government of India ran debts in 33 years. With expanded dominion, even during non-deficit years, there was just enough money to pay the salaries of a threadbare administration, a skeleton police force, and the army.|$|E

25|$|To {{maximise}} {{the potential}} of new, white-run farms, the Company launched a wide-scale <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> programme for white settlers. As part of this drive it reorganised the geographical distribution of native reserve areas, moving the reserves and often reducing them in size where the land was of particularly high quality. To ensure that the white farmers would retain the reliable access to markets that the nascent railway network provided, tribal reserve boundaries in various relevant places were redrawn by the Company to place the railway lines outside. The new hut taxes concurrently compelled black peasants to find paid work, which {{could be found in}} the new agricultural industry, though most tribesmen were reluctant to abandon their traditional lifestyles in favour of the capitalist labour market. Managers at farms and mines often had great trouble sourcing sufficient manpower.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit {{began to}} emerge as a {{political}} force in the late 1960s and early 1970s, shortly after the first graduates returned home. They formed new politically active associations in the early 1970s, starting with the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (Inuit Brotherhood and today known as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami), {{an outgrowth of the}} Indian and Eskimo Association of the '60s, in 1971, and more region specific organizations shortly afterwards, including the Committee for the Original People's Entitlement (representing the Inuvialuit), the Northern Quebec Inuit Association (Makivik Corporation) and the Labrador Inuit Association (LIA) representing Northern Labrador Inuit. Since the mid-1980s the Southern Labrador Inuit of NunatuKavut began organizing politically after being geographically cut out of the LIA, however, for political expediency the organization was erroneously called the Labrador Métis Nation. These various activist movements began to change the direction of Inuit society in 1975 with the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. This comprehensive land claims settlement for Quebec Inuit, along with a large cash settlement and substantial administrative autonomy in the new region of Nunavik, set the precedent for the settlements to follow. The northern Labrador Inuit submitted their land claim in 1977, although they had to wait until 2005 to have a signed <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> establishing Nunatsiavut. Southern Labrador Inuit of NunatuKavut are currently in the process of establishing landclaims and title rights {{that would allow them to}} negotiate with the Newfoundland Government.|$|E
