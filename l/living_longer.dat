5|$|Sound {{movement}} {{through the atmosphere}} is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E

People are <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> with projections of average life expectancy reaching 84.6 years for men and 89.1 for women by 2060, an increase of 7.9 years of life for men and 6.6 years of life for women compared to 2010.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, Machali lost {{almost all}} of her teeth, sight in one eye, and much of her {{strength}} due to aging. She also lost her territory, as her daughter Sundari from her last litter drove her out of her turf. As she was unable to hunt and kill for herself, park staff provided her with food. This intervention became somewhat controversial; tiger expert K Ullas Karanth commented that it resulted in Machali <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> than she should have, and that truly wild animals should be born, live and die naturally.|$|E

25|$|Females tend to live {{five years}} longer; i.e. their funds need to {{last five years}} longer than men's funds. In addition, women face gender {{specific}} challenges resulting from how they are socialized. For example, they must follow rules of negotiating for a higher salary from a mutually-beneficial framework to avoid suffering from a negative employer backlash. As {{a result of all}} of the above-mentioned inequities, women face a more complex money management situation than men in which they earn less but will be <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> and incurring higher expenses.|$|E
25|$|Employment of {{registered}} nurses and nurse practitioners {{is expected to}} increase immensely in the next ten years through legislation and the idea of short-term savings. Much of the growth is expected to come as a result of legislation and proliferation of online schools, leading to the idea of better health care and a greater variety of solutions for health problems which have not been proven through appropriate research. Also, life expectancy is getting longer; therefore more patients are <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> and living more active lives. It is further anticipated that the need for NPs will increase because of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).|$|E

25|$|Approximately 27 million Americans, {{or nearly}} 11% of the population, have diabetes, {{according}} to the American Diabetes Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By 2050, the prevalence of diabetes could increase {{to as much as}} 33% of the population, largely due to the aging of the population and to people with diabetes <b>living</b> <b>longer.</b> Approximately 1.9 million new cases of diabetes are diagnosed each year. The disease was the seventh leading cause of death in 2007, directly claiming more than 71,000 lives and contributing to approximately 160,000 additional deaths. Patients with diabetes are two to four times more likely than those without it to die from cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is an important cause of blindness, kidney disease, and lower-extremity amputations.|$|E
25|$|The {{morbidity}} and mortality caused by HCV has increased {{since the inception of}} highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because HIV patients are <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> from potent antiretroviral therapies and prophylaxis of traditional opportunistic infections. The effect of HCV on the natural history of HIV remains inconclusive due to contradictory studies documenting no effect, while others show an increase to an AIDS defining illness or death. In the United States, approximately 150,000 to 300,000 people are co-infected with HIV and HCV. This represents 15% to 30% of all HIV infected patients and 5% to 10% of all HCV patients. Reduced HCV antibody production, drug interactions, other causes of liver disease, differing epidemiologic characteristics and natural history complicate the management of HCV/HIV patients. Until recently there was little data published regarding treating HIV–HCV co-infected patients; fortunately recent trials have been published about the safety and efficacy of current treatment options.|$|E
