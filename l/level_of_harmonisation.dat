Harmonisation of these taxes was perceived an integral part of achieving a common market, and for this reason it was given priority. Over forty years since the introduction of a common VAT system, VAT is usually regarded as a broadly harmonised tax. Paradoxically, however, it is precisely this high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> which seems to have allowed the preservation of some aspects of VAT law which constitute an obstacle to the establishment of the EC internal market. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the shortcomings of harmonisation within the VAT area, and namely how harmonisation has prevented the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from applying the EC Treaty provisions to the field of VAT, resulting in the maintenance of laws which could arguably be regarded as contrary to the EC internal market and as restrictions to the fundamental freedoms. ...|$|E

40|$|What {{can be done}} to {{strengthen}} EU legislation in the field? NOTE The 2008 Framework Decision on the fight against organised crime provides a sophisticated framework of criminalisation on participation in a criminal organisation. However, it requires improvement both in terms of legal certainty and its scope, {{and in terms of the}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> it achieves. The Framework Decision is drafted in broad and vague terms which may lead to overcriminalisation. A greater degree of harmonisation is necessary not only to ensure a level playing field among Member States, but also to facilitate the operation of other elements of European criminal law. The Lisbon Treaty includes a number of provisions which may serve as legal bases for the further development of the law in the field. Any new proposal should be based on a thorough evaluation of the implementation of the 2008 Framework Decision by Member States and of the interpretation of the relevant concepts by national courts.

The Lisbon Treaty maintained establishing the principle of mutual recognition at the heart of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.

40|$|In this study, we analyse how three {{scenarios}} involving different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> common {{agricultural policy}} (CAP) decoupled payments in the EU affect the distribution of farm income across regions and farm types. We use the farm type extension of the {{common agricultural policy}} impact (CAPRI) model, which captures farm heterogeneity across the EU. The first scenario (NUTS 1) assumes uniform per-hectare payments at the NUTS 1 level. The second scenario (MS-CONV) equalises the per-hectare rates inside each Member State (MS) and partially harmonises the single payment scheme (SPS) across MS {{in line with the}} 2011 Commission proposal. The third scenario simulates a uniform per-hectare payment at the EU level. Depending on the implementation of the SPS, the NUTS 1 flat rate induces a substantial redistribution of payments across farm types and NUTS 2 regions, particularly in regions that apply the historical SPS. The MS-CONV and EU flat-rate schemes have more significant impacts at the EU-wide level. In the EU- 15, almost all farms lose payments from MS-CONV and EU-wide flat rates, whereas in the EU- 10, almost all farm types gain from these scenarios. Our conservative estimates indicate that the flat-rate payments could redistribute up to € 8. 5 billion. Lower land rental costs partially offset the losses of farm income in the EU- 15 from payment redistribution. Land rents drop for all flat-rate scenarios across most sectors and farm sizes in the EU- 15. In the less productive new MS, the landowners’ rental income is largely unaffected by the introduction of the flat rate. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R

40|$|The  regulation  of  Swedish  municipal  accounting  has  undergone  {{fundamental}} changes over recent decades. Municipal accounting became regulated by law the 1 st of January, 1998, {{after having been}} merely voluntarily regulated in the past. In accordance  with  the  legislation,  a  standard-setting  body  was  formed,  with responsibility   for   development   and   interpretation   of   generally   accepted accounting principles for municipal accounting.

We have used a triangulation approach, collecting data through a survey, documentary study and interviews. The overall results show that the reform has had a very limited impact on accounting practice. Compliance with accounting standards and legislation was in general poor. This result is in line with the assumptions of positive accounting theory.   However,  the  study  also  shows  that  there  are  differences  among  the preparers.    The   supposition,   suggested   by   institutional   theory,   that   large municipalities should produce  better  accounting information (i. e. more in line with generally accepted accounting principles) than the municipalities in general, could not be rejected.

40|$|Biobanks have {{recently}} gained great significance {{for research and}} personalised medicine, being recognised as a crucial infrastructure.

Nevertheless, the extent of the actual activities and the impact <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> networking and <b>harmonisation</b> have not been fully assessed. To address these issues and to obtain missing knowledge on the extent of biobanking in Europe, the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, in collaboration with the European Science and Technology Observatory (ESTO), conducted a survey among European biobanks. In total, 126 biobanks from 23 countries responded to the survey. Most of them are small or medium-sized public collections set up either for population-based or disease-specific research purposes. The survey indicated a limited networking among the infrastructures. The large majority of them are stand-alone collections and only about half indicated to have a policy for cross-border sharing of samples. Yet, scientific collaborations based on the use of each biobank appear to be prominent. Significant variability was found in terms of consent requirements and related procedures as well as for privacy and data protection issues among the biobanks surveyed. To help promote networking of biobanks and thus maximise public health benefits, at least some degree <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> should be achieved. JRC. DDG.

40|$|The article {{examines}} whether the norms {{laid down in}} the Directive {{in relation to the}} exceptions and limitations on copyright and related rights can be conducive to a sensible degree of harmonisation across the European Union. Before discussing the degree of harmonisation achieved so far by the Directive, the first part gives a short overview of the main characteristics of the list of exceptions and limitations contained in Article 5 of the Directive. A comprehensive review of the implementation of each limitation by the Member States {{is beyond the scope of}} this article.

These exceptions and limitations were later on also identified by the European Commission as key elements in the deployment of a digital knowledge economy. The analysis will show that the implementation of the provisions on limitations in the Information Society Directive did not, and probably cannot, yield the expected <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> across the European Union and that, as a consequence, there still exists a significant degree of uncertainty for the stakeholders regarding the extent of permissible acts with respect to copyright protected works...|$|E
40|$|International audienceKey messageThe {{potential}} of European National Forest Inventories to harmonise stem quality estimation in European forests was identified despite considerable differences in existing national approaches. ContextKnowledge on stem quality and assortments structure in European forests is highly important for {{policy makers and}} the timber industry and also for carbon life cycle analysis {{due to the fact}} that different timber products have different end use and thus store carbon for different time periods. AimsThe study aim was to evaluate the {{potential of}} European National Forest Inventories (NFI) to objectively report on the stem quality in European forests in a harmonised manner. MethodsA comprehensive questionnaire was conducted as the first important step to evaluate the current status of stem quality assessment and assess the existing <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation.</b> ResultsDirect stem quality assessment or classification is used in 19 out of 28 European NFIs. Only eight countries provide timber assortment estimates from their NFIs. In addition, different sampling strategies for stem quality assessment are used among NFIs. Tree parameters relevant for stem quality assessment on standing trees were identified for the purpose of harmonisation. Several methods towards harmonisation between European NFIs for the purpose of reporting on stem quality of European forests were suggested. ConclusionCurrent European NFIs are not capable of reporting the stem quality of European forests in a harmonised manner at this stage and considerable efforts will need to be taken before the harmonised stem quality estimation can be prepared.

Still, {{the financial sector}} has remained more tightly regulated than most others. Due to financial institutions‟, and especially banks‟, crucial position within financial markets and their systemic nature, financial liberalisation has walked {{hand in hand with}} stricter industry regulation. In the EU a certain overall <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> is sought in all Member States, also within the financial sector, extending to Norway through its EEA Membership and the EEA Agreement. An important part of this harmonisation, although often set aside in favour of the more pressing questions of capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, is the regulation of the taking-up of businesses and pursuit of holdings within the financial sector. Through a long line of Internal Market directives the European Commission has attempted to provide harmonised prudential assessment regulation and authorisation practices for the taking up and pursuit of businesses within the sector. This article discusses Norwegian private ownership regulation in regards to the taking up and pursuit of the businesses of credit institutions and (life) insurance undertakings and its legitimacy under EEA law. In chapters 2 and 3 we review the legal method of interpretation and the relevant regulatory scenery.

The second objective is to evaluate the impact of its solutions on non-financial conditions of business of insurance and thus to determinate as far as directive 2009 / 138 /EC introduces new legal conditions of business of insurance and how they influence on taking-up and pursuit of that economic activity. The carried out analysis of legal solutions of directive Solvency II and its comparative analysis to the provisions of insurance directives of first, second and third generation, that were previously in force, confirmed a research thesis according to which a Solvency II directive, which has introduced a number of new legal solutions concerning conditions of taking-up and pursuit of business of insurance in the internal market of the EU, does not establish a level of harmonization conductive to making efficiency and effectiveness in doing business in that market. The enlargement of legal conditions as a result of passing a directive is not conductive to efficiency of the operation of insurance undertakings on the EU market as well as to increasing their competing opportunities. The provisions of Solvency II directive concerning conditions of business of insurance are characterized by lack of clarity, they are imprecise and inconsistent. They contain legal loopholes.

40|$|This thesis applies {{innovative}} {{methods to}} {{the efficiency and}} productivity analysis of the Australian banking system. Key areas of investigation include the impact of regulatory reforms on bank performance, the impact of firm entry and exit on industry productivity and {{the changing nature of}} banking and the role of risk in measuring bank value-added. The latter leads to {{the construction of a new}} bank production model, emphasising risk management as part of a bank&# 146;s value-added. As such, the proposed bank output framework views risk as a productive service, rather than a bad output or externality, which is often assumed in the literature. Aided with this new framework, several refinements are suggested for the treatment and measurement of bank output by researchers and statistical agencies. A unified regulatory framework combined with a greater <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> in rules in the Australian banking sector, has meant that a pooled analysis of all deposit-taking institutions has become feasible for the first time. With an enlarged dataset new insights are gained into the relative performance of deposit-taking institutions in Australia. The results challenge commonly held views of bank efficiency and the relevance of scale, size and incumbency when measuring bank efficiency. The new definition of bank output is also applied across the sector using econometric and non-parametric techniques to gauge productivity. Problems with balanced data sets and aggregation of firm level productivity are examined. A new approach to decomposing aggregate industry level productivity is introduced based on strong axiomatic grounds and its ability to attribute productivity between continuing, exiting and entering firms. The technique is applied for the first time and uses the newly developed bank output production model. The analysis provides key information on the relative performance of firms in the Australian banking sector...|$|E
40|$|Here, we {{summarise}} {{the results}} after {{carrying out a}} large survey regarding the assessment of vascular alterations, both vessel changes and vascular lesions in an inter-laboratory setting. In total, 32 neuropathologists from 22 centres, most being members of BrainNet Europe (BNE), participated by filling out a questionnaire with emphasis on assessment of common vascular alterations seen in the brains of aged subjects. A certain <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> has been reached among BNE members regarding sectioning of the brain, harvesting of brain tissue for histology and staining used {{when compared to the}} survey carried out in 2006 by Pantoni and colleagues. The most significant variability was seen regarding the assessment of severity and of clinical significance of vascular alterations. Two strategies have recently been recommended regarding the assessment of vascular alterations in aged and demented subjects. The National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) recommends the assessment of hippocampal sclerosis, vascular brain injury and microvascular lesions in 12 regions. Although this strategy will be easy to follow, the recommendations do not inform how the load of observed alterations should be assessed and when the observed lesions are of significance. Deramecourt and his colleagues recommend an assessment and semiquantitative grading of various pathologies in 4 brain regions. This strategy yielded a total score of 0 to 20 as an estimate of pathology load. It is, however, not clear which score is considered to be of clinical significance. Furthermore, in several BNE trials the semiquantitative assessment has yielded poor agreement rates; an observation that might negatively influence the strategy proposed by Deramecourt and his colleagues. In line with NIA-AA, a dichotomised approach of easily recognisable lesions in a standardised set of brain regions harvested for neuropathological assessment and applying reproducible sampling and staining strategies is recommended by BNE. However, a simple strategy regarding assessment of load of alteration is urgently needed to yield reproducible, and at the same time, comparable results between centres. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
