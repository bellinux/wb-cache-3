5|$|Despite the Left Alliance's loss of seats, its {{chairman}} Paavo Arhinmäki was still reasonably {{satisfied with the}} party's performance in the election, due to his claims that the media had concentrated on the four major parties during the campaign. However, Arhinmäki got the most personal votes in his electoral district of Helsinki. The Left Alliance's support was highest in <b>Lapland</b> with 16.7% of the votes and lowest in Southern Savonia with 2.2%.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Vainio's Jawohl, jawohl from Kansi kiinni ja kuulemiin ("Shut the Lid and Goodbye") {{was criticized}} for its {{commentary}} about German tourists who visit <b>Lapland.</b> The album also featured a sensitive song, Mä uskon huomispäivään ("I Believe in Tomorrow"). Other well-known songs from the album are Playboy 60 v ("Playboy 60 yrs"), Suomi–Ruotsi ("Finland–Sweden") and Taas lapsuuden maisemiin ("Back Again to Where I Grew Up").|$|E
5|$|Of the 317 Finnish {{municipalities}}, 16 are monolingually Swedish. 33 municipalities are bilingually Finnish and Swedish; of these, 15 have a Swedish-speaking {{majority and}} 18 a Finnish-speaking one. Four municipalities, all located in <b>Lapland,</b> have a Finnish-speaking majority and a Sami-speaking minority: Enontekiö, Inari, Sodankylä and Utsjoki. Initially, only Swedish was accorded official bilingualism, through a language act of 1922; similar provisions were extended to Sami through a 1991 law. The 1922 law {{was replaced by}} new but largely similar legislation in 2003.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} museums in the town is the Infantry Museum (Jalkaväkimuseo) located {{in one of the}} former army barracks, close to the University of Applied Sciences. It {{contains}} exhibits from the four wars in Finland's modern history – the Civil, Winter, Continuation and <b>Lapland</b> Wars. The museum also contains an exhibit dedicated to Finnish war hero Lauri Törni.|$|E
5|$|The Finns bought 15 new Panzer IV Ausf J in 1944, for 5,000,000 Finnish markkas each (about {{twice the}} {{production}} price). The remainder of {{an order for}} 40 tanks and some StuG were not delivered and neither were German instructors provided. The tanks arrived too late to see action against the Soviets, but were instead used against the Germans during their withdrawal through <b>Lapland.</b> After the war, they served as training tanks, and one portrayed a Soviet KV-1 tank in the movie The Unknown Soldier in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus {{began his}} {{expedition}} from Uppsala on May 12, 1732, {{just before he}} turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted {{on the way to}} examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in <b>Lapland.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Kylfings (Old Norse Kylfingar; Finnic Kylfingid; Hungarian Kölpények; Old East Slavic Колбяги, Kolbiagi; Byzantine Greek Κουλπίγγοι, Koulpingoi; Arabic al-Kilabiyya) were {{a people}} of {{uncertain}} origin active in Northern Europe during the Viking Age, roughly {{from the late}} ninth century to the early twelfth century. They {{could be found in}} areas of <b>Lapland,</b> Russia, and the Byzantine Empire that were frequented by Scandinavian traders, raiders and mercenaries. Scholars differ on whether the Kylfings were ethnically Finnic or Norse. Also disputed is their geographic origin, with Denmark, Sweden and the Eastern Baltic all put forward as candidates. Whether the name Kylfing denotes a particular tribal, socio-political, or economic grouping is also a matter of much debate.|$|E
5|$|In {{foreign policy}} Red Finland leaned on Bolshevist Russia. A Finnish-Russian Red treaty and peace {{agreement}} was signed on 1 March 1918. The negotiations for the treaty revealed, that, as in World War I in general, nationalism {{was more important}} for both sides than the principles of international socialism. The Red Finns did not accept alliance with the Bolsheviks and major disputes appeared e.g. over demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia. The bargaining sides exchanged land areas; an artillery base, Ino, located in the Karelian Isthmus, was transferred to Russia, while Finland received Petsamo in north-eastern <b>Lapland.</b> The significance of the Russian-Finnish Treaty evaporated soon, due to {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Bolsheviks and the German Empire on 3 March 1918.|$|E
5|$|Mari Kiviniemi {{was elected}} {{the new leader}} of the Centre Party in its conference in Lahti on 12 June. The support for the Centre Party has been {{significantly}} higher in northern Finland than elsewhere: in the 2007 election the party received over 43% of the votes in both Oulu and <b>Lapland</b> electoral districts, compared with its nationwide support of 23.1%, while in 2003 the party's vote share in the two northernmost districts was even higher) As the top spots of the party leadership went to members from southern Finland, many of their supporters {{in the northern part}} of the country felt disenchanted; one local party chief even warned that many northern Centre Party supporters might switch sides to the True Finns.|$|E
5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of <b>Lapland.</b> And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
5|$|Raithel {{was awarded}} the Iron Cross 1st Class in late April 1941. Following the defeat of Greece and its allies, the {{division}} was deployed to <b>Lapland</b> in northern Finland in September 1941. Raithel remained as a battalion commander with the 143rd Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the division in Finland and was promoted to Major on 1 November 1941. Schörner became Raithel's mentor during their service with the 6th Gebirgs Division. In January 1942 he {{was awarded the}} German Cross in Gold. In August 1942 he was transferred to the Oberkommando des Heeres (Army Headquarters) reserve pool for an extended period, during which he returned to the mountain infantry school then served briefly with the 133rd Fortress Division on Crete. He was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 October 1943.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his studies in Munich in 1849, Höckert returned to Sweden in 1850. During {{the summer of}} that year, he traveled extensively throughout <b>Lapland</b> in the northern parts of Sweden. Höckert chose <b>Lapland</b> {{because he had been}} inspired by the lively descriptions botanic Nils Johan Andersson had made about the nature and people there.|$|E

25|$|Straight {{after the}} last gig, Holopainen went on a week-long hiking trip to <b>Lapland</b> with Tony Kakko. During the hiking trip, {{they talked about the}} band and Holopainen decided he could not break up Nightwish that easily. When he {{returned}} from <b>Lapland</b> he immediately {{received a phone call from}} Ewo Pohjola, CEO of Spinefarm, offering himself to become their manager and help him straighten things up, and Holopainen agreed.|$|E

25|$|Different {{interpretations of}} the origins of the mythical Pohjola exist. Some include parts of <b>Lapland</b> and the ancient Kainuu (same as Kvenland {{according}} to common view today) in Kalevala's Pohjola. Some point out a similarity with the name Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia in English), a region in western Finland.|$|E
25|$|The Moscow Armistice {{was signed}} between Finland {{on one side}} and the Soviet Union and Britain on the other side on September 19, 1944, ending the Continuation War. The {{armistice}} compelled Finland to drive German troops from its territory, leading to the <b>Lapland</b> War 1944–1945.|$|E

25|$|The Jamtish flora {{is heavily}} {{characterized}} by temperate coniferous forest, taiga, a forest inhabited by Norway spruce and pine trees. Among the two the Norway spruce is more common. The Norway spruce actually grows most densely in Jämtland {{together with the}} southern parts of <b>Lapland.</b> Here roughly 60 percent of the forests consist of spruces.|$|E
25|$|In 1746, {{the volcano}} was {{explored}} by French academicians from the French Geodesic Mission. Their {{mission was to}} determine the sphericity of the Earth. Their work along with another team in <b>Lapland</b> established that the Earth was an oblate spheroid rather than a true sphere. They did not reach the summit of Chimborazo.|$|E
25|$|When Häkkinen {{was five}} years old, his parents rented a go-kart {{for him to take}} to a track near their home. On his first lap, Häkkinen was {{involved}} in an accident but he escaped unhurt. Despite this crash, Häkkinen wished to continue racing and after persistently annoying his parents, the young Finn got his wish fulfilled. His father bought Häkkinen his first go-kart, one that Henri Toivonen had previously competed with. He later won his first karting race in 1975 at the Keimola Motor Stadium where he raced in the regional karting championships in 1978 and 1979, winning the Keimola Club Championship in both years. Häkkinen found further success in 1980 when he won the Swedish <b>Lapland</b> Cup and finished fourth in the 85cc class of the <b>Lapland</b> Karting Championship. Around this time, Häkkinen also drove a Volkswagen Beetle on the frozen lakes of Finland with friend Mika Sohlberg.|$|E

In accordance with the armistice conditions, the <b>Lapland</b> War was commenced to evacuate the Wehrmacht from Northern Finland by force.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to municipalities, {{there are two}} intermediate levels of local government. Municipalities co-operate in seventy-four sub-regions and nineteen regions. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. However, the autonomous province of Åland has a directly elected regional council, and the Sami people have a semi-autonomous Sami Domicile Area in <b>Lapland</b> for issues on language and culture.|$|E
25|$|Archeological {{evidence}} suggests that people along the southern shores of Lake Onega and around Lake Ladoga reached the River Utsjoki in Northern Finnish <b>Lapland</b> before 8100 BC. However, these people did not speak sami. According to the comparative linguist Ante Aikio, the Sami proto-language developed in South Finland or in Karelia around 2000–2500 years ago, spreading then to northern Fennoscandia.|$|E
25|$|Upland Finland {{extends beyond}} the Arctic Circle. The extreme north of this region is known as <b>Lapland.</b> The highest points in upland Finland reach an {{elevation}} of about , and they {{are found in the}} Kilpisjärvi area of the Scandinavian Keel Ridge. In the southern upland region the hills are undulating, while in the north they are rugged. Much of upland Finland is not mountainous, but consists of bogs.|$|E
25|$|Hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union ceased in September 1944, and {{the first}} Soviet POWs were {{handed over to the}} Soviet Union on 15 October 1944.

Furthermore, Finland handed over 2,546 German POWs from the <b>Lapland</b> War to the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Few animals live {{in these}} areas; birds, mostly, {{such as the}} willow warbler, the meadow pipit, the {{northern}} wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European golden plover, the Eurasian dotterel, the snow bunting, and the <b>Lapland</b> longspur. The willow ptarmigan is relatively common, whereas the rock ptarmigan is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufjället is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Paris and {{traveling}} in Belgium, the Netherlands, and England, Höckert returned to Sweden in 1857. He soon became vice-professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and begun {{work on his}} next painting: Brudfärd på Hornavan. Höckert made this painting, depicting the lake Hornavan in <b>Lapland,</b> in a different style than he was used to. It featured brighter tones than his previous paintings, and depicted a more open landscape. Brudfärd på Hornavan was completed in 1858.|$|E
