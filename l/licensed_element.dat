40|$|Based on Brandtler (2012), {{this paper}} argues that {{polarity}} items {{are sensitive to}} evaluability, a concept that refers {{to the possibility of}} accepting or rejecting an utterance as true in a communicative exchange. The main distinction is made between evaluable and non-evaluable utterances. The evaluable category comprises any clause that asserts, presupposes or entails the truth of an affirmative or a negative proposition. In contrast, the non-evaluable category contains clauses that do not assert, presuppose or entail the truth of an affirmative or a negative proposition. According to the Evaluability Hypothesis, non-evaluable environments are natural hosts for both NPIs and PPIs. Hence, the occurrence of polarity items in non-evaluable clauses does not require formal licensing, and this is the reason we find both PPIs and weak NPIs in yes/no-questions and conditionals. Evaluable clauses, in contrast, are restricted environments and may only host polarity items that are formally (i. e. syntactically) licensed. Hence, NPIs require the presence of a <b>licensing</b> <b>element,</b> and PPIs require the absence of such elements. This analysis leads to an important change of perspective, as the occurrence of polarity items in negative and affirmative sentences becomes the marked, or exceptional, case...|$|R
40|$|Background Individuals with agrammatic aphasia show {{selective}} comprehension {{impairments in}} complex sentences with long-distance dependencies such as Wh-filler-gap dependencies (WhFG). Recent {{studies suggest that}} this difficulty arises from failure to integrate grammatical and lexical information (Lexical Integration Deficit Hypothesis [LIDH]; Thompson & Choy, 2009). This study further evaluates LIDH by investigating cataphora processing. Cataphoric dependencies involve a long-distance relation between a preceding pronoun (dependent element) and its antecedent (<b>licensing</b> <b>element),</b> as in (1 a). They are processed similarly to WhFG where the parser searches for the <b>licensing</b> <b>element</b> upon encountering the dependent element (Kazanina et al., 2007). Importantly, cataphora resolution is sensitive to structural (Binding Condition C) and lexical (gender) information, thereby allows examinations {{of the interaction between}} grammatical and lexical information. Method In an eye-tracking self-paced reading experiment, 6 individuals with agrammatic aphasia and 15 controls were tested using a paradigm where the c-command relation (c-command vs. non-c-command), the gender congruency (gender-matched vs. gender-mismatched) between the pronoun and potential antecedent, and the gender specification (stereotypical vs. definitional) were manipulated, as illustrated below. (1) 	a/b. 	After he/*she read the paper, the king happily went [...] . 	c/d. 	He/she read the paper after the king happily went [...] . 	e/f. 	After he/she read the paper, the minister happily went [...] . 	g/h. 	He/she read the paper after the minister happily went [...] . In (1 a/b), the pronoun is grammatically linked to the potential antecedent (the king). Furthermore, because the gender of the antecedent is definitional (king-male), in (1 b) we expect the parser to show a reading time slowdown at the gender-mismatched antecedent (i. e., gender-mismatched effect; GMME). In (1 e/f) the antecedent is gender-ambiguous, but understood stereotypically as male or female (minister-male). Since the interpretation of stereotypical-gender nouns is affected by the gender of the pronoun in healthy individuals (Kreiner et al., 2008), in (1 f), minister is interpreted as female. Consequently, this process requires additional integration costs. The LIDH predicts that since the integration process is impaired in agrammatic aphasia, the GMME is expected for patients but not for controls. In (1 c/d/g/h), since pronoun-antecedent relation is impossible, no GMME is expected. Results Analyses of second-pass reading times revealed a significant interaction of c-command x gender x noun type at the critical antecedent region for the controls, associated with a GMME in the non-c-command/mismatched/definitional condition, but not in the stereotypical condition. Similarly, the patient group showed the same three-way interaction, but in the spillover region. However, GMMEs in both definitional and stereotypical c-command/mismatched conditions were found, with a greater GMME in the stereotypical compared to the definitional condition. Conclusion These findings indicate that the patients exhibited similar eye-movement patterns to that of the controls when processing definitional-gender nouns. However, unlike controls, they failed to use contextual gender information to revise gender stereotypes. These patterns support the LIDH...|$|R

40|$|Replication {{licensing}} ensures {{once per}} cell cycle replication and {{is essential for}} genome stability. Overexpression of two key licensing factors, Cdc 6 and Cdt 1, leads to overreplication and chromosomal instability (CIN) in lower eukaryotes and recently in human cell lines. In this report, we analyzed hCdt 1, hCdc 6, and hGeminin, the hCdt 1 inhibitor expression, {{in a series of}} non-small-cell lung carcinomas, and investigated for putative relations with G 1 /S phase regulators, tumor kinetics, and ploidy. This is the first study of these fundamental <b>licensing</b> <b>elements</b> in primary human lung carcinomas. We herein demonstrate elevated levels (more than fourfold) of hCdt 1 and hCdc 6 in 43 % and 50 % of neoplasms, respectively, whereas aberrant expression of hGeminin was observed in 49 % of cases (underexpression, 12 %; overexpression, 37 %). hCdt 1 expression positively correlated with hCdc 6 and E 2 F- 1 levels (P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 048, respectively). Supportive of the observed link between E 2 F- 1 and hCdt 1, we provide evidence that E 2 F- 1 up-regulates the hCdt 1 promoter in cultured mammalian cells. Interestingly, hGeminin overexpression was statistically related to increased hCdt 1 levels (P = 0. 025). Regarding the kinetic and ploidy status of hCdt 1 - and/or hCdc 6 -overexpressing tumors, p 53 -mutant cases exhibited significantlyincreased tumor growth values (Growth Index; GI) and aneuploidy/CIN compared to those bearing intact p 53 (P = 0. 008 for GI, P = 0. 001 for CIN).

40|$|Design rights {{represent}} an interesting {{example of how}} the EU legislature has successfully regulated an otherwise heterogeneous field of law. Yet this type of protection is not for all. The tools created by EU intervention have been drafted paying much more attention to the industry sector rather than to designers themselves. In particular, modern, digitally based, individual or small-sized, 3 D printing, open designers and their needs are largely neglected by such legislation. The use of printing machinery to manufacture physical objects created digitally thanks to computer programs such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software has been in place for quite a few years, and it is actually the standard in many industrial fields, from aeronautics to home furniture. The change in recent years that {{has the potential to be}} a paradigm-shifting factor is a combination between the popularization of such technologies (price, size, usability, quality) and the diffusion of a culture based on access to and reuse of knowledge. We will call this blend Open Design. It is probably still too early, however, to say whether 3 D printing will be used in the future to refer to a major event in human history, or instead will be relegated to a lonely Wikipedia entry similarly to “Betamax” (copyright scholars are familiar with it for other reasons). It is not too early, however, to develop a legal analysis that will hopefully contribute to clarifying the major issues found in current EU design law structure, why many modern open designers will probably find better protection in copyright, and whether they can successfully rely on open licenses to achieve their goals.

Instead, the non-negative additive counterpart of neanche, anche, could combine with a negative marker or some other negative element: e. g. né/non… anche ‘neither/not even’.

It has been known since Harris (1968) that there is a correlation between the ability of certain verbs to take a manner adverbial and their ability to subcategorise for an affected object. Thus, verbs like resemble, have, cost etc. are ill formed with manner adverbs: (1) *John resembled Sue slowly.

40|$|Human 15 -lipoxygenase type 1 (15 -LOX- 1) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{oxygenation}} of free or membrane-bond polyunsaturated fatty acids containing {{at least one}} bis-allylic methylene moiety. The enzyme has been proposed {{to be involved in}} various physiological and pathophysiological activities including inflammation, apoptosis, cell maturation and tumorigenesis. However, its expression and function has not been well studied yet. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase, synthesizes TTAGGG telomeric repeats which are essential for the stability and integrity of chromosomes and is involved in cell transformation and lymphocyte activation during the processes of tumorigenesis and immune response, respectively. In this thesis, the studies aimed at defining the transcriptional regulation of 15 -LOX- 1 and telomerase. We also delineated the effect of 15 -LOX- 1 upregulation in lung epithelial cells on chemokine production. In paper I, we demonstrated that hyper- and hypomethylation of CpG islands in the 15 - LOX- 1 promoter region are intimately associated with the transcriptional repression and activation of the 15 -LOX- 1 gene, respectively. Inhibition of DNA methylation in the 15 - LOX- 1 negative Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cell line L 428 restores the inducibility of 15 - LOX- 1 by IL- 4. Our results suggest that demethylation of the 15 -LOX- 1 promoter is a prerequisite for gene transactivation, which contributes to tissue- and cell-type-specific regulation of 15 -LOX- 1 expression. In paper II, we identified that three functional STAT 6 binding sites are required for full activation of the 15 -LOX- 1 promoter in the 15 - LOX- 1 positive HL cell line L 1236. We found that this region was occupied by STAT 6 in L 1236 cells but not in L 428 cells. Furthermore, DNA hypomethylation and histone hyperacetylation were observed within the core promoter region of 15 -LOX- 1 only in L 1236 cells. Our data indicate that STAT 6 activation and chromatin remodeling by DNA demethylation and histone acetylation are crucial for transcriptional activation of 15 - LOX- 1 in cultured HL cells. In paper III, we ectopically expressed 15 -LOX- 1 in the human lung epithelial cell line A 549. We found that over-expression of 15 -LOX- 1 in A 549 cells leads to increased release of the chemokines Mip- 1 alpha, RANTES and IP- 10, and thereby increases the recruitment of immature dendritic cells, mast cells and activated T cells. Our data suggest that an increased expression of 15 -LOX- 1 in lung epithelial cells is a pro-inflammatory event in the pathogenesis of asthma and other inflammatory lung disorders. In paper IV, we showed that SET and MYND domaincontaining protein 3 (SMYD 3) directly trans-activates the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. We found that SMYD 3 occupies its binding motifs in the hTERT promoter and is required for maintenance of histone H 3 -K 4 trimethylation in this region. Knocking down SMYD 3 in some tumor cell lines abolished trimethylation of H 3 -K 4, attenuated the occupancy by the transactivators c-Myc and Sp 1, and led to diminished histone H 3 acetylation in the hTERT promoter region, which was coupled with down-regulation of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity. These results suggest that SMYD 3 -mediated trimethylation of H 3 -K 4 functions as a <b>licensing</b> <b>element</b> for subsequent transcription factors binding to the hTERT promoter...|$|R

CC Attribution 3. 0 <b>License.</b> Trace <b>element</b> {{deposition}} from desert dust {{has important}} impacts on ocean primary productivity, the quantification {{of which could}} be useful in determining the magnitude and sign of the biogeochemical feedback on radiative forcing. However, the impact of elemental deposition to remote ocean regions is not well understood and is not currently included in global climate models. In this study, emission inventories for eight elements primarily of soil origin, Mg, P, Ca, Mn, Fe, K, Al, and Si are determined based on a global mineral data set and a soil data set. The resulting elemental fractions are used to drive the desert dust model in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in order to simulate the elemental concentrations of atmospheric dust. Spatial variability of mineral dust elemental fractions is evident on a global scale, particularly for Ca. Simulations of global variations in the Ca / Al ratio, which typically range from around 0. 1 to 5. 0 in soils, are consistent with observations, suggesting that this ratio is a good signature for dust source regions. The simulated variable fractions of chemical elements are sufficiently different; estimates of deposition should include elemental variations, especially for Ca, Al and Fe. The model results have been evaluated with observations of elemental aerosol concentrations from desert regions and dust events in non-dust regions, providing insights into uncertainties in the modeling approach. The ratios between modeled and observed elemental fractions range from 0. 7 to 1. 6, except for Mg and Mn (3. 4 and 3. 5, respectively). Using the soil database improves the correspondence of the spatial heterogeneity in the modeling of several elements (Ca, Al and Fe) compared to observations. Total and soluble dust element fluxes to different ocean basins and ice sheet regions have been estimated, based on the model results. The annual inputs of soluble Mg, P, Ca, Mn, Fe and K associated with dust using the mineral data set are 0. 30 Tg, 16. 89 Gg, 1. 32 Tg, 22. 84 Gg, 0. 068 Tg, and 0. 15 Tg to global oceans and ice sheets...|$|R

30|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in an atmosphere of discussion around the rider’s license. The third European Directive on driving licenses provides from 2013 changes in motorcycle licensing. This Directive requires each EU country to design its specific licensing situations {{on the basis of the}} test of several skills (e.g. an avoidance maneuver at 50 km/h). Each EU country and France in particular, is so busy thinking about the design of these settings. Thus the interests for the authorities of the present results are: (1) the test of a methodology to describe the actual educational content that allows auditing the training system (such audit deserves a much larger population), and (2) the identification of a number of elements that have to be improved in the future <b>licensing</b> system. These <b>elements</b> are first the fact that the training situations are the licensing settings, and thus, the choice of the future test situations largely dictate the nature of the delivered training. The instructors only prepare students to get the license. Secondly, the results showed that there could be a gap between the compulsory training program and its application. It is therefore necessary to monitor its implementation and not to focus only on the theoretical aspect. Thirdly, it seems also necessary to promote the development of hazard perceptual skills as they are traditionally undervalued in observed motorcycle-schools and yet involved in lots of accidents. Fourthly, it appears to us essential to balance the teaching of control and perceptual dimensions: these two dimensions are required in real traffic conditions at each moment but in different proportions depending traffic situations. So these both dimensions must be taught during initial training. Finally, one of the challenges of the authorities is to reduce the gap between the training/licensing situations and the real riding situations. The goal is to ensure that the riders’ activity in training settings seeking similar mechanisms to those used in traffic conditions.|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{period for}} first language acquisition {{has been proposed}} and previously supported primarily by case studies of social isolates and studies with Deaf adults {{who were exposed to}} American Sign Language (ASL) during mid- to late-childhood. Although informative, case studies with hearing, social isolates are confounded by physical abuse experienced by the children. Studies with Deaf adults do not show the development of language acquisition under the condition of delayed input. There is now new evidence for sensitive period effects on first language acquisition from two unrelated children, MEI and CAL. MEI and CAL were not exposed to a first language until approximately 6 years of age. There is no history of physical abuse—just a misdiagnosis of mental retardation instead of deafness. MEI and CAL, once exposed to language, were immersed in ASL. ^ The results of filming MEI and CAL for 3 1 / 2 years, from the beginning of their language acquisition process, suggest that sensitive period effects are seen with at least one specific aspect of language—the formal syntactic features (Chomsky 1995). Formal syntactic features are found in different domains of language, including verb agreement, word-order changing mechanisms, and null referents. Analyses of MEI 2 ̆ 7 s and CAL 2 ̆ 7 s naturalistic language production data, along with preliminary experimental results, reveal difficulties with precisely these domains. MEI and CAL have a higher overall percentage of errors per sample than the two native-signing Deaf comparison children. MEI and CAL made most of their errors with agreeing verbs. This class of verbs {{is the only one that}} marks syntactic features in ASL. MEI and CAL attempted fewer utterances with word order variations, suggesting a difficulty with the formal features that trigger some of the word order change mechanisms. Finally, MEI and CAL produced utterances with incorrectly null referents more often than the native signers, again implicating a difficulty with the formal features needed to trigger the syntactic <b>licensing</b> of null <b>elements.</b> ^ The results from this present study, combined with the results from the studies with Deaf, adult late-learners, suggest that sensitive period effects exist, are specific, and are long-lasting. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{increase}} the understanding of high level Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) licensing processes in Finland, France, the UK, Canada and the USA. These countries have been selected for this study because of their different licensing processes and recent actions in new NPP construction. After discussing their similarities and differences, suitable features for Small Modular Reactor licensing can be emphasized and suggested. Some of the studied <b>licensing</b> processes have <b>elements</b> that are already quite well suited for application to SMRs, but all of these different national processes can benefit from studying and implementing lessons learned from SMR specific licensing needs. The main SMR features {{to take into account}} in licensing are standardization of the design, modularity, mass production and serial construction. Modularity can be divided into two different categories: the first category is simply a single unit facility constructed of independently engineered modules (e. g., construction process for Westinghouse AP- 1000 NPP) and the second is a facility structure composed of many reactor modules where modules are manufactured in factories and installed into the facility as needed (e. g., NuScale Power SMR design). Short construction schedules will not be fully benefitted from if the long licensing process prolongs the commissioning and approach to full-power operation. The focus area {{of this study is to}} better understand the possibility of SMR deployment in small nuclear countries, such as Finland, which currently has four operating NPPs. The licensing process needs to be simple and clear to make SMR deployment feasible from an economical point of view. This paper uses public information and interviews with experts to establish the overview of the different licensing processes and their main steps. A high-level comparison of the licensing steps has been carried out. Certain aspects of the aviation industry licensing process have also been studied and certain practices have been investigated as possibly suitable for use in nuclear licensing. All of the current licensing processes were found to be quite heavy and time-consuming and further streamlining could be possible without compromising safety or the need for public participation in the licensing process. Some examples of the modification possibilities for SMR applications are discussed. A profound discussion on SMR-specific licensing models, and on ways to simplify and harmonize them, will be needed in the near future in Europe too. This would be a natural continuation to the harmonization efforts underway for existing and new large reactors...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} of Scottish Literature During the Long Eighteenth Century" examines the limited {{place in the}} canon traditionally allowed to creative writing in Scotland during this period and the overarching reading of creative impediment applied {{to it in the}} light of Scotland's fraught and not easily to be homogenised national history and identity. It interrogates the dominant mode of what it terms the Scottish literary critical tradition and funds this tradition to have many shortcomings {{as a result of its}} prioritising of literary and cultural holism. In examining the Scots poetry revival of the eighteenth century the thesis challenges the traditional identification of a populist and beset mode, and finds eighteenth-century poetry in Scots to be actually much more catholic in its literary connections. These more catholic "British" connections are reappraised alongside the distinctively Scottish accents of the poets Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns. The poetry of James Thomson, it is also argued, fits more easily into a heterogeneous Scottish identity than is sometimes thought and the work of Thomson is connected with the poets in Scots to show a network of influence and allegiance which is more coherent than has been traditionally allowed. Similarly, the primitivist agenda of the Scottish Enlightenment in creative literature is examined to demonstrate the way in which this provides <b>license</b> for reclaiming <b>elements</b> of the historically fraught or "backward" Scottish identity (thus an essentially conservative, patriotic element within the Scottish Enlightenment cultural voice is emphasised.). Also, with the writers of poetry in Scots, as well as with Thomson, and with those whose work comes under the intellectual sponsorship of Enlightenment primitivism such as Tobias Smollett, James Macpherson, James Beattie and others we chart a movement from the age of Augustanism and neoclassicism to that of sensibility and proto-Romanticism. From Burns' work to that of Walter Scott, John Galt and James Hogg we highlight Scottish writers making creative capital from the difficult and fractured Scottish identity and seeing this identity, as, in part, reflecting cultural tensions and fractures which are more widely coined furth of their own country. The connecting threads of the thesis are those narratives in Scottish literature of the period which show the retrieval and analysis of seemingly lost or receding elements of Scottish identity. Creative innovation and re-energisation rather than surrender and loss are what the thesis finally diagnoses in Scottish literature of the long eighteenth century...|$|R

40|$|The MCM (mini-chromosome mainteinance) protein complex has a {{key role}} in the {{replication}} machinery of Eukaryotes and Archaea. Beside the main unwiding role, this helicase is also supposed to act as one of the essential <b>element</b> <b>licensing</b> replication to ensure that each segment of the genome is replicated only once per cycle. Six homologous MCM proteins belonging to the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, known as MCM 2 - 7, are forming in Eukaryotes a hexameric hetero-complex that is supposed to "load" onto a single DNA strand and to use energy from ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) hydrolysis to unzip the DNA double helix. In Archaea, there is a single MCM gene, coding for a single MCM protein. Therefore the protein complex is made by a homohexamer with six equivalent subunits. The DNA loading mechanism for double-strand unzipping is similar to the Eukaryotes case. The scope of this thesis work is to investigate the structural details of the interaction between DNA and the MCM complex in near physiological condition, by means of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) single molecule imaging. For that, we used archaeal MCM from Methanothermobacter Thermautotrophicus as a model system. There are structural and biochemical evidences that MCM interacts with DNA in two ways: the canonical “loaded” mode where the MCM protein complex is encircling the DNA for unwinding, and an “associated” mode where the DNA is supposed to be wrapped around the external part of the proper ring structure. In this second configuration, less studied than the loaded one, the binding interaction between MCM and DNA might play a role in licencing/initiating the replication process. By means of AFM, we studied the conformational changes induced by the protein complex on blunt-ends, double-stranded (ds) DNA filaments of different lenghts. AFM experiments were carried out in two different conditions: in air to understand the static conformations of DNA-protein complexes; in liquid to follow the interaction dynamics. We first optimized the protocol (surface treatment, buffer condition) for AFM imaging in air to obtain high resolution images of surface-equilibrated DNA molecules before and after the interaction with the protein complex. From statistical analysis of AFM images, we localized the protein complexes along the isolated dsDNA sequences and calculated DNA contour lenght and bending angle before and after the interaction with the protein complex. We discriminated between proteins with DNA wrapped around, calling them “associated”, and the ones interacting with DNA without inducing any bending, calling them “loaded”. To confirm this topographical assignment, we tested two mutants: NβH complex, which presents a mutation in the central hole of the hexamer, inhibiting DNA loading; ∆sA complex, which presents a mutation in the external part, preventing DNA association. In the case of NβH, only associated DNA was observed; in the case of ∆sA, only loaded complexes were found, to prove the soundness of our assumptions. Moreover, the total number of DNA bound complexes decreased from 84 % to 20 % from MCM to ∆sA, proving that association is involved in favouring the replicative helicase loading, and initiating the double-helix unwinding. Finally, we found a DNA compaction of about 13 nm for wild type MCM and ∆sA mutant. In the case of NβH mutant, the compaction is of about 18 nm, and comes together with a bending angle increase of about 16 °, strongly supporting the “association” model. Finally, we studied the dynamics of DNA-MCM complex interaction, in the presence of ATP, via moderately fast (few seconds/images) AFM imaging in liquid. After ATP loading, we observed a change of topographic height of the DNA strands, consistent with the formation of ssDNA, as a sign of DNA unwinding by the MCM complex. This effect was unexpected, since there are no biochemical evidences in literature of efficient unwinding of MCM complex on blunt-ended DNA...|$|R
