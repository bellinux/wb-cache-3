However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive <b>life</b> <b>forms.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that some <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> are {{more capable of}} suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all <b>life</b> <b>forms.</b> Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> in the food chain. He {{believed that}} slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi {{was not only a}} source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract An {{artificial}} <b>life</b> <b>form</b> {{under the}} control of a spiking neural network has been created in a chessboard environment which consists of 60 * 60 grids using Matlab GUI. The spiking neural network consists of 8 neurons simulated using Izhikevich model which combines the property of both biological plausibility and computational efficiency. The neurons within the network are fully connected with each other. The ‘intelligence’ of the artificial <b>life</b> <b>form</b> is stored as value of weights in the synaptic connections of neurons. STDP is the learning rule implemented to the network in this project. STDP adjusts the synaptic weights according to the precise timing of pre and postsynaptic spikes. The artificial <b>life</b> <b>form</b> itself has been designed to complete certain tasks such as avoiding obstacles and catching food in the chessboard. The behavior of the artificial <b>life</b> <b>form</b> {{under the control}} of STDP in various situations will be investigated. Experiments will be carried out at the same time trying to improve the behavior of the artificial <b>life</b> <b>form</b> so that the artificial <b>life</b> <b>form</b> can evolve and show some adaption abilities according to the external environments. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} life on Earth is not well understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse <b>life</b> <b>forms.</b>|$|E
5|$|These <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> {{are found}} in almost every {{location}} on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.|$|E
5|$|After a NASA deep-space probe (sent {{to verify}} the {{existence}} of extraterrestrial life in the solar system) crash lands in Mexico, extraterrestrial <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> spread throughout the Mexico–United States border region, leading to the quarantine of the northern half of Mexico. US and Mexican troops battle to contain the creatures, and a huge wall stretching along the border ostensibly keeps the US protected.|$|E
50|$|This {{argument}} {{could have}} been made every time a new biological <b>life</b> <b>form</b> was found, and would have been correct every time; however, it is still possible that in the future a biological <b>life</b> <b>form</b> not requiring liquid water could be discovered.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to absorb other asteroids to make their planet grow enough to become a life planet; crashing against other objects will decrease the player's mass. At this point, <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. <b>Life</b> <b>forms</b> will disappear, but the player will be able to attract planets to form a solar system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi-star systems by selecting planets from their system and make them absorb asteroids until they become another star.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E

50|$|Let us {{define a}} <b>life</b> <b>form</b> as an entity that reduces entropy by {{self-executing}} the minimum set {{of physical and}} chemical operations necessary to sustain the ability to execute functionally equivalent negentropic operations indefinitely across time. Given that, a <b>life</b> <b>form</b> will be considered an animat (living material) if all the information necessary to execute that minimum set of physical and chemical operations cannot be stored in DNA or RNA. The corollary: If all the information necessary to execute that minimum set of physical and chemical operations {{can be stored in}} DNA or RNA, the <b>life</b> <b>form</b> is biological.|$|R

5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other <b>life</b> <b>forms.</b> Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' {{applies to}} animals and all <b>life</b> <b>forms.</b> This precept isn't {{found in the}} oldest verses of Vedas, but {{increasingly}} becomes {{one of the central}} ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD.

5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E

As it appears to be growing, he puts it into a containment field, but later that night, the crew finds the lab damaged, and the <b>life</b> <b>form</b> gone, apparently having escaped through an air duct. They note that the incident was accompanied by a power drain and a rise in temperature. O'Brien, attempting to track the creature down, hears a strange noise, and then finds a puddle of goo, which they assume is the <b>life</b> <b>form's</b> remains.|$|R
40|$|We {{deliver a}} "keyword" {{account of the}} term <b>life</b> <b>form</b> {{as it has been}} used in natural {{philosophy}} and biology over the last two hundred years, beginning with its appearance in German as Lebensform. We argue that <b>life</b> <b>form</b> has, since its earliest enunciations, pointed to a space of possibility within which life might take shape, but that the way that space is imagined and theorized in biology has transformed substantially; <b>life</b> <b>form</b> originated as a term referring to idealized, aesthetic possibilities, then transformed to describe biogeographic and evolutionary potentialities, and today, in the age of synthetic biology and astrobiology, has come to signal conjectural and future possibilities...|$|R

5|$|Aliens do not {{feature in}} the series, as Grant and Naylor decided {{very early in the}} process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually {{addressed}} with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' (GELF), an artificially-created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might bring}} to Earth pathogens or invasive <b>life</b> <b>forms</b> {{that do not}} harm its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E
