40|$|SummaryObjectivesUsing the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as framework, we {{evaluated}} modifying effects of illness perceptions {{and mental health}} on the association between impairments in body structures and functions due to osteoarthritis (OA) and <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> activities in the lower extremities. MethodsSelf-reported <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> activities was assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA index (WOMAC) function subscale in 316 patients with knee or hip pain or evidence of OA on knee or hip radiographs. Body structures and functions were evaluated during clinical and radiological assessments. Illness perceptions and mental health were assessed with the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and the mental component summary score of the RAND 36 -item Health Survey, respectively. For each patient an expected WOMAC function score was calculated, using an equation based on a multivariate model {{of the association of}} body structures and functions with <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> activities. ResultsThe median (interquartile) self-reported WOMAC function score was 22. 2 (9. 6 – 43. 5). Ninety-one patients reported more and 120 patients reported less <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> activities than expected. Patients with lumbar spine degeneration, physical or exercise therapy and high IPQ-R identity, consequences and chronic timeline scores had an increased risk to report more <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> activities than the expected range. Low IPQ-R identity, consequences and emotional representation scores and better mental health were associated with reporting less <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> activities than the expected range. ConclusionIllness perceptions and mental health modify the association between self-reported <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> activities and calculated <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> activities based on impairments in body structures and functions due to OA...|$|R

5|$|Intellectual Disability – Athletes with a {{significant}} impairment in intellectual functioning and associated <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> adaptive behaviour. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the disability group Intellectual Disability {{has been added to}} some Paralympic Games.

However, the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.|$|E

However, the province set out <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> the 407 ETR lease contract for maintaining traffic volumes to justify toll rates. Despite this, rates have increased annually against the requests of the provincial government, resulting in several court battles and the general public regarding the route as a luxury.|$|E
5|$|Adventure was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The aim {{was to create a}} more accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work was provided by the rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> the libretto, find the mood of the work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E

In 2008, she was also diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, a non-invasive type of breast cancer. She underwent a lumpectomy in December of the same year and has since been cancer-free.|$|E

5|$|The French Democracy {{is a short}} 2005 French {{political}} film made by Alex Chan using {{computer animation}} from Lionhead Studios' 2005 business simulation game The Movies. The plot centers on three Moroccan men who turn to rioting after facing different forms of discrimination. Chan, a French native of Chinese descent, created the film to convey his view that racism caused the riots of the 2005 civil unrest in France. Although Chan was restricted by shortcomings and technical <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> The Movies, he finished the film after four days of production.|$|E

It secures full Norwegian {{sovereignty}} over the archipelago, but contains several restrictions: peaceful {{use of the}} islands, the non-discrimination of citizens and companies of signatory countries, the obligation to protect the natural environment and <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> taxation. The treaty has 39 signatories.|$|E

5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks.

Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E

But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial <b>limitations</b> <b>in</b> the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap.|$|E
