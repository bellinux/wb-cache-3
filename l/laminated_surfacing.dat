Minor surface waviness occurred on the laminates exposed to the cyclic test, whereas, surface waviness, print through and DOI values were all significantly higher as the laminates absorbed larger quantities of moisture from the hygrothermal and hydrothermal tests. The water immersion test, which was the most detrimental to the surface finish of the painted laminates, produced dense blistering on the autoclave manufactured <b>laminate</b> <b>surface</b> whereas the out-of-autoclave <b>laminate</b> <b>surface</b> produced only a few.

In the present study, bond strengths for brackets bonded to composite <b>laminate</b> <b>surfaces</b> pre-treated with both diamond bur and microetcher lie approximately within this acceptable range, being higher than the former. However, significantly high bond strength between the adhesive resin and a restoration has disadvantages. Fracture or loss of the underlying restoration during debonding can occur.

The clinical situation was simulated by preparing standardized restorations in extracted human incisors.|$|R
30|$|The highest SSBS {{of metal}} {{brackets}} bonded on <b>laminate</b> <b>surfaces</b> treated with diamond bur {{could be attributed}} {{to the fact that the}} mechanical abrasive methods which increase mechanical interlocking are perhaps the most significant factor contributing to bond strength, increasing the surface roughness more than did etching with phosphoric acid, which subsequently improved the mechanical retention of the adhesives [5, 9, 18]. This can be explained by the formation of deep craters and streaks which are sufficient for micromechanical retention of orthodontic adhesives. Other studies have reported that sandblasting with alumina particles (microetcher) creates the highest bond strength for both repaired hybrid and nanofill resin composite [20, 29, 30]. On the other hand, orthophosphoric acid etching could not change surface topography of a nanofill composite resin. As phosphoric acid dissolves the inorganic component of the enamel prism, it does not affect the organic component. Consequently, one would not expect the phosphoric acid to have any effect on the composite surface except for enhanced cleaning of the composite resin surface [3 – 6, 20].|$|R

This forces operators to make blade repair a necessity, adding to the operation and maintenance costs of a project. A wind turbine’s tip speed can in some cases have an upper limit based on the erosion exhibited on the leading edge. This paper explores the variables of rainfall rate and impact velocity of the impinging droplets in an attempt to explore the recovery time of the tri-axial composite material used. It is shown that an increase in impact velocity results in a higher mass loss than an increase in the rainflow rate. Analysis using a scanning electron microscope reveals that pin holes in the <b>laminate</b> <b>surface</b> are exploited by the droplets, acting as initiation point for erosion of the composite.

The steps involved in the fabrication process were first using a piece of mirror with appropriate dimensions and then removing the paint coated on the backside until the mercury coating was exposed. Then, we covered a layer of plastic laminate on the mercury coating and the pattern in black and white printed on a paper, overlaid on the <b>laminate</b> <b>surface.</b> Ultraviolet (UV) exposure was used to polymerize the non-pattern area (resistant to acid) and then by means of nitric acid, the non-polymerized (pattern) area was removed (dissolved) and then the hydrofluoric acid was used to etch the pattern area. Cyclic submersion in hydrofluoric acid for a certain time can lead to a certain depth of etching. It should be mentioned that all the steps were taken under complete caution. A number of micromodel setups with homogeneous and heterogeneous flow patterns were built and used for experimental study of polymer injection. Figure  2 shows a homogenous flow pattern used for micromodel fabrication. The heterogeneous micromodels will be explained later on.|$|R
