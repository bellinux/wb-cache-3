40|$|The balloon {{catheters}} produced by Boston Scientific are manufactured using a <b>laser</b> <b>bonding</b> process. The behaviour {{of the materials}} during this laser welding process is not very well understood. In this work a computational model of this process was created which will help predict the behaviour of the materials during bonding and will increase understanding of the <b>laser</b> <b>bonding</b> process. The two parts being bonded are cylindrical and are both made of a thermoplastic polymer called PEBAXÂ®. During the bonding process, these cylindrical parts are surrounded by a heat-shrink tubing which applies a pressure to the PEBAXÂ® parts when heated. The heat and pressure cause the PEBAXÂ® to melt and flow. Modelling the heat-shrink tubing and the melt flow during the laser welding process are key aims of this work. A thermal model of the process was created by modelling the laser absorption and heat transfer through the assembly. This was compared with previous work and validated with experimental data. The PEBAXÂ® was modelled as a viscoelastic material which transitions from relatively rigid to very compliant as it passes its melting temperature. Extensive experimental testing was performed to characterise the heat-shrink tubing. The heat-shrink tubing was modelled using two shape memory models from the literature. These two models were implemented into Abaqus FEA using two user defined material subroutines (UMATs). A thermo-mechanical finite element model of the bonding process was then created in Abaqus FEA {{and the results were}} compared with experimental data. This model captures the overall behaviour of the materials during the bonding process, providing predictions of melt flow.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the <b>laser</b> <b>bonded</b> titanium coated glass/polyimide microjoints were studied in vivo by implanting on a rat brain surface for 10 days. In the current state, {{the strength of the}} joints were measured by a specially designed instrument called "pressure test" equipment where the samples were subjected to a variable pressure load (using high pressure nitrogen) controlled by a pressure regulator. The strength of the joints seems to degrade by about 28 % as a result of soaking in rat brain. The bond degradation in rat brain implants is similar compared with those soaked in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) solution. Polyimide uptakes water through existing pores in it and also water gets in the joint region through the edges of the samples. Water might have caused oxidation of the chemical bonds which are thought to have formed by the laser fabrication process.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} laser-assisted bonding methods for assembly of microfluidic devices and MEMS packaging. A laser microwelding technique for assembly of transparent polymer substrates for fabrication of microfluidic devices was studied. The transparent PMMA substrates were bonded together using a high power diode laser system with a broad top-hat beam profile and an intermediate titanium thin film consisting of 0. 7 mm diameter spots. A tensile strength of 6 MPa was achieved for this novel method which is {{comparable to that of}} the previous work in laser welding of polymers. It has been demonstrated that the method is capable of leak free encapsulation of a microfluidic channel. Furthermore, a novel laser-based method using an LCP film for packaging of MEMS, sensors and other microelectronic devices has been investigated. The results show {{that it is possible to}} use a laser based method with an LCP polymer for high quality substrate bonding applications. Glass-glass based cavities allow optical transmission and have potential applications for optical sensors and other photonic devices. For glass-glass bonding, it was shown that thin film titanium material can be used as an effective optical absorber in the laser based LCP bonding technique. <b>Laser</b> <b>bonding</b> of glass and silicon using an LCP film has also been achieved but in this case the silicon substrate acted as the absorber to capture the laser power. <b>Laser</b> <b>bonding</b> of a silicon cap to a molded LCP package has also been demonstrated successfully.

A polymer diffuser micro-pump shows a flow rate up to 50 mm 3 /min at a frequency of 180 Hz. ^ Finally, a micro-stamping process for rapid replication and mass production of micro-devices and systems is developed.
