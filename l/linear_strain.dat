One is the equation of rotation in the entire block and homogeneous, strain, {{and the other is}} the equation of rotation in the entire block and <b>linear</b> <b>strain.</b> Using the velocities of GPS sites located in the Western Region, Qinghai-Xizang and North China blocks, these {{two kinds of}} elastic motion equations and the rigid motion equation are tested statistically for their unbiasedness and validity to simulate the site velocities of the blocks. The results indicate that the equation with rotation in the entire block and <b>linear</b> <b>strain</b> is the optimal model to describe the block motion. Dividing the Chinese mainland into 10 blocks, the rotation and strain parameters of each block are estimated using the equation with rotation in the entire block and <b>linear</b> <b>strain,</b> and the velocities of GPS sites on the blocks.
