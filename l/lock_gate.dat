5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
25|$|Having the wickets in the gates, {{particularly}} if the gates are above the breast wall, means that the water pouring in could swamp some boats in the lock. Filling the lock through culverts eliminated that problem, as well as putting the <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> below the breast wall.|$|E
25|$|On {{some parts}} of the Montgomery Canal bottom paddles are used in place of side paddles. Rather than passing into the lock through a culvert {{around the side of the}} <b>lock</b> <b>gate,</b> the water flows through a culvert in the bottom of the canal. The paddle slides {{horizontally}} over the culvert.|$|E

25|$|The old port of Kilrush is {{now home}} to a 120 berth marina with <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> access to the Shannon Estuary and the Atlantic Ocean. An {{impressive}} walled garden {{on the grounds of}} the old Vandeleur estate can still be visited today, though Kilrush House was gutted by fire in the late 19th century and finally demolished in the 1970s due to safety hazard. It stood where the main central car park now stands.|$|E
25|$|On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, {{snubbing}} posts {{were used}} to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few miles an hour could destroy the <b>lock</b> <b>gate.</b> To prevent this, a rope was wound around the snubbing post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope 2½ inches (6.3cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.|$|E
500|$|These locks are {{staircase}} locks, whereby inner <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> pairs {{serve as}} both the upper gate and lower gate. [...] The gates are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable. As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic, this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks.|$|E

50|$|A notable {{feature of}} this canal was that all <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> were left open and the bed was left dry {{during the summer months}} when it was not in use. When a cargo was expected, a sluice was opened to allow water from the Venoge to enter the summit level, the <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> were closed and the canal filled.|$|R
50|$|The McCallum <b>Lock</b> <b>Gates</b> {{comprise}} a bridge over {{a set of}} <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> connecting East Beira Lake and the Colombo Harbour. Built between 1951 and 1956 by the Colombo Public Works Department to facilitate barge traffic between ships docked in the harbour and ports on the Kalani river. The bridge connected the Fort to the D.R. Wijewardena Mawatha.|$|R
500|$|The storm dropped {{precipitation}} {{amounts of}} [...] throughout northwestern Illinois, with {{a peak of}} [...] in Mount Carroll. Thus, Carla is the second-wettest tropical cyclone in Illinois, behind only Hurricane Audrey in 1957. Additionally, up to [...] fell in 24hours. Severe local flooding occurred, especially in the northern portions of the state. Heavy property and agricultural damage occurred. Streets and basements {{were reported to have}} flooded, while bridge approaches and a few small bridges were washed out. Precipitation of [...] in Chicago flooded about 60viaducts and 1,000basements. After the Chicago River rose , the <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> to Lake Michigan was opened to release excess water. However, the abrupt onrush of water resulted in about $75,000in damage to boats at Wilmette Harbor.|$|E
500|$|Patterson's yard {{within the}} harbour {{was used for}} the {{construction}} of many ships notably Brunel's [...] in 1838 and the [...] in 1843. They were some of the largest ships to have been built at the time, and ironically hastened the decline of the city docks by proving the feasibility of large ships. The SS Great Britain was to be towed away from her builders, to have her 1,000 hp engines and interior fitted out on the River Thames, but her [...] beam was too big to pass through the lock. Thus the SS Great Britain was moored in the Floating Harbour until December 1844, before proceeding into Cumberland Basin after coping stones and <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> platforms were removed from the Junction Lock. At one time there were dozens of Bristol shipyards, the largest in the harbour being Hilhouse, who became Charles Hill & Sons in 1845.|$|E
2500|$|To help boats leave (downstream) a lock, the locksman would {{sometimes}} open the paddles {{to create a}} swell, which would help [...] "flush" [...] the boat out of the lock. In one case, a boatsman asked for a back swell, that is, open and shut the paddles {{a few times to}} create some waves, to help him get off the bank where he was stuck. If boats ran aground (from being overloaded) they sometimes asked passing crews to tell the upstream lock to give them an extra heavy swell, which consisted of opening all the paddles on the <b>lock</b> <b>gate,</b> creating a surge that affected the whole pound below.|$|E

2500|$|Swaffham Bulbeck Lode {{joins the}} River Cam about [...] below Bottisham Lode. It runs for [...] to the hamlet of Commercial End, which was called Newnham {{until the early}} 19th century. Commercial End {{consists}} of a row of fine buildings, mainly dating from the late 17th and 18th century. The Commissioners of the Bedford Level {{were responsible for the}} drain during this period, and they cleared the channel and straightened the banks on several occasions in response to complaints. Use of the lode declined rapidly once the railways arrived in the area, and only the first [...] to Slade Farm are currently navigable, as shallow water and low bridges prevent access beyond this point. There is a lock at the junction with the River Cam which can accommodate boats up to , with a maximum draught of [...] However, the Environment Agency have modified the upstream <b>lock</b> <b>gate,</b> in order to improve flood control, with the result that the headroom below the guillotine gate is too low for boats to enter the lode. The lower gates have also been removed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} was operated {{from the}} top level. For a descent, the box was first wound into its upper position using a double rack-and-pinion mechanism, then drawn tightly against {{the frame of the}} opening using a ratchet mounted {{on the top of the}} wall. The outer door was then drawn up with another rack-and-pinion. At this point the water levels in the top pound and inside the box would have been roughly equal, but as the inner door [...] – the box door – swung outwards horizontally (like a normal single <b>lock</b> <b>gate)</b> it would not open if the outer level was to any extent higher. A small equalising cock was therefore provided. The door was opened, the boat was floated in, the doors closed and the ratchet released. Because the entering boat would displace its weight of water back into the pound, the total weight of the box was always the same and no great endeavour was needed to wind it up and down. However, the operators could release a little water into the box to assist the descent. Water pressure against the outward-opening doors kept them firmly closed and watertight.|$|E
