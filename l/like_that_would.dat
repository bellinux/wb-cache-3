500|$|He {{began the}} 1981 season with five {{consecutive}} 100-yard games, including a 253-yard effort. [...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> do if he ran {{as much as the}} guy on the West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch is going to be our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it." [...] His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.|$|E

500|$|Carl Sagan {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Contact in 1979. The same year, Lynda Obst, one of Sagan's closest friends, was hired by film producer Peter Guber to be a studio executive for his production company, Casablanca FilmWorks. She pitched Guber the idea for Contact, who commissioned a development deal. Sagan and Ann Druyan (who later became his wife) wrote a 100+ page film treatment, finishing in November 1980. Druyan explained, [...] "Carl's and my dream was to write {{something that would be}} a fictional representation of what contact would actually be <b>like,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> convey something of the true grandeur of the universe." [...] They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact.|$|E
500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair {{of us want to}} get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero and filmed in Los Angeles, California. Spears first contacted Piliero {{and asked him to}} put together a concept for the video. The main idea for Marrs Piliero came from the lyric [...] "be a little inappropriate", which stood out for him, but {{he did not want to}} make a video about sexual inappropriateness. Piliero wrote the opening press conference scene as a tribute to the film Half Baked (1998), which he is a fan of. He explained, [...] "That scene resonates with everyone as the epitome of the greatest way to quit your job, and just blow people off. [...] I felt <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> just be such a perfect way for her to tell the reporters to eff off." [...] Marrs Piliero first asked actor Kellan Lutz to co-star the clip with Spears; however, Lutz turned down the role, saying that [...] "there were a couple of weird things about the part that didn't make sense", including the scene where he was going to pour milk on himself. Piliero then thought of asking one of the stars of Half Baked, Guillermo Díaz, to be part of the video, explaining that it [...] "would make it come full circle." [...] Piliero watched all of Spears' videos and wanted to pull what he loved from them, but also give it something fresh. Piliero felt that all of her references to the paparazzi in her previous videos had been more of a statement than an action, and for [...] "I Wanna Go", he wanted her to have the opportunity to fight back.|$|E

Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people, because a movie <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E
500|$|When The Fabulous Baker Boys was {{released}} in 1989, the idea of Pfeiffer portraying a sex worker who becomes a singer immediately garnered attention from the media. Pfeiffer's performance of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] was used heavily to promote the film; the attention garnered by this particular musical sequence rivaled those of every other film released that year. Pfeiffer continued to generate significant press even after the studio was forced to remove The Fabulous Baker Boys from most theaters to which it had initially been released due to financial concerns. In 1990, Empire magazine published an article entitled [...] "The Fabulous Pfeiffer Girl" [...] in homage to the actress' role. Ultimately, Pfeiffer's performance garnered widespread acclaim from nearly every critic who reviewed the film. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin wrote that [...] "Pfeiffer is [...] unexpected... choice for this musical bombshell" [...] but ultimately admitted that she [...] "proves to be electrifyingly right." [...] According to Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "Pfeiffer does as much for this movie as her Susie does for the Baker boys' act", praising all of her musical performances. Referencing one of her character's lines in which Susie negatively compares the song [...] "Feelings" [...] to parsley, Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers insisted, [...] "Michelle Pfeiffer... is not parsley. Take her out of this movie, and the movie would evaporate." [...] Travers credits the actress with resurrecting the film during its final moments, opining, [...] "The bounce goes out of the movie until Pfeiffer returns to wrap things up", concluding, [...] "the Bridges brothers are a winning pair. But make no mistake: It's Michelle Pfeiffer who puts the 'fabulous' into Baker Boys." [...] Steve Simels of Entertainment Weekly agreed that Pfeiffer [...] "saves Baker Boys from cliché", going on to hail the actress as [...] "a marvel... so funny and vulnerable that she almost makes her indifferently written bad-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold into something three-dimensional and believable." [...] Vanity Fairs Katey Rich concurred: [...] "The film is ostensibly about the Baker (and Bridges) boys, but Pfeiffer stole the show" [...] by [...] "endow her lounge-singer character {{with a lot more}} soul and vulnerability than she needed to." [...] Contributing to The Morton Report, Chaz Lipp agreed that [...] "Pfeiffer feels absolutely authentic in the role... put just the right spin on her line readings to sidestep cliche at every turn", appreciating the actress for interpreting Susie as more than simply a stock character. Despite lamenting that the three main actors [...] "become less interesting" [...] {{towards the end of the}} film, TV Guide agreed that although [...] "the Bridges boys give typically solid performances, it's Pfeiffer who deserves the most credit". The Independents David Thomson was particularly impressed with Pfeiffer's singing, opining, [...] "Anyone who can sing <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be in Las Vegas, not holding together a piano act in the bars and clubs of Seattle". The Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum agreed, calling Pfeiffer [...] "a terrific singer." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} for George magazine, Westmoreland criticized the battlefield prowess of his direct opponent, North Vietnamese general Vo Nguyen Giap. [...] "Of course, he [...] was a formidable adversary", Westmoreland told correspondent W.

By his own admission, by early 1969, I think, he had lost, what, a half million soldiers? He reported this. Now such a disregard for human life may make a formidable adversary, {{but it does not}} make a military genius. An American commander losing men <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> hardly have lasted more than a few weeks."

[...] Mahan suggested that it be called [...] "Naismith ball", at which he laughed, saying that a name <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> kill any game. [...] Mahan then said, [...] "Why not call it basketball?" [...] Naismith replied, [...] "We have a basket and a ball, {{and it seems to me}} that would be a good name for it."

2500|$|The {{original}} book Laurents wrote closely {{adhered to}} Romeo and Juliet, but the characters based on Rosaline {{and the parents}} of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on. Later the scenes related to Juliet's faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted. Language posed a problem; four-letter curse words were uncommon in the theater at the time, and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened. Laurents ultimately invented what sounded like real street talk but actually was not: [...] "cut the frabba-jabba", for example. Sondheim converted long passages of dialogue, and sometimes just a simple phrase like [...] "A boy <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> kill your brother", into lyrics. With the help of Oscar Hammerstein, Laurents convinced Bernstein and Sondheim to move [...] "One Hand, One Heart", which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene, to the scene set in the bridal shop, and as a result [...] "Tonight" [...] was written to replace it. Laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the play's tragic outcome, so comic relief in the form of Officer Krupke was added to the second act. He was outvoted on other issues: he felt the lyrics to [...] "America" [...] and [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] were too witty for the characters singing them, but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites. Another song, [...] "Kid Stuff", was added and quickly removed during the Washington, D.C. tryout when Laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, the Board, {{including}} Florentino Pérez, relented, {{declaring that}} a [...] "man <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{always have a}} place in my club", adding that [...] "McManaman is in now in the team because his behaviour has been in accordance with the true values of the club". Johan Cruyff, meanwhile, described McManaman at the time as the most useful player in the Galácticos because he was [...] "everyone's best partner on the pitch". A further honour was also extended on the pitch by the club in the 2001–02 season, whereas part of Madrid's Centenary Celebrations, McManaman was made the first Englishman to captain Real Madrid in a game against a FIFA World XI, to the applause of the ultras, with whom he was a cult favourite. Arguably his second greatest moment in the white of Madrid also took place that year, in the 2002 UEFA Champions League semi-final against Barcelona at the Camp Nou on 23 April 2002. In this match of monumental proportions, due to El Clásico being a massive game in its own right, but also {{the fact that it was}} a Champions League semi-final, McManaman appeared as a second-half substitute to score a critical goal in second half injury time to secure a 2–0 first-leg advantage, chipping over goalkeeper Roberto Bonano after being played in by Flávio Conceição, after Zidane had scored the first goal on 55 minutes. This notable victory, Real's first at the Camp Nou since 1993, helped secure their place in the final of the 2002 Champions League at Hampden Park, Glasgow, where he came on as a replacement for Figo – and thereby ensuring his second Champions League winners' medal, after Madrid secured a 2–1 victory over German team Bayer Leverkusen.|$|E
