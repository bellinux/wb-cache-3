40|$|The {{small amount}} of viable seed that can be {{harvested}} from tropical <b>ley</b> <b>grasses</b> such as Chloris gayana, Setaria sphacelata and Panicum spp. {{is largely due to}} the wide range in maturity between different heads and in maturity between seeds in any head. Ripe seed is also liable to shed. Adequate and timely top dressing with nitrogen, close row width and careful choice of harvest date increased seed yield either directly or by synchronizing ripening. There was considerable variation within and between varieties in seed yield characteristics: heading date, head number and seed setting, which all displayed high heritability. Heading date and head number were closely correlated with vigour of regrowth. Varieties could well be improved simultaneously for seed and herbage productivity...|$|R

The grass is cultivated in the northern states, the grain in the middle states, and the cotton in the southern states. The grass is food for beasts, the grain is food for man, and the cotton is for clothing. These different kinds of cultivation are not indeed exclusive in the different districts.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 An {{estimated}} 99 % {{of native}} wet prairie {{has been lost}} in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, but a large number of seasonal wetlands remain on private lands dedicated to grass seed production within the historical wet prairie landscape. Because agriculture is known to alter physical and chemical wetland conditions, I investigated if aquatic invertebrate communities differed among annual <b>grass</b> seed <b>farmed</b> wetlands, perennial <b>grass</b> seed <b>farmed</b> wetlands, and native wet prairie. I sampled 30 southern Willamette Valley wetlands (n = 10 in each land use category) in spring of 2009 and resampled 28 in spring of 2010 that are hydrogeomorphically classified as Flats. Invertebrate community composition in native wet prairie differed from farmed wetlands (A-stats = 0. 37, P < 0. 001). Specifically, taxa richness (26. 2 ± 1. 2 in 2009 and 27. 4 ± 1. 0 in 2010) and diversity (3. 0 ± 0. 1 in 2009 and 3. 1 ± 0. 1 in 2010) were higher. From Indicator Species Analysis, taxa representative of wet prairie included a flightless beetle (Apteraliplus parvulus), a cladoceran (Dumontia oregonensis), an isopod (Caecidotea sp.), Calanoida copepods, and Lymnaeidae snails. Invertebrate density (individuals/m²) did not differ among land-use groups, but biomass (mg/m²) in perennial grass wetlands was greater than annual grass wetlands both years. Biomass in perennial <b>grass</b> <b>farmed</b> wetlands was also higher than native wet prairie in 2009 and similar in 2010. Wetland invertebrate composition was strongly associated with reduced vegetation cover and increases in water turbidity and conductivity with farmed sites having lower cover and higher turbidity and conductivity. These findings suggest <b>grass</b> seed <b>farming</b> practices such as soil tillage and field leveling have affects on invertebrate communities by lowering diversity and richness and altering community composition. However, farmed seasonal wetlands still provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates, contribute to the region's biodiversity, and are substantial food resources for wildlife. This grass seed agricultural landscape is an important seasonal wetland habitat and needs to be incorporated into regional conservation plans...|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} a meta-analysis of results from field trials with nitrogen application to leys which {{were carried out}} during 1997 - 2015. The analysis deals with the response to nitrogen fertilisation with respect to dry matter and crude protein content in the harvested biomass. The analysis shows that the yield level without any nitrogen application, and the response to nitrogen (kg dry matter/kg N applied), is greater in these trials compared to data from older trials. This applies to both pure <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> and mixed grass/clover leys. The crude protein content is positively correlated with nitrogen application in pure <b>grass</b> <b>leys.</b> In mixed grass/clover leys this response depends on clover content, but is generally negative in the last cut...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to investigate the optimal economic life cycle of <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> with winter damage problems in northern Norway and to determine the threshold of winter damage before it is profitable to re-seed. A two-level hierarchic Markov process has been constructed using the MLHMP software. The model takes uncertainty concerning yield potential, damage estimation and weather dependent random fluctuations into account. A Kalman filter technique is used for updating of knowledge on yield potential and damage level. The application of the model is demonstrated using data from two commercial Norwegian farms. Since parameter estimates vary considerably among farms, it is concluded that decision support concerning optimal economic life cycle of <b>grass</b> <b>leys</b> should be done at farm level. The results also show the importance of using a flexible dynamic replacement strategy. Use of the model for a specific farm situation is illustrated. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSelecting Manwan Dam as a study case, {{we studied}} the spatial-temporal change {{of land use}} during 1974, 1991 and 2004 based on the {{application}} of RS interpretation and GIS buffer analysis. Land use indices within three buffer distances from dam centre were calculated to quantify the effects of dam construction. The results showed that land use structure changed greatly during and after dam construction. Forestland and grassland were two main types of land use, which occupied over 79. 70 % of total area in 10000 m buffer. The main conversion of land use types took place from forest land to <b>grass</b> and <b>farm</b> land between 1974 and 1991, and that was almost consistent between 1991 and 2004. During 1974 - 1991, spatial dynamics of <b>grass,</b> <b>farm</b> and construction land were much larger than water body and forest land, and had an increasing tendency and the balanced state decreased with the increased off-dam distances which indicated that conversion of input and output were frequently between the three land use types. During 1991 - 2004, water body had the largest value of Rss, {{in a state of}} extreme non-balanced with its Ps reached 0. 96, 0. 96 and 0. 99 in 10000, 5000 and 1000 m buffer, respectively. Further studies showed that direct effect was limited in the 1000 m buffer region based on the land use indices including temporal dynamics of land use change (Rs), spatial dynamics of land use change (Rss,) and tendency and state index (Ps).

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess the {{potential}} radioactive contamination of fodder in the case of accidental radionuclide fallout, and to analyse the relationship between interception and retention of radionuclides as a function of biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI). The interception and the retention of wet deposited 134 Cs and 85 Sr in ley (a mixture of grass and clover) were measured after artificial wet deposition in a field train in Uppsala (eastern central Sweden). The field trial had a randomised block design with three replicates. 134 Cs and 85 Sr were deposited at six different growth stages during two growing seasons (20101 and 2011) using a rainfall simulator. The biomass was sampled in the centre of each parcel 2 to 3 h after deposition and at later growth stages (1 to 5) during the growing season. The above ground biomass and LAI were measured as well. The interception of radionuclides by the ley was largest at the late growth stages; the spike and tassel/flowering (code 5 : 6) in the 1 st year, and at flowering/initial flowering (code 6 : 5) in the 2 nd year. There was a correlation between radionuclide interception and above ground biomass, as well with LAI, for both radionuclides in both years. The highest activity concentrations of both radionuclides were measured after deposition at the late growth stages and were found to be higher in the 2 nd year. There weathering half-lives were shorter at the earlier growth stages than at the later growth stages for both radionuclides. For the magnitude of deposition chosen in our experiment, it can be concluded that the above ground biomass is a good predictor and the LAI a more uncertain predictor of the interception of radiocaesium and radiostrontium by <b>ley</b> <b>grass</b> and clover. ...|$|R
