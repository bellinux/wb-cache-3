40|$|Summary: A {{new device}} for the {{endovascular}} treatment of aneurysms is described. It {{consists of a}} guidewire-directed porous <b>liner</b> or <b>bag,</b> detachably mounted on a microcath-eter and designed to be inserted into an aneurysm and {{to be filled with}} detachable coils or other embolic agents. Sev-eral prototypes have been made. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated its behavior in rel-atively wide-necked aneurysms. Since the introduction of controlled detachment coils, such as the Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC, Target Therapeutics, Fremont, CA) (1, 2), increas-ing numbers of patients with ruptured and unrup-tured intracranial aneurysms are being treated (3 – 5). Initial results have been so encouraging that a prospective multicenter trial randomizing patients with surgically accessible aneurysms is now under way (the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial). There are, however, recognized complica-tions in the use of detachable coils, including thromboembolism, inadvertent occlusion of the an-eurysm-bearing artery, and early and delayed rup-ture of coil-treated aneurysms (5, 6). Some of these problems are due to the tendency of coils to pro-lapse out of wide-necked aneurysms and the ab-sence of evidence, in humans, of endothelialization across the necks of coil-treated aneurysms (7). Ab-sence of endothelialization has also been reported in a coil-treated rabbit aneurysm model (8). Indeed, in this model, large open spaces without signs of thrombosis were found between the loops of the coil baskets in several aneurysms regardless of the observation period. In aneurysm models in pigs (7), dogs (9), and primates (10), however, endothe-lialization across the necks of coil-treated aneu-rysms has been observed.

40|$|AbstractPostharvest {{insect pests}} {{threaten}} the nutritional and financial security of smallholder {{farmers in the}} developing world. Hermetic storage, a technology that protects grain against insects by blocking their supply of oxygen, alleviates the problem of insect-caused losses. PICS (Purdue Improved Crop Storage) bags represent one hermetic technology that improves food availability and incomes of farmers. The polyethylene <b>liners</b> of PICS <b>bags</b> are sometime damaged during use, acquiring small holes or tears. Observations in the laboratory and field suggest that insect development remains localized around {{the point where the}} bag is damaged. We hypothesized that the grain within a hermetic container that has minimal localized damage (such as an insect hole), helps retard leakage of oxygen into the bag and contributes to limiting insect damage and to the overall protective effect. To test this hypothesis, we filled 4  cm dia. by 10  cm long PVC pipes with Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) infested cowpeas and sealed them with caps having a single, insect-sized hole in its center. A vertical tube positioned above the cowpea-filled PVC pipe was filled with one of three different grains (sesame, sorghum, and maize) to different depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 50  cm). Seed size and grain barrier depth significantly reduced the level of bruchid damage to the stored cowpea in the PVC container. Smaller sized grains used for the barriers retarded insect development more effectively than larger sized grains, while deeper grain depth was more effective than shallower barriers. The grain held in a hermetic container contributes in a small, but significant, way to the effectiveness of the containers...|$|R

Such huts exist at many different heights, including in the high mountains themselves - in extremely remote areas, more rudimentary shelters may exist. The mountain huts are of varying size and quality, but each is typically centred on a communal dining room and have dormitories equipped with mattresses, blankets or duvets, and pillows; guests are expected to bring and {{to use their own}} sleeping <b>bag</b> <b>liner.</b> The facilities are usually rudimentary but, given their locations, huts offer vital shelter, make routes more widely accessible (by allowing journeys to be broken and reducing the weight of equipment needing to be carried), and offer good value. In Europe, all huts are staffed during the summer (mid-June to mid-September) and some are staffed in the spring (mid-March to mid-May). Elsewhere, huts may also be open in the fall. Huts also may have a part that is always open, but unmanned, a so-called winter hut. When open and manned, the huts are generally run by full-time employees, but some are staffed on a voluntary basis by members of Alpine clubs (such as Swiss Alpine Club and Club alpin français) or in North America by Alpine Club of Canada. The manager of the hut, termed a guardian or warden in Europe, will usually also sell refreshments and meals; both to those visiting only for the day and to those staying overnight. The offering is surprisingly wide; given that most supplies, often including fresh water, must be flown in by helicopter, and may include glucose-based snacks (such as Mars and Snickers bars) on which climbers and walkers wish to stock up, cakes and pastries made at the hut, a variety of hot and cold drinks (including beer and wine), and high carbohydrate dinners in the evenings. Not all huts offer a catered service, though, and visitors may need to provide for themselves. Some huts offer facilities for both, enabling visitors wishing to keep costs down to bring their own food and cooking equipment and to cater using the facilities provided. Booking for overnight stays at huts is deemed obligatory, and in many cases is essential as some popular huts; even with more than 100 bed spaces may be full during good weather and at weekends. Once made, the cancellation of a reservation is advised as a matter of courtesy - and, indeed, potentially of safety, as many huts keep a record of where climbers and walkers state they planned to walk to next. Most huts may be contacted by telephone and most take credit cards as a means of payment.In the UK the term Hut is used for any cottage or cabin used as a base for walkers or climbers and these are mostly owned by mountaineering clubs for use by members or visiting clubs and generally do not have wardens or permanent staff, but have cooking and washing facilities and heating. In the Scottish Highlands small simple unmanned shelters without cooking facilities known as Bothies are maintained to break up cross country long routes and act as base camps to certain mountains.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{document}} is to identify and describe strategies for the engineering control of worker exposure during the production or use of engineered nanomaterials. Engineered nanomaterials are materials that are intentionally produced and {{have at least one}} primary dimension less than 100 nanometers (nm). Nanomaterials may have properties different from those of larger particles of the same material, making them unique and desirable for specific product applications. The consumer products market currently has more than 1, 000 nanomaterial-containing products including makeup, sunscreen, food storage products, appliances, clothing, electronics, computers, sporting goods, and coatings. As more nanomaterials are introduced into the workplace and nano-enabled products enter the market, it is essential that producers and users of engineered nanomaterials ensure a safe and healthy work environment. The toxicity of nanoparticles may be affected by different physicochemical properties, including size, shape, chemistry, surface properties, agglomeration, biopersistence, solubility, and charge, as well as effects from attached functional groups and crystalline structure. The greater surface-area-to-mass ratio of nanoparticles makes them generally more reactive than their macro-sized counterparts. These properties are the same ones that make nanomaterials unique and valuable in manufacturing many products. Though human health effects from exposure have not been reported, a number of laboratory animal studies have been conducted. Pulmonary inflammation has been observed in animals exposed to nano-sized TiO 2 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Other studies have shown that nanoparticles can translocate to the circulatory system and to the brain causing oxidative stress. Of concern is the finding that certain types of CNTs have shown toxicological response similar to asbestos in mice. These animal study results are examples, and further toxicological studies need to be conducted to establish the potential health effects to humans from acute and chronic exposure to nanomaterials. Currently, there are no established regulatory occupational exposure limits (OELs) for nanomaterials in the United States; however, other countries have established standards for some nanomaterials, and some companies have supplied OELs for their products. In 2011, NIOSH issued a recommended exposure limit (REL) for ultrafine (nano) titanium dioxide and a draft REL for carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers. Because of the lack of regulatory standards and formal recommendations for many nanomaterials in the United States, {{it is difficult to determine}} or even estimate a safe exposure level. Many of the basic methods of producing nanomaterials occur in an enclosure or reactor, which may be operated under positive pressure. Exposure can occur due to leakage from the reactor or when a worker 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s activities involve direct manipulation of nanomaterials. Batchtype processes involved in the production of nanomaterials include operating reactors, mixing, drying, and thermal treatment. Exposure-causing activities at production plants and laboratories employing nanomaterials include harvesting (e. g., scraping materials out of reactors), bagging, packaging, and reactor cleaning. Downstream activities that may release nanomaterials include bag dumping, manual transfer between processes, mixing or compounding, powder sifting, and machining of parts that contain nanomaterials. Hazards involved in manufacturing and processing nanomaterials should be managed as part of a comprehensive occupational safety, health, and environmental management plan. Preliminary hazard assessments (PHAs) are frequently conducted as initial risk assessments to determine whether more sophisticated analytical methods are needed. PHAs are important so that the need for control measures is realized, and the means for risk mitigation can be designed to be part of the operation during the planning stage. Engineering controls protect workers by removing hazardous conditions or placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard, and, with good safe handling techniques, they are likely to be the most effective control strategy for nanomaterials. The identification and adoption of control technologies that have been shown effective in other industries are important first steps in reducing worker exposures to engineered nanoparticles. Properly designing, using, and evaluating the effectiveness of these controls is a key component in a comprehensive health and safety program. Potential exposure control approaches for commonly used processes include commercial technologies, such as a laboratory fume hood, or techniques adopted from the pharmaceutical industry, such as continuous <b>liner</b> product <b>bagging</b> systems. The assessment of control effectiveness is essential for verifying that the exposure goals of the facility have been successfully met. Essential control evaluation tools include time-tested techniques, such as airflow visualization and measurement, as well as quantitative containment test methods, including tracer gas testing. Further methods, such as video exposure monitoring, provide information on critical task-based exposures, which will help to identify high-exposure activities and help provide the basis for interventions.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Postharvest berry {{split and}} abscission are {{prevailing}} physiological disorders that negatively {{impact on the}} quality of table grapes exported from South Africa. Inferior grape quality due to these disorders results in a considerable decline in consumer confidence in the branded product, which leads to a drop in demand, and consequently, lower prices. Since information concerning postharvest factors influencing postharvest berry split and abscission is limited, the search for reliable methods to adequately control these problems remains elusive. In an attempt to obtain the required information, the influence of harvest temperature, harvest maturity, perforated liners, field heat removal prior to packing, delay periods before and after packing, storage duration and the elevation of storage temperature on the development of berry split and abscission in 'Thompson Seedless' (Vitis vinifera Linnaeus) table grapes was investigated. Changes in abscission related factors during berry development, and the influence of pre-and postharvest ethylene inhibitors on the development of berry abscission in 'Waltham Cross' table grapes, was also studied. Berry split was aggravated by packing 'Thompson Seedless' grapes at high pulp temperatures of approximately 30 °C, especially if the grapes were packed in non-perforated bags. The incidence of berry split could be reduced by between 80 and 90 % by packing grapes in perforated instead of non-perforated <b>liners.</b> Perforated <b>bags</b> also reduced levels of S 02 damage. However, due to significantly more moisture loss from grapes in perforated bags, compared to non-perforated bags, the risk of higher fruit and stem desiccation and softer berries existed. Optimum size and density of perforations needs to be determined to reduce berry split without excessive loss of moisture from the grapes, and S 02 gas from the air space surrounding the product. The influence of harvest temperature and liner type on berry abscission was not conclusive. Advanced maturity increased grape resistance to berry split. However, grapes harvested too mature were prone to stem desiccation and the development of Botrytis decay. The occurrence of berry abscission also appeared to increase with advanced harvest maturity. Consequently, to ensure optimal post-storage quality, 'Thompson Seedless' grapes should be harvested as soon as horticultural maturity has been reached, which appears to be at approximately 18 °Brix. Field heat removal for 1. 5 hours at 19 °C prior to packing had no beneficial or adverse effect on berry split and abscission. Delay periods prior to packing aggravated berry abscission, but did not influence berry split significantly. Grapes delayed for 12 hours showed a significant increase in berry abscission and Botrytis decay, compared to grapes delayed for only 3 or 8 hours. Considering that the absence of fungal decay is the most important quality prerequisite in table grapes, it is of vital importance to pack grapes with as short a delay period as possible. Grapes packed in non-perforated liners and delayed for different durations after packing, before the onset of forced-air cooling (FAC), showed significant differences regarding the incidence of berry split. Grapes delayed for 18 hours had significantly higher levels of berry split directly after the delay period, compared to grapes delayed for 6 or 12 hours. No significant difference in berry abscission occurred between grapes delayed for different periods. To minimise the amount of berry split, FAC should be applied as rapidly as possible after the packing of grapes in non-perforated liners. Two storage related factors significantly influenced the incidence of berry split in 'Thompson Seedless' grapes during cold storage significantly, viz. the duration of storage at -O. soC,and the increase in temperature after low temperature storage. Berry split increased almost linearly with prolonged storage at -O. soC. An elevation of storage temperature from -O. soC to 10 °C any time during the cold storage period, further aggravated the split problem. Consequently, the reduction of berry split in 'Thompson Seedless' table grapes during cold storage requires (a) the shortest possible cold storage period, and (b) good temperature management throughout distribution, from initiation of cooling until the final point of sale. The grape berry abscission potential, as quantitatively indexed by the measurement of the fruit removal force (FRF), showed significant changes during berry development of 'Waltham Cross' table grapes, from 27 to 111 days after full bloom (OAFB). This showed that at certain stages of fruit growth, 'Waltham Cross' grapes are more prone to berry abscission. At 27 OAFB, when the berries had an average diameter of 6. 6 mm, the grape bunches showed a significantly higher potential for berry abscission, compared to grapes sampled at a later stage. 'Waltham Cross' has inherently straggly bunches with bare shoulders. Therefore, any abscission during berry development will aggravate the problem. Consequently, it is of vital importance that any adverse factors such as moisture stress be avoided, especially during the period when 'Waltham Cross' grapes appear to be very susceptible to berry abscission. Of all parameters measured, moisture loss showed the best correlation with abscission. Grapes harvested with total soluble solids (TSS) of 12. 3 °Brix, 83 OAFB, had a significantly higher abscission potential than grapes harvested more mature. Therefore, by harvesting 'Waltham Cross' grapes at optimum maturity, at a TSS of approximately 16. 4 °Brix, berry abscission can be reduced to a great extent. It was evident that at veraison, the metabolism of grape berries changes drastically, and additional to the rapid increase in sugars and the rapid decrease in acidity, a decrease in FRF occurs. Preharvest sprays of ReTain™ (a derivative of aminoethoxyvinylglycine), which inhibits ethylene synthesis, showed no promise as a means to reduce postharvest berry abscission. A postharvest treatment with EthylBloc® (1 -methylcyclopropene), which inhibits ethylene action, only reduced berry abscission during one season. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die fisiologiese defekte korrelbars en los korrels wat algemeen voorkom tydens opberging van sekere tafeldruif-kultivars, het 'n negatiewe invloed op tafeldruiwe wat uitgevoer word vanaf Suid-Afrika. Minderwaardige kwaliteit as gevolg van hierdie defekte het 'n aansienlike afname in verbruikers-vertroue tot gevolg wat aanleiding gee tot 'n ooreenkomstige afname in aanvraag en prys van die produk. Inligting rakende na-oes faktore wat die voorkoms van korrelbars en los korrels beïnvloed is beperk, en geen gewaarborgde metode bestaan om hierdie twee defekte volkome te beheer nie. In 'n poging om dié gewenste inligting te bekom, is ondersoek ingestel na die effek van oes-temperatuur, oes-rypheid, geperforeerde sakke, veldhitte verwydering voor verpakking, vertragingsperiodes voor en na verpakking, tydsduur van opberging, en die verhoging van die opbergingstemperatuur, op die voorkoms van korrelbars en los korrels by 'Thompson Seedless' (Vitis vinifera Linnaeus) druiwe. Daar is ook ondersoek ingestel na veranderings in afsnoering verwante faktore tydens korrel-ontwikkeling, en die invloed van vooren na-oes toedienings van etileen inhibeerders op die ontwikkeling van los korrels by 'Waltham Cross'tafeldruiwe. Korrelbars is vererger deur 'Thompson Seedless' met hoë pulptemperature van ongeveer 29. 5 °C te verpak, veral indien dit in 'n riie-geperforeerde sak verpak is. Die voorkoms van korrelbars kon tussen 80 en 90 % verminder word deur 'Thompson Seedless' druiwe in geperforeerde sakke te verpak, in plaas van nie-geperforeerde sakke. Geperforeerde sakke het ook S 02 skade op die druiwe verminder. Tog, as gevolg van betekenisvol meer vogverlies vanaf druiwe in geperforeerde sakke as vanaf druiwe in nie-geperforeerde sakke, bestaan die risiko van meer stingel-uitdroging en minder ferm korrels indien druiwe in geperforeerde sakke verpak word. Optimale grootte en digtheid van perforasies moet bepaal word om korrelbars te verminder, maar sonder oormatige vogverlies vanaf die druiwe en oormatige verlies aan S 02. Die invloed van oes-temperatuur en sak-tipe op los korrels was nie oortuigend nie. Gevorderde oes-rypheid het die druif se weerstand teen korrelbars verhoog. Daarteenoor was druiwe wat té ryp geoes is, meer gevoelig vir stingel-uitdroging en Botrytis bederf. Dit wilook voorkom of die voorkoms van los korrels toeneem met gevorderde rypheid. Dus, om optimum kwaliteit na opberging te verseker, moet 'Thompson Seedless' geoes word sodra hortologiese rypheid bereik word, wat blyk om by 'n totale opgeloste vaste stof-inhoud (TOVS) van ongeveer 18 °Brix te wees. Veldhitte verwydering voor verpakking, vir 1. 5 uur by 19 °C, het geen effek gehad op die voorkoms van korrelbars en los korrels nie. 'n Vertragingsperiode voor verpakking het die los korrel-probleem vererger, alhoewel dit geen betekenisvolle invloed op die voorkoms van korrelbars gehad het nie. Druiwe wat vir 12 uur voor verpakking vertraag is, het betekenisvol meer los korrels en Botrytis bederf getoon, in vergelyking met druiwe wat slegs 'n vertragingsperiode van 3 of 8 uur ondergaan het. Aangesien die afwesigheid van bederf die belangrikste kwaliteits-vereiste vir tafeldruiwe is, is dit van kardinale belang om druiwe so gou as moontlik na oes te verpak. Druiwe, verpak in nie-geperforeerde sakke, wat vir verskillende periodes vertraag is voor geforseerde-lug verkoeling, het betekenisvolle verskille getoon betreffende die voorkoms van korrelbars. Druiwe vertraag vir 18 ure voor verkoeling, het betekenisvol meer korrelbars getoon, soos gemeet onmiddellik na die vertragingsperiode, in vergelyking met druiwe wat slegs vir 6 of 12 ure vertraag was. Geen betekenisvolle verskille in los korrels het voorgekom tussen druiwe wat verskillende vertragingsperiodes ondergaan het nie. Om korrelbars te verminder, moet geforseerde-lug verkoeling so gou as moontlik na verpakking van druiwe in nie-geperforeerde sakke toegepas word. Twee opbergings-verwante faktore beïnvloed die voorkoms van korrelbars by 'Thompson Seedless' druiwe tydens koelopberging, naamlik die tydsduur van opberging by -O. soC,asook 'n styging in temperatuur vanaf -O. soC tot 1 DoC. Korrelbars het feitlik liniêr toegeneem met verlengde opberging by -O. soC. 'n Styging in temperatuur vanaf -O. SoCtot 1 DoCop enige tydstip gedurende die koelopbergingsperiode, het korrelbars verder vererger. Dus, om korrelbars by 'Thompson Seedless' tydens opberging tot die minimum te beperk, moet die tydsduur van opberging so kort as moontlik wees, en moet die koue ketting regdeur die distribusie-proses gehandhaaf word, vanaf inisiëring van verkoeling tot en met die uiteindelike verkoop van die produk. Die afsnoerings-potensiaal van druiwe, soos kwantitatief geïndekseer is deur meting van die vrug-verwyderings-vermoë (VVV), het betekenisvol verander gedurende korrel-ontwikkeling van 'Waltham Cross' tafeldruiwe, vanaf 27 tot 111 dae na volblom (DNVB). Dit het getoon dat 'Waltham Cross' druiwe by sekere stadiums van vrug-groei meer gevoelig is vir korrel afsnoering. By 27 DNVB, wanneer die korrels 'n gemiddelde deursnee van 6. 6 mm gehad het, het die druiwe 'n betekenisvolle hoër potensiaal vir afsnoering getoon, in vergelyking met druiwe wat op 'n latere stadium getoets is. 'Waltham Cross' is inherent geneig tot yl trosse met kaal skouers, gevolglik sal enige afsnoering tydens korrel-ontwikkeling die probleem vererger. Dus is dit van kardinale belang dat enige nadelige faktor, soos byvoorbeeld vogstres, vermy moet word, veral gedurende periodes wanneer dit wil voorkom of 'Waltham Cross' baie vatbaar is vir korrel afsnoering. Van al die parameters wat gemeet is, het vogverlies die beste korrelasie met korrel afsnoering getoon. Druiwe wat 83 DNVB, by 'n TOVS van 12. 3 °Brix geoes is, het 'n betekenisvol hoër potensiaal vir korrel afsnoering getoon, in vergelyking met druiwe wat ryper geoes is. Dus, deur 'Waltham Cross' druiwe by optimum rypheid te oes, by 'n TOVS van ongeveer 16. 4 °Brix, kan korrelbars in 'n groot mate verminder word. Tydens verelson, wanneer die metabolisme van die druiwe drasties verander, was daar gepaardgaande met die drastiese toename in TOVS en die drastiese afname in totale titreerbare sure (TSS), ook 'n afname in Voor-oes bespuitings met ReTain™, wat etileen sintese inhibeer, het geen potensiaal getoon om los korrels by 'Waltham Cross' te verminder nie. 'n Na-oes behandeling met EthyIBloc®, wat etileen werking inhibeer, het slegs korrel afsnoering in een van die seisoene effens verminder...|$|R
