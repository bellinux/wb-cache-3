40|$|Brazil’s rise was a {{globally}} acclaimed {{phenomenon that}} took place under two consecutive administrations: Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995 - 2002) and Lula (2003 - 2010). Under Dilma Rousseff (2011 - 2016), though, Brazil’s foreign activism declined dramatically and its international visibility <b>lost</b> <b>luster.</b> This was due {{to a combination of}} domestic and systemic factors. This paper identifies these factors and gauges their influence in order to answer a main question: is there anyone to blame or was Brazil’s international rollback bound to happen?info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
50|$|Though Jha {{managed to}} restore {{some of the}} <b>lost</b> <b>luster</b> to Motorola Mobility, it still {{struggled}} against Samsung and Apple. Even among Android manufacturers, Motorola had dropped behind Samsung, HTC, and LG in market share by {{the second quarter of}} 2011. This may have been due to the delay in releasing 4G LTE-capable devices, as well as setting the prices of its new products too high. Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside as CEO by May 2012, when the Google acquisition was complete.|$|R

50|$|Van Cortlandt Manor {{became an}} {{essential}} {{stop on the}} route from New York to Albany {{in the years that}} followed the war. The mills were once again thriving and provided the community and travelers with food, supplies, and lodging. Pierre and his wife did not return until 1803 once the manor was in full working order again. The manor was passed down in the family until it was sold to a non-relative, Otis Taylor, in 1945. By this time the property had <b>lost</b> <b>luster,</b> and was not the flourishing estate it has once been.

50|$|Historical objects can {{be cleaned}} using {{a mixture of}} 70% ethanol and 30% weak ammonia water (1%). To remove the surface layer that has <b>lost</b> <b>luster</b> you can use 3-5% EDTA, after that step rinse with {{distilled}} water, and then with 80% ethanol, then with 90% ethanol, and finally with pure ethanol.Do not use ultrasound.Archaeological finds must be treated as soon as possible, preferably after excavation, you can clean them only mechanically, then consolidate with 2% Paraloid B 72, {{in the case of}} dry findings (first saturate with solvent in which it is dissolved), in case of damp or wet findings use Rhoplex WS 24 (acrylic dispersion).Somewhat More recent Russian literature recommends use of bleached beeswax dissolved in white spirit or medical benzine as protective coating. Fish glue mixed with water and alcohol (7/3), with addition of 1% katamine AB as biocide can be used as glue. Nonionogenic detergent 2-3% in a mixture of water and alcohol can be used for cleaning.Avoid prolonged contact with water, sudden changes in temperature and relative humidity, including strong light or contact with acidic or alkaline solutions (soap water too).|$|R
50|$|Sometime after 1250 AD, one {{branch of}} Gaurs {{established}} kingdoms at Chandra, Maholi and Katesar in Sitapur in present Uttar Pradesh. A daughter of Chandra House of Gaurs {{was married to}} Rao Gopal Singh, the Katehria chieftain of Nahil.

Legend goes that Pawayan was established originally from east of Nahil or formed the Poorvaiyan chowk. Poorvaiyan over passage of time got distorted to Pawayan or Powayan.

50|$|The gown was {{assembled}} from {{panels of}} chiffon {{that had been}} embroidered and embellished by Delhi and Agra craftsmen using the zardozi (gold wire weaving) method.

Over time, the metal thread in the dress has tarnished but the beetle wings have not <b>lost</b> their <b>luster.</b>|$|R
50|$|The body of each {{star was}} made of {{stainless}} steel and covered with copper plating. The Kremlin stars were decorated with a hammer and sickle on both sides, made of semi-precious stones from the Ural mountains. The installation of the first Kremlin stars {{did not meet the}} designer's expectations since the surfaces of the semi-precious stones <b>lost</b> their <b>luster</b> and required re-faceting. In 1937, these stars were replaced with new ones made of ruby glass, in time for the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution. One more star was also installed on the Vodovzvodnaya tower.|$|R
50|$|The show owed {{its success}} to its {{creative}} staff who never ceased {{to think of}} ways to make it interesting to audiences. Although there were claims that Sis has <b>lost</b> its <b>luster</b> following Homeboys critical and commercial acclaim, {{all of it was}} put into rest following the latter shows cancellation. Other shows that Sis faced stiff competition from ABS-CBN were Boy & Kris featuring the Philippines king of talk Boy Abunda (from HomeBoy) and Kris Aquino (2007-2009) and Ruffa and Ai (February-October 2009) hosted by Ruffa Gutierrez and Ai Ai delas Alas.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{then turns}} its {{attention}} to {{the man behind the}} legacy, former Mount Saint Charles Academy rink manager turned coach, Bill Belisle. At that time Mount, a perennial contender for the state title had <b>lost</b> its <b>luster,</b> but with Belisle's tough grit and hard nosed approach their legacy began. [...] "It was said he knew how to fix the Zamboni, the soda machines, and the team."

5000|$|Paul Thompson of Pitchfork Media said: [...] "Tao of the Dead does feel, in its {{songs and}} {{structure}} alike, {{like the first}} post-Source Tags record not cooled in the giant shadow of their decade-old triumph; more patient, more potent, more dynamic, less overloaded..." [...] NME gave it a score of seven out of ten and said of the songs, [...] "Sounding as vital as they ever have seven LPs down the track, there's life in them yet." [...] American Songwriter gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and stated: [...] "There's plenty more on Tao of the Dead that works. After years {{out in the cold}} as music critic whipping posts, this should {{go a long way toward}} reclaiming some <b>lost</b> <b>luster</b> for Trail of Dead." [...] Consequence of Sound also gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and stated, [...] "It's important to have moments like this in a concept album that's meant to be taken as one massive 52-minute expression; doing so gives the listener a break and focuses on momentary satisfactions in order to properly digest this cornucopia of solid rock goodness." [...] Filter gave it a score of 70% and stated that [...] "while bombastic and ambitious as ever, Tao suggests that Trail of Dead have once again lost the taste for subtlety and texture that’s past served to elevate their sound from the prog pack." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{continued}} for another nine months with Todd Baechle on bass and Ben Armstrong on drums. They toured the East Coast, but Oberst {{began to feel}} penned in by the band. [...] "It <b>lost</b> its <b>luster</b> and I got {{fed up with the}} big 'emo music' craze. We got tagged as an emo band right off the bat. A lot of cool bands were playing that style of music, then a huge number of bands started tagging along, and suddenly everyone was getting thrown in the emo category. These days, I think of emo as a negative term." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1944, {{propaganda}} endeavoured to {{warn the}} Japanese people of disasters to come, and install in them a spirit as in Saipan, to accept more privation for the war. [...] Articles were written claiming the Americans could not stage air-raids from Saipan, although since they could from China, they clearly could from Saipan; {{the purpose was to}} subtly warn of the dangers to come. [...] The actual bombing raids brought new meaning to the slogan [...] "We are all equal." [...] Early songs proclaiming that the cities had iron defenses and it was an honor to defend the homeland quickly <b>lost</b> their <b>luster.</b> [...] Still, continued calls to sacrifice were honored; neighborhood association helped, as no one wanted to be seen quitting first.|$|R
5|$|This rivalry <b>lost</b> some <b>luster</b> {{when the}} Georgia Tech Athletics {{discarded}} its {{membership in the}} Southeastern Conference in 1963 to become an independent institute. However, the Yellow Jackets continued their annual series of football games with the Auburn Tigers through 1987, and with the University of Georgia though the present day. Georgia Tech and Auburn play football games in occasional years, and games in other sports regularly. Even though the Yellow Jackets have joined the Atlantic Coast Conference for all sports in recent decades, from a historical perspective, the Auburn Tigers are Georgia Tech's second-highest sports rivalry, behind only the Georgia Bulldogs. Georgia Tech trails Auburn in the all-time series 41-47-4, but beat Auburn at Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium in 2003 and in Auburn to open the 2005 season.|$|R
5000|$|That same year, {{the show}} {{introduced}} new faces {{to join the}} growing [...] "MTB" [...] family. The quintet Power Boys, the dance group G-Girls, morning traffic angel Pia Guanio and upcoming teen star Maoui David were among those that joined in the fun and that time, Christine Jacob-Sandejas left the show to focus on her family. During the 4th anniversary of the show on November 2002, the show underwent a major revamp with new game portions and some established ABS-CBN stars (Judy Ann Santos, Edu Manzano, Ryan Agoncillo) co-hosting on a weekly basis. By this time, the show had <b>lost</b> its <b>luster</b> in the ratings game to [...] "Eat Bulaga" [...] following the rising popularity of the reality portion [...] "Sige Ano Kaya Mo?" [...] and creating new sensations out of the Sexbomb Dancers.|$|R
