50|$|Although the ECG {{findings}} of Brugada syndrome were first reported among survivors of cardiac arrest in 1989, {{it was only}} in 1992 that the Brugada brothers recognized it as a distinct clinical entity, causing sudden death by causing ventricular fibrillation (a potentially <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia)</b> in the heart.|$|E
50|$|As E-4031 can {{prolong the}} QT-interval, {{it can cause}} <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{management}} {{and treatment of}} patients with LQT 3 differs from those with LQT 1 and LQT 2 due to the differences in pathophysiology. Consequently, anesthetic management of patients with LQT 3 for preventing <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> is also quite different. Unlike LQT 1 and LQT 2, bradycardia is a risk factor of TdP in LQT 3 cases, and β-blockers are not very effective in preventing <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> [1, 2]. Instead, several {{studies have shown that}} mexiletine or flecainide, Na+ channel blockers, significantly shorten the QTc interval [7, 8]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with LQT 3 are more likely to experience <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> than patients with LQT 1 and LQT 2, and the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) is recommended [9, 10]. On the other hand, the present patient was not administered with the above drugs, because he had not experienced any episode of syncope or <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> such as TdP or VF, and his mother refused such treatment. However, his QTc interval and Tp-e interval prolongations were so marked that the doctor in charge tried to persuade the patient to take the drugs, but failed.|$|R
30|$|Sevoflurane is {{recognized}} as a safe anesthetic, even in patients with long QT syndrome, but it might prolong QTc and/or Tp-e in LQT 3 patients and {{increase the risk of}} TdP and <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{measured}} values of HRT parameters {{have been shown}} to be a statistically significant predictor of the probability of dying from cardiac disease after a patient suffers a myocardial infarction. HRT can also be used to predict death in patients with congestive heart failure from a <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Defibrillators and Personal DefibrillatorsA {{new class}} of defibrillators was invented by Dr. Michel Mirowski, an Israeli {{cardiologist}} who imagined shrinking a 20-pound or so defibrillator to a size that could be implanted in high sudden cardiac death or SCD risk patients. In addition to the shrinking, this imaginative device had to automatically detect and effectively treat (correct) the otherwise <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> known as ventricular fibrillation of VF. The device would be with (in) the patient and would therefore be a 'personal' defibrillator {{as opposed to a}} non-personal bystander operated defibrillator. Personal defibrillators were first called automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators or AICDs. Later this acronym was shortened to ICD.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} sudden death in Brugada {{syndrome}} is ventricular fibrillation (VF). The {{average age of}} death is 41. According to clinical reports, sudden death in people with Brugada syndrome most often happens during sleep. The episodes of syncope (fainting) and sudden death (aborted or not) are caused by fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardias or ventricular fibrillation. These arrhythmias appear with no warning. While there is no exact treatment modality that reliably and totally prevents ventricular fibrillation from occurring in this syndrome, treatment lies in termination of this <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> before it causes death. This is done via insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which continuously monitors the heart rhythm and will shock the wearer if ventricular fibrillation is sensed.Recent studies have evaluated the role of quinidine, a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, for decreasing VF episodes occurring in this syndrome. Quinidine {{has been found to}} both decrease the number of VF episodes and correct spontaneous ECG changes, possibly via inhibiting Ito channels.Some drugs have been reported to induce the type-1 ECG and/or (fatal) arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome patients. Patients with Brugada syndrome can prevent arrhythmias by avoiding these drugs or using them only in controlled conditions. Those with risk factors for coronary artery disease may require an angiogram before ICD implantation.|$|E
40|$|Transmural {{dispersion}} {{in action}} potential duration (APD) {{has been shown}} to contribute to arrhythmia induction in the heart. However, its role in termination of <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> by defibrillation shocks has never been examined.

30|$|Advances in cardiac MRI have {{resulted}} in superior image quality and increased sensitivity in the detection of myocardial trabeculations. Moreover, cardiac MR can also reveal the presence of LGE, a marker of myocardial fibrosis that represents the substrate for potentially <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> [51]. Higher prevalence of LGE is associated with disease severity and LV systolic dysfunction [47].|$|R

40|$|To {{overcome}} the limitations and misjudgments of conventional prediction of arrhythmic cardiotoxicity, {{we have developed}} an on-chip in vitro predictive cardiotoxicity assay using cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells employing a constructive spatiotemporal two step measurement of fluctuation (short-term variability; STV) of cells repolarization and cell-to-cell conduction time, representing two origins of <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> Temporal STV of field potential duration (FPD) showed a potential to predict the risks of <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> originated from repolarization dispersion for false negative compounds, which was not correctly predicted by conventional measurements using animal cells, even for non-QT prolonging clinical positive compounds. Spatial STV of conduction time delay also unveiled the proarrhythmic risk of asynchronous propagation in cell networks, whose risk cannot be correctly predicted by single-cell-based measurements, indicating {{the importance of the}} spatiotemporal fluctuation viewpoint of in vitro cell networks for precise prediction of <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> reaching clinical assessment such as thorough QT assay...|$|E
50|$|The normal {{treatments}} for episodes {{due to the}} pathological look-alikes are the same mainstays for any other episode of cardiac arrest: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation to restore normal sinus rhythm, and if initial defibrillation fails, administration of intravenous epinephrine or amiodarone. The goal is avoidance of infarction, heart failure, and/or <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole, or pulseless electrical activity), so ultimately to restore normal sinus rhythm.|$|R
40|$|The {{arrhythmia}} {{known as}} "Torsade de pointes" {{is a potential}} lethal complication of some drugs, particulary the class Ia and III antiarrhythmic drugs.

50|$|The data on {{the effect}} of β-blockers on HRV in post-MI {{patients}} are surprisingly scant. Despite the observation of statistically significant increases, the actual changes are very modest. In conscious post-MI dogs, β-blockers do not modify HRV. The unexpected observation that before MI, β-blockade increases HRV only in the animals destined to be at low risk for <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> after MI may suggest novel approaches to post-MI risk stratification.|$|R
40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{patients are}} at high risk of potential <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> Gap junction and microRNA- 1 (miR- 1) are both arrhythmia generating conditions. The present study investigated whether Wenxin Granules (Wenxin-Keli, WXKL) could prevent potential <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> by improving gap junctions and miR- 1 following MI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into control, model, metoprolol, low dose WXKL, and high dose WXKL groups. The MI rat model was created by coronary artery ligation. Treatments were administrated intragastrically to the rats for 4 weeks. Conventional transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe the ultrastructure of gap junctions. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used to detect the expression of miR- 1, protein kinase C (PKC), and related proteins. Additionally, a programmatic electrophysiological stimulation test was performed to detect the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT). WXKL protected the ultrastructure of the gap junctions and their constituent Cx 43 by regulating miR- 1 and PKC mediated signal transduction and increased the VFT significantly in the rat MI model. The results suggested that WXKL is an effective alternative medicine to prevent potentially <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> following MI...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{instances}} of {{sudden cardiac death}} documented with longterm ambulatory electrocardiography are described. All had coronary artery disease. The <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> was ventricular fibrillation in seven, bradyarrhythmia ending in asystole in two, and electromechanical dissociation in one. There was no specific arrhythmia pattern in the preceding hour of the terminal event and no predictable electrical trigger for the <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> The literature on the subject has been reviewed. It appears from the information available that larger series of documented sudden death cases are needed if one wishes to define subgroups with a preventable case of sudden cardiac death.

In his monograph De Subitaneis mortibus published in 1709, Lancisi reported on the multicausality of the sudden death syndrome, the influence of risk factors, and the difficulties of identifying the patient who is at risk.

40|$|SummaryAbnormal Ca 2 + cycling is {{important}} in various cardiac diseases. Evidence has accumulated that dysregulation of Ca 2 + release from the ryanodine receptor (RyR 2) {{plays a significant role}} in cardiac dysfunction. Spontaneous Ca 2 + release through RyR 2 during diastole decreases sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + content, and also induces delayed after depolarization (DAD) as a substrate for <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> Several disease-linked mutations in the RyR have been reported in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) or arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVC 2). The unique distribution of these mutation sites has produced the concept that the interaction among the putative regulatory domains within the RyR may {{play a key role in}} regulating the channel opening, and that there seems to be a common abnormality in the channel disorder between heart failure and CPVT/ARVC 2. We review here the considerable body of evidence regarding defective channel gating of RyR 2 in the pathogenesis of heart failure and <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Self-terminating {{ventricular}} fibrillation {{was recorded in}} a 47 year old woman without coronary artery or other structural heart disease. Reperfusion {{was thought to be}} responsible for the {{ventricular fibrillation}} because the arrhythmia started while the ST segment was returning to the baseline during an episode of silent ischaemia that was probably caused by coronary spasm. This case shows that potentially <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> can arise during reperfusion and that ventricular fibrillation during reperfusion may be self-terminating...|$|R
30|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine the cause of death in animals. Arterial pressure and ECG were recorded from 20 animals (83  %) until animals died. The data indicated that some animals had seizures in advance of the death whereas all animals had hemodynamic collapse before they died. Relations between the seizures and the hemodynamic collapse were not clear. No <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> of VF rhythms were found. Before and after hemofiltration, {{there was no evidence of}} surgical complications, such as major bleeding.|$|R
2500|$|Treatment of {{flecainide}} cardiac toxicity involves {{increasing the}} excretion of flecainide, blocking its {{effects in the}} heart, and (rarely) institution of cardiovascular support to avoid impending <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> [...] Modalities that have had success include administration of a beta-sympathomimetic agent, and administration of a sodium load(often {{in the form of}} hypertonic sodium bicarbonate). [...] Placing the individual on cardiopulmonary bypass support may be necessary in order to temporarily remove the need for a beating heart and to increase blood flow to the liver.|$|R
30|$|Mannitol is used {{to reduce}} the {{intracranial}} pressure during neurosurgery. A serious complication of mannitol is mannitol-induced hyperkalemia, which causes electrocardiogram (ECG) change (peaked T waves and wide QRS) and subsequent <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> [1 – 4]. We report a case of ventricular tachycardia (VT) without preceding ECG change after mannitol administration during cerebral artery clipping. We have obtained written consent from the patient to publish this report.|$|E
30|$|In this case, VT {{occurred}} {{without any}} preceding ECG change despite hyperkalemia due to mannitol. <b>Lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> often occurs during neurosurgery. In general, {{there have been}} cases during surgical operations near the brainstem with an increased sympathetic nerve system due to the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm and with hemorrhage shock during craniotomy. There are a few reports of fatal arrhythmia, VT, and/or ventricular fibrillation due to mannitol, which mainly is due to hyperkalemia [3 – 5].|$|E
40|$|The {{heart is}} {{extensively}} innervated and its performance is tightly {{controlled by the}} nervous system.

40|$|Sarcoidosis is a {{rare disease}} of unknown etiology, {{described}} over 80 years ago. It is a multisystemic disorder characterized {{by the presence of}} granulomatous lesions without caseation. Cardiac involvement varies according to the region, but it is generally accepted that 5 % of patients with systemic sarcoidosis have cardiac infiltration with clinical evidence; however, autopsy studies indicate that up to 20 % to 30 % of patients with sarcoidosis have myocardial involvement. Several factors -environmental, occupational and infectious- have been proposed as triggers of the process in individuals with genetic predisposition. Cardiac sarcoidosis may have a wide range of presentations and may even be asymptomatic; the most common manifestations are heart failure, abnormal heart rhythm and <b>lethal</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmias.</b> Treatment includes medications for heart failure, steroids and immune-suppressants, management of <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> with ablation and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac transplantation in severe cases...|$|R
30|$|Although {{echocardiography}} {{has been}} the diagnostic test of choice for non-compaction, other techniques {{have been used for}} the diagnosis, including CT and MRI [34]. Echocardiography may not visualise the apical region optimally, leading to underestimation of the degree of left ventricular non-compaction [37]. MRI provides good correlation with echo for the localisation and extent of non-compaction, and is useful in cases of poor echocardiographic image quality. In addition, the demonstration of differences in MRI signal intensity in non-compacted myocardium may help identify substrates for potentially <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> [34].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Backgrounds Conventional {{in vitro}} {{approach}} using human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) assay {{has been considered}} worldwide as the first screening assay for cardiac repolarization safety. However, it does not always oredict the potential QT prolongation risk or pro-arrhythmic risk correctly. For adaptable preclinical strategiesto evaluate global cardiac safety, an on-chip quasi- in vivo cardiac toxicity assay for <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> (ventricular tachyarrhythmia) measurement using ring-shaped closed circuit microelectrode chip has been developed. Results The ventricular electrocardiogram (ECG) -like field potential data, which includes both the repolarization and the conductance abnormality, was acquired from the self-convolutied extracellular field potentials (FPs) of a lined-up cardiomyocyte network on a circle-shaped microelectrode in an agarose microchamber. When Astemisol applied to the closed-loop cardiomyocyte network, self-convoluted FP profile of normal beating changed into an early afterdepolarization (EAD) like waveform, and then showed ventricular tachyarrhythmias and ventricular fibrilations (VT/Vf). QT-prolongation-like self-convoluted FP duration prolongation and its fluctuation increase was also observed according to the increase of Astemizole concentration. Conclusions The {{results indicate that the}} convoluted FPs of the quasi -in vivo cell network assay includes both of the repolarization data and the conductance abnormality of cardiomyocyte networks has the strong potential to prediction <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> </p...|$|E
30|$|The {{majority}} of fibromas {{are found in}} the LV or RV wall, and fewer than 20 % are detected in the IVS [5]. Fibromas can cause <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmia,</b> valve regurgitation, and ventricular inflow/outflow tract obstruction depending on their location and size [4, 8]. If left untreated, fibromas can increase the risk of fatality. Therefore, surgical resection is recommended, especially in symptomatic cases. Basically complete resection is recommended first. But, partial resection can be an acceptable option when papillary muscle, valvular, and/or ventricular function might be reduced after complete resection [3, 7].|$|E

40|$|Sudden {{cardiac death}} caused by {{malignant}} ventricular arrhythmias {{is the most}} important cause of death in the industrialized world. Most of these <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> occur in the setting of ischemic heart disease. A significant number of sudden deaths, especially in young individuals, are caused by inherited ventricular arrhythmic disorders, however. Genetically induced ventricular arrhythmias can be divided in two subgroups: the primary electrical disorders or channelopathies, and the secondary arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. This article focuses on the genetic background of these electrical disorders and the current knowledge of genotype-phenotype interactions...|$|R
40|$|The role of channelopathies in the {{pathogenesis}} of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with structurally normal hearts is a rapidly evolving story. (1) Many ion channels are involved, including loss-of-function sodium channelopathies of which the phenotypic spectrum ranges from <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> to asymptomatic carriers and includes Brugada Syndrome (BrS), cardiac conduction disease, sick sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation and dilated cardiomyopathy. BrS, characterized by right precordial ST elevation on the electrocardiogram, is frequently associated with conduction delay, potentially <b>lethal</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> and a positive family history of sudden premature death. BrS {{is estimated to be}} responsible for approximately 4 % of all sudden deaths and 20 % of sudden deaths in patients with structurally normal hearts. Despite an overall prevalence of about 5 / 10000 individuals,(2) BrS is considered extremely rare in the pediatric population. However, children harboring loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the sodium channel alpha-subunit (SCN 5 A) have been reported to present with life-threatening arrhythmias especially during febrile episodes. (3) While SCN 5 A mutations account for 11 - 28 % of BrS probands, mutations of the L-type calcium channel (LTCC), including the gene coding for the LTCC beta-subunit (CaCNB 2) among others, have recently been implicated in about 13 % of patients with BrS-related phenotypes and SCD.
