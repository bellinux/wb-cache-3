40|$|The {{digital age}} began in 1939 with the {{construction}} of the first digital computer. In the sixty-five years that have followed, the influence of digitisation on our everyday lives has grown steadily and today digital technology has a greater influence on our lives {{than at any time since}} its development. This book examines the role played by digital technology in both the exercise and suppression of human rights. The global digital environment has allowed us to reinterpret the concept of universal human rights. Discourse on human rights need no longer be limited by national or cultural boundaries and individuals have the ability to create new forms in which to exercise their rights or even to bypass national <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> <b>rights.</b> The defence of such rights is meanwhile under constant assault by the newfound ability of states to both suppress and control individual rights through the application of these same digital technologies. This book gathers together an international group of experts working within this rapidly developing area of law and technology and focuses their attantion on the specific interaction between human rights and digital technology. This is the first work to explore the challenges brought about by digital technology to fundamental freedoms such as privacy, freedom of expression, access, assembly and dignity. It is essential reading for anyone who fears digital technology will lead to the 'Big Brother' state...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} the <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> strike in {{essential}} and public services in the nine sub-regional countries of Southern Africa – South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe – is examined in this contribution. While all of these countries share common influences and face common challenges, {{there appears to be}} a vast disparity in the approaches taken <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> strike in public and essential services in the region. A brief overview of the demographics and labour markets in the countries under discussion is sketched, the salient features of the ILO's approach to strike in essential and public services is highlighted, and a broad overview of the contrasting and disparate approaches to essential and public services in the region is provided. The focus is, however, on the legislative approach taken to essential service employees in South Africa.

40|$|In Texas, {{water is}} on everyone’s minds. Between a raging drought, an {{expanding}} {{oil and gas}} industry, and a whirring media machine, Texans find themselves in great conflict on how to maintain a tradition and a booming industry while conserving the very resource that allows {{their presence in the}} first place: water. Water has become an important part of oil and gas exploration, and this fact has kept it well within the reach of those who lease the mineral interests. Texas law promotes such exploration by granting these lessees the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the reasonable use of the land’s subsurface water so that {{they may be able to}} pursue their mineral interests. The <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> this <b>right</b> loom large, however, as this <b>right</b> may begin <b>to</b> appear, in the minds of legislators, landowners, and the public-at-large, as not so reasonable. Existing Texas common-law <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> this implied <b>right</b> may provide the door through which public interests slip into the traditional analyses and allow the interests of the landowner, the public, and the oil and gas industry to be served. This Comment suggests that changes in common law, regulations, and social and environmental trends portend broader interpretations of the <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> Texas’s implied <b>right</b> of reasonable use of the surface. Specifically, this Comment suggests that the analysis provided by one limitation, the Accommodation Doctrine, may be the path by which Texas courts find that the oil and gas industry should accommodate public interests as well as specific surface-owner interests when pursuing their mineral rights...|$|R

40|$|In his paper, Turnbull {{raises an}} {{important}} but often unrecognized point, {{which is that}} there are certain <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> what <b>rights</b> can do for us. He introduces the notions of "trust" and "compassion" in order to indicate the kind of limitation he has in mind. While I am sympathetic to his general position at this point-there are certain concerns in the ethical domain that cannot be properly addressed by the notion of rights-I think the author owes his readers a more explicit explanantion about what it is that rights cannot do in the particular case he presents us with. Thinking about this case, Turnbull finds himself trapped in a paradox, which leads him to believe he must move beyond rights claims. The paraadox, as he describes it, is that if we stick <b>to</b> <b>rights</b> claims in order to protect people with disabilities against various kinds of discrimination in the context of health care, they might end up in a situation where neither they nor we want them to be.

Article 19 ICCPR {{on freedom}} of expression, for example, allows {{limitations}} for several reasons, including {{the respect of the}} rights or reputation of others, the promotion of national security or pubic order, or of public health or morals. Müller has persuasively argued that this reason effectively means that states may not limit the ‘minimum core’ of economic, social and cultural rights, since they would go against the nature of the rights (Müller 2009, 575). 15 In addition <b>to</b> these requirements, <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> economic, social and cultural rights must be prescribed by law, proportionate to the aim pursued, and necessary in a democratic society. Furthermore, as the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights state, “[article 4] was not meant <b>to</b> introduce <b>limitations</b> on <b>rights</b> affecting the subsistence…of the person.” (United Nations Commission on Human Rights 1987, para 47).

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{alternative ways}} of protecting patent rights using the law and economics framework of property and liability rules. Traditional compulsory licenses are compared with the most recent discussions on the choice between granting or denying injunctive relief for patents (ex post liability rules). The debate about strategic behaviour triggered by the patent system, especially {{in the aftermath of}} the U. S. Supreme Court decision in eBay v. MercExchange is discussed along with policy perspectives on both sides of the Atlantic. The problem of calculating the level of compensation, which is one of the most important critiques against the use of liability rules in patent law, is also examined in depth. The book concludes by suggesting that a coherent patent system could opt for property rules in general cases while leaving enough space for exceptions and limited liability rules. Curtailing exceptions and <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> patent <b>rights,</b> including the use of patent liability rules, could otherwise risk stifling innovation and even contradicting the goals of patent law...|$|R

This computer-aided qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) tool facilitated the process of analysis and enhanced the validity of the research. During the inductive process of analysis two patterns crystallised, viz. the absolutising of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> freedom of expression by some learners and the lack of skills <b>to</b> implement the <b>limitation</b> <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> freedom of expression in schools. The main findings indicated that some learners did not have knowledge regarding the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> freedom of expression, although most learners were aware that they could speak their minds under this right. Furthermore, learners didn’t seem to know how <b>to</b> exercise the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> freedom of expression.
