30|$|Prediction of {{sewing thread}} {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the significant factors in thread procurement. In apparel industry both garment manufacturers and thread suppliers predict thread consumption per unit <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> for their thread purchasing and logistics processes. Inaccurate thread consumption predictions lead to inaccurate costing and reduction of warehouse utilization for both garment manufacturers and sewing thread manufacturers. Purchase of excess or shortage quantities of thread cones make suppliers to endure those excess or shortage thread quantities, so that both parties undergo inflexible logistic process (Jaouadi et al. 2006). In this context sewing thread manufacturers and garment manufacturers are looking for accurate method predicting sewing thread consumption for given stitch lengths so that wastages could be minimized.|$|E

When one tries to improve wearing comfort, often the most problematic items turn to be connection points of the electronic circuitry. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine behaviour of conductive yarns after they have been sewn into textile material, as well as to determine their suitability for the intended applications. In order to determine the quality of a conductive connective seams resistance has been measured (in Ω) under the influence of various variable factors: type of yarn, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stitch,</b> number of layers, type of seam.

30|$|Researchers and {{sewing thread}} {{manufacturers}} had different approaches in developing thread consumption calculations. Thread length {{required for a}} unit length of a stitch is the most frequent measurement (Ukponmwan et al. 2000) which provides flexibility to calculate the thread consumption for a given <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stitch.</b> Measuring the actual length of threads in the stitch is one prominent method which gives correct results if measuring standards are properly followed. Actual lengths of thread are measured by unraveling the formed stitch carefully under correct tension of threads. Unraveled threads are measured following standard testing methods since they are in-build with crimp. As an example, the French standard NF G 07 101 is {{used to determine the}} unraveled thread lengths (Jaouadi et al. 2006). Though unraveling method gives an accurate value, the stitching operation has to be performed several attempts to improve the accuracy by optimizing sewing parameters. The measuring process is time consuming and it requires testing cost for material, and equipment and people. Test operator should be highly skilled person to obtain exact values of yarn lengths without exposing them to excessive tensions or distortions.|$|E

40|$|The term sashiko {{refers to}} the {{stitching}} {{of one or more}} layers of cloth with a simple running stitch and can also apply to the completed fabric. Sashiko is the noun of the verb sasu, meaning to pierce. Sashiko probably was initially a way to recycle or extend the life of cloth. Among the textiles in the Shoso-in, the Imperial Repository built circa 752 to preserve thousands of objects of art and other belongings of the Emperor Shomu, is an 8 th Century 2 ̆ 2 distant mountain 2 ̆ 2 pattern monk 2 ̆ 7 s robe covered with a purple silk running stitch. This running stitch is superfluous to the actual structure of the robe. This is a development of an earlier ritual robe, evolved {{to the point where the}} stitches have lost their original function to strengthen and attach the patches of cloth, but retained to give the appearance of the original 2 ̆ 2 robe of rags. 2 ̆ 2 This is the oldest example of sashiko extant in Japan. There is a gap in recorded history from this point until the 17 th Century when other sashiko are mentioned. Sashiko was done throughout Japan, primarily by women. It is not known to have been done commercially with the possible exception of some of the firemen clothing. Often it was done by and for people who were too poor to buy new cloth. Sashiko developed from necessity rather than as a luxury, so the art of sashiko wasn 2 ̆ 7 t highly competitive, with some exceptions. That is, the product was not regarded as a statement of fashion. Originally a practical technique for making cloth thicker, warmer, and more durable, sashiko can also be purely decorative. Clothing that has been over stitched is not only very strong, but warm. Therefore, it was reasonable to reinforce the cloth by stitching before the cloth wore out. Presently it is done on new cloth, for garments and textiles to be sold in folk craft shops. Typically, sashiko stitching is done with white cotton thread on an indigo-dyed fabric. Most sashiko uses one strand of thread through the needle, doubled so that both strands account for the stitch although it can be done with a single strand. The length of the stitch varies with the number of layers being stitched together. Keeping the stitches even in length, as well as straight, requires skill and practise. There are approximately five to ten stitches per inch (five to ten stitches per 2. 5 cm.) with certain districts noted for having particularly fine stitching. Sashiko was done on balanced weave textiles, that is the warp and weft are the same thickness and weight of thread. Although the ground fabric threads were not usually counted, the stitches were. Within a pattern, per line, the same number and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> is held constant and is consistent (from point A to B are always x number of stitches and the length of each stitch is held constant). Many patterns consist of straight lines that intersect at right angles, so counting the stitches made the patterns quite exact. At the point of intersection either the stitching threads cross creating a pattern, or the absence of the threads create a pattern such as a star or the center of a flower. Sashiko can be either a single repeating pattern or a combination of several patterns on one fabric...|$|E

30|$|Jaouadi et al.

In practice, garment manufacturers calculate thread requirement based on consumption estimate charts provided by specific thread suppliers (Carr & Latham 1994; Amann Group 2010; American & Efird Inc 2007).

The aim was to better understand what impact different stitch patterns used in textile conservation have on the textiles after long-term storage and exhibition. The study focused on the conservation of silk. A literature review established the most commonly used stitches, threads, and support fabrics for treatments of silk artefacts in Europe and North America. The research compared laid couching and brick couching. Two different <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>stitch</b> lines were also studied. In total, 46 textile specimens were prepared, of either standard or artefact silk. The specimens were degraded with a horizontal or vertical tear in order to compare the results depending on the different kinds of damage. Thereafter, they were conserved in a similar manner with slight variations to the above-mentioned variables. After treatment, the specimens were subjected to a fixed-load test. By hanging them from a whiteboard using magnets and weighting with 50 g each. The fixed-load test lasted for three weeks. The results were evaluated through measuring the elongation of the specimen and opening of the tear as well as visual evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>stitching</b> from photographs <b>of</b> the specimen.
