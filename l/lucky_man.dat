[...] Sarah Lyall notes in her 2007 interview with Pinter in The New York Times that his [...] "latest work, a slim pamphlet called [...] "Six Poems for A.," [...] comprises poems written over 32 years, with [...] "A" [...] of course being Lady Antonia. The first of the poems was written in Paris, where she and Mr. Pinter traveled soon after they met. More than three decades later the two are rarely apart, and Mr. Pinter turns soft, even cozy, {{when he talks about}} his wife." [...] In that interview Pinter [...] "acknowledged that his plays—full of infidelity, cruelty, inhumanity, the lot—seem at odds with his domestic contentment. 'How can you write a happy play?' he said. 'Drama is about conflict and degrees of perturbation, disarray. I've never been able to write a happy play, but I've been able to enjoy a happy life.

500|$|Though {{the films}} are presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of Gone to Coney Island survives in The Moving Picture World from July 9, 1910. It states: [...] "Kate has been employed {{for a number}} of years as a maid in the home of Mrs. Greene. Her 'young man,' Henry, works down at Coney [...] He induces Kate to leave her place and take a situation as a ticket seller at Luna Park. Kate tries to tell her mistress of her intended departure, but Mrs. Greene is busy and refuses to listen. Mrs. Greene goes out, during her absence, Kate takes French leave, leaving a note saying she is going to Coney Island. Never having visited the Island, Mrs. Greene considers it a jungle place. When she gets Kate's note, she thinks that her duty to immediately start in pursuit of the misguided girl. Not knowing how to get to the island, she appeals to her old friend, Professor Griggs. He also is ignorant of the ways of Coney, but in turn appeals to his friend Casey, a ward politician, who of course knows the Island, and consents to act as their escort. The three set out for Coney and start on their search for Kate. The hunt is almost forgotten in the joys of looping the loop, shooting the chutes and various other diversions of the Island. When they finally find Kate, she is at her post, selling tickets at Luna. She laughs at Mrs. Greene's fears for her safety and announces the fact that she is happily married, and presents the <b>lucky</b> <b>man.</b> In a cool Coney corner, Mrs. Greene confesses that she found Coney wasn't as bad as it was painted, and she is going to revisit it often." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1837, William Maginn {{produced}} {{essays on}} the play. He {{turned his attention to}} Theseus' speech about [...] "the lunatic, the lover, and the poet" [...] and to Hippolyta's response to it. He regarded Theseus as the voice of Shakespeare himself and the speech as a call for imaginative audiences. He also viewed Bottom as a <b>lucky</b> <b>man</b> on whom Fortune showered favours beyond measure. He was particularly amused by the way Bottom reacts to the love of the fairy queen: completely unfazed. Maginn argued that [...] "Theseus would have bent in reverent awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster." [...] Finally, Maginn thought that Oberon should not be blamed for Titania's humiliation, which is the result of an accident. He viewed Oberon as angry with the [...] "caprices" [...] of his queen, but unable to anticipate that her charmed affections would be reserved for a weaver with a donkey's head.|$|E

2500|$|Mirren {{has also}} {{appeared}} in {{a large number of}} films throughout her career. Some of her earlier film appearances include roles in Midsummer Night's Dream, Age of Consent, O <b>Lucky</b> <b>Man!,</b> Caligula, Excalibur, 2010, The Long Good Friday, White Nights, When the Whales Came and The Mosquito Coast.

One of her other film roles was in Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, as the thief's wife, opposite Michael Gambon. In Teaching Mrs. Tingle, she plays sadistic history teacher Mrs Eve Tingle. In 2007, she claimed director Michael Winner had treated her [...] "like a piece of meat" [...] at a casting call in 1964. Asked about the incident, Winner told The Guardian: [...] "I don't remember asking her to turn around but if I did I wasn't being serious. I was only doing what the [...] agent asked me– and for this I get reviled! Helen's a lovely person, she's a great actress and I'm a huge fan, but her memory of that moment is a little flawed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeannine Etter of Youth Outlook stated [...] "Janet {{takes us}} from ballads to hard-core dance beats, and from sex to politics. The set changes {{appropriately}} reflect {{some of the}} stages of her musical development, from the more playful circus/funhouse vibe of light and playful songs like [...] "Escapade" [...] to the sexual side of Janet's music that keeps getting stronger and stronger as the years go by. During the performance, one <b>lucky</b> <b>man</b> is picked from the audience, strapped to a chair and [...] "tortured" [...] as Janet performs a highly erotic dance for him." [...] The excerpt concluded [...] "Janet is extremely beautiful, but she also demonstrates a humility obtained from pain, reflection {{and a sense of}} spirituality." [...] Christine Robertson of Evening Post, who reviewed Jackson's concert in Wellington, New Zealand, exclaimed [...] "The sleek choreography and superb dance spectacle saw Jackson seldom take a breath from one set to the next—her control of the stage complete. Most of the time she plunged into two decades of hits which give her the right to stand her ground" [...] among her contemporaries. Jane Stevenson of The Toronto Sun exclaimed [...] "pyrotechnics, set pieces and inflatables combine with non-stop singing and dancing for two hours of exhilarating entertainment." ...|$|E

[...] and R.E.M. in their song [...] "The Wake-Up Bomb". The early acoustic material was influential in helping to bring about progressive rock and 21st century folk music-influenced singers as Devendra Banhart. The lyric [...] "Glimmers like Bolan in the shining sun" [...] is featured in My Chemical Romance's song [...] "Vampire Money", a direct reference to Bolan, taken from their most recent studio album [...] Additionally, Oasis [...] "borrowed" [...] the distinct guitar riff from [...] "Get It On" [...] on their single [...] "Cigarettes & Alcohol". Oasis's guitarist, Noel Gallagher, has cited T. Rex as a strong influence. The music of T. Rex features in the soundtracks of various movies, including Velvet Goldmine, Death Proof, Billy Elliot, The Bank Job, and Dallas Buyers Club.
