40|$|While {{liquidity}} {{and order}} flows are microstructure constructs, {{we show that}} they have profound implications for all of finance. In particular, liquidity is intimately connected with the fundamental building blocks of finance, namely, the pricing of risk, the powerful no-arbitrage theorems, and market efficiency. Large-sample studies of liquidity show that both liquidity and liquidity risk are priced in the cross-section of stock returns, the law of one price {{is more likely to}} hold in more liquid markets, and liquidity enhances market efficiency. Hence policies to enhance liquidity encourage efficiency and reduce costs of raising capital. Furthermore, order flows are powerful predictors of returns as well as the real economy.

Liquidity in an Automated Auction The rapid adoption of automated limit order book systems for equities, derivatives, and bonds worldwide has generated considerable interest in the operation of such markets. Using a new database comprising the limit order book for stock index futures trading in an automated market, we analyze the links between market <b>liquidity,</b> <b>order</b> placement behavior, and returns. We obtain several new results. First, we completely characterize the shape of the demand and supply schedules over time and use these to compute metrics of liquidity. We document wide intertemporal variation in overall market liquidity. Second, we provide evidence that traders strategically time their trades {{to take advantage of the}} timevariation in liquidity. Third, we analyze the dynamic relation between measures of liquidity and shorthorizon expected returns. We find support for microstructure models where liquidity is a factor in expected returns, but also complicated dynamics from past returns to market depth...|$|E
40|$|Liquidity in {{government}} securities markets, despite their importance to {{both private and}} public agents, has received much attention in the literature only recently {{due to the fact that}} high-frequency data from trading in those markets were previously unavailable. This paper attempts to measure liquidity in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, where Greek government securities are traded, by estimating six different liquidity measures from high-frequency data. The most appropriate measures for this specific market are derived from the analysis and comparison of the obtained estimates. By any of the measures examined, the ten-year benchmark bond is the most liquid security. The bid-ask spread emerges as a good measure of liquidity for the pre euro area entry period, but looses part of its importance in the post euro area entry period of our sample. An interesting finding is that, in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, liquidity is only weakly related to price volatility, probably due to the specific structure of the government securities market in Greece. Therefore, trading activity is also found to be a good proxy of liquidity in this specific market. Money demand; Greek bond market, market microstructure, <b>liquidity,</b> <b>order</b> flow. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between price spread, volatility and trading volume. We find that spread forms {{as a result of}} interplay between <b>order</b> <b>liquidity</b> and <b>order</b> impact. When trading volume is small adding more liquidity helps improve price accuracy and reduce spread, but after some point additional liquidity begins to deteriorate price. The model allows to connect the bid-ask spread and high-low bars to measurable microstructural parameters and express their dependence on trading volume, volatility and time horizon. Using the established relations, we address the operating spread optimization problem to maximize market-making profit...|$|R
40|$|The thesis investigates {{information}} and liquidity provision in financial markets. I explore {{the implications of}} the strategic behaviour of market makers competing with high frequency traders and of dealers involved in long term relationships with clients in the foreign exchange markets. Additionally, I analyse the value of information from the <b>liquidity</b> <b>order</b> flow to market makers and dealers. Further, I reflect on regulatory implications of my findings. The first chapter presents a literature review to motivate the following chapters. First, I survey the main findings of the papers on market making most relevant to this thesis. Second, I discuss the regulatory and academic debate on high frequency traders, which are widely viewed as a new type of liquidity providers. Third, I discuss important differences between market makers and FX dealers, including specific features of foreign exchange markets and their informational structure. Lastly, I provide a brief overview of the recent regulatory debate on OTC markets. The second chapter analyses the effect of competition between a designated, traditional market maker and a High Frequency Trader providing liquidity. The market maker is risk neutral and the high frequency trader is risk averse, which creates differences in their inventory exposures. The market power of these two participants creates a bid ask spread, but the high frequency trader narrows the spread and improves liquidity. The chapter further investigates the liquidity provision by a monopolistic high frequency trader. I show that having agents with strong inventory concerns as market makers could hamper liquidity provision. I explain how ceteris paribus small changes in the reservation value of liquidity traders can trigger shifts in the equilibrium spread. The third chapter endogenizes the existence of intermediation in a two-tier market. Specifically, trading takes place sequentially in a client-dealer OTC market and in an interdealer market organised as a limit order book. A privately-informed client chooses between trading through dealers or paying an entry cost to join the interdealer market directly. Dealer rents from intermediation increase in the entry cost. I show that competitive dealers use the bid ask spread strategically to reward the client for the information conveyed by his order flow. Furthermore, I show that the client dealer relationship is affected by a commitment problem: clients who trade una tantum execute trades with multiple dealers. Ongoing client dealer relationships viewed as an infinitely repeated game can overcome this problem and the client may benefit from trading exclusively with one dealer. The fourth chapter analyses information sharing and collusion incentives of strategic liquidity providers and the impact of their cooperation on asset prices. Risk neutral liquidity providers operate in a market with risk-averse informed traders (fundamentalists) and noise traders. I consider four regimes: 1) pure market making; 2) dealership without information sharing; 3) dealership with information sharing but without collusion in trading; and 4) dealership with information sharing and collusion in trading. I show that information sharing substantially increases agents' profits, while colluding in trading has a relatively low additional impact on profits. This suggests that if there are penalties for collusion, dealers may choose to only share information, but not to collude. Furthermore, I investigate the effect of the four regimes on market depth, volatility of prices and information content of prices. I find that dealers sharing {{information and}} colluding increase market depth compared to dealership without information sharing. However, the market depth is lower compared to pure market making. Both volatility of prices and the information content of prices increase when liquidity providers act as dealers. The magnitude of these differences depends on the parameters of the model.

40|$|We examine empirically {{the role}} of {{high-frequency}} traders (HFTs) in price discovery and price efficiency. Based on our methodology, we find overall that HFTs facilitate price efficiency by trading {{in the direction of}} permanent price changes and in the opposite direction of transitory pricing errors, both on average and on the highest volatility days. This is done through their <b>liquidity</b> demanding <b>orders.</b> In contrast, HFTs 2 ̆ 019 <b>liquidity</b> supplying <b>orders</b> are adversely selected. The direction of buying and selling by HFTs predicts price changes over short horizons measured in seconds.

40|$|Is {{the effect}} of {{liquidity}} risk on asset prices sensitive to our choice of liquidity proxy? In addressing this fundamental question, we achieve two main results. First, when we estimate factor models on {{a broad range of}} liquidity measures we uncover a profound distinction between trade and <b>order</b> based <b>liquidity.</b> Second, although the order based factor provides a better signal of available liquidity, we find that only the factor related to information risk explains expected returns both in a theoretical liquidity-CAPM model and in a linear pricing framework.

30|$|Neoclassical {{financial}} theory {{argues that}} the arrival of news is the major driver of asset prices.

In this literature, a number of papers investigate the effect of buying/selling pressure currently prevailing in the market for an asset on its price movements. A popular measure of buying/selling pressure in intermediated markets, where market makers ensure <b>liquidity,</b> is <b>order</b> (flow) imbalance, which measures the disparity between buyer- and seller-initiated trades (a precise definition will be provided in Sect. 3.1. 1).|$|R

40|$|Informed traders need <b>{{liquidity}}</b> in <b>order</b> {{to profit}} from their private information. Markets provide liquidity and are compensated by the information released through trading. Fast markets provide access to a limit order book. Slow markets provide execution in an auction-based trading floor. Hybrid markets combine both execution venues. It is shown here that the overall efficiency of a hybrid market is determined by its fast component. The introduction of a trading floor does not generate more informed trading, only takes trading away from the fast market. Trading floors are thus inherently competitive to the fast market.

I find that brokers preferentially route marketable orders to venues with lower liquidity demand fees, driving up the execution probability at these venues and lowering adverse selection costs. When fees for liquidity supply and demand are sufficiently different, brokers route <b>liquidity</b> supplying <b>orders</b> to separate venues, where investors suffer from lower execution probability and higher costs of adverse selection...|$|R

The market liquidity flowing {{into and out}} of an order book is modeled as a mean-reverting stochastic process. Given the shape of the order book for each asset, we express the market impact of an execution as a recursive impact that recovers gradually with associated uncertainty. We then derive the optimal execution strategy as a closed-form solution to the mean-variance problem that optimizes the trade-off between the market impact and the volatility/liquidity risk given investor risk aversion. Using our model, we analyze some implications of the optimal execution strategy with comparative statics and simulations.
