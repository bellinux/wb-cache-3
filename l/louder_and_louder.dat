25|$|At dawn of {{the third}} day, there was thunder, lightning, a dense cloud upon the {{mountain}}, and a very loud blast of the horn. Moses led the people {{to the foot of}} the mountain. Mount Sinai was all in smoke, the mountain trembled violently, the blare of the horn grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> and God answered Moses in thunder.|$|E
25|$|Higher wind {{pressures}} {{increased the}} speaking volume of theatre organ pipes, {{and they were}} placed in chambers, usually high in the auditorium. The fronts of these chambers were covered {{with a set of}} swell shades which opened and closed like venetian blinds. When closed, the sound of the organ was reduced to a whisper. With a foot pedal, the organist could gradually open the shutters to produce <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> sounds from the same pipes. Although this type of swell chamber was not new, theatre organ developments permitted a much broader dynamic range than ever before.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{theme of}} the game {{features}} a neo-Gregorian chant, which was performed in studio by a 135-voice choir. Much of the underscore music that plays when the player is exploring the game, rather than during cinematic scenes, is based upon that opening scene. The composers made use of silence in many scenes, to build up tension for moments of a [...] "pounce" [...] effect, creating the effect with music that something is catching the listener. They deliberately saved the most intense music for the final chapter of Phantasmagoria, when the game becomes the most intense. During some chase scenes, drums and low strings {{are used in the}} score to simulate a heartbeat, which grows <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> during more dangerous moments.|$|E

A furious, intense clapping broke out as the bishop stood frozen. <b>Louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> it grew, with accusations of 'Traitor' and 'Judas' chanted at Lennon. Those in the pews burst into religious and patriotic hymns, 'Boze Cos Polske' and 'Serdeczna Matko.' This went on for approximately 15 minutes.

2500|$|Boston {{had taken}} {{an active role in}} the protests against the Stamp Act of 1765. Its merchants avoided the customs duties which angered London {{officials}} and led to a crackdown on smuggling. Governor Thomas Pownall (1757 to 1760) tried to be conciliatory, but his replacement Governor Francis Bernard [...] (1760–69) was a hard-liner who wanted to stamp out the opposition voices that were growing <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> in town meetings and pamphlets. Historian Pauline Maier says that his letters to London greatly influenced officials there, but they [...] "distorted" [...] reality. [...] "His misguided conviction that the 'faction' had espoused violence as its primary method of opposition, for example, kept him from recognizing the radicals' peace-keeping efforts....Equally dangerous, Bernard's elaborate accounts were sometimes built on insubstantial evidence." [...] Warden argues that Bernard was careful not to explicitly ask London for troops, but his exaggerated accounts strongly suggested they were needed. In the fall of 1767 he warned about a possible insurrection in Boston any day, and his exaggerated report of one disturbance in 1768, [...] "certainly had given Lord Hillsboro the impression that troops were the only way to enforce obedience in the town." [...] Warden notes that other key British officials in Boston wrote London with the [...] "same strain of hysteria." [...] Four thousand British Army troops arrived in Boston in October 1768 as a massive show of force; tensions escalated.|$|E

50|$|This is Smart Volume Management. It is a {{compressor}} that evens out the dynamic range {{of any given}} source so that quieter sounds are <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>loud</b> sounds are quiet. It is best used in circumstances where noise disturbance might be an issue, Late at night for instance. Otherwise it is generally preferable to have it disabled as it does make the sound less dynamic and you don't get {{the full impact of}} loud parts in films, music also sounds less lively.|$|R

50|$|A {{potential}} {{disadvantage of}} AGC {{is that when}} recording something like music with quiet <b>and</b> <b>loud</b> passages such as classical music, the AGC will tend to make the quiet passages <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> the <b>loud</b> passages quieter, compressing the dynamic range; {{the result can be}} a reduced musical quality if the signal is not re-expanded when playing, as in a companding system.|$|R
