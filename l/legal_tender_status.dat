5|$|Section 207 {{repealed}} obsolete {{limitations on}} wastage in the Mint's operations, but directed that administrative regulations be developed on the subject, {{which could be}} more easily changed. Section 208 repealed a provision of the 1873 act requiring coinage dies for the obverse, which are dated, to be destroyed {{at the end of}} each year. Section 209 rephrased statutory provisions allowing the Treasury to sell silver at a price not less than $1.292929 per ounce, and allowed it to sell silver to other government departments for less. Section 210 repealed the 1933 provision regarding the <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status</b> of coins.The law prior to 1965 made it a felony to forge silver coins; this was amended by section 211 to forbid the counterfeiting of coins with denomination greater than five cents. Section 212 made using coins as security for loans a misdemeanor if the secretary hasemade a proclamation in the Federal Register proscribing their use as collateral.|$|E
25|$|Until 1988, the Bank of England issued {{one pound}} notes, and these notes did have <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status</b> in Scotland and Northern Ireland while they existed. The Currency and Bank Notes Act 1954 defined Bank of England notes {{of less than}} £5 in value as legal tender in Scotland. Since the English £1 note was removed from {{circulation}} in 1988, this leaves a legal curiosity in Scots law whereby there is no paper legal tender in Scotland. The UK Treasury has proposed extending <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status</b> to Scottish banknotes. The proposal has been opposed by Scottish nationalists who claim it would reduce {{the independence of the}} Scottish banking sector.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, {{gold coins}} were <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> to any amount, but silver coins were not <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> for sums over 2 pounds nor bronze for sums over 1 shilling. This {{provision}} was retained in revised form at {{the introduction of}} decimal currency, and the Coinage Act 1971 laid down that coins denominated above 10 pence became <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, non-bronze coins denominated not more than 10 pence became <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> for payment not exceeding 20 pence.|$|R

25|$|Hepburn v. Griswold (75 U.S. 603), 1870, which {{declared}} {{certain parts}} of the <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> acts to be unconstitutional.

50|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>tender</b> is {{a medium}} of payment {{recognized}} by a legal {{system to be}} valid for meeting a financial obligation. Paper currency and coins are common forms of <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in many countries. <b>Legal</b> <b>tender</b> is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually <b>legal</b> <b>tender.</b> The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as <b>legal</b> <b>tender.</b> Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by <b>legal</b> <b>tender.</b> For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency.|$|R

25|$|When the Irish Free State {{came into}} {{existence}} in 1922, three categories of banknote were in circulation. These consisted of notes issued by the Bank of England, the British Treasury and six Irish banks then in existence who were chartered to issue notes. Only British Treasury notes had <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status</b> within the state. The issuing of banknotes by multiple private institutions was an everyday aspect of banking in Great Britain and Ireland {{at the time and}} indeed remains so in Northern Ireland and Scotland today.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the United Kingdom, coins valued 1 pound, 2 pounds, and 5 pounds Sterling are <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in {{unlimited}} amounts. Twenty pence {{pieces and}} fifty pence pieces are <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in amounts up to 10 pounds; five pence pieces and ten pence pieces are <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in amounts up to 5 pounds; and pennies and two pence coins are <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in amounts up to 20 pence. In {{accordance with the}} Coinage Act 1971, gold sovereigns are also <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> for any amount. Although it is not specifically mentioned on them, the face values of gold coins are 50p; £1; £2; and £5, a mere fraction of their worth as bullion. Five pound coins, although <b>legal</b> <b>tender,</b> are intended as souvenirs and are almost never seen in circulation.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Legal</b> <b>Tender</b> Cases were {{a series}} of United States Supreme Court cases {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century that affirmed the {{constitutionality}} of paper money. In the 1869 case of Hepburn v. Griswold, the Court had held that declaring paper notes to be <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in payment of debts existing prior to the <b>Legal</b> <b>Tender</b> Act of 1862 violated the United States Constitution. In the <b>Legal</b> <b>Tender</b> Cases, the Court overruled Hepburn, beginning with Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis in 1871, and then Juilliard v. Greenman in 1884.|$|R

25|$|The Australian Gold Nugget is a {{gold bullion}} coin minted by the Perth Mint. The coins have been minted in {{denominations}} of 1/20 oz, 1/10 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz, 1 oz, 2 oz, 10 oz, and 1 kg of 24 carat gold. They have <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status</b> in Australia and {{are one of}} few legal tender bullion gold coins to change their design every year, another being the Chinese Gold Panda. This and their limited annual mintage may, unlike for many other bullion coins, raise their numismatic value over the value of gold used.|$|E
25|$|On 31 December 2001, {{the total}} value of Irish {{banknotes}} in circulation was €4,343.8 million, and {{the total value}} of Irish coins was €387.9 million. The Irish cash changeover was one of the fastest in the eurozone, with some shops illegally ceasing to accept pounds after the first week or two. With a conversion factor of 0.787564 Irish pounds to the euro, 56%, by value, of Irish banknotes was withdrawn from circulation within two weeks of the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, and 83.4% by the time they ceased to have <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
25|$|Maundy {{money is}} a {{ceremonial}} coinage traditionally given to the poor, and nowadays awarded annually to deserving senior citizens. There are Maundy coins in denominations of one, two, three and four pence. They bear dates from 1822 to the present and are minted in very small quantities. Though they are legal tender in the UK, they are never encountered in circulation. The pre-decimal Maundy pieces have the same <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status</b> and value as post-decimal ones, and effectively increased in face value by 140% upon decimalisation. Their numismatic value is much greater.|$|E
25|$|The Swiss franc is the {{currency}} and <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> of Switzerland and Liechtenstein and also <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in the Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia.

50|$|In 1847, the Colonial Bank of Issue {{became the}} only issuer of <b>legal</b> <b>tender.</b> In 1856, however the Colonial Bank of Issue was disbanded and through the Paper Currency Act 1856, the Union Bank was {{confirmed}} once again as an issuer of <b>legal</b> <b>tender.</b> The Act also authorised the Oriental Bank to issue <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> but this bank ceased operations in 1861.|$|R
50|$|The United Precious Metals Association is a Utah-based {{non-profit}} {{dedicated to}} offering its members gold and/or silver denominated accounts.

25|$|Trade dollars did not {{circulate}} in the United States initially, {{but were}} legal tender {{for up to}} $5. Things changed, however, in 1876, {{when the price of}} silver spiraled downward as western producers dumped silver on the market, making the trade dollar worth more at face value than its silver content. That resulted in trade dollars pouring back into the United States, as they were bought for as little as the equivalent of 80 US cents in Asia, and were then spent at $1 in the United States. This prompted Congress to revoke their <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status,</b> and restrict their coinage to exportation demand only. However, this did not stop unscrupulous persons from buying trade dollars at bullion value, and using them for payment as $1 to unsuspecting workers and merchants.|$|E
500|$|Numismatic {{historian}} Walter Breen criticized {{both the}} legal tender provision and the coin in general, {{stating that the}} coin's issuance was [...] "an expensive mistake– its motivation mere greed, its design a triumph of dullness, its domestic circulation and <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status</b> a disastrous provision of law leading only to ghastly abuses." [...] During the 1870s an attempt by Japan to introduce its own trade dollar to China fared no better.|$|E
500|$|The bill provided, in part, for the {{striking}} of trade dollars which held <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>status</b> {{up to five}} dollars. The legal tender provision was added by a last-minute rider {{at the behest of}} silver interests. At the insistence of Ohio Senator John Sherman, the weight and fineness of the piece was indicated on the reverse, an attribution which numismatic historian Don Taxay found incomprehensible as [...] "Chinese merchants would never understand them".|$|E

Thus <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in Scotland is limited to coin.|$|R
