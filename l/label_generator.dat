40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a prototype web search results clustering engine that enhances search results by performing fuzzy clustering on web documents returned by conventional search engines, {{as well as}} ranking the results and labeling the resulting clusters. This is done using a fuzzy transduction-based clustering algorithm (FTCA), which employs a transduction-based relevance model (TRM) to generate document relevance values. These relevance values are used to cluster similar documents, rank them, and facilitate a term frequency based <b>label</b> <b>generator.</b> The membership degrees of documents to fuzzy clusters also facilitates effective detection and removal of overly similar clusters. FTCA is compared against two other established web document clustering algorithms: Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) and Lingo, which are provided by the free open source Carrot 2 Document Clustering Workbench. To measure cluster quality, an extended version of the classic precision measurement is used {{to take into account}} relevance and fuzzy clustering, along with recall and F 1 score.

40|$|This paper details a modular, {{self-contained}} web {{search results}} clustering system that enhances search results by (i) performing clustering on lists of web documents returned by queries to search engines, and (ii) ranking {{the results and}} labeling the resulting clusters, by using a calculated relevance value as a degree of membership to clusters. In addition, we demonstrate an external evaluation method based on precision for comparing fuzzy clustering techniques, as well as internal measures suitable for working on non-training data. The built-in <b>label</b> <b>generator</b> uses the membership degrees and relevance values to weight the most relevant results more heavily. The membership degrees of documents to fuzzy clusters also facilitate effective detection and removal of overly similar clusters. To achieve this, our transductionbased clustering algorithm (TCA) and its fuzzy counterpart (FTCA) employ a transduction-based relevance model (TRM) to consider local relationships between each web document.

The federal district court, in two separate orders, disposed of the action in Caterpillar's favor. Generac then challenged the lower court's rulings in the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Generac's claims were properly dismissed by the lower court.

40|$|Abstract. Real-world graphs or {{networks}} tend {{to exhibit}} a well-known set of properties, such as heavy-tailed degree distributions, clustering and community formation. Much {{effort has been}} directed into creating realistic and tractable mod-els for unlabelled graphs, which has yielded insights into graph structure and evolution. Recently, attention has moved to creating models for labelled graphs: many real-world graphs are labelled with both discrete and numeric attributes. In this paper, we present AGWAN (Attribute Graphs: Weighted and Numeric), a generative model for random graphs with discrete labels and weighted edges. The model is easily generalised to edges labelled with an arbitrary number of numeric attributes. We include algorithms for fitting {{the parameters of the}} AGWAN model to real-world graphs and for generating random graphs from the model. Using real-world directed and undirected graphs as input, we compare our approach to state-of-the-art random <b>labelled</b> graph <b>generators</b> and draw conclusions about the contribution of discrete vertex labels and edge weights to graph structure...|$|R

Most networks exhibit a well-known set of properties, such as heavy-tailed degree distributions, clustering and community formation. Usually, random graph models consider only structural information, but many real-world networks also have labelled vertices and weighted edges. In this paper, we present a generative model for random graphs with discrete vertex labels and numeric edge weights. The weights are represented {{as a set of}} Beta Mixture Models (BMMs) with an arbitrary number of mixtures, which are learned from real-world networks. We propose a Bayesian Variational Inference (VI) approach, which yields an accurate estimation while keeping computation times tractable. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art random <b>labelled</b> graph <b>generators</b> and an earlier approach based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).

40|$|Most {{existing}} saliency models use low-level features or task descriptions when generating attention predictions. However, {{the link}} between observer characteristics and gaze patterns is rarely investigated. We present a novel saliency prediction technique which takes viewers' identities and personal traits into consideration when modeling human attention. Instead of only computing image salience for average observers, we consider the interpersonal variation in the viewing behaviors of observers with different personal traits and backgrounds. We present an enriched derivative of the GAN network, which is able to generate personalized saliency predictions when fed with image stimuli and specific information about the observer. Our model contains a generator which generates grayscale saliency heat maps based on the image and an observer <b>label.</b> The <b>generator</b> is paired with an adversarial discriminator which learns to distinguish generated salience from ground truth salience. The discriminator also has the observer label as an input, which contributes to the personalization ability of our approach. We evaluate the performance of our personalized salience model by comparison with a benchmark model along with other un-personalized predictions, and illustrate improvements in prediction accuracy for all tested observer groups...|$|R
