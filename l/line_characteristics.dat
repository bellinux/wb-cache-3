5000|$|A {{terminal}} list, {{specified by}} the [...] macro, identified the terminals attached to the line. This macro specified the <b>line</b> <b>characteristics</b> - start-stop, bisync, point-to-point, multipoint, leased line or dial [...] - [...] {{and the type of}} polling required - [...] wrap around or open. The polling characters or telephone number used to identify each specific remote device on the line was coded. The [...] macro could be used to modify information for a specific device in the list during execution. A wrap-around polling list would cause each device in the list to be polled sequentially by the channel until a response was received, This reduced the load on the CPU for continuous polling.|$|E
50|$|Distance {{protection}} detects both voltage and current. A fault on {{a circuit}} will generally create a sag in the voltage level. If {{the ratio of}} voltage to current measured at the relay terminals, which equates to an impedance, lands within a predetermined level the circuit breaker will operate. This is useful for reasonable length lines, lines longer than 10 miles, because its operating characteristics {{are based on the}} <b>line</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This means that when a fault appears on the line the impedance setting in the relay is compared to the apparent impedance of the line from the relay terminals to the fault. If the relay setting is determined to be below the apparent impedance it is determined that the fault is within the zone of protection. When the transmission line length is too short, less than 10 miles, distance protection becomes more difficult to coordinate. In these instances the best choice of protection is current differential protection.|$|E

We have also simulated an ADSL modem and run the simulation for the two different media. The comparison includes data rate, BER and transmitting power and proves that power lines need much more energy per transmitting bit under similar circumstances in order to transmit more than 1 Mbps. This increased energy could probably lead to EMC problems and it is towards this direction that study should continue. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{attempt is}} made to combine {{standard}} decomposition techniques and genetic programming approaches, for the induction of generalized approximate throughput formulas in short exponential serial production lines with finite intermediate buffers. The domain of serial production lines lacks the existence of general formulas for acquiring useful measurements and <b>line</b> <b>characteristics,</b> such as throughput. Throughput approximation in literature takes place usually {{with the aid of}} algorithmic computer-based decomposition techniques. In this paper, decomposition-based data for every different number of stations are used as training cases into a genetic programming scheme, which tries to generalize the calculation of throughput within a single mathematical formula. The proposed formula, obtains accuracy higher than 99 % for the training (i. e,. known) data, whereas, it deviates, on average, 5 - 15 % from the accurate decomposed value, for testing (i. e. unknown) production <b>line</b> <b>characteristics...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines are important preclinical models {{in the search for}} novel and targeted therapies to treat head and neck cancer. Unlike many other cancer types, a wide variety of primary and metastatic HNSCC cell lines are available. An easily accessible guide that organizes important characteristics of HNSCC cell lines would be valuable for the selection of appropriate HNSCC cell lines for in vitro or in vivo studies. Methods. A literature search was performed. Results. Cell growth and culture parameters from HNSCC cell lines were catalogued into tables or lists of selected characteristics. Methods for establishing cancer cell lines and basic cell culture maintenance techniques were reviewed. Conclusions. A compendium of HNSCC cell <b>line</b> <b>characteristics</b> is useful for organizing the accumulating information regarding cell <b>line</b> <b>characteristics</b> to assist investigators with the development of appropriate preclinical models. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Abstract — A {{micromachining}} {{process has}} been developed to fabricate high aspect ratio CPW. The tall conductor sidewall created from the high aspect ratio process reduces the resistance per length of the transmission line which lowers the attenuation. The micromachining process combines Si DRIE, thermal oxidation, electroplating, and planarization to create tall CPW with Au conductors and SiO 2 dielectrics. Transmission lines with characteristic impedances of 16 - 21 ȍ have been fabricated on high resistivity Si.
