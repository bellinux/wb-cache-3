Nevertheless, there is recognition that the number of Cornish speakers is growing.

The four basic milieu language strategies; model, mand-model, time delay, and incidental teaching, can be embedded into daily routines and interaction to teach language skills to children within a supportive context. Three Head Start teachers and nine children, three native English speakers and six native Spanish speakers, participated in the school year-long study. The teachers received training and coaching to effectively implement the milieu strategies. The aim of this study was to examine how instructional strategies created and implemented from a special education perspective based on recommended teaching practices can be used with children learning English as a second language as a means of providing teachers with developmentally appropriate strategies and providing children learning English as a second language with consistent comprehensible input. This study recognizes that children with special needs and children learning English as a second language do not necessarily have similar cognitive abilities and learning needs.

Therefore, high school students should know and manage their strategies in learning English.

This present study is aimed at investigating the learning strategies of science and social students of SMA Brawijaya Smart School and the correlation between the academic major and <b>language</b> learning <b>strategies.</b> The approach used is quantitative study. The participants of this study were 113 students consisting of 71 science and 42 social students. The survey comprised an individual background questionnaire and <b>Strategy</b> Inventory for <b>Language</b> Learning (SILL) adopted from Oxford (1990). This study reveals that the students moderately employs the six categories of learning strategies in their learning process. This finding can be measured by the overall <b>language</b> learning <b>strategies</b> which fall into medium level. The result shows that metacognitive strategies are the most frequently used by the students whereas affective strategies are the lowest frequently used.
