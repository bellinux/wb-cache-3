25|$|A fervent {{champion}} of the professional cricketer's rights, Shaw did a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> support of his contemporaries. He declined to tour with WG Grace in 1873/74 because the professionals in the squad were to be afforded only second-class facilities. In 1881, he led a strike of Notts professionals, demanding a formal contract of employment to guarantee an automatic benefit {{at the end of}} an agreed playing period. The high-handed Nottinghamshire committee thought this absolute anarchy and, apparently justified in its feeling that an amateur skipper was the way to go, dropped every member of the offending faction from the side. There was eventually a reconciliation, however, and Shaw took on the capaincy once more.|$|E

After sales slowed down, Rogers joined a jazz group called The Bobby Doyle Three, who got a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> clubs thanks to a reasonable fan following. The group recorded for Columbia Records. They disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for Mercury Records, called [...] "Here's That Rainy Day", failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers, including country artists Mickey Gilley and Eddy Arnold. In 1966 he joined the New Christy Minstrels as a singer and double bass player.|$|E
2500|$|In 1906 Martha {{started to}} study Mathematics and Natural {{sciences}} at Berlin University {{and the so-called}} [...] "Technical Academy" [...] in Charlottenburg, funding her studies {{through a combination of}} private tutoring, bursaries and journalism. [...] In 1908 she switched to medicine which she studied till 1914, receiving her doctorate in medicine in 1915. [...] She had studied subjects which were traditionally male preserves, but the labour shortages resulting from the slaughter of the First World War would open up opportunities after 1918 which most observers in 1914 would have regarded as still unrealistic. [...] During the First World War she worked in a hospital. [...] After 1918 she set herself up as a doctor in the Berlin quarter of Niederschöneweide. [...] Her feminism and her leftwing political commitment meant that the focus of her work was on working class women: sources describe her as a gynaecologist which, whether through training or practical experience, she became. [...] This also involved a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the area of birth control, which then as throughout the twentieth century was frequently border-line controversial.|$|E
