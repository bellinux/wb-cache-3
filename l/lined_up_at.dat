5|$|Cancellara {{began the}} 2013 {{campaign}} with the Tour of Qatar and the Tour of Oman, {{but failed to}} collect any victories. After finishing the aforementioned tours, he raced the Strade Bianche and finished in fourth place. Next, Cancellara raced the Tirreno–Adriatico. He came close to a stage victory in the race's stage seven individual time trial, but missed the win by twelve seconds. Just five days later, Cancellara <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Milan–San Remo, where he was considered by many as a favorite to win the race. The race was marred by poor weather conditions, but Cancellara remained near the front and managed to place third overall after losing out in the sprint for the finish line.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Swimming Union (ASU) did not {{recognise}} {{times that}} had been recorded in short-course pools in the United States, so Evans was forced to return for the Australian Championships {{to qualify for the}} 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane. Despite winning neither of the breaststroke events, Evans successfully earned selection and <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m breaststroke and the 4×100m medley relay. In his favoured 100m event, Evans won bronze, having been led home by Adrian Moorhouse of England and Canada's Victor Davis. In the 200m event, Evans came fourth, almost four seconds behind the victorious Davis. He then combined with David Orbell, Jon Sieben and Brooks to win the medley relay in a Commonwealth Games record time. Canada reached the wall far ahead of Australia, but were disqualified for a premature changeover.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E
50|$|Ngata {{is known}} {{throughout}} the NFL {{for being a}} very versatile player.

In their 4-2 nickel package, he <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> defensive tackle. This versatility makes Ngata {{one of the most}} dominant defensive linemen in the NFL.|$|R

5|$|Buemi was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session; his best lap time of 1.38:586 was half a second off Vettel's pace in the second session. He was {{disappointed}} as he had Barrichello ahead of him driving towards turn 25 on his final timed lap which caused Buemi to reduce his speed and it cost him two tenths of a second. Rosberg took 12th position. Sutil had no grip {{in his car and}} qualified in 13th. His teammate Liuzzi clinched 14th place' he was affected by oversteer and struggled with driving on his car's soft tyres. Schumacher was unable to get his tyres working to his preference and was affected with a right-front brake problem which restricted him to qualifying in 15th. Schumacher's qualifying effort was criticised by the Formula One paddock. Pedro de la Rosa took 16th having struggled with a lack of grip on the super soft compound tyres. Jaime Alguersuari drove hard but experienced a lack of top speed and clinched 17th. Kamui Kobayashi failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session; he flat-spotted his front super soft compound tyres on his first timed lap which caused him to feel vibrations in his car. The two Lotus cars of Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen qualified in 19th and 20th positions, ahead of both Virgin drivers Lucas di Grassi and Timo Glock in 21st and 22nd. Both Hispania drivers <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the back of the field (with Karun Chandhok ahead of Senna).|$|E

25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, Patriots wide {{receiver}} Deion Branch caught 4 passes for 71 yards on a drive that ended with Brady's 2-yard touchdown pass to Vrabel, who <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the tight end spot on the play. The Eagles later tied the game with 3:39 {{left in the third}} period with a 74-yard, 10-play drive that was capped by McNabb's 10-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook.

25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, the Colts marched down the field and scored with a 1-yard run by Manning. Then, after forcing a punt, a 25-yard {{reception}} by Dallas Clark and a 19-yard run by Dominic Rhodes moved {{the ball to the}} Patriots' 32-yard line. Following an incorrect pass interference penalty (a non existent face guarding penalty) on defensive back Ellis Hobbs in the end zone, Manning threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to defensive lineman Dan Klecko, who had <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the fullback position on the play. Then, receiver Marvin Harrison caught a 2-point conversion pass to tie the game at 21.|$|E
25|$|The 1912 Giro d'Italia {{saw some}} big changes {{to how the}} general {{classification}} was to be run; the race was to be centered around the team instead of the individual, meaning that {{the leader of the}} race would be a single team. Teams were allowed only four riders for each squad and were awarded points towards the general classification based on stage placings. The changes to the general classification were met with strong opposition from the start. Fourteen teams <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the start in Milan. Atala-Dunlop, which consisted of Luigi Ganna, Carlo Galetti, Eberardo Pavesi, and Giovanni Micheletto, led the race from start to finish. Ganna was the only member of Atala-Dunlop that didn't finish the race, as he dropped out during the fifth stage. Galetti became the first three-time winner of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the fall}} and winter of 1939, Seabiscuit's fitness seemed to improve by the day. By the end of the year, Smith was ready to return the horse to race training, with a {{collection}} of stable jockeys in the saddle. By the time of his comeback race, Pollard had cajoled Howard into allowing him the ride. After the horse was scratched due to soft going, the pair finally <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the start of the La Jolla Handicap at Santa Anita, on February 9, 1940. Seabiscuit was third, beaten by two lengths. By their third comeback race, Seabiscuit was back to his winning ways, running away from the field in the San Antonio Handicap to beat his erstwhile training partner, Kayak II, by two and a half lengths. Under , Seabiscuit equalled the track record for a mile and 1/16.|$|E
25|$|While {{potentially}} hamstrung {{in attempts}} to install a new offensive system by the NFL lockout, the Browns played through {{the first half of}} the 2011 season at or near the bottom of the league in almost every offensive category. Starting several rookies, Shurmur's team was frequently beset by confusion in personnel and play-calling at critical junctures. Early in the year, the defense surrendered a touchdown on a failure to break the defensive huddle, and the team's chances in several games were compromised by a host of special-teams mistakes and meltdowns. At the midpoint of the season, in a telling series in which Shurmur called for a conservative ball-protection strategy, the Browns recovered their own fumble resulting from a mistakenly called handoff to a third-string tight end <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> fullback, only to botch a short go-ahead field goal attempt with a failed snap and uncoordinated line movement.|$|E
25|$|Cincinnati {{received}} the opening kickoff {{of the second}} half, and exclusively ran {{the ball on the}} first several plays of the drive, even to the extent that Shaq Washington replaced Kay at quarterback, the latter of whom <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> wide receiver; on third down and nine, however, Kay returned to quarterback on a passing play, but was sacked for the fifth time of the game, and the Bearcats were forced to punt, and Switzer tied the NCAA-record with his fifth punt return touchdown of the season, recording an 86-yard touchdown; the extra point was no good. CINCY finally scored a touchdown on their subsequent drive, via a 15-yard rush by Ralph Abernathy, making the score 29–10. On the ensuing kickoff, CINCY kicked the ball out of bounds, setting up UNC with solid field position at their own 35-yard line. Early in the drive Eric Ebron, hurdled a defender and hit the ground hard, but quickly re-entered the game, and caught another pass just a few plays later. Later in the drive, Switzer made a catch that converted a fourth down in the red zone; moments later, Morris rushed for a 1-yard touchdown. This time, the extra point was good to culminate a 13-play, 65-yard drive that encapsulated 4:36. CINCY's ensuing drive stalled, and they punted; Switzer made a fair catch. In the waning seconds of the quarter, CINCY entered the red zone.|$|E

25|$|These Amnesia Fortnight periods proved fortuitous, as Schafer {{considers}} {{these to}} {{have kept the}} company viable. Upon completion of Brütal Legend, Double Fine started work on its sequel, but was told to stop development shortly after as Electronic Arts decided against publishing it. With no other publishing deals <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the time, Schafer {{turned back to the}} eight game ideas developed from Amnesia Fortnight, believing they could be developed further into short, complete games. Schafer also looked at the success of smaller focused games like Geometry Wars on the various download services, realizing the potential market for similar titles. Schafer and his team selected the best four, and began shopping the games to various publishers, and successfully worked publishing details with these. Two of these games, Costume Quest and Stacking, were picked up by THQ and released digitally on the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network storefronts; both games were considered successful and THQ expressed interest in helping Double Fine produce similar titles in the future. Iron Brigade (originally titled Trenched but changed due to trademark issues) was developed as an Xbox Live Arcade game in association with Microsoft Game Studios, and similarly received positive praise from journalists. A fourth game, , was published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in association with the Sesame Workshop for the Xbox 360 using the Kinect controller; though initially not a licensed title, Schafer and his team found it to be an ideal fit for their first licensed-property game. The four unused ideas may be used for a game in the future, according to Schafer, but believes some of them may be unsellable to a publisher.|$|E
