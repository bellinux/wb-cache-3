40|$|True Â¡ctalSPECT can {{accurately}} demonstrate perfusion in creases in the epileptogenic area {{but often}} requires dedicated personnel {{waiting at the}} bedside to accomplish the injection. We investigated the value of perfusion changes as measured by ictal or immediate postictal SPECT in <b>localizing</b> the epileptogenic region in refractory partial epilepsy. Methods: Quantitative perfu sion difference images were calculated by registering, normaliz ing and subtracting ictal (or immediate postictal) from interictal SPECT for 53 patients with refractory epilepsy. Perfusion differ ence SPECT results were compared with visually interpreted SPECT, scalp electroencephalography (EEG), MRI, PET and intracranial EEG. Results: In 43 patients (81 %), discrete areas of increased perfusion (with ictal injections) or decreased perfu sion (with postictal injections) were noted. Interictal scalp EEG was <b>localizing</b> in 28 patients (53 %), ictal scalp EEG was localiz ing in 35 patients (66 %) and intracranial EEG was <b>localizing</b> in 22 patients (85 %) (of 26 patients who underwent invasive study). MRI was <b>localizing</b> in 34 patients (64 %), PET was <b>localizing</b> in 32 of 45 patients (71 %), interictal SPECT was <b>localizing</b> in 26 patients (49 %) and peri-ictal SPECT (visual interpretation) was <b>localizing</b> in 30 patients (57 %). By comparison with an intracra nial EEG standard of localization, SPECT subtraction analysis had 86 % sensitivity and 75 % specificity. Conclusion: Our data provide evidence that SPECT perfusion difference analysis has higher sensitivity and specificity than any other noninvasive <b>localizing</b> criterion and can <b>localize</b> epileptogenic regions with accuracy comparable with that of intracranial EEG. To obtain these results, one must apply knowledge of {{the timing of the}} ictal injection relative to seizure occurrence...|$|R

5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently <b>localized</b> to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and <b>localized)</b> can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
