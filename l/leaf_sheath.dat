500|$|Based on {{the rules}} of botanical nomenclature, the oldest {{properly}} published name for a species has priority over newer names. [...] Bartram applied the Linnaean binomial Palma elata to a [...] "large, solitary palm with an ashen white trunk topped by a green <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath</b> [...] and pinnate leaves" [...] growing in central Florida. [...] While no type collection is known, {{there are no other}} native palms that would fit Bartram's description. [...] In 1946 Francis Harper pointed out that Bartram's name was valid and proposed a new combination, Roystonea elata. [...] Liberty Hyde Bailey's use of the name in his 1949 revision of the genus, established its usage.|$|E
500|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{an annual}} herb with stems that are {{typically}} decumbent, {{meaning that they}} are prostrate at the base but become erect towards the tips, but some individuals may be simply erect. The diffusely branched stems tend to root at the basal nodes. The pubescence on the stems is variable, but common patterns include a line of hair continuous with the <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath,</b> {{or they may be}} [...] basally, meaning hairless, and [...] towards the extremities, that is covered with fine hairs. The leaves are sessile: they lack a leaf stalk, also known as a petiole; or they may be subpetiolate, meaning they have very small petioles. The leaf sheaths are cylindrical, sometimes striped with red, and typically glabrous, but usually have margins that are puberulent or , meaning lined with fine, soft hairs. The leaf blades range from narrowly lanceolate, or lance-shaped, to ovate-elliptic, between egg-shaped and ellipse-shaped. They measure [...] by [...] wide. The blades range from glabrous to puberulent and have scabrescent, or slightly rough, margins. Their tips are acute, meaning they come to a point quickly, to , meaning the point develops gradually. The leaf bases are oblique, or uneven.|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} {{mechanisms of}} starch degradation in rice <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> at the post-heading stage, we investigated {{the function of}} OsBAM 2 and OsBAM 3, which encode plastid-targeted active β-amylase isoforms, in starch remobilization in <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths.</b> The starch content in the second <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> below the flag leaf (the third <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths)</b> peaked at the flag leaf emergence stage and gradually decreased until 15  days after heading. The mRNA levels of OsBAM 2 and OsBAM 3 in the third <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> increased from the flag leaf emergence stage to the heading stage when the starch content began to decrease. However, these mRNA levels did not always remain high during post-heading. Overexpression of OsBAM 2 or OsBAM 3 markedly repressed starch accumulation in the third <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths,</b> showing that OsBAM 2 and OsBAM 3 function in starch degradation in rice <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths.</b> In contrast, {{no significant differences in}} starch content in the third <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> were detected between knockdown plants of OsBAM 2 or OsBAM 3 and non-transgenic wild-type plants. Our results suggest that reduced expression of the individual genes, OsBAM 2 or OsBAM 3, does not result in excess accumulation of starch in the <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths,</b> probably because of the complementary function of another gene or the action of other genes encoding starch-degrading...|$|R
40|$|Similarities in {{structural}} {{organization of}} the culm in Poaceae, Juncaceae, and Cyperaceae such as <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> {{and the presence of}} intercalary meristems at every node suggest the same mechanical properties and, accordingly, the same functionality. Meristems are zones of tissue formation, which constitute areas of weakness along the entire culm and provide the basis for rapid shoot elongation. <b>Leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> clasp the culm preventing the shoot from breaking, ensuring the rigidity to grow erectly and to avoid damage of the meristematic tissue. The mechanical influence of <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> was investigated in members of Poaceae, Juncaceae, and Cyperaceae in the flowering stage. Mechanical properties of Poa araratica, Bromus erectus, Arrhenatherum elatius (Poaceae), Luzula nivea (Juncaceae), and Carex arctata (Cyperaceae) were determined in three-point bending before and after the removal of <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths.</b> The presence of <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> results in smoothing the distribution of flexural rigidity and therefore avoids stress peaks. The achieved maxima of relative contribution of <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> to entire flexural rigidity ranged from 55 % up to 81 % for Poaceae, 72 % for C. arctata, and 40 % for L. nivea. Across the investigated families, the mechanical role of <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> could be verified as essential for culm stability during development and beyond...|$|R

50|$|A ligule {{can also}} {{be defined as a}} membrane-like tissue or row of {{delicate}} hairs typically found in grasses at the junction of the <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath</b> and blade. The ligule appears to be a continuation of the <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath</b> and encircles or clasps the stem as does the <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath.</b> The three basic types of ligules are: membranous, a fringe of hairs (ciliate), and absent or lacking. Most grasses have ligules, and the shape, length, and appearance of the ligule margin provide consistent characters for separating genera and some species of grasses.|$|E
50|$|Feeding {{takes place}} behind the <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath.</b> The feeding lesion can be {{detected}} by cinnamon to chocolate-brown discoloration of the <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath.</b> When a new leaf begins development, a female will move to the new <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath,</b> produce male offspring and then establish a new feeding lesion. Thus, damage will often be observed on interior sheaths when the outer sheath is removed. This continues until the mite reaches the leaf nearest the stem. They also feed on developing panicles from the boot stage to the milk stage of heading.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the relationship between lodging resistance and chemical component contents in culms and <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> of rice, the physical strength and maximum bearing capacity of culm, and the contents and amounts of potassium (K), silicon (Si) and soluble sugars in culms and <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> were investigated using four japonica rice varieties with different lodging resistance characteristics during grain filling. There were significant differences in the total amounts of K, Si and soluble sugars in culms and <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> among the tested rice varieties. The difference in the total amount of Si was greater than that of K or soluble sugars. The physical strength and maximum bearing capacity of culm continuously decreased from heading to ripening, with a rapid decrease at the dough stage. However, the contents and total amounts of K and Si in culms and the Si content in <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> gradually increased and an accumulation of K and Si in culms was exhibited, whereas the content and total amount of K and the total amount of Si in <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> gradually decreased and an exportation of K and Si in <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> was presented. The physical strength was positively and significantly correlated with the total amounts of K and Si in culms during grain filling except that at the heading stage, the total amount of soluble sugars in culms at the heading and milky stages, the total amounts of Si and soluble sugars in <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> at the heading stage, the total amount of K in <b>leaf</b> <b>sheaths</b> at the heading and milky stages, and the maximum bearing capacity during grain filling. It is suggested that the lodging resistance of japonica rice would be improved by increasing the amount of soluble sugars in plants at the early filling stage, and enhancing the amount of Si in plants during grain filling through topdressing Si fertilizer at the early filling stage...|$|R

50|$|Attalea crassispatha has {{a single}} stem which grows up to 20 m tall. The stem is grey, up to 35 cm in diameter, and can be columnar, or {{slightly}} swollen {{at the base of}} the middle of the stem.

Leaves consist of a <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath</b> which wraps around the trunk, a rachis, from which the leaflets emerge, and a petiole, which connects the <b>leaf</b> <b>sheath</b> with the rachis.
