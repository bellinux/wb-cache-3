50|$|The {{location}} update procedure {{allows a}} mobile device {{to inform the}} cellular network, whenever it moves from one location area to the next. Mobiles are responsible for detecting location area codes (LAC). When a mobile finds that the <b>location</b> <b>area</b> <b>code</b> is different from its last update, it performs another update by sending to the network, a location update request, together with its previous location, and its Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI).|$|E
50|$|Each {{location}} {{area of a}} public land mobile network (PLMN) has its own unique identifier which is known as its {{location area}} identity (LAI). This internationally unique identifier is used for location updating of mobile subscribers. It is composed of a three decimal digit mobile country code (MCC), a two to three digit mobile network code (MNC) that identifies a Subscriber Module Public Land Mobile Network (SM PLMN) in that country, and a <b>location</b> <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (LAC) which is a 16 bit number with two special values, thereby allowing 65534 location areas within one GSM PLMN.|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{methods for}} <b>location</b> <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (LAC) {{planning}} in mobile networks require prediction {{values of the}} expected signaling traffic (paging, location update, etc.) {{that have to be}} provided by traffic and mobility models. Modeling can be based on a learning data set consisting of geographic information (population distribution, land use) as input data and performance measurement values from the operations and maintenance center (OMC) as output data. In this paper, the performance of fast modeling methods based on classification and regression trees (CART) is investigated and compared to linear regression analysis. It will be shown that a combination of these two methods shows modeling results of arbitrary accuracy. The analysis of the modeling performance is carried out by comparing the mobile terminated call (MTC) prediction values with OMC measurement values from a real network...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{withdrawn}} by the authors. With the rigorous growth of cellular network many mobility datasets are available publically, which attracted researchers to study human mobility fall under spatio-temporal phenomenon. Mobility profile building is main task in spatio-temporal trend analysis {{which can be}} extracted from the location information available in the dataset. The location information is usually gathered through the GPS, service provider assisted faux GPS and Cell Global Identity (CGI). Because of high power consumption and extra resource installation requirement in GPS related methods, Cell Global Identity is most inexpensive method and readily available solution for location information. CGI location information is four set head i. e. Mobile country code (MCC), Mobile network code (MNC), <b>Location</b> <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (LAC) and Cell ID, location information is retrieved in form of longitude and latitude coordinates through any of publically available Cell Id databases e. g. Google location API using CGI. However due to of fast growth in GSM network, change in topology by the GSM service provider and technology shift toward 3 G exact spatial extraction is somehow a problem in it, so location extraction must dealt with spatial outlier's problem first for mobility building. In this paper we proposed a methodology {{for the detection of}} spatial outliers from GSM CGI data, the proposed methodology is hierarchical clustering based and used the basic GSM network architecture properties...|$|E

For example, in the 213 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (a non-overlay <b>area</b> <b>code),</b> calls may be dialed as 7 digits (XXX-XXXX) or 1-213 + 7 digits. The manner in which a call is dialed does not affect the billing of the call. This [...] "permissive home <b>area</b> <b>code</b> dialing" [...] helps maintain uniformity and eliminates confusion given the different types of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> relief that has made California the nation's most [...] "area code" [...] intensive State. Unlike other states with overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> (Texas, Maryland, Florida and Pennsylvania and others), the California Public Utilities Commission and the New York State Public Service Commission maintain two different dial plans: Landlines must dial 1 + <b>area</b> <b>code</b> whenever an <b>Area</b> <b>Code</b> is part of the dialed digits while cellphone users can omit the [...] "1" [...] and just dial 10 digits.|$|R

Some individuals within the 905 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> region may have to dial long distance to reach each other; although residents of Mississauga and Hamilton share the same <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (905), an individual from Toronto, for example, would have to dial [...] "1" [...] to reach Hamilton, but not to reach Mississauga. Ten-digit telephone dialling, including the <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for local calls, is required throughout the GTA.

In 1996, <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 847 and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 630 were broken off from 708. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 464 is being reserved as an overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for 708 to provide additional numbering options for this area.|$|R
50|$|The new network design, {{completed}} in 1947, provided for 152 <b>area</b> <b>codes,</b> {{each with a}} capacity to serve 540 central offices.

The second <b>area</b> <b>code,</b> 202 {{was assigned to the}} District of Columbia. The allocation of <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> was readjusted as early as 1948 to account for inadequacies in some metropolitan areas.
