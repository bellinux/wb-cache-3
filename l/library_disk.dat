50|$|Ensoniq {{had made}} sure that their {{samplers}} were immediately useful by providing a sound library with every device. These <b>library</b> <b>disks</b> gave musicians {{a taste of what}} was possible with the sample-engine and also the sequencer, acting as usable sounds right out-of-the-box, demonstration pieces for selling more, and tastes of what the extensive library could provide. The ASR-10 was also fully backwards compatible with the earlier Ensoniq EPS and EPS-16+ sound libraries. Ensoniq continued their practice of creating and commissioning sound libraries that real musicians used. Even today, new libraries continue to be made by third parties.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{technological}} advances {{have resulted in}} the wide availability of commercial products offering near-line, robot-based, tertiary storage libraries. Thus, such libraries have become a crucial component of modern largescale storage servers, given the very large storage requirements of modern applications. Although the subject of optimal data placement (ODP) strategies has received considerable attention for other storage devices (such as magnetic and optical disks and disk arrays), the issue of optimal data placement in tertiary libraries has been neglected. The latter issue is more critical since tertiary storage remains three orders of magnitude slower than secondary storage. In this paper, we address this issue by deriving such optimal placement algorithms. First, we study the ODP problem in <b>disk</b> <b>libraries</b> (jukeboxes) and subsequently, in tape libraries. In our studies, we consider different scheduling algorithms, different configurations of <b>disk</b> <b>libraries</b> and different tape l [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|... pSOS (Portable Software On Silicon) is a {{real time}} {{operating}} system (RTOS), created in about 1982 by Alfred Chao, and developed/marketed {{for the first part}} of its life by his company Software Components Group (SCG). In the 1980s pSOS rapidly became the RTOS of choice for all embedded systems based on the Motorola 68000 family architecture, because it was written in 68000 assembler and was highly optimised from the start. It was also modularised, with early support for OS-aware debugging, plug-in device drivers, TCP/IP stacks, language <b>libraries</b> and <b>disk</b> subsystems. Later came source-level debugging, multi-processor support and further networking extensions.|$|R
50|$|Large {{quantities}} of individual magnetic tapes, and optical or magneto-optical discs may {{be stored in}} robotic tertiary storage devices.

40|$|Magnetic {{tape and}} optical <b>disk</b> <b>library</b> units (jukeboxes) are {{satisfying}} {{the demand for}} high-capacity cost-effective storage. The choice between optical disk and magnetic tape technology {{must take into account}} the cost limitations as well as the performance and reliability requirements of the user environment. Library units require data management software in order to function in an automated and user-transparent way. The most common data management applications are backup and recovery, data migration, and archiving. The medium access patterns that these applications create will be described. Since the most user visible application is data migration, a queue simulator was developed to model its performance against a variety of library units. The major subject of this paper is the design and implementation of this simulator as well as some simulation results. The relative cost and reliability of magnetic tape versus optical <b>disk</b> <b>library</b> units is presented for completeness...|$|R

40|$|Tape {{libraries}} {{are becoming}} more commonplace in various installations, whether they are used for automatic backups, archive or on-line storage. This work represents a freely distributable user-mode Clibrary that implements various SCSI commands of the Exabyte EXB- 210 unit. 1 Introduction Tape libraries {{are becoming more}} and more common in installations where large amounts of data need to be stored but also retrieved often for analysis. Up until recently mass storage systems were used only at scientific facilities but due to the development of new applications such as digital libraries, and electronic commerce the demands for storing enormous amounts of information while at the same time providing efficient access to this information is becoming commonplace.

Jukebox devices may {{have up to}} 2,000 slots for disks, and usually have a picking device that traverses the slots and drives. The arrangement of the slots and picking devices affects performance, depending on the space between a disk and the picking device.

This plugin simplifies sound edition (the DSS-1 uses a single slider for the 78 parameters of a sound, combined with numerical entry via the keypad). It is also able to load and save the complete synthesizer memory over MIDI, including the samples (avoiding the use of the DSS-1 floppy disk).

The Epoch-1 {{consisted}} of custom 68020-based CPU board running {{a modified version}} of the BSD 4.2 Unix operating system. The product was released in 1988 and provided 30GB of storage in its base configuration, expandable to 150GB. The server combined optical and magnetic storage and used HSM algorithms to automatically migrate files between the two types of media as required. The base 30GB model sold for $158,000 with one 30GB optical <b>disk</b> <b>library</b> unit and one 760MB magnetic disk drive. By making use of high capacity and comparatively inexpensive (for that time) optical storage the Epoch-1 provided high storage capacity at substantially lower cost than all-magnetic file servers.|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{security}} of cloud computing. Theoretical part of this thesis identifies options which generally lead to higher safety and availability of applications, regardless of the solution. A package of cloud services (called Productivity Suite) was defined, based on the customers' requirements, which is built on Microsoft platform and combined of the following products: Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Lync and is intended to be used by end customers. Specification of the service package, identified opportunities for strengthening the level of security and requirements of potential customers are the primary inputs for designing safe cloud infrastructure, which is the main contribution of this thesis. First step of designing infrastructure is to choose the service provider of data center, who will operate the solution. A decision must be made to select leased solution or owned components. The result of this part is a calculation, which contains all HW components (servers, firewalls, switches, tape <b>library</b> backups, <b>disk</b> arrays) and SW components considering the licensing policy, SSL certificate, domain, backup solution and other operating costs. The solution is limited by financial resources. The priority is safety, security and quality of services...|$|R
50|$|WYLBUR {{provides}} compressed Partitioned Data Sets (PDSs, aka <b>libraries)</b> to save <b>disk</b> space. In MVS {{source code}} is typically stored as {{a sequence of}} card images (80 character lines). If a line contained only one or just a few characters, 80 characters were still used to store that line. Even when data, e.g., source code, are stored as variable blocked (VB), space could be wasted on strings of embedded blanks. WYLBUR implements stream-oriented storage of text in PDSs, (and sequential data sets) so that a one character line might only take 16 characters (line length, offset, chunk length, character) rather than 80 to store. WYLBUR, or an external program run via JCL was used to convert files {{to and from the}} WYLBUR EDIT format.|$|R
40|$|Continuous Integration (CI) is {{a popular}} software-engineering {{methodology}} for co-working between programmers. The key function of CI is to run, build and test tasks automatically when a programmer wants to share his or her code or implement a feature. The primary objectives of CI are to prevent growing integration problems, and to provide feedback with useful information for resolving these issues easily and quickly. Despite extensive academic research and popular services in the industry, such as TravisCI, CircleCI or Jenkins, there is practically have limitations, which result from limited available resources, including budget and low computing power. Moreover, the diversity of modern computer environments, such as different operating systems, <b>libraries</b> or <b>disk</b> sizes, memory, and network speeds, increase both the costs for CI and difficulties in finding bugs automatically in every cases. This study aims to propose supplemental external and internal methods to solve the above obstacles. First, our approach enables programmers to configure different execution environments such as memory and network bandwidth during CI services. Then, we introduce an enhanced CI infrastructure that can efficiently schedule CI services based on resource-profiling techniques and our time-based scheduling algorithm, thereby reducing the overall CI time. Our case {{studies show that the}} proposed approaches can report the resource usage information after completing a CI service as well as improve the performance of an existing CI infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{storage system}} alternatives for movies-on-demand video servers. We begin by characterizing the movies-on-demand workload. Then we study disk farms {{in which one}} movie is stored per disk. This is a simple scheme, but it wastes substantial disk bandwidth, since disks holding less popular movies are under-utilized; also, good performance requires that movies be replicated to reflect the user request pattern. Next, we examine disk farms in which movies are striped across disks, and find that striped video servers offer close to full utilization of the disks by achieving better load balancing. Finally, we evaluate the use of storage hierarchies for video service that include a tertiary library along with a disk farm. Unfortunately, we show that the performance of neither magnetic tape <b>libraries</b> nor optical <b>disk</b> jukeboxes {{as part of a}} storage hierarchy is adequate to service the predicted distribution of movie accesses. We suggest changes to tertiary libraries that [...] ...|$|R
