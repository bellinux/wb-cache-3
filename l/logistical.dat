5|$|After {{completing}} his duties in Iran, Juskalian assumed {{the role of}} chief of operations and training at the headquarters of the First Army that commanded all U.S. Army installations in New England, New York and New Jersey. His posting in New York was cut short by the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and Juskalian was sent to France to join the 1st <b>Logistical</b> Command. When the 1st <b>Logistical</b> Command was merged with the 4th <b>Logistical</b> Command at Verdun, Juskalian was transferred to this command, serving as the G-3 chief of plans, operations and training.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the unit}} again {{deployed}} to combat, {{this time to}} Grenada in support of Operation Urgent Fury. It provided <b>logistical</b> support to the 82nd Airborne Division as the division deployed in the island, supporting US Special Forces operating within. Then in 1989, the unit supported the first combat jump since World War II while supporting Operation Just Cause in Panama. It provided <b>logistical</b> efforts to the division {{once again in the}} region.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and <b>logistical</b> support and was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable <b>logistical</b> support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|The primary <b>logistical</b> and {{strategic}} organizer was King's colleague Bayard Rustin.|$|E
5|$|A major <b>logistical</b> {{effort was}} {{required}} to transport the 80 member team to the Showgrounds on arrival at Perth airport. Royal Perth Hospital's special coach, a Red Cross bus, private cars and a truck to carry wheelchairs were used.|$|E
5|$|As at Darwin, Herring's primary {{difficulty}} was logistics. The {{troops on}} the Kokoda Track had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American <b>logistical</b> organisation, under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns, who in turn was answerable to Herring. Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips {{in order to develop}} the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the <b>logistical</b> turning point of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{superseded}} Rowell {{in command}} of New Guinea Force on 23 September. MacArthur visited Blamey in Port Moresby on 4 October 1942 and the two agreed to establish a Combined Operations Service Command (COSC) to co-ordinate <b>logistical</b> activities. To command it, MacArthur appointed Brigadier General Dwight Johns, the deputy commander of USASOS in SWPA, an expert on airbase construction. He was given an Australian deputy, Brigadier Victor Secombe, who had directed the rehabilitation of the port of Tobruk in 1941. All Australian and American <b>logistical</b> units were placed under COSC, which also controlled a fleet of small craft and luggers.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{remoteness}} of PIG and the <b>logistical</b> {{difficulties of}} caching enough {{fuel for the}} 04/05 expedition and future project(s), BAS used {{the resources of the}} United States Antarctic Program (USAP) and their ski-equipped LC130 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974, {{months after}} Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the {{province}} of Phuoc Long. General Trần Văn Trà sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion, {{as well as to}} solve <b>logistical</b> issues, before proceeding with the invasion.|$|E
5|$|In the North, {{by the end}} of the day, 1. Kavalleriedivision {{had reached}} the line Meppel–Groningen, delayed by <b>logistical</b> {{problems}} and Dutch demolition teams blowing up 236 bridges. Dutch troop strength in that area was weak.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, the US Far East Command {{directed}} the Eighth United States Army to {{assume responsibility for}} all <b>logistical</b> support of the United States and UN forces in Korea. including the ROK Army. Support for the American and South Korean armies came through the United States and Japan. The re-equipping of the ROK Army presented the UN forces with major <b>logistical</b> problems in July. The biggest challenge was a shortage of ammunition. Though logistics situations improved over time, ammunition was short {{for much of the}} war. Consumption of supplies differed among the various units and a lack of a previously drafted plan forced UN logisticians to create a system on the fly.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the prison}} the IRA had planned a <b>logistical</b> support {{operation}} involving 100 armed members, {{but due to}} a miscalculation of five minutes the prisoners found no transport waiting for them and were forced to flee across fields or hijack vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Section 2.3(c): The AFL shall provide command, communications, <b>logistical,</b> medical, transportation, and {{humanitarian}} {{support to the}} civil authority {{in the event of}} a natural or man-made disaster, outbreak of disease, or epidemic. Such assistance shall be authorized by the President of Liberia.|$|E
5|$|The 130th was {{headquartered}} at <b>Logistical</b> Support Area Anaconda for {{the majority}} of the deployment. Throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom, the headquarters commanded up to 15,000 engineers at one time, conducting missions including bridging, humanitarian assistance, topographic missions, dive missions, firefighting, base construction, river patrols, mine detection, missile removal and many more. Brigade units redeployed to Hanau in late 2003 and early 2004. Most of the brigade's soldiers returned to Hanau on 5 February 2004 after numerous <b>logistical</b> delays. Most of the 130th Engineer Brigade's subordinate units would receive Meritorious Unit Commendation for their roles in the invasion of Iraq, though the Brigade's headquarters did not.|$|E
5|$|The 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade is a {{sustainment}} brigade of the United States Army {{based at}} Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It provides <b>logistical</b> support to and {{is part of}} 82nd Airborne Division.|$|E
5|$|The same historians {{would not}} {{consider}} the immense <b>logistical</b> effort fielded by the U.S. to sustain its military in Southeast Asia as a waste of manpower and resources, even if only one American soldier in four assigned to South Vietnam served in the combat arms.|$|E
5|$|There were {{increasing}} {{signs of}} heavy communist <b>logistical</b> activity in southeastern Laos, activity which heralded {{just such a}} North Vietnamese offensive. Communist offensives usually took place near {{the conclusion of the}} Laotian dry season (from October through March) and, for PAVN <b>logistical</b> forces, the push to move supplies through the system came {{during the height of the}} season. One U.S. intelligence report estimated that 90 percent of PAVN materiel coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail was being funneled into the three northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, indicating forward stockpiling in preparation for offensive action. This build-up was alarming to both Washington and the American command, and prompted the perceived necessity for a spoiling attack to derail future communist objectives.|$|E
5|$|After Thiệu's resignation, the South Vietnamese {{military}} situation increasingly declined. On the 26th, the North Vietnamese {{launched an}} all-out attack to take Biên Hòa and the sprawling <b>logistical</b> complex at Long Binh {{from the south}} and southeast. Three days later, the port city of Vũng Tàu was under assault and the pressure against the Cu Chi front was intense.|$|E
5|$|After delays due to both <b>logistical</b> {{difficulties}} and poor weather, the D-Day of Overlord, the largest amphibious operation ever, was postponed 24 hours to 6 June 1944. Eisenhower and Montgomery, commander of 21st Army Group, aimed to capture Caen {{within the first}} day, and liberate Paris within 90 days.|$|E
5|$|After the North Korean {{infiltration}} on September 7 was repelled, the North Korean {{attack on}} Haman {{ground to a}} halt. The North Koreans, racked by <b>logistical</b> and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|As a wanted criminal, Anarky's {{methods and}} goals were {{described}} as leaving him with little <b>logistical</b> support amongst the heroic community, or the public at large, relegating him to underground operation. When in need of assistance, he would call on {{the help of the}} homeless community in Gotham who had supported him since his first appearance.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, {{a number}} of serious {{concerns}} confronted the company. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely <b>logistical</b> difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large power plant in India. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1938, McClelland {{researched}} {{the technical and}} <b>logistical</b> aspects of long-range air communications, an effort {{which resulted in the}} establishment of the Army Airways Communications System. Following this, he worked in the Operations and Training Division of the War Department General Staff, and served as chief of the Aviation division.|$|E
5|$|By 1968 the Americans {{were well}} aware of the scope and scale of the Cambodian <b>logistical</b> effort, but still {{remained}} reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Despite these improvements, {{a second}} {{invasion}} {{by the former}} Katangan gendarmerie, known as Shaba II in May–June 1978, was only dispersed with the despatch of the French 2e régiment étranger de parachutistes and a battalion of the Belgian Paracommando Regiment. Kamanyola Division units collapsed almost immediately. French units fought the Battle of Kolwezi to recapture the town from the FLNC. The U.S. provided <b>logistical</b> assistance.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Marine artillerymen of the 2nd Battalion, 13th Marines Regiment were {{supposed}} to support the Ngok Tavak garrison, their arrival created significant <b>logistical</b> issues for Captain White. Due to the poor condition of the road that connected Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức, {{where most of the}} ammunition was stocked, the Marines had to rely on transport aircraft to bring in ammunition supplies. However, due to high demand and scarce resources, the U.S. 1st Marine Aircraft Wing simply did not have the flexibility to provide the support required by the soldiers at Ngok Tavak. Furthermore, only 31% of the Marines' heavy-lift aircraft was available for operations. The lack of <b>logistical</b> support was exemplified by {{the manner in which the}} 105mm howitzers were deployed; when the Marines arrived at Ngok Tavak, White ordered the Marine detachment to place their howitzers on a downhill position outside the camp's perimeter, as the hill-top position was still covered by trees, making the position of the howitzers a non-ideal location for security.|$|E
5|$|Extensive <b>logistical</b> {{installations}} {{and large}} amounts of supplies were found and destroyed, but as reporting from the American command in Saigon disclosed, still larger amounts of military material had already been moved further from the border to shelter it from the incursion into Cambodia by the U.S. and South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In April, {{during the}} Revolution of 1848 in Paris, {{he left for}} London, where he {{performed}} at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses. This tour was suggested {{to him by his}} Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the <b>logistical</b> arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, {{hundreds}} of Comoran government troops began assembling on Mohéli, which {{is closer to}} Anjouan than the larger island, Grande Comore. Sudan and Senegal provided a total of 750 troops, while Libya offered <b>logistical</b> support for the operation. In addition, 500 Tanzanian troops were due to arrive soon after. France, the former colonial power, also assisted the operation by airlifting AU troops to the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the battle}} and the {{following}} siege, French-speaking Canadians were active {{on both sides of}} the conflict. The American forces received supplies and <b>logistical</b> support from local residents, and the city's defenders included locally raised militia. When the Americans retreated, they were accompanied by a number of their supporters; those who remained behind were subjected to a variety of punishments after the British re-established control over the province.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Tet Offensive, the North Vietnamese showed signs of {{expanding}} and modernizing their <b>logistical</b> effort. The number of supply and maintenance personnel had fallen, mainly due to increased use of motor/river transportation and mechanized construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year that the 559th Group was using 20 bulldozers, 11 road graders, three rock crushers, and two steamrollers for maintenance and new road construction.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other sites}} have been suggested; {{historian}} Paul Hill identified over thirty possibilities. Michael Wood published a 2014 article suggesting a Yorkshire location; philologist Andrew Breeze favours Durham, and Kevin Halloran argues for southern Scotland. Tim Clarkson discounts locations other than southern Scotland or northern England as a battle site, given the <b>logistical</b> {{capacity of the}} kingdoms of Alba and Strathclyde.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February, Souvanna {{signed an}} Agreement on the Restoration of Peace and Reconciliation in Laos between the central {{government}} and the Pathet Lao. The agreement was preceded by intense fighting, as both sides attempted to seize as much territory as possible before the cease-fire went into effect. The agreement was moot, however, since Hanoi {{had no intention of}} removing its troops or abandoning its <b>logistical</b> system.|$|E
5|$|On the 1895 Mazamas expedition, {{the first}} {{heliography}} between {{several of the}} peaks of the Cascades was attempted with some success. A party on Mount Hood was able to communicate {{back and forth with}} the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on Rainier, Baker, Jefferson, and Diamond Peak were not successful, mainly because of dense smoke and <b>logistical</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|Once Soviet {{resistance}} {{along the}} Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, encircling Moscow by outflanking {{it from the}} north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, and <b>logistical</b> difficulties became more acute. Guderian wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages {{at the start of the}} operation.|$|E
5|$|Problems for the Portuguese arose almost {{immediately}} when the offensive {{coincided with the}} beginning of the monsoon season, creating additional <b>logistical</b> difficulties. Not only were the Portuguese soldiers badly equipped, but there was very poor cooperation, if any at all, between the FAP and the army. Thus, the army lacked close air support from the FAP. Mounting Portuguese casualties began to outweigh FRELIMO casualties, leading to further political intervention from Lisbon.|$|E
