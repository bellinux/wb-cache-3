Special attention {{is given to}} sorting smalldiameter and underutilized logs from forest restoration, fuels reduction, and thinning operations. A planned programming approach of objectively determining the feasibility of establishing a <b>log</b> sort <b>yard</b> operation is recommended. This critical thinking will help develop the strategic, marketing, business, and operational plans to guide the development and operation of the <b>log</b> sort <b>yard.</b> Preliminary financial feasibility should begin early in the planning process to help focus efforts on potentially viable opportunities and save time, effort, and money from chasing poor investment scenarios. After options are narrowed, detailed resource assessment, markets, and financial analyses are done. Several critical factors are considered and evaluated for each <b>log</b> sort <b>yard</b> scenario. Although commercial <b>log</b> sort <b>yards</b> have a proven track record throughout North America, small community-based and government-operated <b>log</b> <b>yards</b> have had limited success.

50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twentieth-century, Gate City was one of several “boom towns” located in southwestern Virginia. Although the streets were little more than dirt byways in the town, the area was a vibrant commercial and transportation center. Up to six daily passenger trains passed through Gate City. The town also had a railroad <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> where logs from all over the county were stored and then loaded to be later transported by train. Iron ore from the Snowflake and Nickelsville areas as well as glass sand from the south of Clinch Mountain were manufactured and shipped from Gate City. In addition, the town had a thriving manufacturing center in the area of Water Street where wood pumps, staves, sleds, and harnesses were built. By 1915, the town supported two livery stables on Willow Street and a blacksmith shop on Jackson Street, as well as a dentist’s office, an ice plant, a casket shop, and a furniture manufacturing business. By the 1930s, Gate City had three movie theaters, banks, and a hotel. The town also had two businesses that dealt with auto sales and repairs.|$|E

40|$|Wet storage (sprinkling) of wood offers {{valuable}} {{protection against}} drying out and biological attack, {{but at the}} same time there are disadvantages to be considered. Negative effects in the forms of reduction in wood quality and the environmental impact of <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> run-off must be minimised in order to make wet storage effective. In the work underlying this thesis, the effect of different sprinkling water qualities on changes in wood properties during storage was studied. A new method for treating <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> run-off by using it to irrigate soil-plant systems was also evaluated. Sprinkling experiments were conducted both indoors and outdoors in which the effects of sprinkling on the wood quality of Norway spruce (Picea abies) pulpwood piles were examined. Soil-plant systems with willows (Salix schwerinii x Salix viminalis), alder (Alnus glutinosa) and couchgrass (Elymus repens) were irrigated with Norway spruce <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> run-off and evaluated both in lysimeters and in the field (couchgrass) for their purification capacity. Sprinkling water quality, in terms of salinity, did not affect the inorganic content of wood during storage. Brackish waters can be used without increasing the risk for raising the inorganic contents. Neither did sprinkling with fresh or recycled water affect wood brightness. Factors other than those studied determine the optimal wet storage regime. The composition of different <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> run-offs is very different, but they are all rich in oxygen-consuming organic material. Irrigation of soil-plant systems purifies <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> run-off even at very high irrigation intensities and is a convenient method for practical use.

40|$|<b>Log</b> <b>yard</b> runoff can {{be harmful}} to {{receiving}} watercourses, {{mainly because of the}} high concentration of organic substances and phosphorus that can cause eutrophication and oxygen depletion. This thesis assesses the effectiveness of soil infiltration and constructed wetlands to purify runoff from two log yards in Sweden storing mainly Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). The treatment efficiency of infiltration in a couch grass (Elytrigia repens (L.) Desv. ex Nevski) field was examined by comparing pollutant concentrations in the <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> runoff with resulting concentrations in groundwater pipes. The content of total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), suspended solids (SS) and distillable phenols was investigated during seven summer seasons. The results showed good purification capacity for TOC, TP and distillable phenols, but the infiltration had no effect on TN and SS. Intense irrigation led to increasing levels of TP in the groundwater after a few years. Reduced irrigation did not increase the purification efficiency for TOC but halted the increase of TP in the groundwater. Infiltration in soil systems planted with four different species (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gärtner (common alder), Salix schwerinii x viminalis (willow variety ‘Gudrun’), Lolium perenne (L.) (rye grass) and Phalaris arundinacea (L.) (reed canary grass)) was assessed at a field-scale experimental site. No significant difference in treatment efficiency could be seen when comparing the different plants with each other. The infiltration was effective in reducing TOC and TP in the <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> runoff, but could not reduce SS. The self-organizing map (SOM) model was applied to the results to assess the relationships between different water quality variables, and the SOM model performed very well in predicting TN and TP concentrations. A small constructed treatment wetland showed no significant effect when treating <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> runoff, possibly because the hydraulic load on the wetland was too high and the oxygen content too low for the biochemical processes in the wetland to reduce the concentrations of TP, TOC and SS, or because the particles in the runoff do not settle easily. A constructed wetland should either be made larger or supplemented by further treatment solutions. The results in this thesis support the use of soil infiltration rather than wetlands to treat <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> runoff. Storage of aged windthrown logs on both log yards led to significantly higher content of TP in the runoff.

40|$|Hurricanes pose a {{great risk}} to forestry, {{and lead to}} high {{financial}} losses due to destroyed wood. For example, the hurricane ‘‘Gudrun’ ’ devastated {{a large part of}} the forests of southern Sweden in January 2005. Windthrown logs are removed from forest, temporarily stored on log yards, and frequently sprinkled with water to avoid decay. However, the subsequent runoff may cause environmental pollution. The aim of this original article is to assess the treatment of <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> runoff, which was impacted by logs of different age, in an inexpensive free water surface constructed wetland. Considering that there is commonly insufficient space for treatment wetlands, a small wetland was retrofitted into an existing ditch next to the <b>log</b> <b>yard.</b> Among other parameters, total organic carbon, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen were measured. Results show insufficient treatment of <b>log</b> <b>yard</b> runoff. The storage of aged windthrown logs led to a higher content of total phosphorus in the runoff. It is likely that the hydraulic loading rate in this wetland case study was too high, and that the concentration of oxygen in the runoff was too low for the biochemical processes in the wetland to reduce the concentrations of total phosphorus, total organic carbon, and suspended solids. It follows that a similar wetland treatment system to be designed in the future should either be made larger or supplemented by alternative further treatment solutions such as increased oxygenation or the introduction of aggregates promoting the adsorption of phosphorus.
