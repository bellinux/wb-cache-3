30|$|The {{results of}} this {{empirical}} analysis suggest that to stimulate sustained {{economic growth in the}} Pakistan, policy makers may focus importance to improve educational system, control inflation and increased GDP growth. However, financial sector reforms certify the efficient allocation of financial resources to improve both productive and allocate efficiencies in the economy. The results indicate that long-term economic growth is highly dependent on the potential ability of country to move up on the innovation scale to remain globally competitive. This needs the allocation of appropriate resources for research and development (R&D) activities to <b>push</b> <b>key</b> economic sectors in the country.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the notion}} of the nexus has gained {{traction}} in the domain of natural resource governance. It has become the defining vocabulary to understand the interlinkages between land, water, food and climate. Since the 2008 World Economic Forum <b>pushed</b> <b>key</b> players to be concerned about water, food and energy security and their interlinkages, the nexus has become a strong policy metaphor to address the ‘world in crises’. This report provides a synthesis of ideas and cases discussed at the Nexus Network Resource Conflicts workshop, held in the Institute of Development Studies on Monday 29 February 2016...|$|R
50|$|There are sixteen mazes {{containing}} diamonds {{which must}} be collected and monsters to be avoided. The mazes are broken up with doors that must be opened by <b>pushing</b> <b>keys</b> into them. The keys must be facing in the correct direction. There are other items that can be pushed including boulders that create diamonds when pushed together and black boulders that are just obstructions. There are also bonus items. As the items can only be pushed, and not pulled, the main puzzle element {{of the game is}} a Sokoban style transport puzzle as pushing certain items against a wall or in front of other objects means the level is impossible to complete.|$|R

Corey is exuberantly <b>pushing</b> <b>keys</b> to show the viewer that he is heavily immersed in the game action; Jenny is beating him. Frustrated, he asks for a rematch, but she has an upcoming class and must leave. He decides he will copy the game {{so that he can}} play it at home.

30|$|The second test, “Speed and Accuracy,” {{measures}} the reaction time related with a choice. The task measures speed {{and accuracy of}} response to complex stimuli and requires <b>pushing</b> the <b>key</b> correspondent to one {{of a set of}} stimuli. The stimuli are numbers (from 1 to 7) presented at the centre of the screen in randomized sets (from 3 to 5 elements). In each trial of the task, one number of the set appears ringed round. The child is instructed to <b>push</b> a <b>key</b> correspondent to the ringed round number. The scores are established by evaluating the number of correct answers (correct responses score, range scores: 0 – 30) and median time of answer (response time score).|$|R

40|$|The growing {{impact of}} human {{activities}} on the climate system adds a new dimension of complexity and urgency to climate change research. Human activities may {{have the potential to}} <b>push</b> <b>key</b> components of the climate system past critical states into qualitatively different modes of operation, i. e. to exceed a tipping point. This possibility requires additional efforts from the many branches of climate change research in order to improve the accuracy of climate change projections. The examination of past climate records {{has proven to be a}} very useful area of climate change research. This thesis tackles two elements of the climate system whose tipping points are currently considered very critical: the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and South American precipitation. The major goal of this work is to better understand and work out a detailed reconstruction of ocean circulation and climate variability in the western South Atlantic and eastern South America during the last deglaciation, with special emphasis on abrupt climate change...|$|R

30|$|The “Visual Recognition” test {{includes}} two different tasks. The first, “Visual Recognition” task, requires recognizing a visual target among group of distractors appearing in sequence. The stimuli are images of common objects (for example umbrella, star, fruit). The child {{is required to}} <b>push</b> a <b>key</b> when a star appears on the screen. The scores are the number of correct answers (correct responses score, ranges score: 0 – 15) and median time of answer (response time score). The second, “Visual-Spatial Selectivity” task, is a computerized version of symbols barrage test. The child has to delete a particular symbol {{of a set of}} stimuli.

50|$|Computer {{keyboards}} can {{be classified}} by the switch technology that they use. Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80 to 110 durable switches, generally one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and pre travel (the distance needed to <b>push</b> the <b>key</b> to enter a character reliably). Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater cost savings.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the role re-location {{has played in}} shaping the status of elite and middle-class schools in and around London. A Bourdieusian lens is applied to understand the institutional trajectories of 51 schools which moved from central London out to the suburbs and beyond between the 1860 s and 1970 s. It is argued that this strategy served to maintain, reinforce and create institutional prestige within the ‘field’ of schools serving the upper and middle classes. These re-locations have had a lasting effect on London’s school system, <b>pushing</b> <b>key</b> institutions of elite social reproduction outwards {{and away from the}} city centre. In discussing the motivations for re-location, Bourdieu’s (1996) theory of field and elite formation is used with specific reference to urban change, thus developing a Bourdieusian-historical approach to understanding the geography of social reproduction (Thiem, 2009). The focus on London also sets these re-locations in the context of broader socio-spatial shifts within the British upper and middle classes, in which new social formations were emerging, with an aristocratic-financial elite concentrated in the south-east of England (Anderson, 1964; Rubinstein, 1977). Re-location formed part of a broader process of urban and socio-economic transformation which created a powerful educational infrastructure for the upper and middle classes in and around London...|$|R

This was effected by <b>pushing</b> the <b>key</b> further in the ignition switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.|$|R

50|$|The 1A2 Key Telephone System was a {{modular system}} that {{provided}} flexible solutions {{for a variety}} of telephone service requirements.

Each user could select a specific telephone line to place calls on, or to answer calls, and manage those calls by placing them on hold or transferring them to other stations. The system provided options for station-to-station signaling and intercom, and music-on-hold. The control functions were operated directly on each telephone instrument with a set of <b>push</b> buttons (<b>keys)</b> that had lamps installed internally to provide visual indication of line status.|$|R
