The original CCE&HR station buildings were destroyed when the Centre Point tower block was built.|$|R
5|$|Situated between Somerset Road and Devonshire Road, Group 2 Architects {{designed}} the PUB Building as an H-shaped block {{with a central}} service core and a naturally-ventilated lobby. Facing north and south, the two parallel wings are of unequal height, and are linked by a wider transverse area three floors in height, and further up by the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> and the access to each floor. Between the two wings is a landscaped courtyard.|$|E
5|$|In Spoke City, Thomas Prescott accepts an {{apparently}} innocent hitch-hiker into his car. The stranger's true intentions are revealed when he attaches a metal bracelet to Prescott's wrist, warning {{him that it}} contains a powerful explosive charge that is due to detonate in 30 minutes; the key to unlock it will be found {{in his office at}} the Hudson Building. Speeding to his workplace with the police in pursuit, Prescott removes the bracelet and leaves it in a filing cabinet. The device explodes as he is returning to the ground floor in a lift: the top levels of the Hudson Building are incinerated, and Prescott is plunged {{to the bottom of the}} <b>lift</b> <b>shaft,</b> ten storeys underground.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the disused tunnels between Borough and King William Street {{stations}} were converted {{for use as}} an air-raid shelter, with entrances to the shelter at King William Street and at six sites south of the Thames (of nine planned). In the 1960s the disused tunnels were used to assist the ventilation of London Bridge station and all the entrances bar that at 9 London Bridge Street were infilled with concrete. It is now only possible to access the tunnels from Three Castles House or a passage from the Jubilee line at London Bridge. Most of the C's six original station buildings were rebuilt or modified during the improvements to {{the line in the}} 1920s or during more recent modernisations. Only the building at Kennington retains its original exterior and the dome over the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft,</b> a feature of all the original stations.|$|E

25|$|The six-storey Canterbury Television (CTV) {{building}} {{collapsed in}} the earthquake, leaving only its <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> standing, which caught fire. 115 {{people died in the}} building, which housed a TV station, a medical clinic and an English language school. On 23 February police decided that the damage was not survivable, and rescue efforts at the building were suspended. Fire-fighting and recovery operations resumed that night, later joined by a Japanese search and rescue squad. Twelve Japanese students from the Toyama College of Foreign Languages died in the building collapse. A government report later found that the building's construction was faulty and should not have been approved.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before 19:00 BST on Wednesday, 8 August 2006, a fire {{broke out}} at the {{derelict}} Montebello Hotel in Fore Street, Ilfracombe. Twenty fire engines were required {{to put out the}} blaze including a number rushed to the scene from Woolacombe, Barnstaple and the bordering county of Somerset. Specialist equipment was brought in from as far afield as Exeter, and according to the local radio news 85 firemen were involved at the fire. The fire spread to three neighbouring properties and showered debris over a wide area. The six-storey hotel was completely gutted, with only the front wall, chimney stacks and remains of the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> frame surviving the blaze, and the fire was still being damped-down the following day. Fore Street was closed for some period due to the difficulties of demolition.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 2 November 1952, Derek Bentley and Christopher Craig set out {{to break into the}} {{confectionery}} manufacturers Barlow & Parker in Croydon. Bentley and Craig were spotted climbing up a drain pipe {{to gain access to the}} roof by a member of the public, who called the police. The first officer to arrive on scene was Detective Sergeant Frederick Fairfax; by this time both Bentley and Craig had hidden behind the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft.</b> DS Fairfax gained entry to the roof and apprehended Bentley, but while doing so was shot in the shoulder by Craig. Upon armed uniformed officers arriving, Constable Sidney Miles was shot dead by Craig. After trial, Bentley was sentenced to death and Craig to be remanded at Her Majesty's Pleasure. For DS Fairfax's role in the incident, he received a George Cross, as did Constables Norman Harrison and James McDonald. Constable Robert Jaggs was awarded the British Empire Medal, with Sidney Miles awarded a posthumous Queen's Police Medal for Gallantry.|$|E
25|$|There {{have long}} been tales of hauntings at The Grotto, mainly {{relating}} to a smuggler named John the Jibber who was reputedly murdered by his fellow criminals after selling information to HM Customs. It is {{said that he was}} hung in a barrel in a cave close to the present <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> and left to starve. Until the pub was sold by Vaux, it was said that the landlord would leave out a special tankard of ale each night after closing and, in the morning, it would be empty. Local DJ and TV presenter, Alan Robson drank from the tankard during one of his live Metro Radio shows, allegedly sparking off a series of supernatural phenomena that eventually forced the then landlord to quit. This included flying ashtrays smashing against the wall and flooding in the cellar after all the beer taps were inexplicably turned on. Unfortunately the original tankard was lost during refurbishment. A replacement is on display, but is no longer filled up each night for the ghost. The pub was also the venue for a uktv investigation in 2001, where paranormal researchers claimed to have identified at least seven different spirits.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} GNP&BR stations, the lifts descended {{directly}} to platform level. The platform layout is {{almost identical to}} that at Caledonian Road, but the two tracks form very gentle [...] curves with respect to bases of the <b>lift</b> <b>shafts</b> between the tracks.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the top of}} {{the tower}} was a {{revolving}} restaurant, the facade and floor of the restaurant revolving as one unit, while the roof of the restaurant was used as an observation platform for visitors. There are 558 stairs up to the top, and two <b>lift</b> <b>shafts</b> which reach the top in 30 seconds.|$|R

500|$|In April 2015, Transport for London {{announced}} that it was seeking proposals for the commercial use of parts of the surface building, disused <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> and underground passages. Suggested possible uses included a restaurant, a bar, a theatre, a gallery or retail space. Tours by the London Transport Museum through its [...] "Hidden London" [...] programme began in 2016.|$|E
500|$|Station {{reconstruction}} {{to accommodate}} the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, with the existing structure {{to be used as}} exits with The lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for {{five and a half years}} (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the [...] "umbrella" [...] covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical 3ft diameter concrete foundations, sunk from 43 up to 73ft deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. Service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A pre-stressed concrete raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson's third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel. The interchange passageway between the Central line and the Bakerloo line in the area of the former junction with the Bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel. From there, a pilot tunnel Ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in the former Bakerloo line <b>lift</b> <b>shaft.</b> A new substation for the Bakerloo line was built at the bottom of the shaft. With the additional escalators in place, the one-way circulation scheme was introduced and the remaining lifts were removed.|$|E

The elevator car emerges horizontally from the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> and enters {{a section of the}} ride called [...] "The Fifth Dimension", which is a collection of sights and sounds and star fields, again {{in the style of the}} television show's opening sequence. A rendition of The Twilight Zone theme plays throughout. The scene ends as the elevator reaches another star field which splits and opens much like elevator doors. The elevator enters another vertical shaft, this one pitch black. Serling's voice is heard again, saying: ...|$|E
50|$|In 2014 {{the station}} {{received}} £4.6 million of government grants {{as part of}} the Access for All initiative to replace the footbridge at Brockenhurst with a new bridge complete with <b>lift</b> <b>shafts.</b> Step-free access to platforms 1 and 2 was previously by a rotating turntable bridge across the tracks while step-free access to platforms 3 and 4 was across the track bed itself.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the main}} {{entrance}} featured both lifts/elevators and a grand staircase which ascended against a huge stained glass mural masking the <b>lift</b> <b>shafts.</b> The first floor was devoted to wallpaper displays and its lengthy retail counter allowed for conversion to a long bar. The second floor was reserved for fabric displays, while the third floor held management offices and an interior design studio.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{commenced}} {{in early}} 2016. A major shutdown {{of the line}} and Blackburn Road occurred during late 2016-early 2017, enabling the removal of the level crossing. Blackburn Road and the railway line reopened in early February 2017. The project also includes two new <b>lift</b> <b>shafts</b> from the island platform to the underpass, and to nearby Railway Road. These works are expected to be completed by May 2017.|$|R
2500|$|William Anelay Limited was {{contracted}} {{to carry out}} essential external stonemasonry repairs and to cover the existing dome roof with a new lead covering. The contract included the demolition of some internal walls and the building of an extension {{to the front of}} the property. This [...] provided a new entrance [...] area, offices and toilet facilities and allows access from the path to the building at basement level. The existing spiral staircase was removed and stored, and a new one installed allowing for a <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> in the centre. The museum was closed during the restoration and refurbishment period and reopened in May 2008.|$|E
2500|$|When the Bakerloo line {{opened in}} 1906 it was advertised {{with a maximum}} {{temperature}} of , but over time the tube tunnels have warmed up. In 1938 approval was given for a ventilation improvement programme, and a refrigeration unit was installed in a <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> at Tottenham Court Road. Temperatures of [...] were reported in the 2006 European heat wave. It was claimed in 2002 that, if animals were being transported, temperatures on the Tube would break European Commission animal welfare laws. A 2000 study reported that air quality was seventy-three times worse than at street level, with a passenger breathing the same mass of particulates during a twenty-minute journey on the Northern line as when smoking a cigarette. The main purpose of the London Underground's ventilation fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels, and fans across the network are being refurbished, although complaints of noise from local residents preclude their use at full power at night.|$|E

Eleven years later in Dry Springs, Nevada, The TARDIS materialises at a diner, and the Doctor meets Cassie Rice and Native American Jimmy Stalkingwolf. He uses his sonic {{screwdriver}} to investigate an alien artifact. Detecting that the artifact has been activated, two Men in Black arrive demanding the artifact in question. The Doctor and the others escape, to investigate Jimmy's [...] "space monster". The monster {{turns out to be}} a Viperox battle-drone and is destroyed by a rocket from a USAF helicopter which arrives on the scene. The soldiers take them to Area 51 (aka Dreamland). In Dreamland, Colonel Stark locks them in a cell with a gas that will wipe their memories. The Doctor manages to break free, stop the gas, and escapes with Cassie and Jimmy via a ventilation shaft. The alarm sounds and they run into a lab where they find a captured grey alien. After fleeing pursuing guards in a lift they are recaptured at the top of the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft.</b> Colonel Stark is revealed to be working with a Viperox leader named Lord Azlok.|$|E
50|$|The {{persistent}} dampness, {{coupled with}} the attendant problems of vandalism and the uncompromising design, meant that by the 1980s the complex had become a by-word for all that was worst in public sector housing. In 1987 and 1988, the City Council undertook a major renovation, adding a sloping white roof with pediments, placing bright blue cladding around the exteriors of <b>lift</b> <b>shafts,</b> and enclosing the by-then unusable balconies in conservatories.|$|R
