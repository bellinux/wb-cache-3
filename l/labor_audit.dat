40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis {{study was conducted}} in an effort to develop improved techniques for labor resource analysis and reporting to enhance workload management and planning. A <b>labor</b> resource <b>audit</b> is described that is sufficiently flexible and adaptable to all Navy public works activities. This thesis presents a step-by-step method to analyze, design and implement a prototype <b>labor</b> <b>auditing</b> system for determining and budgeting for proper level, mix, and balance of personnel to support maintenance and repair operations. Specifically, this thesis focused on workload growth, backlog completion time, personnel and funding shortfalls in the area of real property maintenance and repair at the Naval Postgraduate School. Information developed provided insight into: effectively identifying resources to decrease backlog; managing incoming work requests more effectively; and providing financial accountability and credibility at middle management levels.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} labor {{tax evasion}} {{and the impact}} of <b>labor</b> inspectorate <b>auditing.</b> The analysis is based on a unique dataset built by linking two important sources of information: a) a dataset of individual artisan firms, b) an individual audit dataset. Our data describe the universe of artisan firms in Piedmont (Italy) in 2000 - 2005. Using information on firm characteristics and tax evasion, observed directly from the audit exercise, we: a) estimate undeclared work in the artisan sector; and b) evaluate the impact of tax inspections on employer labor tax declarations. Relying on a double hurdle selection model we find that the artisan sector includes around 14 % of undeclared workers. We find also that inspections could be counterproductive, decreasing tax revenues and not increasing non compliance. JEL Classification...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of US firms for the period 2000 - 2011, we examine whether {{organized}} <b>labor</b> in <b>audit</b> client firms affects their financial statement quality and auditor decisions such as audit fees and going concern qualifications. We do not find evidence supporting the association between unionization and financial statement quality metrics such as future accounting restatements, discretionary accruals {{and the likelihood of}} reporting small profits. However, we find that labor unionization is associated with higher audit fees and higher likelihood of goingconcern qualifications but shorter audit report lags. Because the auditor’s response seems to be unrelated to inherent earnings quality differences, these findings support the contention that the auditors mitigate the higher litigation risk in unionized firms by giving more going concern qualifications (thereby deflecting the legal threat away) and by charging higher audit fees to compensate for the additional risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} on discrimination produced from the audit method is examined. Audits survey the average firm {{and not the}} marginal firm which determines the level of market discrimination. Taken on its own terms, {{there is little evidence}} of labor market discrimination from audit methods. The validity of audit methods is critically dependent on unverified assumptions about equality across race/gender groups of the distributions of unobserved (by audit designers) productivity components acted on by firms and about the way <b>labor</b> markets work. <b>Audits</b> can find discrimination when none exists and can disguise it when it does. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of business risk audit (BRA) approaches during the 1990 s by several leading audit firms {{has been the}} subject of considerable scrutiny and commentary. Under BRA, the auditor responds to the increasing complexity of auditee financial reports by acquiring a deep and comprehensive under-standing of the auditee’s industry, strategy, business models, and processes— tasks best accomplished by higher-ranked labor—and by employing this un-derstanding to make <b>audit</b> <b>labor</b> allocations. Using proprietary data for 165 audits conducted in 2002, we investigate three propositions about <b>audit</b> <b>labor</b> use under BRA. First, relative to pre-BRA benchmarks for the same auditor, we expect BRA audits to use a greater proportion of higher-ranked labor. Sec-ond, we expect engagements with high assessed auditor business risk (ABR), a summary risk assessment that reflects the BRA auditor’s rich understand-ing of the auditee, to be allocated more labor and more higher-ranked labor than pre-BRA benchmarks. Third, at all ranks of labor, we expect a positive association between assessed ABR and levels of labor use. We find empirical evidence consistent with these propositions. We also find that total labor use in our sample is only modestly lower than pre-BRA norms. Analysis of fee data from these engagements suggests that audit fees in 2002 are substantially less than would be expected under pre-BRA benchmarks.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of manufacturing supply chains worldwide has provoked a fierce {{debate over how}} to effectively monitor and promote compliance with labor standards in supply chain factories (Frenkle and Scott 2002; Fung, O’Rourke, and Sabel 2001; O’Rouke 2003; Weil 1996). In this paper we aim to identify the factors that lead to better working conditions through a structured comparison of two factories in the same supply chain. In an earlier quantitative study of the <b>labor</b> compliance <b>audit</b> records of all 830 suppliers of a leading multinational corporation (MNC), we found that after country-level variables—such as {{rule of law and}} level of economic development—and basic factory characteristics—such as factory age and ownership—are controlled, there are still considerable variations in labor compliance (Locke, Qin, and Brause 2007). The in-depth case study presented in this paper is designed to understand the underlying mechanisms driving these variations. Specifically, we focus on three linked questions: First, why do working conditions vary across factories located in the same region and producing for the same global brand? Second, what are the root causes of the prevalent labor problems in supply chains? And last, what accounts for the improvements in labor conditions among global suppliers? We argue that some of the most prevalent problems in compliance with labor standards are deeply rooted in the way that supply chains are coordinated. To achieve sustainable improvements in working conditions and labor standards, systematic interventions aimed at tackling these root causes are critical—in particular, improving the ability of suppliers to better schedule their work and stabilize and motivate their workforce through new forms of work organization...|$|R
40|$|Most {{models of}} optimal income tax {{enforcement}} assume that income is either random or solely remunerates <b>labor,</b> neglecting that <b>auditing</b> strategies {{may depend on}} observable inputs. This paper outlines a model to optimally monitor self-employed entrepreneurs when, in addition to reported profits, the tax collection agency also observes {{the number of workers}} employed (or any other input variable) at each firm. We show that, by conditioning the monitoring strategy only on labor input, it is optimal for the IRS to audit firms in a way that generates some empirical regularities, like the missing middle. We also show that the optimal direct mechanism can be implemented by an indirect monitoring strategy that is consistent with actual IRS practices. In particular, the IRS calculates inputted income as function of labor. Whenever an entrepreneur reports profits that are lower than inputted income, she is randomly monitored. Finally, we formalize a model of optimal presumption taxation, in which inputted income is the tax base, to compare revenue collection across tax systems.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{awareness}} {{of the importance of}} researching core strategic resources and activities, the work that has been done to date has largely taken the form of anecdotal reports and case study analysis. We have yet to see large-sample studies demonstrating how organizational elements, independently, complementarily and interactively, may or may not enhance the organization’s performance. Moreover, little attention has been given to researching this topic in public sector organizations. The present study aims to bridge this gap by examining the impact of a set of independent intangible organizational elements and the interactions among them on a set of objective organizational performance measures in a sample of local government authorities in Israel. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that organizational performance (measured by self-income ratio, collecting efficiency ratio, employment rate, and municipal development) can be well explained by six intangible organizational elements (managerial capabilities, human capital, internal <b>auditing,</b> <b>labor</b> relations, organizational culture, and perceived organizational reputation) and the interactions among them, which need {{to be taken into account}} in any cost effective development.
