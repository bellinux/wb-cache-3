Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E
