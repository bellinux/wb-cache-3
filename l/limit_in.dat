5|$|Within {{six months}} of the {{original}} ruling, the ICC ultimately decided to change the 12-hour work <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> 24hours to a 10-hour driving <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> 24hours, and the 15-hour on-duty limit was rescinded. Motor carriers were required to give drivers 8, rather than 9, consecutive hours off-duty each day. These rules allowed for 10hours of driving and 8hours of rest within a 24-hour day.|$|E
5|$|For 1966, {{the engine}} {{capacity}} <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> Formula One was doubled from 1.5litres (92cuin) to 3litres (183cuin). It was not feasible to enlarge existing 1.5-litre engines {{to take full}} advantage of the higher limit and Climax chose not to develop a new 3-litre motor, leaving many teams without a viable engine for 1966.|$|E
5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition {{by considering the}} difference quotient, and computing its <b>limit.</b> <b>In</b> practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using rules for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.|$|E

5|$|Chirocephalus diaphanus is a Mediterranean species, which {{reaches its}} {{north-western}} <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> Great Britain, and {{is missing from}} Fennoscandia. Its distribution in Western Europe extends almost continuously from Great Britain to the Iberian Peninsula, and as far east as the Rhine in Germany. A single occurrence of C. diaphanus is known from the Benelux countries, in pools in South Limburg, Netherlands. Further east, it occurs south of 47°N in the Apennine and Balkan peninsulas, reaching the Black Sea in Romania; an isolated population exists {{at the mouth of}} the Vistula river in Poland. In the Mediterranean Sea, populations exist on Sicily and Crete.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse <b>limit.</b> <b>In</b> the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} inverse <b>limits</b> <b>in</b> the categoryCHU of compact Hausdorff spaces with upper semicontinuous (usc) functions. We {{introduce the}} notion of weak inverse <b>limits</b> <b>in</b> this category and show that the inverse limits with upper semicontinuous set-valued bonding functions (as they were defined in [15]) together with the projections are not necessarily inverse <b>limits</b> <b>in</b> CHU but they are always weak inverse <b>limits</b> <b>in</b> this category. This is a realization of our categorical approach to solving a problem stated by W. T. Ingram in [14]...|$|R
5|$|Like flour mills, {{factories}} that make aspirin tablets must {{pay attention to}} {{how much of the}} powder gets into the air inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the speed <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> the park had been raised from 20 to 30 {{miles an hour and}} there were {{concerns}} that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. The speed limit was reduced to 20 miles an hour in the summer of 2004.|$|E
5|$|The great {{northern}} tilefish {{has been}} subject to regulation to prevent overfishing. Regulations include catch limits and gear restrictions to prevent damage to the species' habitat and population.

5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to get the highest score. There are two play modes: Zen and Core. There is a 90-second time <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> Zen mode. In Core mode, players play until the screen fills with poorly placed tetrominos, similar to Tetris. Core has two difficulties. On the easiest difficulty, three-letter words suffice, but harder modes require five-letter words at a minimum. A score {{multiplier}} grows as players maintain a combo of multiple words created in succession, and resets if players are too slow. Scores are uploaded to Game Center.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} this type of {{supernova}} {{is similar to that of}} novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does not approach the Chandrasekhar <b>limit.</b> <b>In</b> the case of a nova, the in-falling matter causes a hydrogen fusion surface explosion that does not disrupt the star. This type of supernova differs from a core-collapse supernova, which is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers of a massive star as its core implodes.|$|E
5|$|Further {{successful}} defenses followed against Torres on the January 30, 2012, {{episode of}} Raw and Tamina Snuka at Elimination Chamber on February 19. After this, Phoenix competed only sporadically {{for a few}} months, including a tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII, where she and Eve Torres were defeated by Kelly Kelly and Maria Menounos. On the April 6 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix lost to Nikki Bella in a non-title match, following Kelly's interference. On the April 23 episode of Raw, Phoenix lost her Divas Championship to Nikki Bella in a Lumberjill match, after suffering a storyline ankle injury. At Extreme Rules, Phoenix was scheduled to face Nikki in a rematch for the Divas Championship, however she was not medically cleared to compete {{and was replaced by}} the returning Layla, who ended up winning the title. Phoenix made two unsuccessful attempts at regaining the Divas Championship from Layla at Over the <b>Limit</b> <b>in</b> May and at No Way Out in June, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> an attempt {{to make up for the}} delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|E
5|$|Test cricket {{is played}} between {{international}} cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, having no <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> their number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from {{three days to}} timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased {{partly because of the}} increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Final Fantasy XIII-2 follows on {{from that of}} Final Fantasy XIII, but as is typical for the series, it is {{unrelated}} to all other previous Final Fantasy games. In XIII, one of the fal'Cie—a god-like race—transformed a team of six people, the primary characters of the game, into l'Cie (servants of the fal'Cie with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time <b>limit),</b> <b>in</b> {{the hope that they}} would initiate the end of the world. The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named Cocoon to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe.|$|E
