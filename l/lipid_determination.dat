30|$|The OECD 305 {{guideline}} [1] states that, if possible, <b>lipid</b> <b>determination</b> and {{residue analysis}} {{should be performed}} using the same sample. However, analysis of test substances often requires specific extraction procedures which might be in contradiction to the guidelines for gravimetric <b>lipid</b> <b>determination</b> by solvent extraction. In this case (until suitable nondestructive instrumental methods are available), it is recommended to determine the fish lipid content by solvent extraction on independent fish sampled at the start {{and at the end}} of the experiment. The amount of fish per tank should be adjusted accordingly. The analysis of fish from the test and control groups at the end of the experiment is important to confirm the equal lipid content of test and control animals. As described in the OECD 305 guideline [1], the lipid content of the fish (as milligrams per kilogram wet weight) at the end of the experiment should not differ from that at the start by more ± 25 %.|$|E

40|$|Growth Media and <b>Lipid</b> <b>Determination</b> Comparison of High Rate Algae Ponds Eric Alexander Nicolai The {{feasibility}} of algal biofuel production {{relies on the}} use of a non-potable water source. Municipal wastewater is nutrient-rich and a cost effective option as a growth media in algae ponds. However, this resource may be too valuable for algal biomass production, as reclaimed wastewater is needed for surface irrigation and groundwater recharge. This thesis compares the performance of 4. 2 m 2 high rate algal raceway ponds (HRAPs) to 33 m 2 HRAPs grown on primary settled wastewater during a media recycling study and a growth media comparison study using wastewater and reclaimed water. The comparative metrics of performance for this study included: pond productivity, settling efficiency, and nutrient removal. This thesis also discusses the variability of algal lipid content from wastewater ponds using three different <b>lipid</b> <b>determination</b> methods. Six 4. 2 -m 2, 0. 3 m deep HRAPs were compared to nine 33 -m 2 HRAPs located at the San Luis Obispo Water Resource Recovery Facility (SLOWRRF). During the media recycling study, the first round of growth (Round 1) included ponds operating at 2 -day and 3 -day hydraulic retention times (HRTs) for both pond sizes. The pond arrangements for the second round of growth (Round 2) were the same with the exception of no 2 -day HRT for the 33 -m 2 pond set. Net biomass productivity in the 4. 2 -m 2 ponds under predicted the productivity of the 33 -m 2 ponds. Settling efficiency was comparable between the different rounds of growth for both pond sizes. Total soluble nitrogen removal was predicted using 4. 2 -m 2 ponds. Of the three <b>lipid</b> <b>determination</b> methods, the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) quantification was the most precise between replicates. However, this method determined the lowest lipid content because it quantifies a better representative lipid content by excluding other constituents not relevant to biofuel production...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is {{a severe}} {{autosomal}} dominant disease which is under-diagnosed. The prevalence of HeFH {{has rarely been}} assessed in an unselected sample from the general population. MethodsBased on a huge sample of lipid panels, we assessed the prevalence of individuals classified with definite or probable HeFH (Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria) > 5 {{that is to say}} LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) > 6. 5 mmol/L (251 mg/dL). From 2006 to 2015, 200 620 LDL-C were obtained from 105 398 subjects in a large database of a French University Hospital. Subjects from 0 to 102 years (53. 7 ± 20. 5) and of both genders were analysed. LDL-C levels were calculated with the Friedewald or the Planella formula if elevated triglycerides. We also assessed the prevalence of all DLCN LDL-C criteria: 4. 0 - 4. 9 mmol/L (155 - 190 mg/dL); 5. 0 - 6. 4 mmol/L (191 - 250 mg/dL); 6. 5 - 8. 4 mmol/L (251 - 325 mg/dL);> 8. 5 mmol/L (> 325 mg/dL). ResultsThe prevalence of LDL-C between 4. 0 and 4. 9 mmol/L was 9. 81 % [95 % CI: 9. 68 - 9. 94]; the prevalence of LDL-C between 5. 0 and 6. 4 mmol/L was 2. 41 % [95 % CI: 2. 35 - 2. 48]; the prevalence of LDL-C between 6. 5 and 8. 4 mmol/L was 0. 37 % [95 % CI: 0. 34 - 0. 39] and the prevalence of LDL-C> 8. 5 mmol/L was 0. 09 % [95 % CI: 0. 08 - 0. 10]. In the first <b>lipid</b> <b>determinations</b> of 105 398 subjects, the prevalence of LDL-C between 4. 0 and 4. 9 mmol/L was 10. 77 % [95 % CI: 10. 6 - 11. 0]; between 5. 0 and 6. 4 mmol/L was 2. 47 % [95 % CI: 2. 38 - 2. 56]; between 6. 5 and 8. 4 mmol/L was 0. 28 % [95 % CI: 0. 25 - 0. 32] and of LDL-C> 8. 5 mmol/L was 0. 06 % [95 % CI: 0. 04 - 0. 07].

Subjects in the upper (n = 22) and lower (n = 22) quartile of the Ho score distribution were asked to take part in a laboratory experiment. Continuous measures of heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and electrodermal activity were taken while participants carried out a series of behavioral maneuvres, including mental arithmetic and mirror star tracing.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} in the last decennia to develop a rapid method for <b>lipid</b> <b>determination</b> in microalgae, as an alternative for the time consuming gravimetric methods. Different studies showed that in situ lipid staining with Nile Red is a promising method, but very few did a profound optimization and validation. In this study, <b>lipid</b> <b>determination</b> with in situ staining of lipids with Nile Red has therefore been thoroughly optimized and validated for Nannochloropsis oculata. It was found that fluorescence intensity at 570 - 580 nm (when excitation wavelength was 486 nm) increased in microalgal suspensions with Nile Red compared to the blank without Nile Red, suggesting that Nile Red enters the microalgal cells and stains the lipids. Fluorescence intensity, calculated by peak height or peak area, was increased by addition of glycerol to the microalgal suspension. This method was further improved by optimization of the optical density of the algal suspension, the Nile Red concentration and glycerol concentration in the algal suspension and the incubation time. This optimized procedure was used to validate the method. In contrast to almost all studies about this subject, the validation was performed on different, independent batches of Nannochloropsis oculata, on which both the Nile Red method and the gravimetric method was tested. A good correlation (R² = 0. 9483) was found between neutral lipid content obtained by the Nile Red method and the gravimetric method. It can also be concluded that Nile Red staining correlates better with neutral lipid content than with total lipid content. It can be concluded that Nile Red in situ lipid staining gives an indication of the (neutral) lipid content in Nannochloropsis oculata. Also for other microalgal species, this is a promising method. However, for exact quantification of total lipid content, gravimetric methods are recommended, which are both more accurate and more precise. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} described method {{has been extended}} to various specific lipids of liver and brain. The basic method involves thin-layer chromatography followed by charring to reveal the bands. The intensity of each band is determined by suspending the silica gel in a radioactive scintillation gel and measuring the optically quenched activities. The lipids are extracted with hexane/isopropanol and, {{in the case of}} total <b>lipid</b> <b>determinations,</b> the extract is simply applied to a silica gel plate and charred without use of a development step. For brain cerebroside, the extract is applied to the plate and developed in the usual way.

For sphingomyelin the ester type lipids in the extract are cleaved by alkali for 1 min and the resultant lipids are applied directly to the thin-layer plate. Free fatty acids are ~hromato~aphed and measured after a preliminary solvent partitioning to remove most lipids. The method is useful for samples of 5 - 40 pg.

The results obtained with different extraction methods may differ quite considerably [6, 8, 9, 12 – 18], leading to over- or underestimations when normalizing BCF values to lipid contents. Therefore, the selection of appropriate extraction techniques using mixed systems of nonpolar and polar solvents is required to ensure the complete extraction of total lipids from fish/tissue samples. In this context, the OECD 305 guideline [1] recommends the use of chloroform/methanol for determination of fish lipid content. The microgravimetric assay for total lipids described by Gardner et al.

However, a broad range of analytical procedures are available which can be used for lipid measurements as part of bioconcentration studies and thus may have a potential impact on the results obtained.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in multiple genes involved in lipid transport and metabolism are presumed to modulate the risk of dyslipidemia in response to antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: The contribution to dyslipidemia of 20 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms of 13 genes {{reported in the literature}} to be associated with plasma lipid levels (ABCA 1, ADRB 2, APOA 5, APOC 3, APOE, CETP, LIPC, LIPG, LPL, MDR 1, MTP, SCARB 1, and TNF) was assessed by longitudinally modeling more than 4400 plasma <b>lipid</b> <b>determinations</b> in 438 antiretroviral therapy-treated participants during a median period of 4. 8 years. An exploratory genetic score was tested that takes into account the cumulative contribution of multiple gene variants to plasma lipids. RESULTS: Variants of ABCA 1, APOA 5, APOC 3, APOE, and CETP contributed to plasma triglyceride levels, particularly in the setting of ritonavir-containing antiretroviral therapy. Variants of APOA 5 and CETP contributed to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Variants of CETP and LIPG contributed to non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, a finding not reported previously.

Glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms that alter glucocorticoid sensitivity may influence metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with AD. The 9 b polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene is associated with relative glucocorticoid resistance and has been reported to increase the risk of myocardial infarction in the elderly. We explored the impact of this polymorphism in patients with AD. Materials and Methods: 147 patients with AD and 147 age, gender and ethnicity matched healthy controls were recruited. Blood was taken in a non-fasted state for plasma <b>lipid</b> <b>determination,</b> measurement of cardiovascular risk factors and DNA extraction. Results: Genotype data for the 9 b polymorphism was available for 139 patients and 146 controls. AD patients had a more atherogenic lipid profile characterized by an increase in the prevalence of small dense LDL (p = 0. 003), increased triglycerides (p = 0. 002), reduced HDLC (p, 0. 001) an elevated highly sensitive C-reactive protein (p = 0. 01), compared with controls. The 9 b polymorphism (at least one G allele) was found in 28 % of patients and controls respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, BMI and hydrocortisone dose per metre square of body surface area in patients, there were no significant metabolic associations with this polymorphism and hydrocortisone doses were not higher in patients with th...|$|E

The sera were of human origin, to avoid abnormal matrix effects. To de-crease the cholesterol content in some samples, we ad-sorbed them onto colloidal silicic acid. To increase it, we added lipoproteins that had been precipitated from human serum with heparin and calcium ions. The precipitation method we used allowed us to dilute the serum as little as possible and to keep the final concentrations of calcium and heparin as low as possible, while maintaining a high choles-terol content. By mixing these sera having high and low cholesterol concentrations, we could prepare batches with any desired concentration. The stabilities of these sera were excellent. We used the sera to calibrate enzymic determina-tions of cholesterol.

40|$|PURPOSE: Metabolic Syndrome {{as defined}} by ATP III criteria, a {{constellation}} of risk factors associated with insulin resistance, predisposes to premature atherosclerosis and early coronary events. Whether that negative risk profile is associated with endothelial dysfunction remains to be established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transcapillary escape rate of albumin (TERalb), a measure of capillary permeability and integrity of systemic capillary endothelium, and forearm vasodilation to intra-arterial acetylcholine (ACH), an index of nitric oxide (NO) -mediated vasomotor dysfunction, were assessed in 24 non-diabetic, uncomplicated hypertensive men with Metabolic Syndrome according to ATP III criteria (hypertension {{with at least two}} additional traits such as high triglycerides, low HDL, abdominal obesity, impaired fasting or post-load plasma glucose). Twelve age-matched lean normal hypertensive patients with normal lipid and glucose profile and nine normotensive subjects were the controls. All patients underwent <b>lipids</b> <b>determination</b> and fasting and post-OGTT insulin assessment; HOMA-IR was the index of insulin resistance. RESULTS: TERalb was higher in hypertensive patients with Metabolic Syndrome, without differences between hypertensive and normotensive controls. Blood pressure (BP), lipids, plasma glucose, insulin levels and HOMA-IR were unrelated to TERalb. Responses to acetylcholine were selectively attenuated in metabolic patients and, on an individual basis, related only to HDL cholesterol levels, independent of LDL cholesterol, BP, body size, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR values. No relationship existed between responses to acetylcholine and TERalb. CONCLUSIONS: Altered systemic capillary permeability characterizes insulin-resistant hypertensive patients with Metabolic Syndrome. That defect, which may promote early atherosclerosis development, coexists with blunted endothelial-mediated vasodilation, indicating a pervasive abnormality of endothelial function...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{evaluated}} plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), factor VII activity (FVII), and fibrinogen in {{a sample}} of octo-nonagenarians. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship of these fibrinolytic and coagulation parameters with lipoprotein profile and anthropometric variables in the absence or presence of disability. METHODS: We enrolled a population of 162 octo-nonagenarians, divided in two groups on the basis of presence or absence of disability in the activity of daily living (ADL). All the anthropometric determinations were carried out according to standardized methods. Blood samples for hemostatic and <b>lipid</b> <b>determinations</b> were collected after overnight fasting and resting. RESULTS: PAI- 1 activity and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in disabled (DIS) compared to free-living (FL) adults, whereas FVII did not show differences in the two groups. PAI- 1 activity and FVII positively correlated to anthropometric parameters (body mass index, subscapular and tricipital skinfold thickness) in both DIS and FL. No correlations were found between fibrinogen and other variables in FL, whereas a negative relation with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels emerged in DIS. FVII was positively related with total cholesterol low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B in both FL and DIS. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of octo-nonagenarians, PAI- 1 activity and FVII show a significant correlation with several anthropometric and lipoprotein parameters, suggesting that these variables are strongly associated with body composition and lipid metabolism independent from age and disability. DIS presented higher PAI- 1 and fibrinogen levels; this observation may take in account the high prevalence of vascular diseases and also occult inflammation, which are known to affect these parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Experimental {{studies have}} {{suggested}} an important role of the spleen in lipid metabolism, although with controversial results. Our purpose was to analyze {{the effect of a}} nutritionally balanced (NB) diet and a diet containing pork fat (PF) as source of lipids on the lipid profile of rats submitted to splenic surgery. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were divided into six groups of 10 animals each: 1 sham-operated, NB diet; 2 sham-operated, PF diet; 3 total splenectomy (TS), NB diet; 4 TS, PF diet; 5 TS followed by splenic autotransplantation (SA), NB diet; and 6 SA, PF diet. Blood samples were collected at the beginning (D 0) and after 12 weeks of the experiment (D? 12) for plasma <b>lipid</b> <b>determination.</b> Morphologic regeneration of splenic tissues was observed, with no dif-ferences between groups 5 and 6. When D? 12 plasma lipid levels were compared to D 0 levels there were no differences in groups 1, 3, and 5, while in groups 2, 4, and 6 total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and triacylglycerols (TAG) increased, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) decreased. At D? 12, groups 2, 4, and 6 had lower HDL than group 3. In conclusion, regardless of the surgical procedure applied to the spleen, an NB diet maintained plasma lipid levels while a diet with PF as source of lipids changed the animals ’ lipid profile...|$|E
40|$|Microalgae are {{exponentially}} growing {{aquatic organisms}} that perform photosynthesis very efficiently. As such, they can realize {{a much higher}} production per square meter than traditional agricultural plants. Furthermore, they are poor in structural polysaccharides and richer in proteins and lipids. Microalgae have a characteristic lipid composition, with fatty acids often differing from those in higher animal and vegetable organisms. To screen microalgae for their amount of lipids, an analytical procedure to extract the lipids can be performed. This method is time- and labor-intensive, {{making it difficult to}} screen large numbers of algae. The aim of this research was to propose a rapid method for <b>lipid</b> <b>determination</b> of microalgae. For the development of the rapid method, Nile Red, a lipid-soluble fluorescent dye, was tested. This dye is known to be a fluorescent marker for neutral lipids. Pretreatment of the algal cell suspensions was avoided as much as possible and was therefore limited to dilution of the algal suspension until the OD (720 nm) was between 0. 1 and 0. 3. The area of the fluorescence peak and height at different emission wavelengths were compared to the actual amount of total and neutral lipids. Unfortunately, {{there appears to be no}} good relationship between the actual amount of the total or neutral lipids and the area of the fluorescence peak or the height of fluorescence at any of the emission wavelengths measured. We can only conclude that the Nile Red method gives some indication about the total and/or neutral lipids present, but cannot be used as a quantitative technique. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Principally, {{extraction}} {{differences may}} lead to substantial differences in comparing BCFs across studies and among species of varying lipid composition [9]. However, a critical investigation of different methods for <b>lipid</b> <b>determination</b> {{with respect to their}} impact on estimated BCFs is missing. Due to the limited amount of published results from bioaccumulation studies which were carried out according to OECD TG 305 [1], the specific comparison of BCFs estimated for single contaminants is difficult. Geyer et al. [38] described the relationship between the lipid content of fish and their bioconcentration potential of 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene. This study presents a valuable collection of references of older bioaccumulation studies. For instance, in a study on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), presented by Galassi and Calamari [39], a lipid content of 3.2 % was estimated for the newly hatched animals leading to a wet weight-based BCF (BCFW) of 349 (based on lipid weight, the respective lipid-based BCF (BCFL) was 10, 906). In a further study on the same species but with bigger animals, a lipid content of 8.3 % was determined leading to a BCFW of 1, 300 (BCFL = 15, 660) [40]. Lipid contents in both studies were determined by the Soxhlet extraction [23]. However, different solvent systems (n-hexane vs. acetone/hexane) and different boiling periods (8 h vs. 24 h) were applied. It can be assumed that in the first study, due to the neutral solvent (n-hexane), only the neutral lipids were removed leading to a lower lipid content and thus a higher BCFL value. In contrast, the lipid content presented in the second study seems to be exceptionally high for animals of the given size.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} summation technic for the quantitation {{of total}} lipid {{from the results}} of the cholesterol, phospholipid,and triglycerides determinations is compared to the phenol turbidity and gravimetric method. Also considered is the total lipid value calculated from the cholesteroland triglyceride concentrations. THE AVAILABLE SEMIAUTOMATED METHODS for the precise and accurate quantitation of serum cholesterol, phospholipids, and glycerides have vastly reduced the labor, laboratory equipment, space, and typical errors attendant to performing these studies. Still needed, however, is a procedure for total lipid assay which retains the analytic integrity of the gravimetric method and, at the same time, can be conveniently applied to quantitating a large number of serum samples. One solution to this problem is to perform the cholesterol, phospho-lipid, and triglyceride assays, and then calculate the total lipid concen-tration, from the values of the lipid fractions. The purpose of this paper, then, is to evaluate this summation meth-od as a useful tool in providing accurate and precise total lipid values for clinical use. Methods Subject Preparation Total cholesterol (C), free cholesterol (FC), esterified cholesterol (EC), phospholipid (P), triglyceride (T), and total <b>lipid</b> <b>determinations</b> were performed on serum samples from 328 adult males. The subjects were outpatients who arrived 1 or 2 days before the samples were collected. Prior to the patient’s visit, he received a letter of instruc-tions which directed him to eat food ad libitum during the 3 days prior to his appointment at the laboratory.

40|$|About 5 to 7 years ago, {{metabolic}} changes {{associated with}} use of atypical antipsychotic agents began being investigated and identified. This led, in 2004, to the FDA requesting manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics to add a warning regarding the risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes to their prescribing information. 1 Around the same time, joint consensus recommendations from four key national organizations—the American Diabetes Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and the North American Association for the Study of Obesity—were developed to address the need for metabolic monitoring in patients prescribed atypical antypsychotics. 2, 3 Specifically, the recommendation was that “all patients receiving second-generation antipsychotics should have fasting blood glucose and lipid levels determined at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. ” More recently, a quality measure has been developed by the The STAndards for BipoLar Excellence (STABLE) Project that assesses the percentage of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated with an atypical antipsychotic agent who received at least one assessment for hyperlipidemia within the initial 16 -week period of treatment. 4 Actual Practice Studies suggest that lipid monitoring in patients being treated with atypical antipsychotic agents is underperformed.

Synopsis [...] The methods for determining SEBUM EXCRETION {{as well as the}} subsequent for-mation of a LIPID LAYER ON THE SKIN SURFACE are discussed. The different stages of this process are measured by techniques appropriate to the physical parameters. A new method which allows the quantitative <b>determination</b> of the <b>lipid</b> layer of the skin surface exclusively is also described. This method takes advantage of the known effect tath the LIGHT-TRANSMISSION OF GROUND GLASS increases after contact with skin lipid which results, for example, by pres-sing it to the forehead. This INCREASE IN LIGHT TRANSMISSION OF THE GLASS at 460 nm is PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF SURFACE <b>LIPID.</b> <b>Determinations</b> at different levels of skin lipid show that both the known physiological relations of sebum excretion and its pharmacological lterations can be reproduced by this method. The standard deviation of the method is S = •: 6. 5 % (coefficient of variation, V = 12. 8 %). Comparison of assays by the method of Strauss and Pochi and by this method, combined with an analysis of the shape of the resulting curves, permits DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN SEBUM EXCRETION AND THE SUBSEQUENT FORMATION OF THE SURFACE LIPID LAYER. This method enables one to follow the distribution of ENDOGENOUS LIPIDS on the skin as well as the fate of EXOGE-NOUSLY APPLIED LIPIDS at brief intervals. Thus, novel approaches to various physiological, dermatopharmacological and cosmetic problems should be possible xvith the aid of this new me-thod. A...|$|R
