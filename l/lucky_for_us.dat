2500|$|The Taylor Commission {{received}} criticism due to {{implications of}} bias. Attorney General Robert Kennedy {{was included in}} the group and collectively, the commission was seen as a unit more preoccupied with deflecting the White House from blame than that of a group concerned with realizing the true depth of mistakes that promoted the failure in Cuba. Jack Pfeiffer, who worked as a historian for the CIA until the mid-1980s, simplified his own view of the failed Bay of Pigs effort by including a quote from Raúl Castro, Fidel's brother, given to a Mexican media member in 1975. [...] "Kennedy vacillated," [...] Castro said. [...] "If at that moment he had decided to invade us, he could have suffocated the island in a sea of blood, but he could have destroyed the revolution. <b>Lucky</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> he vacillated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pyarelal of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo {{quoted in}} an {{interview}} that [...] "Rajesh Khanna was <b>lucky</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout [...] "Wah! Wah!" [...] in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Anurodh. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then, {{and did not want to}} work with him." [...] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishore was very reluctant to sing [...] "Waada Tera Waada" [...] in Dushman and suggested to Laxmikant-Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishore meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishore that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this, Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.|$|E

6000|$|It was a <b>lucky</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{that nobody}} came along just then.

Finally the king said: ...|$|R

[...] "Yes, it was a <b>lucky</b> chance <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> his staying at La Rochette. Florimond was born under an unlucky star, I think, and you under a lucky one, Fortunio." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{professor}} wasn't at home," [...] explained Edna. [...] "Perhaps {{that was}} <b>lucky</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> He is in Chicago, and we pleaded {{so hard that}} Mrs. Dyer let us go into the attic and help ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, mother, {{but that}} was when I was seizing him, and in hot blood," [...] said Henry, in a subdued voice. [...] "I was hasty there, no doubt. <b>Lucky</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> both that the pistol missed fire." ...|$|E

We {{consider}} {{we have made a}} capital bargain with you; we have been paid by you for our work in sinking the shaft, and now it will be easy <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to work our claims.

"A very <b>lucky</b> change <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> Brooks," [...] Mr. Bullsom declared, {{with the}} burly {{familiarity}} which he considered justified by {{his position as}} chairman of the Radical committee. [...] "Poor Morrison was past the job. It was partly through his muddling that we lost the seat at the last election. I'd made up my mind to have a change this time, and so I told 'em." ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{script for}} the film was written by Brian Cox with Hernandez serving as Associate-Producer. Hernandez was excited to have Valderrama play the lead, stating in an interview, [...] "Wilmer is just drop-dead perfect! Really, it was a <b>lucky</b> break <b>for</b> <b>us</b> getting him to play Diego de la Muerte/El Muerto. He is so {{completely}} immersed in the role. For him, its {{a chance to play}} a leading role in a film. And he sees the franchise potential with this character. I mean, hes playing a comic book superhero, how cool is that!?" [...] In the same interview he also praised the supporting cast, saying [...] "The quality of actors should give you an idea {{about the quality of the}} script." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Like him!' I exclaimed. 'The worst-tempered bit of {{a sickly}} slip that ever {{struggled}} into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured, he'll not win twenty. I doubt whether he'll see spring, indeed. And small loss to his family whenever he drops off. And <b>lucky</b> it is <b>for</b> <b>us</b> that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and selfish he'd be. I'm glad you have no chance of having him for a husband, Miss Catherine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is good}} news, Terence, though I {{see myself}} that our {{difficulties}} will really begin only when we get out. There {{is no doubt that}} the fight with the guerillas was a <b>lucky</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> I would not have missed it for anything, for I must say there was much more excitement in it than in a battle, at least as far as my experience of a battle goes. At Talavera we had nothing to do but stick up on the top of a hill, watch the French columns climbing up, and then give them a volley or two and roll them down the hill again; and between times stand to be shelled by Victor's batteries on the opposite hill. I cannot see that there is any fun about that. This fight, too, has turned out a very good thing <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> I expect we should not have been so well treated if it had not been for it, and the fact that some of these French soldiers are ready to give us a helping hand is first rate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bear sure enough. I expect {{he knows}} of this place, and has {{come here for}} shelter. He had much better have left it alone. It is <b>lucky</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> that the fire has burnt low; it would have scared him {{if it had been}} blazing. Lie down, Jack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they had}} we'd seen somethin' of it; but them duffers didn't have any baggage {{when they come}} aboard. The Bonita wouldn't 'a' left the cove so quick if the men had known about this. I tell you, fellers, it was <b>lucky</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> that they stole the brig!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed we did; and <b>lucky</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{that we did}} so. Had {{they not}} known that we were prepared, I am {{convinced}} the house would have been attacked.

6000|$|... "And {{your mother}} {{tells me that}} you play the fiddle. These things will be of service to you with the Prince. Music runs in his family. Your {{education}} has been what you could get at a village school. Well, you are not examined in Greek roots in polite society, which is <b>lucky</b> <b>for</b> some of <b>us.</b> It is as well {{just to have a}} tag or two of Horace or Virgil: 'sub tegmine fagi,' or 'habet foenum in cornu,' which gives a flavour to one's conversation like the touch of garlic in a salad. It is not bon ton to be learned, but it is a graceful thing to indicate that you have forgotten a good deal. Can you write verse?" ...|$|R
