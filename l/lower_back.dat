Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E

5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} to the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and {{slightly better than}} low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although {{only a few of}} those who have spinal fusion experience good results. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E

30|$|The seated push-up test is {{a method}} of {{assessing}} {{the strength of the}} triceps, shoulder and scapular muscles. The test involves pushing the body up out of a seated position, and slowly <b>lowering</b> it <b>back</b> into the seat. The participant was placed with the knees out straight and the heels resting on the floor or table. The participant had to push their body up from the table or floor until the elbows were straight, held for 20  seconds and then slowly <b>lowered</b> <b>back</b> into the seat. The reliability of revised push-up test protocol in people without disabilities was 0.80 to 0.96 (Hong et al. 2011).|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (<b>lower</b> <b>back),</b> or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the seasons which did not feature post-season fights between the coaches, several seasons have been impacted, forcing postponements.

The fight between season ten coaches Rashad Evans and Quinton Jackson took place at UFC 114 with Rashad Evans winning by unanimous decision. The fight was postponed by five months due to Jackson's A-Team filming commitments and his temporary decision to retire from fighting.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E
