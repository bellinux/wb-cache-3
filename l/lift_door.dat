500|$|The video {{features}} Range, Buchanan and Buena {{emerging from}} a lift onto separate floors of a tall building, the lift having been called by unsuspecting men. Range arrives {{on the floor of}} the first man, described by Buena as 'Mr Shy Guy', and the two begin flirting with each other. Buchanan opens the <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> to see, the second man, 'Mr Too Cool' and Buchanan is shown flirting and dancing with him. Buena emerges from the lift to find 'Mr Perfect', the third man. Buena takes his folded umbrella and throws it away, and soon begins flirting with him.|$|E
6000|$|Jules {{brought the}} machine to a halt: {{and it was at}} this point that he should have done the one thing {{connected}} with his professional activities which he did really well--the opening, to wit, of the iron cage. There are ways of doing this. Jules' was the right way. He was accustomed to do it with a flourish, and generally remarked [...] "V'la!" [...] in a modest but self-congratulatory voice as though {{he would have liked to}} see another man who could have put through a job like that. Jules' opinion was that he might not be much to look at, but that he could open a <b>lift</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> {{opens to}} reveal an {{underground}} cavern, or catacomb, {{just ahead of}} the main ride chamber - which remains sealed at this point. The cavern is themed with rock effects to give the impression of a recently excavated site.|$|E

50|$|Most levels contain platforms, {{defined as}} {{anything}} {{able to change}} its height. Though it is generally used to describe <b>lifts,</b> <b>doors</b> are included in this category. Doors {{may or may not}} show up on the player's automap and are usually opened with the action key. In cases where they are damaged or locked they can be opened by special designated triggers or switches. Switches control various functions such as <b>lifts,</b> <b>doors</b> and lighting and {{come in the form of}} manual switches that can be toggled with the action key, stations for computer chips or breakable circuitry. Some switches are “tag” switches that execute multiple functions at once or those that must be activated as part of “repair” missions. Another notable level feature is teleporters, able to send players who use them to different parts of a level or to other levels. Aliens are unable to use them.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} reverberatory {{is nothing}} more than a steel box lined with alumina refractory brick with a flue at one end and a vertically <b>lifting</b> <b>door</b> at the other. Conventional oil or gas burners are placed usually on either side of the furnace to heat the brick and the eventual bath of molten metal is then poured into a casting machine to produce ingots.|$|R
50|$|Five strangers board a {{descending}} lift, one by one, in {{a modern}} office block in London. They reach the sub-basement, though {{none of them have}} pressed for that destination. There they find a large, elaborately furnished room which appears to be a gentlemen's club. The <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> has closed and there are no buttons to bring it back, nor any other exit. Resigned to waiting for help, they settle down with drinks and talk. The conversation turns to dreams, and each man tells of a recurring nightmare.|$|E
50|$|When {{the story}} of the final dream is told, the five ponder the meaning of their nightmares. The <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> opens, and they find {{themselves}} looking out onto a graveyard. They walk out, becoming decomposing corpses, and disappear one by one. Sebastian stays behind, and explains that they are damned souls compelled to tell {{the story of}} their evil deeds for all eternity. He then turns back into the room (which is now the inside of a tomb with a coffin in the centre) and the door shuts behind him.|$|E
50|$|The {{fire escape}} {{is exposed to}} the sniper's gunfire, so they force open the <b>lift</b> <b>door.</b> It is boobytrapped with a shotgun, however, which kills Jeff. Becky, Kurtis, and Paul climb down the lift shaft, but {{discover}} the ground-floor exit door has been blocked with a skip {{and return to the}} top floor. Jenny suggests the emoticons symbolise the three wise monkeys and that the sniper is targeting them because they let Jimmy be killed and refused to speak to the police about it. She then walks into her flat to be shot dead alongside her children.|$|E
50|$|For the 1968 {{model year}} the entire line was updated {{with a new}} body {{featuring}} a taller integrated windshield with an integrated rear-view mirror, a padded dashboard with non-toggle switches, built-in headrests, and <b>lifting</b> <b>door</b> handles. This version was first shown at the 14th Tokyo Motor Show in October 1967 and {{was developed to meet}} the new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. In the US the engines were also fitted with new emissions controls, and the lesser 1600 continued as a companion model through the end of production. Australia had no such emission controls.|$|R
50|$|Newer homes feature more American styled tilting panel <b>lift</b> <b>doors</b> which slide up onto a {{track on}} the ceiling via a motor and chain drive. Since the late 1970s {{most if not all}} garages are attached, and {{throughout}} the 80's it became more common to have an access door into the home from the garage where design permitted, whereas it is commonplace now. Most older unit (apartment) blocks in Australia have garages on the ground floor accessible through a common hallway and access doors, all leading into a common driveway. Newer ones now have underground parking.|$|R

50|$|Rialto {{consists}} of two interconnected towers, North and South, with rooftop floors at Level 41 and Level 58 respectively. There are 36 passenger lifts, 95 km of lift cables, 706 <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> openings and 1,450 staircase steps. The outer surface of the building has 13,000 windows. There are five basement levels of car park available for occupiers and casual users. When completed in 1986, The Rialto surpassed Sydney's MLC Centre to become Australia's tallest building at 251 metres. It was the tallest for five years until being surpassed by 101 Collins Street in 1991. It remained the tallest to roof until the construction of Eureka Tower in 2006. It is currently the seventh tallest building in Australia and third tallest to roof after the Eureka and the Pearl Tower.|$|E
5000|$|The aim of {{the show}} was to {{complete}} each game (set on a [...] "floor" [...] of the skyscraper), gradually rising up the tower. In the first series this climaxed in the alphabet soup game, {{and in the second}} series upon reaching the penthouse, where prizes could be won. In series two if a player lost a game, they were sent to the [...] "basement" [...] of the tower (the laundry room), and the other players had to take the lift back down to rescue them. In the first series the lift doors would open directly into game, whereas in the second series the lift doors would open to a generic corridor which had a series of doors, with a light above a door in the corridor indicating the relevant room. On occasions during the second series the <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> would open to reveal a darkened corridor with the dark knight walking slowly to the lift, which required the contestants to quickly shut the lift doors.|$|E

5000|$|An {{extension}} spring counterbalance system {{consists of a}} pair of stretched springs running parallel to the horizontal tracks. The springs <b>lift</b> the <b>door</b> through a system of pulleys and counterbalance cables running from the bottom corner brackets through the pulleys. When the door is raised, the springs contract, thus <b>lifting</b> the <b>door</b> as the tension is released. Typically these springs are made of 11 gauge galvanized steel, and the lengths of these springs are based on the height of the garage door in question. Their lifting weight capacity can best be identified by the color that is painted on the ends of the springs.|$|R
5000|$|Once the <b>lift</b> <b>doors</b> open riders {{are greeted}} by a Phalanx {{operative}} wearing a gas mask and covered in blood, holding a small torch. Those in the left lift are abruptly led out whilst those in the right lift are kept in by another masked actor who lets them out a few seconds later. Riders then enter a strobe maze, whereby powerful strobe flashes to disorientate them. Metal chain link fences surround riders, whilst [...] "contaminated" [...] Phalanx operatives jump out at them. Air cannons, strobe lighting and loud sound effects simulate the supposed 'decontamination' of the visitors. Riders are then chased out of the ride by a 'rabid' Phalanx worker.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} space is structured around a central engine room which basically {{gives rise to}} the building's form. This space creates the spine of the building and has direct access to Pashen street via a large automated, panel <b>lift</b> <b>door.</b> Set either side of the engine room are ancillary spaces including a watch room, dormitory, officer's room (formerly a workshop), kitchen, recreation room and toilet and shower facilities. These ancillary spaces are lined with tongue and groove boarding. Similarly, the floors are also said to be tongue and groove, pine floor boards however, more recent floor coverings now conceal the nature of the original floor. The central engine room is set approximately 200mm below the floor level of side ancillary spaces, and access into these spaces is via small concrete steps located outside each doorway. Built into the steps are a series of drainage pipes which allow the central area to drain freely. At the rear of the central engine room a small locker room has been constructed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{patriotic}} {{tension in}} the boardroom on the 8th floor of the Australian Natives' Association building in Elizabeth Street yesterday morning was being stretched to breaking point. From {{four corners of the}} room hung Australian flags. At the Head of the long boardroom table sat Sir Norman Martin, chairman of the Australia Day Council. ...There had been intense speculation earlier as to what the [...] "special uniformed messenger" [...] would be wearing when he arrived bearing a sealed envelope containing the Australian of the Year decision. ... He was made to walk from the <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> to Sir Norman twice to satisfy other television cameramen, until, rather thankfully, he at last handed the envelope over.It was somehow an anticlimax when Sir Norman demanded: [...] "Do you bear a message from the Premier?""Yes" [...] said the messenger meekly, and as Sir Norman announced the winner to be Robert Helpmann, a shower of prepared press releases announcing the same thing landed gently {{on the table in front}} of the waiting pressmen. The 1966 announcement of the Australian of the Year, as reported in The Age.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Heroes & Villains", she {{is shown}} to be a client of a famous comic book store, and that she has bought a copy of the graphic novel based on Castle's {{character}} Derrick Storm, which she tries to hide as an attempt to help with the sales. When she interrogates Officer Hastings, who has been fighting crime as a vigilante called Lone Vengeance and is suspected of killing a man that knew her double identity, {{it turns out that the}} two of them are very similar in that they lost one of their parents when someone murdered them and have allowed that to drive their careers towards the police force in order to make justice. It also turns out that she has a boyfriend who works as a journalist and writes a comic about what Lone Vengeance does. Beckett tells her to stop letting her past define her life. When it is found that Officer Hastings is innocent, the officer and the journalist leave the precinct and kiss passionately as the <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> closes. Castle comments on the similarity between the couple the officer and the journalist make and the relationship between himself and Beckett.|$|E

5000|$|Captain Picard has {{the dubious}} honor of giving {{a guided tour}} of the ship to three {{children}} that won a science fair, a task he has not been looking forward to. They are aboard the turbolift when the accident occurs, and Picard suffers a fractured ankle from the sudden stop. He calms the children down, and to boost their morale, assigns them honorary command roles. With their spirits renewed, Picard and the children start to climb out of the turbolift and up the shaft until they are able to access the <b>lift</b> <b>doors</b> on another floor and climb out safely. Picard comes to appreciate the children and offers to give them another tour once the situation has been resolved.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} scene (taking place in the [...] "missed train" [...] timeline), James leaves the {{hospital}} after visiting his mother, and Helen leaves after ending her relationship with Gerry. They meet in the lift, and Helen drops an earring which is picked up by James, as in their first encounter {{at the beginning of}} the film. Before the <b>lift</b> <b>doors</b> close, James tells Helen to cheer up and repeats his line: [...] "You know what the Monty Python boys say..." [...] Helen (who had previously assumed the rejoinder to be [...] "always look on the bright side of life.") says [...] "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition". The frame freezes as she and James stare at one another.|$|R

"We’d {{just done}} {{a show in}} a hotel, and as the <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> opened there was this crowd waiting for autographs and someone shouted out, 'What {{do you think of}} R.E.M. doing your record?'" [...] {{explained}} Presley to Record Collector editor Peter Doggett. [...] "Well, I hadn’t heard of R.E.M. But my manager had, so he suggested working with them on our new album. And when I listened to their records, I thought they weren’t far removed from what we were doing when we started. They invited me and Chris over to Athens to work with them for a week. By this time I’d realised quite how big they were, and so we spent the first five minutes walking around one another going, 'Wow'. It was quite different working with them. With the Troggs it had always just been you had a guitar and so you had a sound. With them, you had a roomful of 65 guitars to get exactly the right sound. They were very laid back, very normal. There was no high falutin’ sort of, 'Listen to this 'cos we’re better than you.' After all, their drummer was selling hamburgers until a few weeks before they made it. He was doing quite well with his own business. Having been a roofer when [...] "Wild Thing" [...] hit the charts, I could relate to that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Liam {{enters the}} building, as does Mr. Becker, who {{is holding a}} petrol can. As Liam walks into the ritual room, Rob runs out, {{shouting}} [...] "Liam, it's Becker, he's here!" [...] but is interrupted by Becker who hits him with a bat and proceeds to douse him with petrol. Liam, thinking Becker is the djinn, runs in to save Rob, accidentally pushing Becker down some stairs. When {{he goes back to}} look Becker has disappeared. Later Becker reappears and Liam is about to kill him in revenge for Annie until Rob rushes in and stops him. Seconds later, Rob kills Becker in a panic when Becker attempts to choke him. They start to leave, Rob attempting to convince Liam there really was no djinn but Liam remembers Lucy and they go looking for her. Liam finds her hanged in the lift shaft. Rob reveals to Liam that he is the djinn, telling Liam that it's his turn as his father sent him somewhere terrible, so now Liam will know the pain that he has. Liam attempts to stab him, but Rob blocks it with his hand, which bleeds but also starts a small flame. As Rob taunts Liam, Liam realises through another flashback that fire will kill the djinn. He grabs the nearby lantern and wards off Rob with it, but as Rob attempts to fake being unpossessed (by crying and admitting fear) Liam tosses the lantern at him, setting him ablaze. Liam kicks him down the lift shaft, but a few seconds later he grabs onto Liam's shin (now heavily burned and scarred). Liam finishes him by shutting the <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> on him, causing him to fall all the way down. After a while Liam opens the door to check he is dead, but a burst of flame pushes him back, signalling his body has been destroyed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Signal {{variation}} {{caused by}} motions along the lift shaft in a campus environment and {{on board a}} ship is compared. The guiding effect is common for both lift shafts, and the variation in amplitude of the guided signals is more significant for the lift shaft with larger dimensions. Unlike the lift shaft within the campus, the ship with its lift shaft forms a ‘waveguide within waveguide ’ structure. Therefore, the reflected signals within the ship enclosure outside the lift shaft are significantly affected by the motion along the lift shaft. Due to {{the difference in the}} degree of the signal variations in these two environments, the rms delay spread is found to be closely related to the <b>lift</b> <b>door</b> status and the lift car position in the campus environment, whereas it is not significantly affected by the motions along the lift shaft in the ship environment. From the statistical study and comparison of the signal variations in the two environments, the Weibull probability density function is found to be the most suitable model to describe analogous waveguide channels such as the lift shaft and the ship enclosure. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether <b>lifting</b> the trawl <b>doors</b> and sweeps from the seabed can reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. We {{carried out a}} catch {{comparison}} and catch ratio analysis between two gear setups, one with the trawl doors and sweeps at the seabed (the traditional way) {{and the other with}} the <b>doors</b> and sweeps <b>lifted.</b> The study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing with the doors and sweeps at the seabed, the gear is significantly more efficient at catching flatfish. The gear setup with the doors and sweeps at the seabed captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than the gear setup with the <b>doors</b> and sweeps <b>lifted.</b> This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases with fish size. The results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as <b>lifting</b> the <b>doors</b> and sweeps from the seabed could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if <b>lifting</b> the <b>doors</b> and sweeps from the seabed is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R

50|$|On {{the night}} of 19 July 1998, at least five men broke into Kearney's eighth-floor flat in the New Lodge area of Belfast. He was up late minding his two-week-old daughter, Caitlin Rose, who was asleep on his chest. The men put Caitlin and her mother, Lisa, into a bedroom and {{disabled}} the telephone. They overpowered Kearney, allegedly {{with the help of}} chloroform, and tied his hands behind his back. He was dragged out to the lift (elevator) and shot three times: once in each knee and once in the ankle. Lisa found him unconscious and bleeding heavily. She could not get any of the neighbours to answer their doors, and had to run to another floor to find a telephone. The <b>lift</b> <b>doors</b> had also been jammed and she had to run to the ground floor to unblock them. An ambulance rushed Kearney to the Mater Hospital, but he is believed to have died on the way.|$|R

500|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} axial centre of the building, comprising a temple-like portico {{standing in front of}} the doors—a relatively common motif of administration buildings of the time. The entrance arrangement is regarded by some people as slightly pompous: the entrance and <b>lift</b> <b>doors</b> are of bronze, and the ceiling and walls of the porch are clad in bronze plate and copper friezes. The inner lobby has two curved staircases with a sheet aluminum treatment, and marble walls with a zigzag pattern. The axial centre at the rear of the building has a round glazed façade; here, the view of the buildings at the rear of the site (the [...] "casino") is maximised by the curved walls that afford vistas to the subsidiary buildings 100 m distant, separated from the main building by parkland and a pool. During the American occupation of the building, this rotunda housed a small kiosk; later, it was used as a conference room. Nowadays, it is called the Dwight D. Eisenhower room and accommodates a café.|$|R
