40|$|A digital {{microfluidic}} biochip (DMFB) is {{a device}} that digitizes fluidic samples into tiny droplets and operates chemical processes on a single chip. Movement control of droplets can be realized by using electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology. DMFBs have high configurability, high sensitivity, low cost and reduced human error {{as well as a}} promising future in the applications of point-of-care medical diagnostic, and DNA sequencing. As the demands of scalability, configurability and portability increase, a new DMFB architecture called Microelectrode Dot Array (MEDA) has been introduced recently to allow configurable electrodes shape and more precise control of droplets. The objective of this work is to investigate a routing algorithm which can not only handle the routing problem for traditional DMFBs, but also be able to route different sizes of droplets and incorporate diagonal movements for MEDA. The proposed droplet routing algorithm is based on 3 D-A* search algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the maximum <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time,</b> average <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> and total number of used cells. By enabling channel-based routing in MEDA, the equivalent total number of used cells can be significantly reduced. Compared to all existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm can achieve so far the least average <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of signal pruning in static timing {{analysis}} (STA). Traditionally, signals are propagated through the circuit and are pruned, such that only the signal with the <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> at each node is propagated forward. This signal pruning is a key to the linear run time of STA. However, it was previously observed that a signal with the <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> {{may not be the most}} critical signal, as an earlier signal with a larger transition time can result in a longer delay in the down-stream logic. Hence, arrival time based pruning can result in an optimistic delay, incorrect critical paths, and discontinuities of the delay during circuit optimization. Although algorithms were proposed to remedy this issue, they rely on propagation of multiple signals and have an exponential worst-case complexity. In this paper, we propose a new timing analysis algorithm, which uses a two pass traversa...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simple yet powerful general theoretical framework and efficient implementation for removal of clock network timing pessimism. We address pessimism in static timing analysis (STA) tools caused by considering delay variation along common segments of clock paths. The STA tools compute setup (hold) timing slack based on conservative combinations of late (early) launching and early (<b>late)</b> capturing <b>arrival</b> <b>times.</b> To avoid exponential-time path-based analysis the STA tools use both early and <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> on gates common to both launching and capturing paths. It is impossible in real circuit and is observed {{as the clock}} network pessimism in STA. Our approach supports any kind of delay variation though the typical causes of the pessimism are process, voltage, and temperature on-chip variation, and reconvergence in clock network. We propose a new theoretical framework that allows to apply known graph algorithms instead of time consuming forward and backward multi-pass tracing algorithms and heuristics that are limited to some network topologies [4]. The new graph-based framework supports clock networks of virtually any size and type, e. g., tree, mesh, hybrid, clock gating, chains of multipliers and dividers, loops in such chains, etc. The implementation based on the proposed framework has proven its strength in a commercial sign-off static timing analyzer and thus is helping hundreds of designers to achieve faster clock speeds of their chips...|$|R

However, the solution of current pin-count aware technique is inevitably limited by simply adopting it after the droplet routing stage. In this paper, we propose the first droplet routing algorithm for PDMFBs that can integrate pin-count technique with droplet routing stage. Furthermore, our algorithm is capable of simultaneously minimizing the number of control pins, the number of used cells, and the <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time.</b> We first present a basic integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to optimally solve the droplet routing problem for PDMFBs with simultaneous multi-objective optimization.

To further reduce the runtime, we present a deterministic ILP formulation that casts the original routing optimization problem into a decision problem, and solve it by a binary solution search method that searches in logarithmic time.

40|$|As the {{microfluidic}} technology advances, {{the design}} complexity of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFB) {{are expected to}} explode in the near future. One {{of the most critical}} challenges for DMFB design is the droplet routing problem, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner. In this paper, we propose a fast routability- and performancedriven droplet router for DMFBs. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a global moving vector analysis for constructing preferred routing tracks to minimize the number of used unit cells; (2) an entropy-based equation to determine the routing order of droplets for better routability; (3) a routing compaction technique by dynamic programming to minimize the <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> of droplets. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves 100 % routing completion for all test cases on three Benchmark Suites while the previous algorithms are not.

For the quantitative {{description of the}} spectrum in the whole time domain (from t≃tb to t≫tb, where tb is the ballistic time of flight), we make the following substantial improvements beyond previous simulations: (1) For the anharmonic decay we consider, the multibranch decay where the energies and propagation directions of the decayed phonons are determined from the energy-momentum conservation of the process. (2) For the isotope scattering polarization-dependent anisotropic scattering is used when we discuss the phonon intensity at a time t close to tb, otherwise an approximate isotropic scattering is employed. (3) The elastic anisotropy is explicitly incorporated through the group velocity of phonons to locate the positions where the scattering events occur. The simulated phonon intensity versus time of flight compares favorably with recent experiments. Specifically, the exponential decay for <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> observed experimentally is well reproduced.

The proposed scheme calculates the equivalent waveform that makes the output waveform close to the actual waveform, and uses the equivalent waveform for timing calculation. The proposed scheme can cope with various waveforms affected by resistive shielding, crosstalk noise, wire inductance etc. In this paper, we devise a method to calculate equivalent waveform. The proposed calculation method is compatible with conventional methods in gate delay library and characterization, and hence our method is easy to be implemented with conventional static timing analysis tools. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — High {{performance}} circuits {{are facing}} increasingly severe signal integrity problems due to crosstalk noise and crosstalk noise awareness {{has become an}} integral part of static timing analysis (STA). Existing crosstalk noise aware STA methods compute noise induced delay uncertainty on a net by net basis and in a pessimistic way, without considering the overlap bounds of the victim and aggressor timing windows and realistic delay impact on early and <b>late</b> signal <b>arrival</b> <b>times.</b> Since crosstalk induced delay on indivudial nets contribute cumulatively on data and clock paths, even small amounts of pessimism in computation can add up to produce several unrealistic timing violations. Unlike glitch noise analysis where noise often attenuates during propagation, quality of delay noise analysis is severely affected by any pessimism in noise estimation and can unnecessarily cost valuable silicon and design resources for fixing unreal violations. In this paper, we propose two temporal techniques to reduce pessimism in crosstalk noise aware STA. The first method, “effective delay noise”, is a net based method where the exact overlap points of victim and aggressor timing windows are considered to obtain the part of delay noise that actually impacts early and <b>late</b> signal <b>arrival</b> <b>times.</b> The second method, “path based delay noise”, is a path based method where the reduced arrival uncertainty of the nets of a given path are utilized for pessimism reduction. We also propose a novel “uncertainty propagation ” technique as part of the second method, which results in an iteration free crosstalk noise aware STA of the path with significantly reduced pessimism. The two techniques are combined in a proposed methodology that is compatible with existing industrial static timing analyzers with very little computational overhead compared to the traditional noise aware STA and a significant improvement in eliminating unreal violations. The proposed techniques resulted in 77 % reduction of worst case negative slack and 57 % reduction in the number of failing paths in the setup analysis of a 90 nm industrial design. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{combinatorial}} optimization problem that models situations of both dynamic ride-sharing and taxi-sharing. Passengers who want to share a taxi or a ride, use an app to specify their current location, destination and further information such as the earliest departure time, the <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> and the maximum cost {{they are willing to}} pay for the ride. Car owners also specify their origin, destination, the leaving time and the maximum accepted delay. Taxi drivers report their location and the time they will start and end the service. All drivers need to define a price per kilometer. The problem is to compute routes, matching requests to vehicles in such a way that ride-sharing is allowed as long as some restrictions are satisfied, such as: the capacity of the vehicle, maximum trip cost of each passenger and maximum delay. The problem is dynamic since new requests arrive on-line and routes can be modified in order to attend them. To solve this dynamic problem, the day is divided in time periods. For each period, an instance of a static problem is created and solved by a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Experiments with instances based on real data were made to evaluate the heuristics and the proposed method. In our simulations with taxis, passengers paid, on average, almost 30 % less than they would pay on private rides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We study the {{deployment}} planning problem (DPP) that may roughly {{be defined as}} the problem of the planning of the physical movement of military units, stationed at geographically dispersed locations, from their home bases to their designated destinations while obeying constraints on scheduling and routing issues {{as well as on the}} availability and use of various types of transportation assets that operate on a multimodal transportation network. The DPP is a large-scale real-world problem for which no analytical models are existent. In this study, we define the problem in detail and analyze it with respect to the academic literature. We propose three mixed integer programming models with the objectives of cost, lateness (the difference between the arrival time of a unit and its earliest allowable arrival time at its destination), and tardiness (the difference between the arrival time of a unit and its <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> at its destination) minimization to solve the problem. The cost-minimization model minimizes total transportation cost of a deployment and is of use for investment decisions in transportation resources during peacetime and for deployment planning in cases where the operation is not imminent and there is enough time to do deliberate planning that takes costs into account. The lateness and tardiness minimization models are of min-max type and are of use when quick deployment is of utmost concern. The lateness minimization model is for cases when the given fleet of transportation assets is sufficient to deploy units within their allowable time windows and the tardiness minimization model is for cases when the given fleet is not sufficient. We propose a solution methodology for solving all three models. The solution methodology involves an effective use of relaxation and restriction that significantly speeds up a CPLEX-based branchand-bound. The solution times for intermediate sized problems are around one hour at maximum for cost and lateness minimization models and around two hours for the tardiness minimization model. Producing a suboptimal feasible solution based on trial and error methods for a problem of the same size takes about a week in the current practice in the Turkish Armed Forces. We also propose a heuristic that is essentially based on solving the models incrementally rather than at one step. Computational results show that the heuristic can be used to find good feasible solutions for the models. We conclude the study with comments on how to use the models in the realworld.

This study examines the uncertainties associated with the historically reconstructed contaminant fate and transport simulations for an epidemiologic study conducted at U. S.

30|$|Under ambient {{temperature}} conditions, {{measurements of the}} P-wave velocity, vP, and S-wave velocity, vS, were performed using a separate, calibrated apparatus prior to, and following all three heating/cooling cycles using first <b>arrivals</b> (contrary to <b>late</b> <b>arrivals</b> in the coda for CWI). These measurements provided a reference for the velocity measurements. Measurements were made using two pairs of piezo-transducers in contact with opposing faces of the samples. One pair was oriented parallel to the sample length to measure P-wave first <b>arrival</b> <b>times.</b> The other, oriented perpendicular to the sample length, provided S-wave first <b>arrival</b> <b>times.</b> The source function was a sinusoidal pulse: 700  kHz for P-wave, and within the range 100 – 500  kHz for S-wave velocity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} we apply a {{recently}} formulated gen-eral timing model of synchronous operation {{to the special}} case of latch-controlled pipelined circuits. The model accounts for multiphase synchronous clocking, correctly captures the be-havior of level-sensitive latches, handles both short- and long-path delays, accommodates wave pipelining, and leads to a comprehensive set of timing constraints. Pipeline circuits are important because of their frequent use in computer systems. We define their concurrency {{as a function of}} the clock schedule and degree of wave pipelining. We then identify a special class of clock schedules, coincident multiphase clocks, which provide a lower bound on the value of the optimum cycle time. We show that the region of feasible solutions for single-phase clocking can be nonconvex or even disjoint, and derive a closed-form expression for the minimum cycle time of a restricted but prac-tical form of single-phase clocking. We compare these forms of clocking on three pipeline examples and highlight some of the issues in pipeline synchronization.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{modeling}} framework {{to study the}} day-to-day scheduling travel time adjustment behavior {{on the base of}} past experiences. Scheduling travel time is defined as the difference between the requested <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> and the departure time. Mathematical equations are established to formulate every traveler’s dynamic adjustment on his/her departure time. In the adjustment process, the last day’s scheduling time is an essential component, while the numbers of <b>late</b> <b>arrivals,</b> punctual arrivals, and early arrivals in a previous day are used to reflect the past experiences. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework...|$|R

For {{the first time in}} Malaysia, expected bus <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> and timetables were put up at bus stops along routes. However, these bus frequency timetables at the bus stops, as well as in myrapid website had been removed. This is because they could not cope with many sorts of problems, which is traffic congestion and insufficient number of buses, which resulted in <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> of buses.|$|R
50|$|Ghost, Fire, and the Hard-Hearted Witch regroups {{and tells}} Tong Fong Pak to reunite with them, believing that their reunion will prevent Xuemei from attacking them. Tong Fong Pak instead proposes {{that he will}} reunite with the masters and be {{directly}} under Fire's command only if marriage with Yuehua is a guarantee. When Yuehua hears this news and with little success in begging Fire {{to back out of}} the marriage arrangement, she runs away. Lun Lin buries his father and is a drunken mess. He is visited by Xuemei, who tells him of his original family but is unsuccessful. After she left, his master arrives to tell him about his (<b>late)</b> <b>arrival</b> around the <b>time</b> of his family's massacre, in which he discovered Lun Lin and deemed him as the only survivor of his family. Their reunion is cut short as they catch Ghost in his unsuccessful attempt to ambush Xuemei and take the lyre. As Ghost escapes, Lun Lin tries to convince Xuemei not to take any vengeance but Xuemei will not give up.|$|R
