40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the {{economic}} crisis has led to an increased number of shipping and trade cases before the courts which raise the issue of economic hardship as an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-performance</b> of the contract. As a legal concept, even in western legal systems, the cultural and normative differences pose a serious challenge for judicial and arbitral tribunals to find the right solution. The two extremes are either that hardship does not excuse performance or that it requires the contract to be modified, either judicially or by the parties. This article highlights some of these differences between the legal systems and emphasises that commercial people can and should be trusted to find solutions to the disruptive effects to contractual relations. However, commercial arrangements or solutions are only as successful as the legal system on which they are founded. This article thus aims to study the developments in European commercial law thinking which might be said to support or hinder commercial creativity and innovation. From an English law point of view, it will be demonstrated that these developments could not be said to be doctrinal developments per se, but merely a more pragmatic, as consistent with the heritage of the common law, application of the current doctrinal rules. The doctrinal challenges however could impede these pragmatic solutions as would be argued. Shipping contracts provide a useful backdrop because of their globalised and transnational nature. Of course, shipping contracts are often seen as a pure version of contracts given the presumed equal bargaining positions of both parties...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the situation of unexpected events which render the performance under the contract much more difficult than originally planned or totally impossible to perform. The research includes the comparative study of different international instruments dealing with the unexpected change of circumstances, also the English and U. S. common law and the relevant case law. The study of the case law showed that though the preference by courts and arbitral tribunals is given to the principle that contracts should be kept, there have been numerous cases where the party has been exempted from contractual obligations under the change of circumstances and this should be regarded as a way to assure the fairness principle in contractual relations. The paper also examines the requirements which are necessary for exclusion of the performance under unexpected change of the circumstances. As a general principle, the occurrence of the unexpected event itself will not be sufficient for exempting a party from contractual obligations. Number of things need to be determined and taken into account when assessing whether the party can be <b>excused</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-performance.</b> Furthermore, as regards to the effects of such events the balance of interests is followed by giving the affected party the right to choose the relevant remedy. Taking into account the complexity of modern contractual relationships, it is preferable that parties follow the principles of good faith and cooperation which lies in the centre of renegotiations. However, in the case of failure to negotiate the parties can “pass” to courts the right to determine whether adjustment or termination will conclude the contractual relationships...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{assessment}} of the position of English, American, French and German law, UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG), the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and Principle of European Contract Law (PECL) regarding the problem of economic hardship in performance of contracts. As such, it has four aims: first, to establish a comprehensive concept of economic hardship; second, {{on the basis of the}} concept of economic hardship established, to examine this concept in the four main legal systems to determine the extent to which they recognise this problem and what kind of legal consequences they consider for it; third, by a comparative approach, to consider and explore the points of convergence and divergence between the legal systems under study; and, fourth, by examining some international and regional laws and models to find out how non-domestic laws and models have treated the issue. In relation to the first aim, after establishing that a general theory of hardship is needed, it is argued that economic hardship occurs when, as a result of unforeseen and unforeseeable supervening events for which none of the parties is responsible and could not have been avoided the consequences, the performance of the contract has become excessively onerous and the original equilibrium of the contract has been fundamentally altered. In relation to the second aim, different conclusions are reached in the four legal systems being studied: in English law, although the doctrine of frustration by its dominant test of ‘fundamental change’ is theoretically applicable to cases of economic hardship, in practice, English courts have rejected the notion that hardship can be regarded as a ground <b>for</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-performance</b> of the contract. In American law, the modern doctrine of commercial impracticability has recognised the problem of economic hardship. However, in practice American courts have been unsuccessful in properly applying this doctrine to cases of economic changes in contracts. French law has only accepted economic changes as a ground for revision in administrative contracts under the doctrine of imprévision.  The German doctrine of frustration has played a broader function compared to that of other legal systems; German law has recognised the problem of economic hardship as a ground <b>for</b> <b>excuse</b> of <b>non-performance</b> of the contract in its case law and also in its recently revised Civil Code. In relation to the third aim, it is submitted that CISG, an international convention for international sale of goods, has not adopted the concept of economic hardship, and impossibility is the only ground for the exemption rule under Article 79 of CISG. However, the two modern models UNIDROIT Principles and PECL have properly recognised the problem of economic hardship and anticipated appropriate solutions for it. Although the presence of a concept of economic hardship is needed as a general guidance in changed economic circumstances, it is concluded that the most peaceful way to deal with the problem of economic hardship is to provide express causes at the time of conclusion of the contract.

40|$|Certain {{natural or}} {{technological}} disasters may have exceptionally severe consequences {{that call for}} the adoption of extraordinary measures. Some of these may restrict individual rights and freedoms to an extent which is not compatible with the affected State’s international obligations under human rights law. Yet, {{the existence of a}} public emergency of significant magnitude may temporarily exonerate States from the duty to fully respect their human rights commitments, either through the operation of specific clauses that are included in the relevant treaties (so-called “derogation clauses”), or—where no such provision is present—by invoking certain justifications recognized in international law as valid <b>excuses</b> <b>for</b> the <b>non-performance</b> of legal obligations. This chapter intends to look at the practice of States and treaty monitoring bodies in order to ascertain what substantial and procedural requirements States must fulfill if they deem it necessary to suspend individual rights while coping with a public emergency prompted by a natural or man-made disaster. The purpose is to ascertain what features a disaster must present in order to trigger the right to derogate, to what extent human rights may be suspended, what formal steps must be undertaken by authorities which choose to derogate from human rights treaties, and which are the legal parameters under general international law with regard to the suspension of treaties which do not explicitly provide for a right to derogate...|$|R

The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|R
