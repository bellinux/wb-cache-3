40|$|Lack of {{international}} markets for <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> <b>cereals</b> such as sorghum {{is a major}} constraint to economic development for West African farmers. Lack {{of international}} markets has traditionally resulted in price declines in normal and good weather years since consumers can only eat {{so much of a}} staple. Once consumers have enough of the staple, prices collapse, as there are no other markets. These price declines discourage farmers from using higher input levels and therefore achieving productivity gains. Hence, facilitating the growth of the food and feed processing industries for the basic staples is critical for the rapid economic growth of developing countries. To address this constraint USAID, in 2005, funded a project under the Initiative to End Hunger in Africa (IEHA). This project focused on transferring new sorghum technologies linked to the market development for feed processors and intensive poultry producers in four Sahelian countries where these sectors are growing rapidly, particularly in Senegal...|$|R

Some of the collected data were focused on the availability and distribution of famine foods and their role in times of famine. Malnutrition problems, that arise {{as a result of}} drought and famine, and the role of relief organizations, during famine, were examined. During the field investigation, 10 species of famine foods were found to grow in the study area. Chemical analysis of these species was carried out. Uncultivated cereal grains like Dactyloctenium aegytium (Koreeb) and Cenchrus biflorus (Haskaneit) were compared with some of the <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> <b>cereals</b> like Sorghum and Pennisetum darfuricum. The protein percentage of Cenchrus biflorus (Haskaneit) was 15. 41 %; this value was higher than that of Sorghum. The values of crude fiber of all tested plants were higher than those of staple foods. Citrullus lanatus (Bateech seed), showed the highest value of protein content (30. 38 %), but its consumption is limited because of shortage of rain in north Darfur state. The crude protein of Tribulus terrestris (Deriasa), and Cordia sinensis (Andrab), exceeded the protein content of Pennisetum darfuricum (Dukhn) and Sorghum (Dura).

40|$|Both in industrialised {{countries}} as well as is many developing countries, pig and poultry production systems have become very specialised and highly sophisticated. They are extremely efficient at the biological level and demand little labour. In most developing countries, little of the feed required for these agro-industrial production systems is available locally; it must therefore be imported and paid for with scarce reserves of foreign exchange. Furthermore, such systems require high capital investments and generate little employment. In tropical countries there are many locally available feed products which compete only marginally with the production of food crops for human consumption. As a source of carbohydrates, for example, there are the milling residues of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> <b>cereals</b> (rice, sorghum, millet, etc.) or imported ones (notably wheat); residues of roots and fruit (cassava, yams, bananas) as well as grasses. For protein-rich feeds, there are: cotton, groundnut and oil-palm seeds, leguminous plant seeds (e. g; Canavalia); leaves of various crops (e. g. cassava and yams); and trees and brush {{which may or may}} not come from leguminous species such as Leucaena, Gliricidia, Erythrina and Canavalia among others. There are no biological obstacles to basing pig and poultry production in tropical countries entirely on local resources. Furthermore, such a policy of using local resources would substantially increase productivity per unit of each basic resource (for example, light, soil, water and population). What is required is a policy of 'agricultural production systems' designed to optimize agricultural activity in general, and the use of natural resources in particular, rather than simply maximizing the production of specific crops. All of these considerations are examined in a book written by Dr. T. R. Preston and published in English and French by CTA in its series on 'Science and Technology for Development'.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the risk to human health by heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni and Cr) through the intake of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> vegetables, <b>cereal</b> crops and milk from wastewater irrigated site. Milk is not directly contaminated due to wastewater irrigation, but is an important route of food chain transfer of heavy metals from grass to animals. Heavy metal concentrations were several fold higher in all the collected samples from wastewater irrigated site compared to clean water irrigated ones. Cd, Pb and Ni concentrations were above the `safe¿ limits of Indian and WHO/FAO standards in all the vegetables and cereals, but within the permissible limits in milk samples. The higher values of metal pollution index and health risk index indicated heavy metal contamination in the wastewater irrigated site that presented a significant threat of negative impact on human health. Rice and wheat grains contained less heavy metals as compared to the vegetables, but health risk was greater due to higher contribution of cereals in the diet. The study suggests that wastewater irrigation led to accumulation of heavy metals in food stuff causing potential health risks to consumers...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the base line levels of potentially toxic and essential trace metals namely, Cd, Pb, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu and Zn in water, <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> vegetables, <b>cereals</b> and vegetable ghee-oil samples {{of a highly}} industrial city `Gujranwala` have been measured after wet digestion by employing AAS technique. Sampling was made from selected sites {{in and around the}} city over a period of three months. The concentration of Mn, Ni, Zn, Cu and Pb was found significantly higher in vegetables ranging from 3 - 63, 2 - 81, 5 - 92, 7 - 70 and 6 - 60 ppm respectively. Nickel and Cu concentration was found higher in cereals whereas, Cd was found at ppb level in all variety of samples studied. Tap water, vegetable ghee-oil have recorded lower concentration of these metals. Vegetables collected from urban area have shown elevated level of contamination than those of taken from canal irrigated farms. The overall level of trace metals with few exceptions of vegetable samples was found within the permissible limits fixed by WHO. The analytical method was checked by applying on SRM of wheat and spinach. The results were found in agreement with the certified values within experimental error. The major polluting sources of the city such as automobile, man made activities, soil and road dust, metallic corrosion and industrial activities have been indicated.

40|$|The {{potential}} advantages of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> produce are mainly {{related to the}} coexistence of production and consumption in the same area. These advantages are: reduced transportation, freshness, better taste, easy traceability, transparency, food safety, environmental sustainability and community development.

On the other hand, interest is growing for furnishing produce to local produce schools, hospitals and public institutions. The supply chains of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> produce are classified into direct marketing distributions (farmers’ markets, CSAs, roadside stands, on-farm stores) and indirect marketing distributions (restaurants, foodservices, supermarkets).

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the initial {{findings of a}} survey {{of members of the}} Chefs Collaborative organization. The Chefs Collaborative is a national network of more than 1, 000 members of the food community who promote sustainable cuisine by celebrating the joys of local, seasonal and artisanal ingredients. Many of the Chefs Collaborative members have significant expertise in purchasing <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food products. The purpose of this research and the following report is to 1) use the expertise gained by members of the Chefs Collaborative organization in order to help producers market their products to the foodservice industry and 2) to examine the opportunities and obstacles producers may encounter when approaching a restaurant or institution with <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products. The survey was targeted to Chefs Collaborative members who have the greatest buying authority for the foodservice establishment. Ninety-one percent of the foodservice establishments surveyed were independently owned restaurants, while 8 % were chain restaurants. Nearly half (49 %) of the establishments surveyed were upscale full-service restaurants with 75 % of the respondents holding the position of Chef at the establishment. The following conclusions illustrate how producers can use the research findings in this report when marketing their products to restaurants and institutions. 1. Purchasing <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food products can be profitable for foodservice establishments. Seventy-three percent of the foodservice establishments agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “purchasing <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food has a positive impact on my foodservice establishment’s bottom line profits. ” A producer can use this information to show that, based on a survey of a particular group of foodservice establishments, purchasing <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products can be profitable. 2. Chef Collaborative members prefer to purchase direct from a farmer. When given several alternatives from which to purchase products for their establishment, 57 % of the respondents would prefer to purchase direct from a farmer by either receiving direct shipments from the farm or by picking up their products at the farm. 3. Awareness of the attributes that foodservice establishments take into consideration when making food purchases will increase a producer’s likelihood of success. The attributes that foodservice establishments ranked as very to extremely important when making a purchasing decision were a product’s quality, a product’s taste, the knowledge of how a product is raised or grown, a product’s freshness, the ability to guarantee consistent quality, strict adherence to food safety, a thorough knowledge of the producer’s product and its uses, and the ability to deliver the quantity needed by the establishment. Producers must address these attributes when marketing their products to foodservice establishments. 4. The Chefs Collaborative members identified specific reasons for purchasing <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food and the factors that motivate them to continue to purchase from local farmers and ranchers. Producers should use this data when approaching a foodservice establishment to make a sale. Based upon their establishment’s experiences with <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> or produced food products, the Chefs Collaborative members’ reasons for initially purchasing <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products and for continuing to purchase local include: •	<b>Locally</b> <b>grown</b> foods have higher or better quality. •	<b>Locally</b> <b>grown</b> products are fresher. •	Positive relationships have developed with producers. •	Customer requests have been received for <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products, especially after carrying local foods for a period of time. •	The availability of unique or specialty products. 5. Obstacles to purchasing <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food were identified by Chefs Collaborative Members. While {{it is important to be}} aware of the advantages of purchasing <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food in order to help sell local products to foodservice establishments, producers need to be able to anticipate the obstacles that can and will be raised when marketing their products. Again, this group of establishments has a mission or belief that many foodservice establishments do not have. It is very important to take note of the obstacles that they see. A producer should anticipate potential obstacles before his or her first sales call on a restaurant or institution and know how to counter that obstacle. The most significant obstacles identified by the respondents include: A. Distribution and Delivery—getting the right product in the right quantity to the right place at the right time. •	Consistent availability •	Reliable supply •	Availability and knowing what <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products are available in their area •	Complicated ordering •	Too many purveyors (establishments want fewer invoices to pay) B. Competitive Or Pricing Comparable To Other Purveyors Only 11 % mentioned seasonality as an obstacle. One interpretation of this data could be that some of the establishments in the sample are featuring <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> foods only when they are in season by featuring these products on a “seasonal menu”. This promotional technique may influence their customers to frequent the restaurant while these items are “in season”. 6. Chefs Collaborative members have promoted the use of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food. Ninety percent of the foodservice establishments surveyed promote the use of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food on their menu or in their promotional material at one time or another, and 49 % of those who had promoted consider the promotion to be very effective. 7. Foodservice establishments need to be able to easily source and purchase <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products. As indicated above, members of the Chefs Collaborative cited product availability and/or knowing what <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products are available in their area as a product sourcing and purchasing challenge. In fact, four out of the five top ranked obstacles (see section 2. 6) have to do with the ordering and delivery of products. In addition, 38 % stated that they would increase <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> purchases if a greater quantity or variety local products were available and one-third would increase their <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> purchases if a larger variety of local products were available. Consequently, availability and delivery are major issues in increasing the amount of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products purchased by foodservice (and most likely retail) establishments. These establishments also need to be able to easily source the local products available in their area. This awareness will lead to more <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products purchased. The data suggests that there is a real need for a clearinghouse or database of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products to provide simple and easy access for interested foodservice (or retail) personnel. These clearinghouses will also help a restaurant or institution find backup sources for products they are buying when their current purveyor’s supply is limited. Although quantitative information is presented in this report, the data is projectable only to the members of the Chefs Collaborative organization with buying authority and is not projectable to the population as a whole. Producers should use the findings of this report when developing their marketing plan for product introductions and marketing products to foodservice buyers and as a guide to approaching independent restaurants and institutions with their product line. The report begins with the results of an assessment of attributes and how the respondents rank the importance of these attributes when selecting the brands or products they purchase. The report then turns its focus to the foodservice establishment’s experience in purchasing local products, including where and why they have purchased local ingredients, as well as the obstacles they have faced. The report also discusses how the establishments promote the use of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> food. Finally, the report identifies the <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products that have the greatest foodservice market potential...|$|R

We also assess the potential of <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> foods to meet these guidelines, finding that meeting dietary guidelines with a local, seasonal diet would bring economic benefit, in this case, US$ 148 million in income for Vermont farmers.

Results imply that <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> products are valued more than organic food products. Based on the marginal WTPs, our results also suggest that the least valued product would be the non-locally grown conventional almond. Relative to this product, respondents are willing to pay 0. 61 € more for a non-locally grown organic product, 1. 51 € more for a <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> conventional product, and 2. 12 € more for a <b>locally</b> <b>grown</b> organic product...|$|R
