5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was very}} {{difficult}} to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the <b>Leeward</b> Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the <b>Leeward</b> Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Klaus was a North Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that hit}} the <b>Leeward</b> Islands from the west in November of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming from a broad {{area of low pressure}} on November 5, Klaus maintained a northeast movement throughout much of its path. After making landfall on extreme eastern Puerto Rico, it passed {{to the north of the}} <b>Leeward</b> Islands, resulting in strong southwesterly winds and rough seas. Klaus attained hurricane status and reached peak winds of 90mph (145km/h) before becoming extratropical over cooler waters on November 13. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing minor flooding and light damage. Klaus caused heavy marine damage in the <b>Leeward</b> Islands, including wrecking at least three ships. The Virgin Islands experienced heavy damage as well.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the fourth}} named storm and second {{hurricane}} of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Dean formed on July 31 and reached tropical storm status the following day east of the <b>Leeward</b> Islands.

Dean continued northward before making landfall in southeastern Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the <b>leeward</b> or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, <b>leeward</b> side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, Guyana and the <b>Leewards</b> {{faced each}} other, and the <b>Leewards</b> {{became the first}} - and only - team to avoid defeat against the Guyanese in this year's tournament.
