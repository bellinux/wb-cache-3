2500|$|In 2001, {{after her}} mother's suggestion, Scherzinger quit the band {{in order to}} {{audition}} on the WB's television show Popstars, a precursor to modern's string of reality series. With the aim to chronicle the group's formation until the recording of their debut album, Warner Bros. imprint London-Sire Records signed the group to a recording contract before the band was named and had finalized its membership, due to the hours of network television exposure the group would receive. Initially hesitant {{at the idea of}} joining a group, she then opted otherwise as she saw it as an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles. For her audition she sang Whitney Houston's version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] and won a spot along with four other finalists (Ivette Sosa, Maile Misajon, Ana Maria <b>Lombo</b> and Rosanna Tavarez), establishing the girl group Eden's Crush. Their debut single, [...] "Get Over Yourself", was released in March 2001 and debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100; they became the first female act to debut at number one on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. Their debut studio album, Popstars, debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. They went on to tour with 'N Sync and Jessica Simpson, {{but by the end of}} the year their label went bankrupt and disbanded. During this time, will.i.am approached Scherzinger to become a member of the Black Eyed Peas, but she turned it down as her then-boyfriend declined. In December 2002, Scherzinger worked with Yoshiki of Japanese heavy metal band X Japan on his Violet UK project. She sang the English version of [...] "I'll Be Your Love" [...] live with the Tokyo Symphonic Orchestra.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} flume experiments {{were carried out}} to evaluate the passive transport of the adult cockle Cerastoderma edule with shell sizes from 15 to 35 mm. The {{purpose of the study}} was to measure the erosion of this bivalve under controlled laboratory conditions, reproducing the current velocities and the cockle size distribution found at the <b>Lombos</b> do Ulla river mouth in Spain during high river discharges. Increasing velocities (0. 29, 0. 31, 0. 35, 0. 40, 0. 44 and 0. 47 m s– 1) were applied to the bivalves, analysing the influence of population density (500 and 1000 ind. m– 2), activity (live vs dead individuals), and mollusc size and distribution. To assess the effect of bivalve size distribution on the cockle transport, uniform and non-uniform cockle size distributions were tested. The particle image velocimetry technique and the double-averaged methodology were used to determine velocity fields during the experiments. In the experiments cockle erosion rates were found to be directly related to the flow velocity and inversely related to the population density. The erosion behaviour of uniform and graded cockle size distributions showed differences similar to those found in the bedload transport of uniform and non-uniform sediment mixtures. Our results provide a mechanism to explain the observed physical transport of bivalve populations after large storm events...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo, neste trabalho, foi avaliarem-se três formulações de carne de jacaré-do-papo-amarelo (Caiman latirostris) em conserva: em óleo comestível, em salmoura com cebola e em salmoura temperada. Após o abate, foram separados cortes (seis pares de membros, uma cauda, duas costelas e dois <b>lombos)</b> para a fabricação das conservas. Antes do processamento industrial, realizou-se a análise de ácidos graxos da carne in natura através de cromatografia gasosa. Após o processo de enlatamento, procedeu-se o teste de esterilidade {{comercial}} para alimentos de baixa acidez para as conservas elaboradas, para então avaliar a aceitação sensorial das três formulações, utilizando escala hedônica estruturada de nove pontos. Foram avaliadas a aparência e a impressão global. Foram analisados também o teor de cloreto de sódio, o pH e a composição centesimal (umidade, resíduo mineral fixo, proteínas e lipídeos) das conservas. Os ácidos graxos saturados, monoinsaturados e poliinsaturados corresponderam, respectivamente, a 28, 5; 42, 5 e 29, 0 % do total de ácidos graxos da carne in natura. As conservas, com ausência de vazamento ou estufamento no teste de esterilidade, foram liberadas para análise sensorial. Em relação à aparência, observou-se que as três amostras diferiram significativamente entre si, sendo a conserva em cebola a menos aceita, seguida da conserva temperada e em óleo, que foi a mais aceita. Em relação à impressão global, a conserva em óleo também foi a mais aceita. O teor de cloreto de sódio variou de 0, 5 a 1, 2 %, sendo mais elevado nas conservas em salmoura. A carne de jacaré-do-papo-amarelo em conserva apresentou um pH médio de 5, 0, umidade de 76, 0 %, resíduo mineral fixo de 1, 3 %, concentração de proteínas de 12, 4 % e teor de lipídeos totais de 5, 5 %. A conserva em óleo apresentou um teor de lipídeos mais elevado (12, 8 %). De acordo com os resultados, pode-se concluir que a comercialização de carne de jacaré-do-papo-amarelo em conserva é viável, permitindo o melhor aproveitamento da carne após o abate, com aumento do seu valor agregado e uma boa aceitação sensorial do produto. This research {{focused on}} the evaluation of three broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris) canned meat formulas: one in edible oil, another in salt with onions, and the third one in seasoned salt. Some cuts (six pairs of members, one tail, two ribs and two loins) were separated after slaughter to produce the canned meat. Gas chromatographic analysis of the fatty acids in the non-processed meat was conducted before industrial processing. After the canning process, a commercial sterility test for low acidity food was conducted for the canned meat samples. Subsequently, the three formulations were tested for sensory acceptance by a 9 -point hedonic scale {{with respect to their}} appearance and global impression. The sodium chloride content, pH and percent composition (moisture, fixed mineral residue, proteins and lipids contents) of the canned meat samples were determined. The saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids values were, respectively, 28. 5; 42. 5 and 29. 0 % of the total fatty acids in the non-processed meat. The canned meat samples were released after verifying that there were no leaking or blown cans in the sterility test. The three samples were significantly different in respect to appearance. The results showed the following order, from the least to the most acceptable sample: salt with onions, seasoned salt and edible oil. As for the global impression, the formulation in edible oil was also the most acceptable. The sodium chloride content was in the range of 0. 5 to 1. 2 %, where the highest value was found for the samples in salt. The canned meat samples had an average pH of 5. 0, 76. 0 % moisture content and 1. 3 % of fixed mineral residue, a protein concentration of 12. 4 % and a total lipid content of 5. 5 %. The sample in edible oil showed a higher concentration of lipids (12. 8 %). One can conclude from these results {{that it is possible to}} commercialize canned broad-snouted caiman meat, which allows a better use of the meat after the slaughter. There were also an increase in the value added and a good sensory acceptance of the product...|$|R
40|$|A carne ovina Ã um produto altamente rico em proteÃnas, com baixo teor de gordura e muito valorizado no mercado internacional. PorÃm, vÃrios fatores responsÃveis pela caracterizaÃÃo da qualidade da carne contribuem para a baixa popularidade desse produto no paÃs, tais como operaÃÃes de prÃ e pÃs-abate mal realizadas, abate de animais velhos, manejo inadequado, tÃcnicas precÃrias de manuseio pÃs-abate, entre outros. Dessa forma, a pesquisa teve por objetivo avaliar a qualidade funcional e sensorial da carne ovina produzida e comercializada no Estado do CearÃ a fim de detectar e melhorar as condiÃÃes que afetam a qualidade das carnes. No experimento, utilizou-se 6 animais provenientes de cinco procedÃncias do Estado do CearÃ (P 1 - TauÃ, P 2 - Sobral, P 3 - QuixadÃ, P 4 - Caridade e P 5 - criatÃrio {{experimental}} da UFC), totalizando 30 cordeiros que variaram de seis meses a 1 ano de idade. ApÃs o abate, as carcaÃas permaneceram durante 24 horas em cÃmara fria a 0 ÂC. Em seguida, foram divididas longitudinalmente em duas meia-carcaÃas. De cada animal, utilizaram-se os cortes paleta e perna da meia-carcaÃa direita e os dois <b>lombos.</b> As peÃas foram dessossadas e retiradas porÃÃes dos mÃsculos para cada anÃlise. As peÃas musculares foram embaladas em filmes de nylon-polietileno, seladas a vÃcuo e mantidas em congelamento atÃ a realizaÃÃo das anÃlises de pH, capacidade de retenÃÃo de Ãgua (CRA), perdas de peso por cocÃÃo (PPC), forÃa de cisalhamento (FC), cor medido pelos parÃmetros L*, a*, b*, H* e C*, composiÃÃo centesimal e anÃlise sensorial dos atributos de cor, sabor, maciez, suculÃncia e aceitaÃÃo global. Os valores de pH obtidos nas diferentes procedÃncias apresentaram diferenÃa significativa, sendo que a carne da procedÃncia P 3 apresentou maior pH. Com relaÃÃo as propriedades CRA e PPC, houve significÃncia estatÃstica devida tanto aos cortes como Ãs procedÃncias estudadas, sendo que a procedÃncia P 5 se destacou com maiores valores para as duas variÃveis. A FC nÃo apresentou significÃncia estatÃstica para as diferentes procedÃncias. No entanto, para as variÃveis da anÃlise de cor, a procedÃncia P 5 apresentou valores de L*, a*, b*, H* e C* significativamente maiores que as demais procedÃncias. Com relaÃÃo Ã composiÃÃo centesimal, apenas o conteÃdo de cinzas na carne nÃo apresentou diferenÃas significativas entre as procedÃncias. Quanto Ã aceitaÃÃo sensorial, as procedÃncias P 5 e P 4 se destacaram em todos os atributos analisados (cor, sabor, maciez, suculÃncia e aceitaÃÃo global), ou seja, a criaÃÃo de ovinos em confinamento pode influenciar a aceitaÃÃo do produto pelos consumidores, uma vez que esse tipo de sistema gera animais em melhores condiÃÃes no momento do abate, o que determina a qualidade final da carne. Quanto Ã atitude de consumo, a procedÃncia P 5 apresentou maior aceitaÃÃo e menor rejeiÃÃo, indicando essa como a mais aceita entre os provadores. Lamb meat {{is rich in}} protein, low in {{fat content}} and highly valued in the international market. However, several factors responsible for the characterization of the meat quality contribute to a low popularity of this product in the local market. Among them the slaughter operations performed poorly, inadequate management of the animals and poor techniques of post-slaughter handling. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the functional and sensory quality of lamb produced and marketed in the State of CearÃ to detect conditions that {{affect the quality of}} the meat. In this experiment, six animals from five different locations of the State of CearÃ (P 1 - Taua, P 2 - Sobral, P 3 - QuixadÃ, P 4 - Caridade and P 5 - UFC) were used, totaling 30 lambs ranging from six months to one year of age. After slaughter, carcasses remained for 24 hours in cold storage at 0 ÂC. They were then divided longitudinally into two half-carcasses. From each animal, were used the shoulder and the leg cuts from the right half carcass and the loins from the two half carcasses. The pieces were removed, bonned and the muscles separated for analysis. The muscle pieces were packed in nylon-polyethylene film, vacuum sealed and kept frozen until the realization of the following meat analysis: pH, water holding capacity (WHC), cooking loss (CL), shear force (SF), color, chemical composition and sensory analysis of color, flavor, tenderness, juiciness and overall acceptance. The meat pH values obtained from different locations showed significant differences, with P 3 showing higher values than the other meats. Regarding the CRA and PPC analysis, statistical significance was observed for both the type of cut and the location of the animals where P 5 showed the highest values for both variables. SF values were not different for the different locations of the animals. However, for the variables of color analysis, the results for P 5 showed values for L*, a*, b*, H* and C* significantly higher than those for the other locations. With respect to meat composition, only the ashes were not significantly different among the locations. As for the meat sensory the animals from P 5 and P 4 performed better than those from the other locations in all the attributes evaluated (color, flavor, tenderness, juiciness and overall acceptance). Raising sheep in confinement may influence product acceptance by consumers, since this type of system produces animals with appropriate condition at slaughter, which influences the final quality of the meat. The attitude of the consumers related to the meat from P 5 showed greater acceptance and less rejection of the meat...|$|R
