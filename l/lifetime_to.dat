5|$|King Stephen {{refused to}} accept William's {{deposition}} and the appointment of Murdac, and prevented Murdac from taking up residence in York. Stephen probably wished to trade recognition of Murdac for support for his son Eustace. Stephen was trying to secure the coronation of Eustace as his successor during his own <b>lifetime,</b> <b>to</b> defeat the rival claims to the throne of Henry of Anjou. Within a few years, however, both Murdac and the pope had died, so William travelled to Rome to plead with the new pope, Anastasius IV, for restoration to office. The pope concurred, and William's reappointment was confirmed on 20 December 1153. On his return to York, while crossing the Ouse Bridge in York in triumphal procession, the bridge collapsed, yet no one was killed.|$|E

5|$|Laurence (died 2 February 619) was {{the second}} Archbishop of Canterbury from about 604 to 619. He {{was a member of}} the Gregorian mission sent from Italy to England to Christianise the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism, {{although}} the date of his arrival is disputed. He was consecrated archbishop by his predecessor, Augustine of Canterbury, during Augustine's <b>lifetime,</b> <b>to</b> ensure continuity in the office. While archbishop, he attempted unsuccessfully to resolve differences with the native British bishops by corresponding with them about points of dispute. Laurence faced a crisis following the death of King Æthelberht of Kent, when the king's successor abandoned Christianity; he eventually reconverted. Laurence was revered as a saint after his death in 619.|$|E
5|$|Sun Tzu's historicity is uncertain. Sima Qian {{and other}} {{traditional}} historians placed {{him as a}} minister to King Helü of Wu and dated his <b>lifetime</b> <b>to</b> 544–496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity nonetheless place the existing text of The Art of War in the later Warring States period based upon its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare. Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant Sun Bin also wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled The Art of War. Since both Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972.|$|E

25|$|Most later Marxists {{agreed with}} this view, but some – {{particularly}} those in the early Soviet Union – believed that evolutionary theory conflicted with their economic and social ideals.
