40|$|An edited {{version of}} {{astronaut}} Bonnie J. Dunbar's Plenary Address at the 1990 MRS Fall Meeting is presented. The Shuttle program is briefly reviewed {{with emphasis on}} the microgravity environment experiments conducted aboard the Columbia in January 1991. In particular, protein crystal growth experiments resulted in growing morphologically uniform crystals with sizes in the 400 - 500 micron range are discussed. The <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> intended to {{study the effects of}} atomic oxygen and the ultraviolet light environment in low earth orbit on materials has been successfully retrieved. Some research areas of future flights are noted...|$|E
50|$|Engineers {{originally}} intended {{that the first}} mission would last about one year, and that several <b>long-duration</b> <b>exposure</b> missions would use the same frame. The <b>exposure</b> <b>facility</b> was actually used for a single 5.7-year mission.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment is to assess the effects of long-term exposure of candidate balloon films, tapes, and lines to the hostile environment above the Earth's atmosphere. Degradation of mechanical and radiometric properties will be observed {{by a series of}} tests on exposed materials. The experiment is passive and will test candidate balloon films, tapes, and lines. The experiment will occupy one-third of a 3 -in. -deep peripheral tray. Two additional identical sets of material will be prepared. The first set will be tested immediately and the second will be held in a controlled environment until the recovery of the samples placed on orbit. Tests will then be performed on this second set to determine any effects of aging. The specimens that are recovered from the Long Duration <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> will also be tested and the effects of <b>long-duration</b> <b>exposure</b> noted. In addition to these specimens, another set of specimens will be exposed at an accelerated <b>exposure</b> <b>facility</b> and the results will be compared with those of specimens exposed in situ...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was exposed to}} the space environment for 6 years on the Long Duration <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> (LDEF). It investigated quantitatively {{the effects of the}} <b>long-duration</b> space <b>exposure</b> on the relevant performance parameters of a representative set of electron-optic system components, including lasers, radiation detectors, filters, modulators, windows, and other related components. It evaluated the results and implications of the measurements indicating real or suspected degradation mechanisms. This information will be used to establish guidelines for the selection and use of components for space-based, electro-optic systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{reusable}} <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> (LDEF), {{which can}} accommodate experiments requiring large exposure surface areas, large volumes and/or massive hardware, offers to researchers a new inexpensive opportunity to conduct extended technology and basic research {{testing in the}} space environment. Many researchers with interest varying from medical research to astrophysics research will have their experiments performed in the 80 large experiment trays on the first LDEF flight. This paper describes the LDEF {{and a number of}} experiments now being developed for the first mission. In particular, this paper illustrates the value of the LDEF features which allow the return of the experiment hardware and repeated flights...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of materials exposed in space in LEO for nearly {{six years in}} the NASA <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> is presented. It is demonstrated that {{it will be necessary to}} isolate surface debris and reaction products from materials exposed in space. Replication techniques originally designed for electron microscopy examination of surfaces can be applied to lift off and isolate such surface features. Debris and reaction products were examined through a variety of analytical techniques, including the surface morphology by SEM, and internal microstructures by STEM and TEM, EDS, and SAD. The results illustrate the role that atomic oxygen and micrometeorites play in surface alteration and reaction in LEO space environments, as well as the role of debris created from other proximate materials...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{transmittance}} {{characteristics of}} nine optical filters were remeasured after nearly {{six years in}} space aboard the NASA <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility.</b> Three different filter types were included. In general, transmittance decreased for most filters. The center frequency and bandpass of a narrow-band filter under an aluminum cover were unchanged, while narrow-band filters exposed directly to the space environment tended to show a shift in center frequency and increased bandwidth. A pair of infrared-reflecting mirrors exhibited reduced transmittance in the visible, with a mirror under an aluminum cover less degraded than a mirror exposed to space. The bandpass was unchanged for both of these mirrors. Neutral density filters showed {{a slight increase in}} transmittance for an uncovered filter; essentially no change for the filter under the aluminum cover...|$|E
30|$|The {{safety of}} Conducted energy weapons is under debate [1]. The patient's {{condition}} and the delivered energy are ones of the affecting factors to the safety [2]. Repeated or <b>long-duration</b> <b>exposure</b> related to the delivered energy can lead to cardiac arrest, apnea, hypotension or academia [3].|$|R
50|$|In manual mode, the XG-M {{would use}} that LED to display its {{recommended}} shutter speed. However, {{to select a}} shutter speed, the camera {{had to be removed}} from the eye; the speed selected was not shown in the viewfinder. Speeds between 1 second and 1/1000 second could be chosen, and there was a BULB mode for <b>long-duration</b> <b>exposures.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is unknown}} whether <b>long-duration</b> <b>exposure</b> to {{microgravity}} itself may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. Based on observations and clinical judgement, medical operations personnel {{have suggested that}} some of these incidents have been related to pre-existing, undiagnosed coronary artery disease. Additional pre-selection crew screening tests, including calcium scoring, have been added to reduce such occurrences in the future.|$|R
40|$|The NASA <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> (LDEF), {{designed}} for the in situ testing of optical instrumentation in the space environment is described. The LDEF is basically a reusable structure which is three-axis gravity-gradient stabilized when flying free in space. The structure weighs about 8, 000 lbs. and accommodates experiment trays weighing about 10, 000 lbs. A vacuum exposure control canister is being {{designed for}} controlled exposure experiments. The LDEF will have an experiment power and data system and a shuttle bay environmental measurements system is being designed for measuring parameters such as acoustics, vibration, acceleration. The induced environment contamination monitor will evaluate the contamination levels of shuttle payloads. Experiments currently under development include the evaluation of active optical components {{and the study of}} fiber optic data transmission...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{low earth orbit}} on the <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> (LDEF) {{spacecraft}} are reported. The LDEF spacecraft was deployed in low earth orbit in 1984 and was retrieved in 1990. The structure and design of LDEF is described. The dose of ionizing radiation received, data obtained, {{and its effects on}} the satellite are discussed. Atomic oxygen surface effects, oxygen induced damage, and damage from meteoroids and man-made debris are examined and an analysis of meteoroid impacts is presented. The effects of molecular and particulate contamination of the spacecraft's surface and instrument damage were analyzed. Post-flight analysis of LDEF's framework and experiments provided much information about the space environment and its effects on spacecraft materials and will be useful in the design of long-lived large space structures...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has been}} conducted on about 100 different material/process combinations, {{most of which were}} candidates for use in solar arrays having high power-to-weight ratios. These substances were exposed to the LEO environment during <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> Experiment A 0171 in order to evaluate the synergistic effects of the LEO environment on the materials' mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. Materials evaluated include solar cells, cover slips having antireflectance coatings, adhesives, encapsulants, reflective materials, mast and harness materials, structural composites, and thermal control thin films. About one-sixth of the experiment tray was devoted to composite-material tensile specimens, which were specifically to be studied for changes in their mechanical properties. Preliminary results of the surface-damage evaluation are presented. These surface effects are dominated by atomic-oxygen erosion and micrometeoroid/space debris impacts...|$|E

40|$|A {{micrographic}} {{investigation is}} reported of {{samples of the}} fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) Teflon thermal-blanketing materials recovered from the <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> (LDEF) satellite. The samples are taken from the trailing edge and row 8 which correspond to exposures to vacuum UV (VUV) and VUV + atomic O, respectively. Data are taken from SEM and IR-spectra observations, and the LDEF leading-edge FEP shows {{a high degree of}} erosion, roughening, and sharp peaks angled {{in the direction of the}} flow of atomic O. The trailing edge sample influenced primarily by VUV shows a hard brittle layer and some cracked mosaic patterns. Comparisons to a reference sample suggest that the brittle layer is related to exposure to VUV and is removed by atomic-O impingement. Polymers that are stable to VUV radiation appear to be more stable in terms of atomic oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Work {{performed}} by the University of Alabama in Huntsville's (UAH) Center for Applied Optics (CAO) entitled Atomic Research is documented. Atomic oxygen (AO) effects on materials have long been a critical concern in designing spacecraft to withstand exposure to the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment. The objective of this research effort was to provide technical expertise {{in the design of}} instrumentation and experimental techniques for analyzing materials exposed to atomic oxygen in accelerated testing at NASA/MSFC. Such testing was required to answer fundamental questions concerning Space Station Freedom (SSF) candidate materials and materials exposed to atomic oxygen aboard the <b>Long-Duration</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Facility</b> (LDEF). The primary UAH task was to provide technical design, review, and analysis to MSFC {{in the development of a}} state-of-the-art 5 eV atomic oxygen beam facility required to simulate the RAM-induced low earth orbit (LEO) AO environment. This development was to be accomplished primarily at NASA/MSFC. In support of this task, contamination effects and ultraviolet (UV) simulation testing was also to be carried out using NASA/MSFC facilities. Any materials analysis of LDEF samples was to be accomplished at UAH...|$|E
