5|$|Along {{with the}} arcade, the other main draw for the centers since the {{beginning}} was its animatronic show, until the mid-1990s. More recently, <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> {{has been placed on}} animatronics. However, there are now several different styles of animatronic shows in use within the company, depending on when the location opened, whether it was renovated, and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's speech {{received}} much <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> than his (now famous) remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten {{by the news}} media. Regardless, several of his aides considered it to be among his finest orations. Journalist Jack Newfield was {{of the opinion that}} the address was a suitable epitaph for the senator, who was himself assassinated two months later.|$|E
5|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is one of}} key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> was given to environmental projects, {{and the absence of}} law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.|$|E

5|$|As of 2006, the IFNA {{recognises}} only women's netball. Men's netball teams {{exist in}} some areas but attract <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> from sponsors and spectators. Men's netball started to become popular in Australia during the 1980s, and the first men's championship was held in 1985. In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams {{to compete in the}} Australian Mixed and Men's National Championships. By 2006, mixed netball teams in Australia had as many male participants as rugby union. Other countries with men's national teams include Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Kenya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike women's netball at elite and national levels, men's and mixed gendered teams are largely self-funded.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received <b>less</b> <b>attention.</b> Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in {{the running of the}} newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E
5|$|Simon & Schuster {{released}} The Firebrand on October 1, 1987 in hardcover, and it {{was issued}} in paperback in September 1988. The Firebrand has been overshadowed by the popularity of The Mists of Avalon, receiving <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> and critical praise. Reviews of the book ranged from mixed to positive, with many literary critics praising Bradley's ability to give new characterizations to legendary figures. It has been translated into at least twelve languages, beginning with Portuguese and French in 1989.|$|E
50|$|A step beyond {{mechanization}} is automation. Early production machinery, such as {{the glass}} bottle blowing machine (ca. 1890s), required a lot of operator involvement. By the 1920s fully automatic machines, which required much <b>less</b> operator <b>attention,</b> were being used.|$|R

5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{appointment}} as temporary abbot, {{he was appointed}} fully as abbot of Wat Paknam, where he remained {{until his death in}} 1959. For his life and work he was given monastic and royal honorific names, that is Phrakhru Samanadham-samathan (in 1921), Phrabhavanakosolthera , Phramongkolratmuni , and finally Phramongkolthepmuni (in 1957). The last three royal titles were given late, {{due to the fact that}} the temple was not under royal patronage, and therefore received <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> from the royal family than other temples.|$|E
5|$|Though Lancashire was a {{football}} stronghold {{in the early}} years of the professional game, providing a large proportion of Football League teams, the cup final had never been contested between two Lancashire clubs until the 1904 final. 30,000 supporters from the region travelled to London, sparking press reports of records for North-South rail travel. Lacking alternative accommodation, several thousand slept on the platforms at Euston and St Pancras. A jovial atmosphere built up, with the Manchester Industrial Boys Band playing Hiawatha. However, in London itself, the match received <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> than a final featuring a southern team would have done. Tickets in an uncovered stand cost 5s.|$|E
5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> was paid to the lunettes.|$|E

5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Disney {{produced}} Cinderella, his studio's first animated {{feature in}} eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2million to produce, it earned nearly $8million {{in its first}} year. Disney was less involved {{than he had been}} with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.|$|E
5|$|The {{books were}} {{relatively}} expensive to print, {{because of the}} Corbould and Finden illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, {{and the use of}} Spottiswoode's printing house. In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins. An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835. As {{it became clear that the}} series was not going to take off, fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller. Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> to its business dealings. However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in print until 1890.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese {{continued}} {{to settle in}} San Diego and found work in the fishing industry, railroad construction, service industry, general construction work, food industry, and merchandising.

5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> to social stimuli, smile {{and look at}} others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
