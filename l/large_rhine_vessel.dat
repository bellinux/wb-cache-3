40|$|The {{suitability}} of the MoorMasterTM system by Cavotec MSL in inland shipping is researched. It is an innovative mooring system using vacuum pads with active motion control, utilising a PID controller. A {{case study of}} a 110 m <b>Large</b> <b>Rhine</b> <b>vessel</b> moored directly beside the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal (ARK) is performed. In order for the system to be suitable, the ship motions have to remain within certain mooring criteria, while passing vessels {{should not have to}} reduce speed. The forces on the moored vessel caused by the passing vessels are simulated using ROPES, a numerical method based on a 3 D flow model, using the panel method. Three different passing vessels at three different passing distances are simulated. All passing vessels are simulated to sail at the maximum allowed speed in the ARK. Next, the manoeuvring model is used to set up the equations of motion of the moored vessel. The external force consists of the forces calculated in the Ropes simulations and the modelled forces of the MoorMasterTM units. Solving these equations results in the ship motions.

50|$|A naviduct is {{a special}} class of navigable aqueduct, in which the {{waterway}} also includes a lock. One example of a naviduct has been built at Enkhuizen on the Houtribdijk in the Netherlands on the instructions of the Rijkswaterstaat. This cost over €55 million and was completed in 2003. It {{is big enough to}} simultaneously transfer two <b>large</b> <b>Rhine</b> river-barges from the Markermeer to the IJsselmeer or vice versa. The structure was chosen because a busy waterway crosses a dike carrying a busy road, but the space available for separate aqueduct and lock facilities was restricted.|$|R

40|$|To enable {{efficient}} management of inland navigation processes,specialized information systems should be developedthrough {{the application of}} modern information and communicationtechnology (ICT). For this purpose, individual Europeanwaterway and port authorities have developed their ownlocal information systems and databases. Due to the non-conformityof these databases, their integration at the Europeanlevel is confronted with selious problems (COMPRIS, 2003). One of the major problems {{is the lack of}} a common Europeanunique identification number for inland barges. For this reason,in some locally managed databases several different identificationnumbers are attributed to one and the same inlandbarge or certain identification numbers are not available. Thesame problem occurs in the communication between waterwayautholities and between waterway and port authorities. Therefore,a unique identification number for all floating objects onthe European waterways should be introduced. At the momentthere are only two official numbers for vessels. The first, the!MO number, introduced in 1978, is only used by maritimevessels. The second, the OFS number (Official Ship Number),is used only for vessels that have a Rhine patent (issued by theCCNR). The OFS number cannot satisfy all the requirementsof RIS Directive 2005 / 44 /EC and the amendment to Directive 82 / 714 /EEC on technical requirements for inland navigationvessels in the enlarged European Union. The fact is that only 20 % of the ranges of codes are reserved for the non-Rhinecountries. A special Electronic Reporting International group(ER!) was appointed to formulate a new system for uniqueidentification of inland vessels and also define a databasemodel for vessel characteristics. The initial suggestion of ERIwas to add one character in front of the OFS number in orderto increase its coding capacity. The intention was to make asfew as possible differences/modifications to the system currentlyused under the regime of the <b>Rhine</b> <b>Vessel</b> InspectionRegulations in order to minimize the administrative efforts ofharmonization. As members of the ER! group, we made a proposalfor such a new identification number (the so calledERN), which was discussed by the ERI expert group takinginto account the input from the Joint Working Group ofCCNR and EC. In this paper, we will desclibe our proposal toER!, which was later slightly modified within a special ER! expertgroup...|$|R

40|$|Low-frequency oceanic motions have banded {{structures}} termed “striations. ” Since these striations {{embedded in}} large-scale gyre flows can have large amplitudes, the authors investigated {{the effect of}} mean flow on their directions {{as well as their}} contribution to energetics and mixing using a β-plane, barotropic, quasigeostrophic ocean model. In spite of the model simplicity, striations are always found to exist regardless of the imposed barotropic mean flow. However, their properties are sensitive to the mean flow. Rhines jets move with the mean flow and are not necessarily striations. If the meridional component of the mean flow is <b>large,</b> <b>Rhines</b> jets become high-frequency motions; low-frequency striations still exist, but they are nonzonal, have small magnitudes, and contribute little to energetics and mixing. Otherwise, striations are zonal, dominated by Rhines jets, and contribute significantly to energetics and mixing. This study extends the theory of β-plane, barotropic turbulence, driven by white noise forcing at small scales, to include the effect of a constant mean flow. Theories developed in this study, based upon the Galilean invariance property, illustrate that the barotropic mean flow has no effect on total mixing rates, but does affect the energy cascades in the frequency domain. Diagnostic frameworks developed here can be useful to quantify the striations’ contribution to energetics and mixing in the ocean and more realistic models. A novel diagnostic formula is applied to estimating eddy diffusivities. United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Grant NNX 09 AI 87 G) United States.

40|$|The Netherlands are a small, low-lying delta in W. Europe (42 000 km 2; 50 degrees- 54 degrees N; 3 degrees- 8 degrees E), mainly {{consisting}} of alluvial deposits from the North Sea {{and from the}} <b>large</b> rivers <b>Rhine</b> and Meuse. The country was 'created by man'. The conversion of natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems into drained agricultural land was a major cultural operation over the past 1000 years. Roughly 55 % of the country's surface area is still agricultural land. Some decades ago, The Netherlands' landscape was characterised by an armoured coastline and bridled estuaries, a drastically reduced area of saline and freshwater marshes, fully regulated rivers and streams, and numerous artificial lakes. The aquatic ecosystems beyond {{the influence of the}} large rivers, the Pleistocene raised bogs and moor lands, have almost been completely annihilated in the past. Acidification and eutrophication led to the deterioration of the remaining softwater lake vegetation. Last but not least, an artificial drainage system was constructed, leading to an unnatural water table all over the country, high in summer, low in winter. Only very recently, some 25 years ago, the tide has been turned and ecological rehabilitation and restoration of disturbed ecosystems are in full swing now, enhanced by the European Union policy to set aside agricultural land in the Netherlands in favour of the development of 'nature'. The state of the art of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecological restoration projects in the Netherlands is given. Starting from the conceptual basis of restoration ecology, the successes and failures of hundreds of restoration projects are given. Numerous successful projects are mentioned. In general, ecological restoration endeavours are greatly benefiting from progressive experience {{in the course of the}} years. Failures mainly occur by insufficient application of physical, chemical or ecological principles. The spontaneous colonisation by plants and animals, following habitat reconstruction, is preferred. But sometimes the re-introduction of keystone species (e. g. eelgrass; salmon; beaver) is necessary in case the potential habitats are isolated or fragmented, or when a seed bank is lacking, thus not allowing viable populations to develop. Re-introduction of traditional management techniques (e. g. mowing without fertilisation; low intensity grazing) is important to rehabilitate the semi-natural and cultural landscapes, so characteristic for the Netherlands. For aquatic ecosystems proper (estuaries, rivers, streams, larger lakes) the rule of thumb is that re-establishment of the abiotic habitat conditions is a pre-requisite for the return of the target species. This implies rehabilitation of former hydrological end geomorphological conditions, and an increase in spatial heterogeneity. The 'bottom-up' technique of lake restoration, viz. reduction in nutrient loadings, and removal of nutrient-rich organic sediment, is the preferred strategy. The 'top-down' approach of curing eutrophicated ecosystems, that is drastic reduction of fish stock, mainly bream, and introduction of carnivorous fish, may be considered as complementary. For semi-aquatic ecosystems (river-fed and rain-fed peat moors, brook valleys, coastal dune slacks) it also counts that the abiotic constraints should be lifted, but here the species-oriented conservation strategy, the enhancement of the recovery of characteristic plant and animal species, is mainly followed. An important pre-requisite for the rehabilitation of the original natural or semi-natural vegetation is the presence of viable seed bank. Restoration of salt-marsh vegetation has to deal with a short-lived persistent seed bank, which means that transport of seeds by water currents is important. Isolated softwater ecosystems may rely on the long-lived seeds of the aquatic macrophytes. The paper ends with some notes on the predictability of the outcome of ecological restoration measures and the societal position of restoration ecology as a science. Scientists hold different views on the predictability of restoration measures. A fact is that the predictability of ecosystem development increases, with increasing knowledge of the underlying environmental processes...|$|R
40|$|Atlas of the Dutch water mites (Acari: Hydrachnidia) Few biogeographic {{studies have}} been {{published}} on water mites. Only Lundblad (1962) has published an atlas of the Swedish water mites. So far, there are no complete publications {{on the distribution of}} Dutch water mites. Acarologists who worked on Dutch water mites, i. e. A. C. Oudemans (1858 - 1943), G. Romijn (1868 - 1930) and A. J. Besseling (1898 - 1968) have collected in a limited geographical area only. Besseling, therefore, classified most of the water mites as rare or very rare. Davids (1979) adapted this to the knowledge of that time. Since this last publication, many new data have been collected in The Netherlands, including biotopes which had hardly been investigated. This resulted in publications on the coastal dunes (Smit & Van der Hammen 1992), quagfens (Smit & Van der Hammen 1996) and springs and streams (Van der Hammen & Smit 1996). We also tried to collect hyporheic water mites, however, without results so far. Many data have been collected by the regional water authority boards, for which we identified and checked many specimens. The result of our work is a number of new species for the Dutch fauna and some taxonomical changes (Smit & Van der Hammen 1990 b, 1992 c, Smit & Duursema 1993, Smit et al. 1993 a, Van Maanen et al. 1997). Furthermore, three new species for science could be described (Smit & Van der Hammen 1992 b, Smit 1996 a). The database contains some 4900 localities, with 60. 000 records. We used a 5 x 5 km-grid to show the distribution of the species. In The Netherlands 1666 of these so called hour-squares can be found with fresh - brackish water, of which 1120 have one or more records of water mites. We stored our data in the program Ecolims, including data on watertype and co-ordinates of the Dutch Topographical Survey. We have gained an almost complete coverage. Only some brackish areas, the <b>large</b> rivers (<b>Rhine,</b> Meuse) and the lake IJsselmeer have limited or no data. However, most of these areas are poor in water mite species. We did not include many old data. Usually, these data do not contribute much to our knowledge, as the earlier acarologists usually collected close to their homes. Furthermore, these old localities are difficult to locate. Only for rare species, occurring in less than 10 5 x 5 kmsquares, we have added old data from the notebooks of Besseling (deposited in the Zoological Museum in Amsterdam). Included in these notebooks are the data of Romijn. Furthermore, data from C. Davids have been used. Our recent data show a bimodal distribution over the year (figure 3), as we sampled twice a year, in spring and in summer. We give a revised list of the Dutch water mites on p. 6 - 13. Previous reviews have been published by Besseling (1964), Van der Eijck (1977), Davids (1979, 1980) and Mol (1984). We re-identified a number of species from the collection of Besseling. We followed the classification of Viets (1987), except for Hydrachna and Piona, where no subgeneric classification is given. For the subgeneric classification of Unionicola we followed Vidrine (1986) and Harvey (1998). On the family level one change has been made: the Wettininae have been raised to family level (Harvey 1998). The genus Hydrochoreutes has been placed in its own subfamily, the Hydrochoreutinae (Smith & Cook 1991). The number of species known from The Netherlands in earlier publications was 188 (Besseling 1964) and 213 (Davids 1979), respectively. The Dutch list now contains 51 genera, with 234 species and including six subspeies not belonging to the nominate form. Five species and one subspecies new for the Dutch fauna are given: Piersigia limophila, Torrenticola anomala, Piona disparilis, Piona conglobata coacta, Forelia spatulifera and Arrenurus sculptus. On the other hand, four species have been omitted: Oxus oblongus, Piona annulata, Forelia koenikei and Arrenurus pugionifer. The description of the species includes the following topics. Nomenclature: For each species a complete list of synonyms used in Dutch publications is given, as well as all publications in which records of the species in The Netherlands have been published. Not included in this bibliography is the so-called ‘grey’ literature, e. g. unpublished reports. Occurrence and distribution: For each species its occurrence is given, using the following division: very rare species occurs in 10 or less 5 x 5 km-squares rare species occurs in 11 - 29 squares rather rare species occurs in 30 - 100 squares rather common species occurs in 101 - 250 squares common species occurs in 251 - 500 squares very common species occurs in more than 500 squares The seasonal periodicity is given for species which show a preference for either spring or (late) summer/ autumn. Only old records of species which occur in less than ten squares or species which have not been found recently, have been included on the maps. To distinguish these records from recent observations a division is made between data before and since 1970. This is a convenient year because the recent extensive research on the distribution of Dutch watermites started in 1978 - 1979. All data of environmental parameters are from the provinces Noord- and Zuid-Holland only. In these provinces, situated in the Holocene part of the country, fringe zones occur from Pleistocene to Holocene and from coastal dunes to the low lying ‘polders’. Furthermore, very brackish parts can be found, as well as clay and peat soils. Therefore, the data given in this paper are not suitable for species which have their optimum in acid waters or in streams. Summary: Each species account is concluded with a short summary in English. The diversity of the water mite fauna is highest in the seepage region between the Holocene and Pleistocene parts of The Netherlands. The reasons are probably the better water quality, the low chloride content and the relatively high habitat diversity caused by peat digging activities in earlier centuries. In parts of The Netherlands with only lentic waters, chloride and nutrient levels are the main factors that determine the species richness of the water mite fauna. For example, in ditches with a bad water quality the maximum number of species is 10; when the quality is optimal, more than 20 species are possible. Since the beginning of the 20 th century the diversity of the water mite fauna in lotic waters has deteriorated strongly. Of the rheophilic species 40 % has disappeared and nowadays 80 % is rare or very rare. The main reasons are canalization and eutrophication. In The Netherlands, the surface waters are classified in different types, mainly based on morphology and lentic-lotic divisions. Distinguished are: springs, brooks, rivers, fens, marshes, cattle pools, larger pools, ditches, small canals, large canals, lakes, dune waters and city waters. The water mite fauna of each of them has been calculated and compared with each other. Only species present in more than 10 % of the number of localities belonging to a special water type is given (table 84) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study factors {{affecting}} the filtration activity and grazing effects of the freshwater bivalves Corbicula fluminea and Dreissena polymorpha were investigated. This was done {{with a combination of}} laboratory and field related experimental approaches. Both bivalves represent keystone species, who can have a large impact on planktonic community composition and the flux of matter in ecosystems. Additionally the whole seasonal population dynamics of C. fluminea were investigated to provide a basis for future predictions and modelling approaches. The first part of the present work concentrated on the impact of warming on the grazing rates of C. fluminea and D. polymorpha and their natural prey organisms such as heterotrophic flagellates. Therefore filtration experiments were performed in circulating flow channels to provide a natural current by using untreated water from a <b>large</b> river (River <b>Rhine,</b> NRW, Germany). It was shown that the increase of the prey´s growth rates was much stronger than that of the predator´s grazing rates when temperatures were increased from 19 °C to over 25 °C. When performing the same experiments using a benthic microbial predator community (biofilms dominated by suspension-feeding ciliates), an increase of the grazing rates relative to the growth rates with temperature could be observed. The data shows, that a predator-prey interaction between the macrofauna (Bivalves) and their unicellular prey community can change significantly under the impact of increasing temperature when consumpiton and growth rates develop differentially. This can lead to netto-decrase of the prey abundance. The data suggests that the predator-prey interaction which is balanced at moderate temperatures can become unbalanced with increasing temperature. In the second part of this work the role of Dreissena polymorpha in mediating effects of high summer temperatures on the dominant components of natural river plankton was investigated. It was shown that both heterotrophic flagellates and algae increase in abundance at temperatures above 20 °C because of decreasing grazing activity of D. polymorpha at such temperatures. Bacteria, as the main prey of the heterotrophic flagellates, decreased in abundance with increasing temperature, suggesting a trophic cascade (mussel - flagellates - bacteria) that is altered by the temperature response of the mussel ingestion. The data thus demonstrates that microbial communities controlled by a macrofaunal component can experience substantial changes at high summer temperatures because of differential development of direct and indirect grazing effects with temperature. In the third part of the present work, seasonal and interannual variability of C. flumineas grazing activity was investigated. Strong seasonal variations, such as a 50 -fold increase from February to July, were observed. These variations were only poorly linked to temperature, as they could be found at both the ambient field temperature and a constant temperature of 15 °C. It was shown that highest grazing activity was found at periods of highest reproduction activity. Additionally it was shown that the grazing activity was very low from March to August 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 after the bivalves experienced a period of two weeks with low winter temperatures close to the lethal temperature of 2 °C. Such low temperatures lead to reduced reproduction rates as shown in previous studies. It was demonstrated that other factors besides temperature probably associated to life-history can have a large impact on the grazing activity of bivalves. The last part of this study concentrated on the shell growth of C. fluminea. The shell growth of more than 50 individuals was observed over a period of more than one year. It was confirmed, that shell growth decreases with increasing shell size. The data was used to generate growth curves {{over a period of several}} years with the help of a von Bertalanffy growth model. Additionally the model was used to estimate the age at a given length, the maximum age (7. 3 years) and the maximum shell length of C. fluminea in the River Rhine. Taken together, {{the present study}} demonstrated that temperature increase can alter a predator-prey interaction when grazing rates of the predators and growth rates of the prey develop asynchronously with increasing temperature. It was shown that warming can differentially influence organisms on different trophic levels by trophic cascading (mussels-flagellate-bacteria). Additionally, the long-term (whole season) studies showed that there are other factors besides temperature such as cold winter periods or reproduction activity that can surpass direct temperature effects. The last part of the study provided basic data about population dynamics of C. fluminea. Both the short-term grazing experiments and the long-term studies provide new patterns and mechanics, which are relevant to accurately predict the performance and the effects of invasive bivalves under changing environmental conditions. ...|$|R
