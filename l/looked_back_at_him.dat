500|$|At {{the same}} time as the police handed control over to the SAS, they began making {{arrangements}} for the IRA operatives once they were in custody, including finding a police vehicle in which to transport the prisoners. A patrol car containing Inspector Luis Revagliatte and three other uniformed officers, apparently on routine patrol and with no knowledge of Operation Flavius, was ordered to return to police headquarters as a matter of urgency. The police car was stuck in heavy traffic travelling north on Smith Dorrien Avenue, close to the roundabout where it meets Winston Churchill Avenue. The official account states that at this point, Revagliatte's driver activated the siren on the police car in order to expedite the journey back to headquarters, intending to approach the roundabout from the wrong side of the road and turn the vehicle around. The siren apparently startled McCann and Farrell, just as Soldiers [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] were about to challenge them, outside the Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. [...] "Soldier A" [...] stated at the inquest that Farrell <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and appeared to realise who [...] "A" [...] was; [...] "A" [...] testified that he was drawing his pistol and intended to shout a challenge to her, but [...] "events overtook the warning": that McCann's right arm [...] "moved aggressively across the front of his body", leading [...] "A" [...] to believe that McCann was reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] shot McCann once in the back; [...] "A" [...] went on to tell the inquest that he believed Farrell then reached for her handbag, and that he believed Farrell may also have been reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] also shot Farrell once in the back, before returning to McCannâ€”he shot McCann a further three times (once in the body and twice in the head). [...] "Soldier B" [...] testified that he reached similar conclusions to [...] "A", and shot Farrell twice, then McCann once or twice, then returned to Farrell, shooting her a further three times. Soldiers [...] "C" [...] and [...] "D" [...] testified at the inquest that they were moving to apprehend Savage, who was by now [...] south of the petrol station, as gunfire began behind them. [...] "Soldier C" [...] testified that Savage turned around while simultaneously reaching towards his jacket pocket at {{the same time}} as [...] "C" [...] shouted [...] "Stop!"; [...] "C" [...] stated that he believed Savage was reaching for a remote detonator, at which point he opened fire. [...] "Soldier C" [...] shot Savage six times, while [...] "Soldier D" [...] fired nine times. All three IRA members died. One of the soldiers' bullets, believed to have passed through Farrell, grazed a passer-by.|$|E

60|$|She {{gathered}} up her dress from the floor, and hurried away to her room--without <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as usual {{when she opened}} the door.|$|R
60|$|A thrush {{began to}} sing in the maple. She stole silently toward the door, and paused to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> once to meet his glance. He had turned.|$|R
60|$|He watched Alvina {{with sharp}} blue eyes. Alvina <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> still vacantly.|$|E
60|$|Trudaine <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily; {{and taking}} out his handkerchief, passed {{it over the}} soiled cover of the book.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned slowly}} away, and Carrie moved towards the door, but, {{when she reached}} it, she stopped and <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|With {{a strong}} effort he {{mastered}} himself. Peggy had mounted a few steps, and was <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> over her shoulder. He {{could read the}} meaning now in the grey eyes.|$|R
60|$|There {{she paused}} a moment <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a coyness that might have become a girl of half her years, yet which her splendid beauty saved from being unbecoming even in her.|$|R
50|$|The {{ambulatory}} of {{the cathedral}} contains a statue of Saint Anthony of Padua, dressed as a Franciscan monk, with the baby Jesus in his arms. The saint looks at the child, smiling, and Jesus <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|For {{the third}} time Allan looked at his lawyer. And for {{the third time}} his lawyer <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quite unabashed.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} he stood still looking very earnestly at his father, who <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with tears in his deep-set, faded eyes.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{with her}} fine blue eyes, and signalled full into his spirit, as she said, her voice ringing with {{intimacy}} almost caressive {{now it was}} addressed to him: ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{not sure}} whether--so brief was the moment!--he had held and kissed her cheek. His arms were empty now, and he {{caught a glimpse of}} her poised on the road above him amidst the quivering, sunlit leaves, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> over her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Panchita obeyed {{and walked}} slowly toward her home, saying nothing. For some {{distance}} she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly upon Dry Valley's.

6000|$|... "As {{she paused}} {{there for a}} moment to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and ask the name of the book, he thought how pretty and how sweet she was; {{and for the first time}} a faint glimmer of the true nature of the thing he was doing forced itself into his brain.|$|R
6000|$|Rufus {{took her}} hand, {{and pressed it}} in silence. She <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{as she opened the}} door of her room. [...] "Don't {{distress}} Amelius," [...] she said; [...] "I can bear anything but that." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Gudrun with dark, vacant eyes. She <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as if full of gratitude. These phrases {{of a dying}} man were so {{complete}} and natural, coming like echoes through his dead mouth.|$|E
60|$|She {{picked up}} her skirts and ran, ran so lightly and swiftly that Cecil, who was taken by surprise, had no chance of {{catching}} her. From the hall door she <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> panting behind.|$|E
60|$|Gorman {{tried to}} {{extinguish}} the light, {{but it was}} a fire that would not be put out. He cursed the shop-windows and the lamps for shining so brightly on him; he cursed the few people whose curiosity induced them to pause and <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and he cursed himself for being such a fool.|$|R
60|$|When I {{could trust}} myself to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{he was out}} of his bed, {{standing}} erect at the side of it. The pupils of his eyes were now contracted; his eyeballs gleamed {{in the light of the}} candle as he moved his head slowly to and fro. He was thinking; he was doubting--he spoke again.|$|R
60|$|But {{the moment}} they touched turf, with one <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> she was off. Had she all the time meant to give him this breakneck chase--or had the loveliness of that Autumn day gone to her head--blue sky and coppery flames of bracken in the sun, and the beech leaves and the oak leaves; pure Highland {{colouring}} come South for once.|$|R
6000|$|... "So, I {{just looked}} at him--coolly, you know, and looked at her. Then I <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again--taking my time, you know. 'I don't think that that's a fair {{question}} to put to me,' says I." ...|$|E
6000|$|We <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{openly and}} frankly. The moment was {{critical}} for our interview. Could he do it? Were we {{the kind of}} person that he could give it to? Could we get it if he did? ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{a word in}} reply, {{without the}} {{slightest}} movement in her from head to foot, she <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> The blank stillness of horror was in her face. The deadly cold of horror was in her hands.|$|E
60|$|He almost saw it, {{going on}} before. He stopped, looking up towards the skylight; and a figure, childish itself, but {{carrying}} a child, and singing as it went, {{seemed to be}} there again. Anon, {{it was the same}} figure, alone, stopping for an instant, with suspended breath; the bright hair clustering loosely round its tearful face; and <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ryo Asuka (Satan): Leader of all demons. Wields {{incredible}} psychic power, {{among other}} abilities.

The story ends with the two meeting face to face and, instead of fighting, Akira walks past <b>him</b> while Ryo <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> sadly.|$|R
60|$|They {{began to}} meet more people. For {{the most part}} these were staring before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean. One man in evening dress passed them on foot, {{his eyes on the}} ground. They heard his voice, and, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> saw one hand {{clutched}} in his hair and the other beating invisible things. His paroxysm of rage over, he went on his way without once <b>looking</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{from the}} corner of the Square, a straight, impassive figure in a little halo of soft light. There was a catch in her heart. Her companion's words were surely spoken in some foreign tongue.|$|E
6000|$|Evan {{pulled up}} {{abruptly}} and <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "We {{are really in}} the devil of a hurry," [...] he said, [...] "and if you really have a yacht, {{the truth is that}} we would give our ears for it." ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{gazed into}} the fire for several moments, and Philip watched her. It was a woman's face, grave and thoughtful, a little perturbed just then, as though by some unwelcome thought. Presently she <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{looked into his eyes}} long and earnestly.|$|E
5000|$|Unmasking {{the baker}} as Bugs, Brody retraces his steps to unmask Bugs' {{previous}} disguises, leading Brody {{to believe that}} [...] "everybody's a rabbit!". When Brody looks into {{what he thinks is}} a mirror (but is actually a window) and sees Bugs <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he thinks he has turned into a rabbit and snaps, hopping down the street and turning onto the Brooklyn Bridge, hysterically shouting [...] "What's up, doc?!" ...|$|R
60|$|In her mind, {{she prayed}} to God to bless her father, and to soften him towards her, {{if it might}} be so; and if not, to forgive {{him if he was}} wrong, and pardon her the prayer which almost seemed impiety. And doing so, and <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with blinded eyes, and {{stealing}} timidly away, passed out of his room, and crossed the other, and was gone.|$|R
60|$|Quentin {{was so much}} {{surprised}} at the causeless offence which these two decent looking persons had taken at a very simple and civil question, that he forgot to be angry at the rudeness of their reply, and stood staring after them as they walked on with amended pace, often <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{as if they were}} desirous to get as soon as possible out of his reach.|$|R
