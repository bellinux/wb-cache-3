5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. <b>Low</b> <b>alloy</b> steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to high strength <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E

5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E

500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E

Fatigue crack growth tests show a correlation between fatigue performance and the occurrence of crack closure.

The relationship between the crack path and the microstructure, i. e. grain structure and slip planarity, is assessed semi-quantitatively. A criterion to evaluate the propensity for slip band formation is derived and reasonable correlation is found between the fatigue fracture behaviour of the three alloys and this criterion. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{emphasis}} on magnesium alloys can be appreciated {{by following the}} research push from several agencies, universities and editorial efforts. With a density equal to two-thirds of Al and one-thirds of steel, Mg provides the best opportunity for lightweighting of metallic components. However, one key bottleneck restricting its insertion into industrial applications is low strength values. In this respect, Mg-Y-Nd alloys have been promising due {{to their ability to}} form strengthening precipitates on the prismatic plane. However, if the strength is compared to Al alloys, these alloys are not attractive. The primary reason for low structural performance in Mg is related to <b>low</b> <b>alloying</b> and microstructural efficiency. In this dissertation, these terminologies are discussed in detail.

40|$|<b>Low</b> Cr <b>alloys</b> {{are mostly}} {{utilized}} in structural components such as steam pipes, turbine generators and reactor pumps operating at high temperatures from 400 ℃ to 700 ℃ in nuclear power plants. For safe operation, {{it is necessary}} {{at the design stage}} to predict and understand the creep damage behaviour of <b>low</b> Cr <b>alloys</b> under long-term service conditions but under low stress levels. Laboratory creep tests can be utilized in the investigation of creep damage behaviour, however, these are usually expensive and time-consuming. Thus, constitutive modelling is considered here for both time and economic efficiency. Existing constitutive equations for describing creep are mostly proposed based on experimental data for materials under high stresses. For low stress levels, the computational determination of a current state is extrapolated from those constitutive equations by simply using a powerlaw or sinh law. However, experimental observation has shown that this method is not satisfactory. The aim of the current research is to utilize continuum damage mechanics (CDM) to improve the constitutive equations for <b>low</b> Cr <b>alloys</b> under long-term service. This project provides three main contributions. The first is a more accurate depiction of the relationship between minimum creep rate and stress levels. The predicted creep rates show good agreement with creep data observed experimentally for both 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel and 0. 5 Cr- 0. 5 Mo- 0. 25 V steel creep specimens. Secondly, it gives a more comprehensive description of the relationship between creep damage and creep cavitation. The CDM approach has been used and a reasonable agreement has also been achieved between predicted creep strain and experimental data for 0. 5 Cr- 0. 5 Mo- 0. 25 V base material under the critical stress of 40 MPa at 640 ℃. Thirdly, it proposes a more accurate creep rupture criterion in the creep damage analysis of <b>low</b> Cr <b>alloys</b> under different stress levels. Based on investigation of creep cavitation for 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel, the area fraction of cavitation at rupture time obviously differs under different stress levels. This thesis contributes to computational creep damage mechanics in general and in particular to the design of a constitutive model for creep damage analysis of <b>low</b> Cr <b>alloys.</b> The proposed constitutive equations are only valid at low and intermediate stress levels. Further work needs to be undertaken when more experimental data are available...|$|R
