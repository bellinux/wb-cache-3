6000|$|... "It {{is beyond}} all measure charming of you," [...] Guillot declared, [...] "but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little question. Is it peace or war?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad to see {{you both}} so ruddy; Cobhurst air must agree with you. And now, before we say {{anything}} else, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> question: Have you had your supper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brave {{and generous}} friend, will <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one last question? I am very ignorant, and it {{troubles}} me--just a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're worth {{a bushel}} of diamonds--when you cook 'em. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something--is your old dad as fierce as Uncle Dan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} I should {{come here with}} proofs," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Well, they are easy enough to collect. You shall have them. But before I go, Lord Arranmore, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you know who I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A great {{fellow in}} livery opens the door, and says, 'You're the forty- fifth as come about this 'ere place; but, fust, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{preliminary}} question. Are you a Hirishwoman?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} gone," [...] Saton answered, [...] "before {{any of your}} guests are up. In case I do not see you again alone, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> question, or rather a favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. Precisely: {{thats all}} anybody {{has to say}} to it, except the British public, which pretends not to believe it. And now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{sympathetic}} personal question. Havnt you a headache? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I don't think it's funny at all,' said Sam. 'But jes <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one thing: what's {{the name}} of the toll-gate woman?' ...|$|R
60|$|In conclusion, Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> not {{to force}} on me this {{continued}} correspondence by daily attacks. It is a trouble and a nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in our conversation, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> this. You read the newspapers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If they did! They will. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> question. I know {{something}} more than your name about you; I knew something about Gaffer Hexam. When did you last set eyes upon his daughter?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Dick, old chap," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are just}} back from abroad {{and you are not}} quite in the hang of things yet. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> plain question. What do you think of us all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{delighted to}} hear that our friends have arrived at last,' he said. 'Before I shake hands with them, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} about this queer work of art here. I see photographs of it downstairs. Are they for sale?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not, boy," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr Shirley. [...] "Well, now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Ned, {{how much}} gold have you {{brought back from}} the diggings?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{for that}} individual, Mr Venus,' remarks Wegg, {{when he is}} fully gone, 'I have been passed over! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{what you think of}} him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Farebrother {{was silent}} for a moment, and then said earnestly, [...] "My dear fellow, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one question. Forgive me if I take a liberty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I neither {{want any}} thanks, nor merit any," [...] was the {{careless}} rejoinder. [...] "It {{was nothing to}} do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is too much--it is too much," [...] {{said the}} King. [...] "Nature is weak. I must speak to you, brother artist, without further disguise. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> solemn question. Adam Wayne, Lord High Provost of Notting Hill, don't {{you think it}} splendid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hearing {{that the}} man who took Ticonderoga was here in Pendennis Castle, I've ridden twenty-five miles to see him; and to-morrow my brother will ride forty for the same purpose. So let me have first look. Sir," [...] he continued, {{addressing}} the captive, [...] "will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> few plain questions, and be free with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They were, when I {{last heard}} of them. They {{are not at}} home. By the way, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> Is {{it true that you}} were seen there?' ...|$|R
6000|$|D. You put it very home to <b>me.</b> Pray <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> another question: Are {{you in any}} {{likelihood}} of getting your ship off, if you refuse it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will pass}} over {{that for the}} present. But do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> {{do you think it}} possible, I say possible, that you and Frank should be married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so, my dear boy. For a beginning, then, let me {{say that}} Lady Arabella's letter makes clear some things which she intended--and also some things which she did not intend. But, before I begin to draw deductions, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> few questions. Adam, are you heart-whole, quite heart-whole, in the matter of Lady Arabella?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young man," [...] the {{professor}} said earnestly, [...] "let {{me point out}} to {{you that this is}} a wonderful position in which you have been placed. You ought to be most proud and grateful. Any trifling inconveniences which may result should be, I venture to say, utterly ignored by you. Now come, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> question. Are you feeling absolutely your--how shall I call it--revised self to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend, the {{question}} you ask cannot be fully answered," [...] said Egede. [...] "I can explain, however, that our first parents were put into {{the world to be}} tried or tested in that way. To have warned Eve would have rendered the test useless. Enough for us to know that she was told what to do. Her duty was to obey. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> question: is not sin--is not murder--hateful?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hurd," [...] he begged, [...] "do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one question! Why do {{you refuse}} me? What harm can I {{possibly}} do {{by talking to}} your villagers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Isabella, I am serious. But first <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> {{have you}} no {{suspicion}} that I {{may have been}} privy to the strange chance which befell you yesterday morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A modern Theatre, as I {{heard you}} say, Sows seeds of evil broadcast--well it may; But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> my {{respected}} son, Pray, {{have you ever}} ventured into one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} think I have. But, Mrs. Orme, will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> favour? Perhaps you will not say {{anything}} about my coming here. I have been very unhappy; I have indeed; and--" [...] Mrs. Furnival's handkerchief was now up at her eyes, and Mrs. Orme's heart was again full of pity. Of course she gave the required promise; and, looking {{to the character of}} the woman, we may say that, of course, she kept it.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Oh, but that’s not fair—that’s Pope! It’s not original, Dudgeon. Understand me,’ said I, {{wringing}} his breast-button, ‘the first duty of all {{poetry is}} to be mine, sir—mine. Inspiration now swells in my bosom, because—to tell you the plain truth, and descend a little in style—I am devilish relieved at the turn things have taken. So, I dare say, are you yourself, Dudgeon, if you would only allow it. And à propos, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> home question. Between friends, have you ever fired that pistol?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are forgetting, Mistress Thankful, {{that you}} have not told me how I can serve you. It cannot be that you are still {{concerned}} in Capt. Brewster, who has given evidence against your other--FRIENDS, and tacitly against YOU. Nor can it be on their account, for I regret {{to say they are}} still free and unknown. If you come with any information exculpating them, and showing they are not spies or hostile to the cause, your father's release shall be certain and speedy. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> single question: Why do you believe them honest?" ...|$|E
500|$|Eaton: [...] "Then <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if the prosecuting {{officers}} {{have not been}} entirely correct in repelling all insinuations that you ever had tolerated any such means for raising funds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And what, Sir,' said Pott--'what, Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> as an {{impartial}} man, {{is the state}} of the public mind in London, with reference to my contest with the INDEPENDENT?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well,' {{said this}} gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his arms. 'That's a horse. Now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> girls and boys, Would you paper {{a room with}} {{representations}} of horses?' ...|$|R
