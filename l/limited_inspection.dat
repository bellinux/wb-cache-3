40|$|To {{guarantee}} {{the quality of}} a product, in quite a few production processes all produced items are inspected before they go to the consumer. In case there is one product characteristic that has to conform a certain specification <b>limit,</b> <b>inspection</b> can take place by measuring this characteristic and comparing it to a test limit. This test limit is in general slightly more strict than the specification limit, because of a measurement error in measuring the characteristic. Instead of measuring the characteristic itself, one can also inspect an item by means of the measurements of other characteristics that are related to the characteristic of interest. This may be of interest if it is very costly to measure the characteristic itself, or if the characteristic itself can only be measured destructively.

40|$|Passive alloys like {{stainless}} steels {{are prone to}} localized corrosion in chlorides containing environments. The greater {{the depth of the}} localized corrosion phenomenon, the more dramatic the related damage that can lead to a structure weakening by fast perforation. In practical situations, because measurements are time consuming and expensive, the challenge is usually to predict the maximum pit depth that could be found in a large scale installation from the processing of a <b>limited</b> <b>inspection</b> data. As far as the parent distribution of pit depths is assumed to be of exponential type, the most successful method was found in the application of the statistical extreme-value analysis developed by Gumbel. This study aims to present a new and alternative methodology to the Gumbel approach with a view towards accurately estimating the maximum pit depth observed on a ferritic stainless steel AISI 409 subjected to an accelerated corrosion test (ECC 1) used in automotive industry. This methodology consists in characterising and modelling both the morphology of pits and the statistical distribution of their depths from a <b>limited</b> <b>inspection</b> dataset. The heart of the data processing is based on the combination of two recent statistical methods that avoid making any choice about the type of the theoretical underlying parent distribution of pit depths: the Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD) is used to model the distribution of pit depths and the Bootstrap technique to determine a confidence interval on the maximum pit depth...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I model the optimal {{monitoring}} and enforcement strategy when inspection capacity is fixed by budget or manpower constraints. I adopt a leverage enforcement structure that classifies firms into two groups with different enforcement intensities. Optimal {{monitoring and enforcement}} requires effective allocation of the fixed number of inspections to the two groups. In each period, a fixed number of firms are selected from each group for inspection, and those with the highest emissions are placed in the targeted group in which the inspection probability is higher. This transition structure induces rankorder tournaments among inspected firms. Once selected for inspection, the emissions of each firm are subject to a standard above which the firm pays a fixed penalty. I find that a regulator facing inspection capacity constraints should leverage the <b>limited</b> <b>inspections</b> by allocating more inspections to the targeted group. In addition, I show that targeting enforcement is generally superior to static enforcement. This is in accordance with findings in the literature. These results are consistent over different ranges of regulatory parameters. ...|$|R

These double sampling events were easily detected by examination of the size data, and software limits could be set to exclude such double sampling events from the data set.
