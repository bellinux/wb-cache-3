25|$|The <b>Liberty</b> <b>cap,</b> {{also known}} as the Phrygian cap, or pileus, is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. It {{reflects}} Roman republicanism and liberty, alluding to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty.|$|E

The origin of the name is attributed to its appearance from some angles as looking like a Frenchman's cap, notably the <b>Liberty</b> <b>cap</b> worn during the French Revolution (1789–1799).|$|E

Alas, the men of Kansas was far from being as sorrowful as the part demanded,--in spite of her instructions she would smile at the boys. But the appealing inscription she bore, [...] "Set me free" [...] was greeted with storms of laughter, the boldest of the young men shouting that she was too beautiful to be free, and some of the old men, to their shame be it said likewise shouted. No false embarrassment troubled Kansas. She was openly pleased. But the young men who had brought their sweethearts to town, and were standing hand in hand with them, for obvious reasons saw nothing: They scarcely dared to look at Kansas, and those who did were so loudly rebuked that they turned down the side streets.|$|R
25|$|When the U.S. {{government}} {{moved back}} to Philadelphia in 1790, the city, {{in an attempt to}} convince the federal government not to move to Washington, was determined to provide luxurious accommodations at Congress Hall, the recently constructed building where Congress was to meet. One of the finishing touches was in June 1791, when a large Axminster carpet was installed in the Senate's upper-floor chamber. The central design was the U.S. coat of arms, complete with the constellation of 13 stars, surrounded by the linked shields of all thirteen states. Under the arms, there was also a pole with a <b>liberty</b> <b>cap</b> and a balance of justice. The carpet was 22 by 40 feet, and was made by William Peter Sprague, an Englishman from Axminster (probably trained under Thomas Whitty) who had set up a factory in Philadelphia. The carpet was not brought to Washington, D.C., when the government moved in 1800, and is long lost. The National Park Service had a reproduction made in 1978 as part of the restoration of Congress Hall; they had to speculate on the exact design of the eagle and chose the representation seen on the first seal die.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to striking the pattern coins in 1849, {{officials at the}} Philadelphia Mint continued to experiment with three-cent silvers. [...] The matter {{was caught up in}} ongoing conflict between Mint chief coiner Franklin Peale, and the chief engraver, James B. Longacre, who each prepared designs. [...] Peale produced a coin depicting a <b>Liberty</b> <b>cap,</b> based on a design prepared by Longacre's late predecessor, Christian Gobrecht, in 1836. Longacre prepared a design similar to the coin that was eventually released.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1849, {{there were}} {{calls for a}} silver three-cent piece, and pattern coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint. Longacre's design {{featured}} a shield within a six-pointed star on one side. [...] Peale offered a competing design, showing a <b>Liberty</b> <b>cap,</b> very similar to one Gobrecht had made in 1836 when a gold dollar had been proposed. [...] Patterson preferred Peale's design, but reluctantly endorsed Longacre's, since it was in lower relief and could be struck more easily, and Treasury Secretary Thomas Corwin approved the Engraver's work. [...] The three-cent piece went into circulation in 1851.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} Bechtlers began to strike their private issues, Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury became an {{advocate}} of having the Mint of the United States ("Mint", when described as an institution) strike the one-dollar denomination in gold. He was opposed by the Mint Director, Robert M. Patterson. Woodbury persuaded President Andrew Jackson to have pattern coins struck. [...] In response, Patterson had Mint Second Engraver Christian Gobrecht break off work on the new design for the silver one-dollar coin and work on a pattern for the gold dollar. Gobrecht's design featured a <b>Liberty</b> <b>cap</b> surrounded by rays on one side, and a palm branch arranged in a circle with the denomination, date, and name of {{the country on the}} other.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} the dime, owing to the {{smallness}} of the coin, has been held quite simple.

The piece was {{designed}} by Robert Scot, and was the first in the eagle series, which continued until the Mint ceased striking gold coins for circulation in 1933. The common name is a misnomer; Liberty does not wear a turban but a cap, believed by some to be a pileus or Phrygian <b>cap</b> (<b>Liberty</b> cap): her hair twisting around the headgear makes it resemble a turban.|$|R
500|$|Swiatek and Breen {{describe}} the obverse {{of the quarter}} eagle as [...] "very Art Deco". Liberty appears on it, wearing a <b>liberty</b> <b>cap</b> and holding both a scroll representing the United States Declaration of Independence and a torch likely intended to recall the Statue of Liberty. The reverse depicts Independence Hall, where the Declaration was signed, and the rising sun behind it. [...] Sinnock's initials are to the right, above {{the right wing of}} the building. Bowers pointed out that the depiction of Independence Hall closely resembles that on the Bicentennial half dollar, struck a half century later. As no clock hands are seen on the bell tower of the building on the quarter eagle, it is not possible to say what time is intended—on the Bicentennial half dollar, the time is 3:00.|$|E
500|$|Psilocybe semilanceata, {{commonly}} known as the <b>liberty</b> <b>cap,</b> is a psilocybin or [...] "magic" [...] mushroom that contains the psychoactive compounds psilocybin, psilocin and baeocystin. It is both {{one of the most widely}} distributed psilocybin mushrooms in nature, and one of the most potent. The mushrooms have a distinctive conical to bell-shaped cap, up to [...] in diameter, with a small nipple-like protrusion on the top. They are yellow to brown, covered with radial grooves when moist, and fade to a lighter color as they mature. Their stipes tend to be slender and long, and the same color or slightly lighter than the cap. The gill attachment to the stipe is adnexed (narrowly attached), and they are initially cream-colored before tinting purple as the spores mature. The spores are dark purplish-brown in mass, ellipsoid in shape, and measure 10.5–15 by 6.5–8.5micrometres.|$|E
500|$|The three {{designs for}} the Turban Head eagle—the obverse and the two reverses—are all by Scot. [...] They are {{identical}} to designs used on other silver and gold coins of the period—the Mint did not yet put denominations on gold pieces. The origin of Scot's obverse is uncertain. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule suggests a similarity between Scot's portrayal of Liberty on the eagle and the portrait on the 1792 half disme (deemed by some the first Federal coinage), and speculates that the ultimate inspiration may have been Martha Washington, the President's wife. He also contends that a bust should have drapery only if intended {{as part of a}} statue: [...] "Greco-Roman classicism has been misunderstood here". Numismatic historian Walter Breen believes that Scot probably [...] "copied some unlocated contemporaneous engraving of a Roman copy of a Hellenistic goddess, altering the hair, adding drapery and an oversize soft cap". Breen disputes Vermeule's contention that the cap is a pileus, the hat given to emancipated slaves as a symbol of their freedom. In support of his argument, he reproduces an 1825 letter from then Mint Director Samuel Moore, stating that the cap on the gold coins was [...] "not the <b>Liberty</b> <b>cap</b> in form, but probably conforming to the fashionable dress of the day". Numismatic author David Lange contends the headgear is a mob cap, much in fashion at the time.|$|E

500|$|Weinman's dime depicts Liberty with {{a wreath}} of tight curls, {{and wearing a}} {{traditional}} pileus, or <b>Liberty</b> <b>cap.</b> [...] His depiction of the pileus as a winged cap has provoked comparisons with Roman Republic denarii, which art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered superficial. [...] Weinman wrote that he considered the winged cap to symbolize [...] "liberty of thought". [...] Vermeule suggests that {{one reason for the}} use of wings was that Weinman, in common with many in the tradition of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, under whom Weinman had studied, liked the effect of feathers done in relief. [...] The reverse depicts a fasces, the object carried by lictors, who accompanied Roman magistrates; on the coin it represents war and justice. [...] It is contrasted with a large olive branch symbolizing peace. [...] According to Breen, [...] "Weinman's symbolic message in this design... was clearly an updated 'Don't tread on me'". The fasces is bound both horizontally and diagonally by a leather strap, with the loose ends at the bottom. The lettering is in Roman style, and is made as discreet as possible.
