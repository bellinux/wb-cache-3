40|$|Purpose – Several {{authors have}} {{proposed}} {{different approaches to}} help practitioners deal with the complexity of prioritising improvement projects and initiatives. However, these approaches have been developed as “generic” methods which do not consider the specific needs, objectives and capabilities of different industries and organisations. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present an integrated methodology that prioritises improvement projects or initiatives based on two key performance objectives, cost and quality, specifically important for <b>low</b> volume-high <b>integrity</b> product manufacturers. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews some of the most commonly used prioritisation methods and the theory and logic behind the proposed prioritisation methodology. Then, the prioritisation methodology is empirically tested, through a case study, in a world class manufacturing organisation. Findings – The results obtained from the case study indicate that the integrated methodology proposed in this paper is an effective alternative for <b>low</b> volume-high <b>integrity</b> products manufacturers to identify, select and justify improvement priorities. Practical implications – Selection and prioritisation of projects and initiatives are key elements for the successful implementation of improvements. The integrated methodology presented in this paper intends to aid organisations in dealing with the complexity that is normally handled over the selection and prioritisation of feasible improvement projects. Originality/value – This paper presents a novel methodology that integrates two commonly used approaches in industry, Process Activity Mapping (PAM) and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), to prioritise improvements. This methodology can help, in particular, organisations embarked in the manufacture of <b>low</b> volume-high <b>integrity</b> products to take better decisions and align the focus of improvement efforts with their overall performance and strategic objectives...|$|R

However, there is no quite satisfactory solution to the problem about the superposition of multi-reflections particular by the upper defects of pile and the dissipation of the absorption and scattering by soil and pile. In this paper, the velocity response on the top of pile is derived considering the superposition of the multi-reflections on no matter how many interfaces of the discontinued impedance due to the defects of pile. Therefore, the resulting new method to inverse the velocity response is presented. When the every first exact wavelet are given, all the reflection coefficients can be determined and then the defects of pile and their corresponding depths can be detected one-to-one mapping to the discontinued impedance interfaces. In addition, the non-linear least squares method is applied in <b>low</b> strain <b>integrity</b> testing of foundation pile to solve the damping factor of soil and pile. The convergence is improved in comparison to other method. The examples for real pile shows that the methods are effective and the result is satisfactory...|$|R
