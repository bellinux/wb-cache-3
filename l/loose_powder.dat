5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where <b>loose</b> <b>powder</b> can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E

2500|$|The first revolvers were front loading, {{and were}} a bit like muskets in that the powder and bullet were loaded separately. These were caplocks or [...] "cap and ball" [...] revolvers, because the caplock method of priming {{was the first to}} be compact enough to make a {{practical}} revolver feasible. When loading, each chamber in the cylinder was rotated out of line with the barrel, and charged from the front with <b>loose</b> <b>powder</b> and an oversized bullet. Next, the chamber was aligned with the ramming lever underneath the barrel. [...] Pulling the lever would drive a rammer into the chamber, pushing the ball securely in place. Finally, the user would place percussion caps on the nipples on the rear face of the cylinder.|$|E
60|$|It was done, {{and they}} {{regarded}} {{their work with}} pride, although it seemed probable that they were building up their own tomb. Because of its position at an angle of the passage, they knew that Meyer could not get to it with a pole to batter it down. Also, there was no <b>loose</b> <b>powder</b> left, so his only chance would be to pull it to pieces with his hands, and this, they thought, might be beyond his power.

Densification occurs very rapidly, and is followed by a much slower sintering process typical of volume diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{hydrides}} {{are attractive}} candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage {{because of their}} high hydrogen storage capacities and moderate operation temperatures. However, the fast and efficient transport of reaction heat through the hydride bed is an unsolved problem due to the low intrinsic heat conductivities of complex hydrides. Here, we report on increasing the effective thermal conductivities of a NaAlH 4 - and a LiNH 2 -MgH 2 -based material by admixing expanded natural graphite (ENG) up to 25 mass% and compaction with up to 400 MPa. Thermal conductivities in radial and axial direction, microstructure and phase fractions of these pellets were determined. With increasing ENG content the heat transfer characteristics of both systems were enhanced from less than 1 W m - 1 K - 1 up to 38 W m - 1 K - 1. The pelletized hydride-graphite composites can be processed easily and safely compared to <b>loose</b> <b>powders.</b> Further, they have increased volumetric storage capacities of up to 59 g-H 2 l - 1 and 54 g-H 2 l - 1 compared to the <b>loose</b> <b>powders</b> with 19 g-H 2 l - 1 and 18 g-H 2 l - 1 for the NaAlH 4 - and a LiNH 2 -MgH 2 -based material, respectively, {{and they are very}} suitable for a tubular hydride tank design due to anisotropic heat transfer characteristics...|$|R

Then he scattered powder thickly over the floor beneath, so that when the candle fell at the recoil it must explode the huge pile in which the three drunkards were wallowing.|$|E
60|$|And {{now that}} the contest was over what was to follow? To me, the hours that came after are even greater in honor than those glorious hours of victory. Already down the shore, the work of rescuing the sailors and marines from the Maria Teresa, Oquendo, and Vizcaya had begun, and now the crews of the Brooklyn and Oregon turned in to aid the wounded and the dying, and those in danger of drowning, on the Colon. Boat after boat went out, close to the sinking cruiser, now burning fiercely, with {{abandoned}} guns going off, <b>loose</b> <b>powder</b> and shells exploding, and magazines in danger of tearing all asunder. Amid such perils did our noble jackies work, hauling man after man from the ship, or from the water, and taking them to our own warships, there {{to be cared for}} as tenderly as though they were our own. Some of the Spaniards could not understand this treatment. They had been told that the Americans were butchers and had no hearts, and when they realized the truth many burst into tears of joy.|$|E
60|$|Marlborough ordered General Tettau {{to cross}} the river in boats, with eight hundred picked men, and to carry Old Fort by storm. The assault was made with great {{determination}} and bravery; but the works were strong and stoutly defended, and the British were about to fall back, discomfited, when fortune came to their assistance. Some <b>loose</b> <b>powder</b> ignited and fired the magazine, by which {{more than two hundred}} men of the garrison were killed, and the works seriously injured. After this disaster, the governor abandoned the fort and withdrew, with the survivors of its garrison, to Charles's Fort. Marlborough at once commenced the siege of this position, but for fifteen days the place resisted all his efforts. The heavy loss, however, which the garrison had suffered by the explosion in Old Fort, rendered them unable, by sallies, to interfere with the works of the besiegers. These were carried on with great vigour, for Marlborough feared that the approach of the wet season would put a stop to his operations.|$|E

'Fire now {{was set to}} a {{quantity}} of huts built for the accommodation of African soldiers to the northward of the barracks, {{as well as to}} the house of a poor black woman called Dalrymple. These burnt briskly, throwing a dismal glare over the barracks and picturesque town of San Josef, and overpowering the light of the full moon, which illumined a cloudless sky. The mutineers made a rush at the barrack-room, and seized on the muskets and fusees in the racks. [...] Their leader, Daaga, and a daring Yarraba named Ogston instantly charged their pieces; the former of these had {{a quantity}} of ball- cartridges, <b>loose</b> <b>powder,</b> and ounce and pistol-balls, in a kind of gray worsted cap. He must have provided himself with these before the mutiny. How he became possessed of them, especially the pistol- balls, I never could learn; probably he was supplied by his unmilitary countrymen: pistol-balls are never given to infantry. [...] Previous to this Daaga and three others made a rush at the regimental store-room, in which was deposited a quantity of powder. [...] An old African soldier, named Charles Dickson, interfered to stop them, on which Maurice Ogston, the Yarraba chief, who had armed himself with a sergeant's sword, cut down the faithful African. [...] When down Daaga said, in English, [...] "Ah, you old soldier, you knock down." [...] Dixon was not Daaga's countryman, hence he could not speak to him in his own language. The Paupau then levelled his musket and shot the fallen soldier, who groaned and died. The war-yells, or rather growls, of the Paupaus and Yarrabas now became awfully thrilling, as they helped themselves to cartridges: most of them were fortunately blank, or without ball. Never was a premeditated mutiny so wild and ill planned. Their chief, Daaga, and Ogston seemed to have had little command of the subordinates, and the whole acted more like a set of wild beasts who had broken their cages than men resolved on war.|$|E
