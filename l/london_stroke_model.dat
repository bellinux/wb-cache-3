40|$|Background Stroke is a {{clinical}} priority requiring early specialist assessment and treatment. A London (UK) stroke strategy {{was introduced in}} 2010, with Hyper Acute Stroke Units (HASUs) providing specialist and high dependency care. To support increased numbers of specialist staff, innovative multisite multiprofessional simulation training under a standard protocol-based curriculum took place across London. This paper reports on an independent evaluation of the HASU training programme. The main aim was to evaluate mechanisms for behaviour change within the training design and delivery, and impact upon learners including potential transferability to the clinical environment. Methods The evaluation utilised the Behaviour Change Wheel framework. Procedures included: mapping training via the framework; examination of course material; direct and video-recorded observations of courses; pre-post course survey sheet; and follow up in-depth interviews with candidates and faculty. Results Patient management skills and trainee confidence were reportedly increased post-course (post-course median 6 [IQ range 5 – 6. 33]; pre-course median 5 [IQ range 4. 67 – 5. 83]; z[*]=[*] 6. 42, P[*]&# 60;. 001). Thematic analysis showed that facilitated ‘debrief’ was the key agent in supporting both clinical and non-clinical skills. Follow up interviews in practice showed some sustained effects such as enthusiasm for role, and a focus on situational awareness, prioritization and verbalising thoughts. Challenges in standardising a multi-centre course included provision for local context/identity. Conclusions Pan-London simulation training under the <b>London</b> <b>Stroke</b> <b>Model</b> had positive outcomes in terms of self-reported skills and motivation. These effects persisted to an extent in practice, where staff could recount applications of learning. The evaluation demonstrated that a multiple centre simulation programme congruent with clinical practice can provide valuable standard training opportunities that support patient care...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In 2012, an {{innovative}} programme of simulation-based training produced a unified approach to training acute stroke teams across several London hospitals. Based on the London Model ([URL] {{this is the}} first time a standardized protocol-based curriculum has been rolled out across multiple hospitals in a geographic area of the UK. Objectives: This project reports on comprehensive evaluation data collected at various points during the programme, designed to answer the question of whether there has been a significant demonstrable shift in learning and in behaviour in practice. In addition to specific scenario-based learning outcomes, the learning outcomes included time management and decision-making, working with colleagues, and recognition and management of acute deterioration in a stroke patient. Material/Patients and Methods or Expected Audience: The project used a mixed-methods evaluation approach. Data were collected from participants before, during, and at multiple time intervals after the interventions. The unique design of the training programme also allowed examination of differences between different simulation centres’ implementation of the programme, between different hospitals’ practices and implementations of the <b>London</b> <b>Stroke</b> <b>model,</b> between staff with different roles and levels of experience, different time to follow-up and between specific programme components. Pre- and post-intervention surveys (n= 165) measured changes in participant self-efficacy, a psychological construct related to domain performance, regarding learning outcomes. Open-ended, topical interviews (n= 20) at time intervals after the intervention explored how the learning objectives were met, what information was retained, and what implications this has had for personal development, for practice, and for patient care. Results / Requirements/Specific needs: Data analysis, which is still in process, consists of comparison of pre and post course survey data via analysis of variance, and a thematic analysis of qualitative data. Initial analysis of quantitative data show an increase in perceived self-efficacy among candidates in the domains associated with the intended learning outcomes, and also in the specific area of using a standardized early warning reporting system. However, this increase was lower among more advanced clinicans (those with extensive experience working in a high-acuity stroke unit). Initial analysis of qualitative data show that nurses find the training more specifically relevant to subsequent clinical situations than do doctors, who report that the simulation is generally worthwhile but not necessarily immediately relevant. Both doctors and nurses are less able to specifically recall and associate the learning activities with clinical practice over time. Conclusion / Description of the session: Data from this project show that the training programme is effective in helping achieve the associated learning outcomes. This project demonstrates that carefully designed simulation programmes, which are congruent with clinical practice, can provide valuable training opportunities that support patient care. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Stroke</b> <b>models</b> are {{essential}} tools in experimental <b>stroke.</b> Although several <b>models</b> of <b>stroke</b> {{have been developed}} {{in a variety of}} animals, with the development of transgenic mice there is the need to develop a reliable and reproducible <b>stroke</b> <b>model</b> in mice, which mimics as close as possible human stroke. Methods BALB/Ca-RAG 2 -/- γc -/- mice were subjected to cauterization or thrombosis <b>stroke</b> <b>model</b> and sacrificed at different time points (48 hr, 1 wk, 2 wk and 4 wk) after stroke. Mice received BrdU to estimate activation of cell proliferation in the SVZ. Brains were processed for immunohistochemical and EM. Results In both <b>stroke</b> <b>models,</b> after inflammation the same glial scar formation process and damage evolution takes place. After stroke, necrotic tissue is progressively removed, and healthy tissue is preserved from injury through the glial scar formation. Cauterization <b>stroke</b> <b>model</b> produced unspecific damage, was less efficient and the infarct was less homogeneous compared to thrombosis infarct. Finally, thrombosis <b>stroke</b> <b>model</b> produces activation of SVZ proliferation. Conclusions Our results provide an exhaustive analysis of the histopathological changes (inflammation, necrosis, tissue remodeling, scarring [...] .) that occur after stroke in the ischemic boundary zone, which are of key importance for the final stroke outcome.

40|$|Summary: Rodent <b>stroke</b> <b>models</b> {{provide the}} {{experimental}} backbone for the in vivo {{determination of the}} mechanisms of cell death and neural repair, and for the initial testing of neuroprotective compounds. Less than 10 rodent <b>models</b> of focal <b>stroke</b> are routinely used in experimental study. These vary widely {{in their ability to}} model the human disease, and in their application to the study of cell death or neural repair. Many rodent focal <b>stroke</b> <b>models</b> produce large infarcts that more closely resemble malignant and fatal human infarction than the average sized human stroke.

40|$|Felix Fluri, Michael K Schuhmann, Christoph KleinschnitzDepartment of Neurology, University Clinic Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, GermanyAbstract: This review {{outlines}} {{the most frequently}} used rodent <b>stroke</b> <b>models</b> and discusses their strengths and shortcomings. Mimicking all aspects of human stroke in one animal model is not feasible because ischemic stroke in humans is a heterogeneous disorder with a complex pathophysiology. The transient or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model is one of the models that most closely simulate human ischemic <b>stroke.</b> Furthermore, this <b>model</b> is characterized by reliable and well-reproducible infarcts. Therefore, the MCAo model has been involved in the majority of studies that address pathophysiological processes or neuroprotective agents. Another model uses thromboembolic clots and thus is more convenient for investigating thrombolytic agents and pathophysiological processes after thrombolysis. However, for many reasons, preclinical stroke research has a low translational success rate. One factor might be the choice of <b>stroke</b> <b>model.</b> Whereas the therapeutic responsiveness of permanent focal stroke in humans declines significantly within 3  hours after stroke onset, the therapeutic window in animal models with prompt reperfusion is up to 12  hours, resulting in a much longer action time of the investigated agent. Another major problem of animal <b>stroke</b> <b>models</b> is that studies are mostly conducted in young animals without any comorbidity. These models differ from human stroke, which particularly affects elderly people who have various cerebrovascular risk factors. Choosing the most appropriate <b>stroke</b> <b>model</b> and optimizing the study design of preclinical trials might increase the translational potential of animal <b>stroke</b> <b>models.</b> Keywords: permanent and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, photothrombosis, endothelin- 1, microsphere/macrosphere, thromboembolic clot model, rat, mous...|$|R

40|$|Rationale: The {{majority}} of stroke patients are discharged home dependent on informal caregivers, usually family members, {{to provide assistance}} with activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, and toileting. Many caregivers feel unprepared for this role, and this may have a detrimental effect on both the patient and caregiver. Aims: To evaluate whether a structured, competency-based training programme for caregivers improves physical and psychological outcomes for patients and their caregivers after disabling stroke, and to determine if such a training programme is cost-effective. Design: A cluster randomized controlled trial. The trial aims to recruit 25 patient and caregiver dyads {{from each of the}} 36 participating stroke rehabilitation units. Stroke units have been randomized to either the intervention or control group with randomization stratified by geographical region and quality of care. The intervention is the <b>London</b> <b>Stroke</b> Carer Training Course developed and evaluated in a previous single-centre study. The <b>London</b> <b>Stroke</b> Carer Training Course comprises a number of caregiver training sessions and competency assessment delivered while the patient is in the hospital and one follow-up session after discharge.

40|$|Stroke is {{the most}} common cause of {{long-term}} disability, and there are no known drug therapies to improve recovery after stroke.

Hypoxic–ischemic stroke is a well-established <b>stroke</b> <b>model,</b> but behavioral recovery in this model is not well described.

40|$|Abstract—Engineering return <b>stroke</b> <b>models</b> can be {{categorized}} either as current generation (traveling current source type) mod-els or current propagation (transmission line type) models. The current generation models are described among other parame-ters by a corona current distributed along the channel. Recent studies {{show that there is}} equivalence between the models of cur-rent generation and current propagation types. Due to this equiv-alence, any engineering return <b>stroke</b> <b>model</b> of current propaga-tion type can be described in terms of an equivalent corona cur-rent per unit channel length. The measurements conducted within 10 – 500 m from triggered lightning flashes show that the electric field of subsequent return strokes at these distances flattens within 15 µs or so. In this paper, the constraints imposed by this feature on the temporal and spatial variation of the equivalent corona current are investigated. The results show that in order for the close fields to flatten within 15 µs or so, the equivalent corona current, should be bipolar and the corona current wave shape at late times should be identical to that of the longitudinal current time derivative. This is in contrast to most of the engineering models of current generation type, in which the corona current is assumed to be unipolar.
