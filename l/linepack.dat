30|$|The {{mismatch}} in timeline brings uncertainties to {{the available}} fuel amount in gas-powered generation units and further affects the reliable {{operation of the}} coupled gas and electricity network. One solution to offset the fluctuating gas demand is by gas storage, e.g. <b>linepack.</b> As the most promising gas storage method, <b>linepack</b> is replenished when injections are larger than demands, and <b>linepack</b> is consumed when injections are lower than demands.|$|E

40|$|Gas {{transmission}} systems operate most fuel efficiently if {{they operate}} {{at a steady}} flow rate. Customers often use gas at rate s which swing widely daily, and this decreases system fuel efficiency. It is standard practice to manage line pack to attempt to lessen fuel usage in such cases.

30|$|With growing global {{concerns}} for climate change, {{natural gas is}} drawing increasing attentions these years as an important type of clean fuel. Given the worldwide carbon pricing policies, increasing GPG units are built {{to cope with the}} urgent requirement for natural gas. A variety of planning issues may hence rise in regard to the reliability and security of transmission networks. Therefore, it is necessary to co-plan the GPG units with power systems in an integrated manner. An integrated ECP for natural gas and power system is proposed in this paper, which is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear problem. The objective of the proposed approach is to find the best augmentation plan with the minimum cost. In addition, the variations of <b>linepack</b> are simulated to compensate the timeline mismatch of natural gas and electricity.|$|E
30|$|The {{natural gas}} market usually {{consists}} of two parts: ① the financial market, {{which is based on}} transactions of future contracts; ② the physical market, which involves cash flows for the actual gas deliveries at the specific delivery points [9]. As a supplement to forward contract portfolios, in Australia’s market structure, a day-ahead market completes daily gas trading [28]. Normally, gas is dispatched in cost-order from the cheapest to the most expensive sources until load is satisfied [9]. Gas prices are determined on the preceding day by market participants, on the basis of localized supply and demand conditions, while other impacts such as exporting and international trading are not considered in this paper. As the time intervals for trading and delivering gas and power are inconsistent, the fluctuating gas demand for GPG needs to be offset by stored gas, e.g. <b>linepack</b> [28]. Stored gas can also reduce the price volatility in gas markets.|$|E

Relevant mission objectives and operating conditions are stated to define the stray light problem. Since SABER is an earth limb viewing sensor, the telescope must be designed for large off-axis rejection. Described are the key design features which make the instrument well suited for its mission. Representative point source transmittance (PST) curves computed using the commercial stray light program APART are presented.

40|$|Wind {{power is}} {{expected}} to be the major element of renewable electricity generation in Great Britain (GB) by 2020 with a capacity of around 30 Â GW. The potential impact of a large amount of wind generation on the GB gas network was investigated using a combined gas and electricity network model. The varying nature of gas and electric power flows, network support facilities such as gas storage and compressors, and the power ramping characteristics of various power plants were considered. Three case studies were modelled, one case uses the existing network and the other two make use of a hypothesised network in 2020 with two distinct levels of wind generation representing low and high wind periods. The simulation results show that a large penetration of wind generation will influence the electricity generation mix as the wind power varies. Gas-fired generation is used to compensate for wind variability. This will cause increased flows and compressor power consumption on the gas network. <b>Linepack</b> depletion during low wind periods was shown to limit the ability of the gas network to fully supply gas-fired generators.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} share of variable renewable generation, balancing electric powersystems {{could become a}} major concern for system operators because of their variableand hardly predictable nature. However, gas technologies appear as a solutionto provide this flexibility, but the impacts on the gas power system have hardly beeninvestigated. In this thesis, consulting reports on the subject matter, regulator suggestions andgas-electricity interaction models in scientific literature are studied and four sourcesare identified {{to be used for}} balancing: <b>linepack,</b> storage facilities, liquefied natural gasand intraday gas supply from adjacent areas. Then, a gas-electricity model for flexibility supply is designed and three case studies are simulated in order to analyze bothgas and electric power systems’ behaviors. In these case studies, electricity generation,contribution of gas sources and costs are analysed. The study concludes that critical situations on gas market that can occur, e. g. incases of large variation in the net electricity demand and limited availability of linepackand storage facilities, the need of intraday modulation can exceed the possibilities toprovide for it. Then, gas cannot be supplied to power plants during peak periods, andmore gas than necessary is used during off-peak periods. The case studies also showthat day-ahead forecast errors in variable renewable generation can be handled mucheasier than variations by the gas system but leads to higher costs...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas {{flows in}} {{pipelines}} {{as a consequence}} of the pressure difference at the inlet and outlet. Adjusting these pressures makes it possible to inject natural gas at one rate and withdraw at a different rate, hence using the pipeline as storage as well as transport. We study the value of using the so called pipeline <b>linepack</b> as a short-term gas storage and how this functionality may offset the discrepancy between the low flexibility in take-or-pay contracts and the high inherent flexibility of a gas fired power plant. To value the storage option, we consider a cycling power plant facing volatile power prices while purchasing gas on a take-or-pay contract. We estimate a Markov regime-switching model for power prices and a mean reverting jump diffusion model for gas prices. Applying Least Squares Monte Carlo simulation to the operation of the power plant, we find that the storage option indeed has significant value for the plant, enabling it to better exploit the sometimes extreme price fluctuations. Finally, we show how power price volatility and jump frequency are the main value drivers, and that the size of the storage increases the value up to a point where no additional flexibility is used. ...|$|E
40|$|Loyola de Palacio Programme on Energy PolicyThis paper {{analyses}} {{the value}} and cost of line-pack flexibility in liberalized gas markets through {{the examination of the}} techno-economic characteristics of gas transport pipelines and the trade-offs between the different ways to use the infrastructure: transport and flexibility. Line-pack flexibility is becoming increasingly important as a tool to balance gas supply and demand over different periods. In the European liberalized market context, a monopolist unbundled network operator offers regulated transport services and flexibility (balancing) services according to the network code and the balancing rules. Therefore, gas policy makers should understand the role and consequences of line-pack regulation. The analysis shows that the line-pack flexibility service has an important economic value for the shippers and the TSO. Furthermore, the analysis identifies distorting effects in the gas market due to inadequate regulation of line-pack flexibility: by disregarding the fixed cost of the flexibility in the balancing rules, the overall efficiency of the gas system is decreased. Because a full market based approach to line-pack pricing is unlikely, a framework is presented to calculate a cost reflective price for pipeline flexibility based on the trade-offs and opportunity costs between the right to use the <b>linepack</b> flexibility and the provision of transport services...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne {{option to}} decarbonise {{residential}} {{heat in the}} UK is to convert the existing natural gas networks to deliver hydrogen. We review the technical feasibility of this option using semi-structured interviews underpinned by a literature review and we assess the potential economic benefits using the UK MARKAL energy systems model. We conclude that hydrogen can be transported safely in the low-pressure pipes but we identify concerns over the reduced capacity {{of the system and}} the much lower <b>linepack</b> storage compared to natural gas. New hydrogen meters and sensors would have to be fitted to every building in a hydrogen conversion program and appliances would have to be converted unless the government was to legislate to make them hydrogen-ready in advance. Converting the gas networks to hydrogen is a lower-cost residential decarbonisation pathway for the UK than those identified previously. The cost-optimal share of hydrogen is sensitive to the conversion cost and to variations in the capital costs of heat pumps and micro-CHP fuel cells. With such small cost differentials between technologies, the decision to convert the networks will also depend on non-economic factors including the relative performance of technologies and the willingness of the government to organise a conversion program...|$|E
30|$|The {{majority}} of the research in the gas system focuses on simplifications of the nonlinear equations that govern the physics of gas flow {{as well as the}} general representation of the technical components (e.g. compressor model) of the gas transmission system. A current useful and efficient way to alleviate the burden of the nonconvex MINLP gas problem is the application of mixed integer linear programming techniques for piecewise linearization. In this way, the nonlinear formulation is approached by approximated linearized functions that render the problem as a MIP, which enables the computation of global optima within fast execution times. The most comprehensive article that studies the advantages and drawbacks of various MIP formulations for the gas optimization problem is [5], where different piecewise linearization approaches are tested for different test cases in both dynamic and stationary conditions in order to derive conclusions about the more accurate and faster approximations. Based on the results, the authors argue about the effectiveness of the incremental method and further apply it in [6] and [7] in order to linearize the transient flow equations for a combined electricity-gas model that is applied on the Belgian high-calorific gas network, where the effects of initial <b>linepack</b> in system operation are examined. A simpler linearization approach can be seen in [8] and [9] for a stochastic unit commitment and a combined optimal power flow model, respectively. Simple electricity-gas conversion factors are applied to all studies and the compressor machine modeling is also reduced to a compression factor. The incremental method is again applied in [10] for stationary gas flow within a large decomposition framework.|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources into existing electric power systems is connected with an increased interdependence between natural gas and electric power transmission networks. To analyse this interdependence {{and its impact on}} security of supply, we developed a novel combined dynamic simulation and optimization model and implemented it into the simulation package SAInt (Scenario Analysis Interface for Energy Systems), the first published software application that allows the combined simulation of gas and electric power systems in a single time frame and simulation environment. The model is composed of a transient hydraulic simulation model for the gas system and an augmented AC-Optimal Power Flow model for the electric power system, which includes a model for dispatchable power system loads and considers time transitional constraints, such as the ramp rate and the start-up time of generation units. Both models take into account the control and constraints of the most relevant facilities present in both systems. The bidirectional interconnection between both systems is considered and established by coupling equations describing the fuel gas offtake for power generation in gas fired power plants, and the electric power supply to LNG terminals and electric driven compressors in gas compressor stations. The resulting system of equations for the combined model are solved in a single simulation time frame. In order to quantify the impact of different contingencies on the operation of the combined system, a number of security of supply parameters are proposed, which can be utilized to compare the impact of different contingencies on security of supply and the efficiency of countermeasures to mitigate this impact. The capabilities of the combined model and the functionality of the simulation tool are demonstrated in a case study of a sample gas and power transmission system. Results indicate how the combined simulation can give insight into important and critical information, such as the timing and propagation of contingencies cascading from one system to the other or the grace period to react to disruptions. Such information can contribute to improving the coordination between gas and power transmission system operators in the event of disruptions, thus, increasing the resilience and the level of security of supply in the combined energy system. The information provided by the combined model cannot be obtained by the traditional co-simulation approach, where both systems are solved in different time frames. Furthermore, the studies stress the importance of using transient gas simulation models for security of supply analysis instead of steady state models, where the time evolution of gas pressure and <b>linepack</b> are not reflected appropriately.

40|$|Natural gas {{presently}} provides {{nearly one}} quarter of New Zealandʼs primary energy and, since the production started at the Maui gas field over twenty years ago, the quantity of gas used in electricity generation has more than doubled, with about {{one quarter of}} electricity demand now generated from natural gas. Gas {{has proven to be}} a competitive and versatile thermal fuel in the industrial, commercial and residential markets and is a necessary and reliable complement to renewable resources in electricity generation. Underpinning the attractiveness of gas is efficient and cost-effective combustion and generation technology and a highly reliable system of supply. Gas is supplied from the production and processing facilities in Taranaki to the principal gasfired power stations through a high-pressure transmission system. Whilst this system has operated to a high level of reliability since the 1970 ʼs, it does not have built into its design 1 the reliability criteria, such as N- 1, applied in electricity transmission networks whereby the loss of a linkage within the system will not cause a failure elsewhere. The reliability of the gas transmission system can be ascribed to its engineering and operational competence rather than the availability of back-up supplies through the design of the network layout. The few failures in gas supplies which have occurred have generally been of short duration and caused by damage to the transmission pipelines, such as washout by flooding or impact by digging machinery operating adjacent to the buried pipeline. Unlike the electricity transmission network, there is some storage capacity within the gas system as the gas is transmitted at high pressure (up to 86 bar) and consumers can be supplied for some time as the gas decompresses in the pipeline downstream of the damage. During the washout of the Hawkes Bay pipeline in 2004, there was sufficient compressed gas, or <b>linepack,</b> in the pipeline to supply the residential gas market for the week the pipeline was out of operation. However, larger industrial consumers could not receive gas during this period. Government and the gas industry is aware of this potential vulnerability to gas supplies and, through the Gas Industry Company, is replacing existing industry arrangements for dealing with critical contingencies with regulations under the Gas Act. The resulting Gas Governance (Critical Contingency Management) Regulations 2008 include, inter alia, the appointment of a critical contingency operator, the preparation of critical contingency management plans, and curtailment arrangements to reduce gas supply to consumers. They are intended to permit the more efficient management of situations when gas supply is affected by short-term production outage or physical problems with the transmission system which the market proves unable to manage although they do not specify a maximum period for which the contingency arrangements will be applied. One of CAENZʼs principal areas of activity is developing a more thorough understanding of the resilience of New Zealand infrastructure to natural hazards and the inter-dependencies between any vulnerabilities and the wider economy. The natural gas supply system is a significant part of this infrastructure and little publicized work has been undertaken to investigate the impact of sustained failures within the supply system on gas availability and the consequent impact on gas consumers, in particular the electricity generators which have a wider impact on electricity consumers. This lack of investigation is due in part to the high level of reliability of gas supplies. Whilst gas supplies may be crucial to many commercial and industrial consumers, relatively few have back-up measures in place to replace gas if it were not available. In some cases this is because the consumersʼ operations require the particular properties of natural gas but in most cases it is due to the costs of making provision for back-up fuels which is deemed unnecessary given the high reliability of natural gas supply. However, this is not to say that situations cannot occur which result in a sustained shortfall of gas supplies. It is the intention of this investigation to provide a better understanding of the impact of breakdowns in the gas supply system on the availability of gas to consumers and the consequent impact on their operations. Specific attention is given to the impact of gas availability on electricity generation and the interplay between gas and electricity demand when gas is in short supply...|$|E
