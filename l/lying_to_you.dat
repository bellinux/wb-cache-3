[...] Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: [...] "They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath {{are in the same}} league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary." [...] On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: [...] "The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come." [...] Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that [...] "Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre".|$|E
2500|$|According to Gomez, one of {{the main}} inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos {{surfaced}} online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015. [...] Many claimed she gained weight, with some news outlets going as far as to label her a [...] "mess", and suggested Gomez was [...] "going off the deep end". She commented: [...] "I was getting a lot of hate for my body and ‘you’re gaining weight,’ and so I was in Mexico and I was just feeling all of this stuff and I would be <b>lying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> if I said it didn’t kind of hurt my feelings, but I kind of channeled that into my music." [...] Gomez called the experience [...] "degrading", explaining that she had never been through intense bullying before.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{instance of}} life imitating art {{to have been}} called a Perry Mason moment in retrospect occurred in a 1983 Maryland trial. Harlow Brian Sails was accused of murdering an off-duty Prince George's County police officer while robbing a jewelry store a year earlier with three accomplices. All {{of them had been}} sentenced to life for both crimes when Sails' trial began. Conflicting eyewitness testimony cast what could have been reasonable doubt on Sails' role in the crime. He denied the charges, but recanted on cross-examination and confessed to the murder while on the witness stand.

[...] Dillon demanded a trade {{at the end of the}} 2003 season after throwing most of his gear to the fans during the last home game of the season. He went on to win a Super Bowl with the New England Patriots in the following season.|$|E

However, Singerman was concerned because Lemmy's speech was [...] "getting bad" [...] {{and took him to}} a brain scan. On 26 December the doctor came into Lemmy's apartment, [...] "brought the results and told us all that he has two to six months to live". Lemmy reacted calmly. [...] "He took it better than all of us", said Singerman. [...] "His only comment was, 'Oh, only two months, huh?' The doctor goes, 'Yeah, Lem, I don't want to bullshit you. It's bad, and there's nothing anyone can do. I would be <b>lying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> if I told you there was a chance.'" [...] Plans were made to treat Lemmy at home. A video game console at the Rainbow Bar and Grill that Lemmy loved to play was brought to his apartment. On 28 December 2015, he spent hours on the console, and Rainbow owner Mikael Maglieri paid a visit. Lemmy died in his sleep later that day.|$|E
