Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined {{that the quality of}} African American petty officers at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for the enlisted men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers at Port Chicago considered the enlisted men unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.|$|E

It {{occupied}} converted naval premises until a clubhouse was built, which was opened in June 2005 by the Princess Royal. £7.85 million of funding for the project was donated by charities, individuals and local councils; the National Lottery donated £3 million in 2003, and the South West Regional Development Agency added £3.34 million. The academy's aims are to promote the sport of sailing at all <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and ability, through courses, training and events, and {{to contribute to the}} economic regeneration of the area. Since opening it has created a demand in service and marine industries worth around £10 million. WPNSA continues to promote sailing to local schools, offering benefits such as free boat hoist and storage. Use of the facilities and access to training is open to anyone in return for an annual membership fee. On 6 July 2005, London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the WPNSA was chosen to host the sailing events.|$|E

40|$|The local {{politicians}} in Sweden {{are responsible for}} {{a great deal of}} the welfare system why one would assume that there are a lot of demands put on them - demands for certain skills or a certain <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> I have in this study tried to find out how the demands on the local representatives concerning the demands for competence and the actual <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> among the politicians are affecting the local politics. This was done through investigating how the {{local politicians}} are perceiving their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and the demands put on them, but also how the employees are perceiving the demands and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> put on the politicians. The study was made in the municipality of Gislaved in Southern Sweden. I was using both quantitative method (an opinion poll among the politicians and employees in the municipality) and qualitative method (interviews with three politicians and three employees and literature studies). In order to investigate the demands for competence I split the concept into “soft” competence (socially and emotionally based skills), and “hard” competence (skills based on knowledge, education and experience). The demands for competence mentioned in the opinion-poll are both “soft” and “hard”: 62 % of the employees put demands <b>of</b> “hard” <b>competence</b> skills on the politicians. 61 % of the politicians put demands <b>of</b> “soft” <b>competence</b> skills on themselves. The interviewed respondents say that certain skills are needed for a certain political mission. I consider the demands for competence as rather high according to the result. The local politicians are not, according to the opinion-poll, having the appropriate competence skills, though many of the respondents (56) answered that they have the competence to a certain degree. It is also noticeable that 33 out of 81 persons say that the employees are only having the competence needed to a certain degree. I consider the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> among the local politicians rather low according to the result. The results from the investigations of the demands for <b>competence</b> and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> were put into a model with different outcomes depending on if the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and the demands for competence are high or low. The result from high demands for <b>competence</b> and a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> not answering fully to those demands is that these high demands of political skills may put a pressure on the politicians, which may lead to a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> an increased quality on the local politics, create a higher degree of confidence in the politicians from the society and an increased interest in political participation, but the high demands could also lead to a feeling of incompetence among the politicians, and that less people will take interest in participating in politics as they wont consider themselves having the demanded skills. So increased demands <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> may lead to both quality and elitism. The non-existing demands <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> today supports increased amateurism among the local decision makers, and an increase in the rule of experts. If a number of demands would be formalized they could on the other hand create barriers for marginalized groups participation in politics...|$|R

40|$|Paper purpose: The aim of {{the present}} {{communication}} is to propose a procedure to assess the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> achieved by graduates. Design/methodology/theoretical approach: We propose to use a quality assurance procedure to assess and improve the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> achieved by graduates. Findings: Graduate students should exhibit hard competences -specific knowledge-in their field of study and, also soft or transversal competences that provide complementary abilities to use the former in any specific environment. Social responsibility is among the list <b>of</b> transversal <b>competences.</b> We found that transversal competences are difficult to assess. The method we propose provides a clear idea <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> acquired.

40|$|Background: Nurses’ self {{awareness}} <b>of</b> {{their own}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>competence</b> {{is essential in}} maintaining high standards of care and identifying areas of educational need and professional development. Self-assessment is a method for measuring clinical competence, and encourages nurses to use reflective thinking and take {{an active part in}} the learning process. Although nurse competence may vary between hospitals, very few studies have been done on this subject. Methods: In this cross sectional study, we analyzed clinical competency of 190 registered nurses working in different hospitals in Bushehr by self assessment method. The instrument for data collection was a valid and reliable questionnaire consisting of 73 items from seven categories which were devised from Benner's “from Novice to Expert” framework. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> was assessed on a scale of 0 - 100 and the frequency of using the competencies was assessed on a Likert scale. Results: the nurses reported their overall <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> as “good” (51 - 75). They felt more competent in the categories of “managing situations” and “helping role” (with maximum score of 79. 54) and least competent in “teaching – coaching” and “ensuring quality” categories (with minimum score of 61. 15). The frequency of practicing competencies had a positive correlation with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> nursing clinical <b>competence.</b> Conclusion: The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>competence</b> and frequency <b>of</b> using competencies varied in different hospitals. Although the nurses reported their overall <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> as good, we should be concerned about 24 % of competencies which are not used by the nurses, especially in "teaching – coaching" and "ensuring quality" categories...|$|R
