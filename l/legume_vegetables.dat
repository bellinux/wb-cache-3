40|$|Hyaline rings with admixed multinucleated giant cells {{characterize}} pulse granulomas; {{the term}} pulse refers to edible seeds of <b>legume</b> <b>vegetables.</b> The etiology has been controversial, with theories including vascular degenerative changes or {{a reaction to}} vegetable material; ultrastructural studies and experimentally induced lesions in animals favor the latter. This lesion is typically seen in the oral cavity, with only rare reports in the gastrointestinal tract and gallbladder. We herein describe five cases of pulse granulomas identified in these sites. All cases contained foreign-body giant cells and vegetable debris within or near hyaline rings. Pulse granulomas may form mass lesions but are usually an incidental finding on microscopic examination. In incidentally detected cases, recognition of pulse granulomas can suggest a mural abscess, fistula, or perforation of the gut, findings {{which may not be}} grossly apparent. The presence of vegetable material in all five cases further supports an exogenous pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Greece, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Nisso Chemical Europe GmbH to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance acetamiprid in purslane, <b>legume</b> <b>vegetables</b> and pulses (beans and peas). In order to accommodate the intended uses of acetamiprid, Greece proposed to raise the existing MRLs of acetamiprid from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in purslane, from 0. 01 * mg/kg in peas (with pods) and 0. 06 mg/kg in beans (with pods) to 0. 5 mg/kg, from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 0. 05 mg/kg in beans (without pods) and from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 1 mg/kg in pulses (dry beans and peas). Greece drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 15 mg/kg on beans (with pods), 0. 4 mg/kg on peas (with pods), 0. 07 mg/kg on beans (without pods), 0. 15 mg/kg on peas (without pods) and 0. 07 mg/kg on pulses (dry beans and peas); these MRL proposals reflect the intended uses in southern EU only. In addition, a MRL proposal for purslane (3 mg/kg) was derived by extrapolation from trials on lettuce. A deficiency was noted in some trials concerning the storage conditions of the samples prior analysis. Information needs to be provided to confirm that samples were effectively stored under conditions for which integrity of residues is demonstrated. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of acetamiprid in the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values...|$|E
