50|$|The {{variator}} pulley of an iCVT is choked {{using two}} small choking pulleys. Here one choking <b>pulley</b> is positioned <b>on</b> the tense {{side of the}} chain of the iCVT. Hence there is a considerable <b>load</b> <b>on</b> that choking <b>pulley,</b> the magnitude of which {{is proportional to the}} tension in its chain. Each choking pulley is pulled up by two chain segments, one chain segment to the left and one {{to the right of the}} choking pulley; here if the two chain segments are parallel to each other, then the <b>load</b> <b>on</b> the choking <b>pulley</b> is twice the tension in the chain. But since the two chain segments are most likely not parallel to each other during operations of an iCVT, it is estimated that the <b>load</b> <b>on</b> a choking <b>pulley</b> is between 1 and 1.8 times of the tension of its chain.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} {{the influence of the}} loading condition (concentric vs. eccentric <b>loading)</b> <b>on</b> the <b>pulley</b> system of the finger. For this purpose 39 cadaver finger (14 hands, 10 donors) were fixed into an isokinetic loading device. The forces in the flexor tendons and at the fingertip were recorded. In the concentric loading condition A 2 and A 4 ruptures as well as alternative events such as fracture of a phalanx or avulsion of the flexor tendons were almost equally distributed, whereas the A 2 pulley rupture was the most common event (59 %) in the eccentric loading condition and alternative events were rare (23. 5 %). The forces in the deep flexor tendon, the fingertip and in the pulleys were significantly lower in the eccentric loading condition. As the ruptures occurred at lower loads in the eccentric than in the concentric loading condition it can be concluded that friction may be an advantage for climbers, supporting the holding force of their flexor muscles but may also increase the susceptibility to injury...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work closed form {{relationships}} {{for the power}} losses in rubber V-belt CVT are obtained, together with expressions for the axial thrust on both the driving and driven pulleys, starting fromsimple physical hypotheses. Losses have been grouped into threemain contributions: frictional sliding losses, longitudinal and lateral material hysteresis and frictional losses due to the engagement/disengagement of the belt at the entrance and exit from the pulleys. In {{order to keep the}} model simple and to obtain a closed form solution, circumferential slip is assumed to take place mainly in the driven pulley and the sliding angle is assumed constant along the sliding portion of the contact arc. Themodel was validated through comparisonwith experimental results obtained on a dedicated test bench capable of measuring the transmitted torques and the axial thrusts <b>on</b> both <b>pulleys,</b> the pulleys rotating speeds and the total belt tension. The sliding angle γ and the damping coefficient Ψ,which were introduced in the analytical relationships,were determined by a best fit procedure {{on the basis of the}} obtained experimental results. After having obtained those parameters, the model appeared to be capable of reproducing with a fairly satisfactory agreement the power losses, as well as the axial <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> the <b>pulleys,</b> which were obtained in different operating conditions; thus it is proposed as a useful tool for the design of this kind of transmission...|$|R
50|$|Damage to the flexor tendon pulleys that {{encircle}} {{and support}} the tendons that cross the finger joints {{is the most common}} finger injury within the sport (see climber's finger).The main culprit for pulley related injuries is the common crimp grip, especially in the closed position. The crimp grip requires a near ninety-degree flexion of the middle finger joint, which produces a tremendous force <b>load</b> <b>on</b> the A2 <b>pulley.</b> Injuries to the A2 pulley can range from microscopic to partial tears and, in the worst case, complete ruptures. Some climbers report hearing a pop, which might be a sign of a significant tear or complete rupture, during an extremely heavy move (e.g. tiny crimp, one- or two-finger pocket). Small partial tears, or inflammation can occur {{over the course of several}} sessions.|$|R
40|$|A {{manually}} operated impact-type machine for breaking cocoa pods was designed, fabricated and tested. The major {{components of the}} machine include a frame, rail, hammer, pulley, bearings and rope. The machine requires rope tension, tensile stress and cross sectional area of 128. 7 N, 728 kN/m 2, 1. 77 x 10 - 4 m 2 respectively. Impact energy of 30. 9 J is required to break one pod while 78. 6 J is required for five pods at a time. Hammer speed {{was determined to be}} 3. 13 m/s. The total <b>load</b> <b>on</b> the <b>pulley</b> shaft was 143. 52 N. The machine requires a shaft diameter of 14. 6 mm and a shaft of 15 mm was used. The machine has a power requirement of 201. 6 W. The pods used for testing the performance of the machine were classified into small (5. 00 – 6. 40 cm), medium (6. 50 – 8. 00 cm) and big (8. 10 – 9. 60 cm) sizes according to the dimension of their mid-diameters. The machine was tested using 1 to 4 pods per loading. The parameters measured for testing the performance of the machine include the average number of hammer drops/falls required to break the specified number of pods, time required to break the pods, number of broken pods per operation, machine capacity, percentage bean damage and machine functional efficiency. The machine had less than 1 % seed damage with its efficiency and capacity rangin...|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} the {{electric}} motors in the industrial and commercial sectors use belt drives. 1 Belt drives provide flexibility in the positioning of the motor relative to the load. Pulleys (sheaves) of varying diameters allow {{the speed of the}} driven equipment to be increased or decreased relative to the motor speed. A properly designed belt power-transmission system offers high efficiency and low noise, requires no lubrication, and presents low maintenance requirements. However, certain types of belts are more efficient than others, offering potential energy cost savings. The majority of belt drives use V-belts, which use a trapezoidal cross section to create a wedging action <b>on</b> the <b>pulleys</b> to increase friction and improve the belt’s power transfer capability. Joined or multiple belts are specified for heavy loads. V-belt drives can have a peak efficiency of 95 % or more at the time of installation. Efficiency is dependent <b>on</b> <b>pulley</b> size, pulley wear, V-belt alignment, transmitted torque, under or oversizing belts for load requirements. Efficiency can deteriorate by as much as 5 % over time if slippage occurs because the belt is not periodically retensioned. The most important operational and maintenance issue in a V-belt drive is its tension. I...|$|R
