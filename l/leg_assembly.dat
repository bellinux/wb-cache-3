40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation and fabricationof a bipedal humanoid system actuatedwith linear springsto producea standing equilibrium position. The humanoid system iscomprised of two <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{connected by a}} hip bracket. Elevenpairs of springs were attached to the system in locations designedto simulate themuscles and tendons in a humanbody. The assembly was modeled in the multi-body dynamicssimulation software SimWise 4 D. Simulations were performed to determine the springs’stiffnessand naturallengths using a top-down heuristicapproach. After a set of springs werefound to produce a good simulated stable position, theywere cross referenced to standard commercially-available parts. Afinalsimulation was then performed toverify that the real-world spring values produced astable system. Working in tandem with SimWise 4 D, the humanoid assembly was fabricated usingPLA plastic via an extrusion-type rapid prototyping machine. From {{the results of the}} simulation, theset of workingsprings were implementedonto the plasticmodel. After final modifications, the assembly then produced astanding equilibrium position. Finally, the assembly was perturbed in several directions to ensure that after the system experienced a displacement it wouldthen return to its original position...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{an automated}} crawling robot system including a platform, a first <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> a second <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{first and second}} rails attached to the platform, and an onboard electronic computer controller. The first <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> has an intermittent coupling device and the second <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> has an intermittent coupling device for intermittently coupling the respective first and second leg assemblies to a particular object. The first and second leg assemblies are slidably coupled to the rail assembly and are slidably driven by motors to thereby allow linear movement. In addition, the first <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> is rotary driven by a rotary motor to thereby provide rotary motion relative to the platform. To effectuate motion, the intermittent coupling devices {{of the first and}} second leg assemblies alternately couple the respective first and second leg assemblies to an object. This motion is done while simultaneously moving one of the leg assemblies linearly in the desired direction and preparing the next step. This arrangement allows the crawler of the present invention to traverse an object in a range of motion covering 360 degrees...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a pipe inspection instrument carriage for use with a pipe crawler or other locomotion means for performing internal inspections of piping surfaces. The carriage has a front <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> a rear <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> and a central support connecting the two assemblies and for mounting an instrument arm having inspection instruments. The instrument arm has means mounted distally thereon for axially aligning the inspection instrumentation and means for extending the inspection instruments radially outward to operably position the inspection instruments on the piping interior. Also, the carriage has means for rotating the central support and the front <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> {{with respect to the}} rear <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> so that the inspection instruments azimuthally scan the piping interior. The instrument carriage allows performance of all piping inspection operations with a minimum of moving parts, thus decreasing the likelihood of performance failure...|$|E

5000|$|The Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device (SLAMMD) was {{installed}} in the HRF-1 during Expedition 11. The SLAMMD measures the on-orbit mass of the crewmembers by applying Newton's second law of motion (force is equal to mass times acceleration). This device can measure a mass between 95 and 240 lb using the force generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer. Each spring {{is attached to a}} cam, which is also attached to a centrally located shaft with a flywheel mounted on top of it. The cam is designed such that, as the springs are stretched over a distance, a constant force is applied to the central shaft. A lanyard wrapped around the large flywheel is fed through a small slit on the SLAMMD front panel. The lanyard is latched onto the SLAMMD guiding arm, where the crewmember sits for a body mass measurement. Attached to the guiding arm is a <b>leg</b> support <b>assembly</b> around which the crew-member wraps his or her legs (as one would for a leg curl machine), a belly pad to help align the stomach, and a headrest.|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a pipe crawler having a midsection that provides the stability and flexibility to allow the pipe crawler to negotiate curved and uneven segments of piping while traveling through piping systems. The pipe crawler comprises a front <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> a rear <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> a midsection with a gimbal at each end for connecting the midsection {{to the front and}} rear leg assemblies in a flexible manner, and an air cylinder for changing the distance between the front and rear leg assemblies. The pipe crawler moves in ``inch worm`` fashion with the front and rear leg assemblies alternating between an extended and a retracted position as the air cylinder moves the retracted <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> forward. The midsection has a plurality of legs extending radially for holding the midsection within a maximum displacement from the piping axis so that the gimbals are not pivoted to extreme angles where they might lock up or seize. When the midsection is displaced sufficiently, its legs with wheels on each end engage the interior surface of the piping and prevent further displacement. Using two gimbals divides the angle between the planes defined by the front and rear leg assemblies which also helps to prevent excessive gimbal pivoting...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{principal}} differences between locomotion in granular soils using legs when compared with wheels is that the drag between the <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> and the regolith material provides additional thrust. Experimental work is presented which demonstrates that this additional force is substantial, and can significantly augment legged vehicle Drawbar Pull. The paper also demonstrates that the drag force depends in a highly non-linear manner on sinkage depth, and linearly on leg cross section yet is only weakly dependent on leg cross-sectional shape, leg material frictional properties, or leg velocity. Comparison with modelled forces using established wedge theory techniques demonstrates poor correlation between predicted and actual results; in contrast, a modelling approach based on {{an analysis of the}} dynamics of granular materials produces an excellent correlation with experimental results and enables the drag force to be accurately characterised by deriving a constant coefficient which is characteristic of the soil material. Future work will investigate the relationship between this characteristic coefficient and the physical properties of the soil material to develop a robust method of predicting the coefficient for any soil. © 2013 ISTVS.

50|$|The Continental {{was very}} {{striking}} visually, and had features not {{often found in}} keyboard instruments, both then and now. The most obvious of these was its reverse-coloured keys (black naturals and white sharps) similar to a harpsichord. Then the chrome Z-shaped bolt-on <b>leg</b> stand <b>assembly</b> and bright vermilion (in some models grey) top made for a very distinctive and handsome piece of equipment. The Vox Continental used six slider-type, metered volume controls called drawbars instead of the stop-tab rocker switches seen on other combo organs. Two of the drawbars controlled the voices (flute and reed tones), {{and three of the}} other four controlled the footages (in reference to ranks of pipes on a pipe organ, but were essentially successive octave controls; the lower the footage number, the higher the octaves were pitched (8 foot being one octave higher than 16 foot etc.), the last of the four controlling a mixture of four higher pitches. There was a single-speed, single intensity vibrato, but the Continental had no other special effects or bass notes. Its simplicity was appreciated by many players.|$|R
40|$|Maximal {{power output}} occurs when {{subjects}} perform ballistic exercises using loads of ~ 30 - 50 % of one-repetition maximum (1 -RM). However, performing 1 -RM testing prior to power measurement requires considerable time, especially when testing involves multiple exercises. Maximal isometric force (MIF), which requires substantially {{less time to}} measure than 1 -RM, might be an acceptable alternative for determining the optimal load for power testing. PURPOSE: To determine the optimal load based on MIF for maximizing dynamic power output during leg press and bench press exercises. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (12 men and 8 women; mean +/- SD age: 31 +/- 6 y; body mass: 72 +/- 15 kg) performed isometric leg press and bench press movements, during which MIF was measured using force plates. Subsequently, subjects performed ballistic leg press and bench press exercises using loads corresponding to 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, and 60 % of MIF presented in randomized order. Maximal instantaneous power was calculated during the ballistic exercise tests using force plates and position transducers. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Fisher LSD post hoc tests {{were used to determine}} the load(s) that elicited maximal power output. RESULTS: For the leg press power test, six subjects were unable to be tested at 20 % and 30 % MIF because these loads were less than the lightest possible load (i. e., the weight of the unloaded <b>leg</b> press sled <b>assembly</b> [31. 4 kg]). For the bench press power test, five subjects were unable to be tested at 20 % MIF because these loads were less than the weight of the unloaded aluminum bar (i. e., 11. 4 kg). Therefore, these loads were excluded from analysis. A trend (p = 0. 07) for a main effect of load existed for the leg press exercise, indicating that the 40 % MIF load tended to elicit greater power output than the 60 % MIF load (effect size = 0. 38). A significant (p. 0. 05) main effect of load existed for the bench press exercise; post hoc analysis indicated that the effect of load on power output was: 30 % > 40 % > 50 % = 60 %. CONCLUSION: Loads of 40 % and 30 % of MIF elicit maximal power output during dynamic leg presses and bench presses, respectively. These findings are similar to those obtained when loading is based on 1 -RM...|$|R
