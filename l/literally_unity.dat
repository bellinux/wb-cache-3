5000|$|Ex Unitate Vires (<b>literally</b> [...] "from <b>unity,</b> strength") is a Latin phrase {{formerly}} used as {{the national}} motto of South Africa. It was originally translated as [...] "Union is Strength" [...] but was later revised in 1961 to mean [...] "Unity is Strength". Its Dutch version is [...] "Eendracht maakt macht", itself a non-literal translation of [...] "in concordia res parvae crescunt", originally the motto of the Dutch Republic. That translation, along with its french counterpart - [...] "l'union fait la force" [...] - is also the current motto of Belgium. It was adopted in 1910 as the national motto but was replaced in 2000.|$|R
50|$|When ius means law, {{it usually}} has some {{semantic}} connection {{to what is}} right, just or straight. For instance, the German motto Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit (<b>literally</b> <b>Unity</b> and law and freedom)) has been translated as Unity and justice and freedom, {{even though there is}} a different word for justice (Gerechtigkeit). Lex does not have such a connection. Some translators of Kant's and Hegel's works have translated Recht as objective right (see Steiner, 2002, p. 276), although those works, especially Kant's, are just about law or, at most, about the best law.|$|E
