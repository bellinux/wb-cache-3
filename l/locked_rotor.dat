40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to design identification methods for identifying a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The whole identification and motor control is carried out in d-q coordinates, and the program used for processing and control was the matlab simulink, together with the real time platform DSpace. The work focuses on two main areas of identification, off-line identification and on-line identification. For offline identification the frequency analysis was used with the <b>lock</b> <b>rotor</b> test to get three main parameters. They are the quadrature and direct inductances and stator resistance. In the online mode, the identified parameters were extended to magnet flux _f identified by MRAS method. The remaining parameters were again identified by frequency analysis, which was adapted into online mode, and simultaneously applied to the identification of several part in one time. The next method is Newton method, which is used for estimating stator resistance of the motor, without the need to apply any signal...|$|R
40|$|The ZXBM 1021 {{is a high}} performance, low noise, single-phase, Direct Current Brushless (BLDC) motor pre-driver with {{variable}} PWM {{speed control}} and current control suitable for fan and blower motors. For system flexibility the motor speed can be controlled by either an external PWM control signal or by a DC voltage signal from an external control voltage or from a Thermistor network. To prevent motor inrush current the device has a soft start feature. To help protect the motor coil, the ZXBM 1021 provides <b>rotor</b> <b>lock</b> protection which shuts down the output drive if <b>rotor</b> <b>lock</b> is detected. The device automatically re-starts with soft-start when the <b>rotor</b> <b>lock</b> is removed. The ZXBM 1021 monitors the motor current to provide a programmable over current limit. A Tachometer output {{is provided by the}} open collector output Frequency Generator (FG) pin which allows external interface to monitor motor rotation or speed. The FG output is the magnetic change frequency. The ZXBM 1021 is available in space saving and low profile U-QFN 4040 - 20 package.

When the armature is not turning (called <b>locked</b> <b>rotor)</b> there is no Back-EMF and the motor's current draw is quite high. If the motor's starting current is high enough it will pull the line voltage down enough to notice the dimming of the light.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of a synchronous motor {{is due to the}} interaction of the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor. Its stator winding, which consists of a 3 phase winding, is provided with a 3 phase supply, and the rotor is provided with a DC supply. The 3 phase stator winding carrying 3 phase currents produces 3 phase rotating magnetic flux (and therefore a rotating magnetic field). The <b>rotor</b> <b>locks</b> in with the rotating magnetic field and rotates along with it. Once the <b>rotor</b> <b>locks</b> in with the rotating magnetic field, the motor is said to be in synchronization. A single-phase (or two-phase derived from single phase) stator winding is possible, but in this case the direction of rotation is not defined and the machine may start in either direction unless prevented from doing so by the starting arrangements.|$|R
50|$|A blocked rotor test is {{conducted}} on an induction motor. It {{is also known}} as short circuit test, <b>locked</b> <b>rotor</b> test or stalled torque test. From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The blocked rotor torque test is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked rotor current test is conducted on squirrel cage rotor motors.|$|E
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A <b>locked</b> <b>rotor</b> condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

During the same period, rotor design was moving to composite blades that were much stronger than the older spar-and-stringer designs, which eliminated the need for the complex bearing system that relieved loads. Although the Derschmidt rotor still improved performance, it appeared the added complexity was not worthwhile.|$|R

This brake is a secondary means to hold the turbine at rest for maintenance, with a <b>rotor</b> <b>lock</b> system as primary means. Such brakes are usually applied only after blade furling and electromagnetic braking have reduced the turbine speed generally 1 or 2 rotor RPM, as the mechanical brakes can create a fire inside the nacelle if used to stop the turbine from full speed.

By <b>locking</b> the main <b>rotor</b> (and the power turbine) with the rotor brake, the engine could be spun up to operating speed, then lit, and when the engine core is at the operating speed of 10,500 rpm the brake is released and drive to the rotor smoothly increased as the power turbine gains speed. This was used to bring the rotor to speed from stationary in just 15 seconds and a time from engine start to take-off of only 30 seconds.|$|R
