Digital images are increasingly conveyed over vulnerable channels such as the Internet. Protecting digital product is going to become important issue to ensure the secure transmission of the digital items.

Also, The Block Truncation Coding (BTC) is one of the effective and real time application for data hiding. Most present BTC based watermarking methods cannot completely exploit visual perception of the cover images and do not obtain high data embedding rate. For more exploiting visual perception and high data embedding, an enhanced data hiding scheme based on BTC is proposed. In proposed method, considering the texture sub blocks and Least Significant Bits (LSBs of higher mean value and lower mean value) substitution combine together for designing improved the BTC watermarking scheme.

40|$|Abstract—Reminiscent of the parity {{function}} in network coding for the butterfly network, it is shown that forwarding an even/odd <b>indicator</b> <b>bit</b> for a scalar quantization of a relay observation recovers 1 {{bit of information}} at the two destinations in a noiseless interference channel where interference is treated as noise. Based on this observation, a coding strategy is proposed to improve the rate of both users {{at the same time}} using a relay node in a noisy interference channel. In this strategy, the relay observes a linear combination of signals sent by the two sources, and broadcasts a common message to the two destinations over a shared out-of-band link of constant rate R 0 bits per channel use. The relay message consists of the bin index of a structured binning scheme obtained from a 2 R 0 -way partition of the squared lattice in the complex plane. We show that such scalar quantization-binning relay strategy asymptotically achieves the cut-set bound in an interference channel with a common out-of-band relay link of limited rate, improving the sum rate by two bits for every bit relayed, asymptotically at high signal to noise ratios (SNR) and when interference is treated as noise. We then use low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes along with bit-interleaved coded-modulation (BICM) as a practical coding scheme for the proposed strategy. We consider matched and mismatched scenarios, depending on whether the input alphabet of the interference signal is known or unknown to the decoder, respectively. For the matched scenario, we show the proposed strategy results in significant gains in SNR. For the mismatched scenario, we show that the proposed strategy results in rate improvements that, without the relay, cannot be achieved by merely increasing transmit powers. Finally, we use generalized mutual information analysis to characterize the theoretical performance of the mismatched scenario and validate our simulation results. I...|$|R
