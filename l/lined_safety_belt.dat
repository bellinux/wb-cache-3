40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} trends in <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, {{and type of}} <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> law. METHODS: We analyzed Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data on <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use from 33 states for 1987 through 1993 and used linear regression models to determine trends in prevalence. RESULTS: Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics had the highest <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use among racial/ethnic groups. Prevalence varied little from age 25 through 64 years in all years, but averaged 25 percentage points higher in states with primary laws than in states with no <b>belt</b> laws. Overall <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use increased by an average 2. 7 +/- 0. 1 percentage points per year and varied little across most demographic groups, {{but there was no}} significant increase for Black males aged 18 through 29 years.

40|$|Background: The use of <b>safety</b> <b>belts</b> is {{the single}} most {{effective}} means of reducing fatal and nonfatal injuries in motor vehicle crashes. If all motor vehicle occupants consistently wore <b>safety</b> <b>belts,</b> an estimated 9553 deaths would have been prevented in 1999 alone. Methods: The Guide to Community Preventive Services’s methods for systematic reviews were used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} three interventions to increase <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use. Effectiveness was assessed on the basis of changes in <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use and number of crash-related injuries. Results: Strong evidence was found for the effectiveness of <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> laws in general and for the incremental effectiveness of primary <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> laws relative to secondary laws. Strong evidence for the effectiveness of enhanced enforcement programs for <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> laws was also found. Additional information is provided about the applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation of these interventions.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> use is 80 % nationally, {{yet only}} 63 % in Massachusetts. <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> use among {{potentially}} at-risk groups in Boston is unknown. We sought {{to assess the}} prevalence and correlates of belt non-use among emergency department (ED) patients in Boston. Methods A cross-sectional survey with systematic sampling was conducted on non-urgent ED patients age ≥ 18. A closed-ended survey was administered by interview. <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> use was defined via two methods: a single-item and a multiple-item measure of <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use. Each was scored using a 5 -point frequency scale. Responses were used to categorize <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use as 'always' or less than 'always'. Outcome for {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} was <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use less than 'always'. Results Of 478 patients approached, 381 (80 %) participated. Participants were 48 % female, 48 % African-American, 40 % White, median age 39. Among participants, 250 (66 %) had been in a car crash; 234 (61 %) had a valid driver's license, and 42 (11 %) had been ticketed for belt non-use. Using two different survey measures, a single-item and a multiple-item measure, <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use 'always' was 51 % and 36 % respectively. According to separate regression models, factors associated with belt non-use included male gender, alcohol consumption > 5 drinks in one episode, riding with others that drink and drive, ever receiving a citation for belt non-use, believing that <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use is 'uncomfortable', and that 'I just forget', while 'It's my usual habit' was protective.

All <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> and hand-held cellular phone use data were collected through direct observation while vehicles were stopped at intersections and freeway exit ramps in Michigan. Data were weighted to be representative of drivers during daylight hours in Michigan. Analyses included statistical comparisons of <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use rates and a logistic regression model to determine the effect of hand-held cellular phone use on <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use. The study found that <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use for drivers using a hand-held cellular phone was significantly lower than for drivers not using cellular phones. This same significant relationship was found within nearly all demographic categories analyzed. The logistic regression model showed that the odds of a hand-held cellular phone user not using a <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> was 1. 77 times that of a driver not using a cellular phone.

40|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>belts</b> are {{the most}} {{effective}} safety device in vehicles in terms of preventing injuries (1). Every year, <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage data across the nation is collected by the individual states, the District of Columbia, and U. S. territories in a probability-based observational survey. Using this survey, Massachusetts, a secondary seat belt law state, ranked last in <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage in 2008. This percentage was approximately a 2 percent decrease from 2007. This value was not an aberration as within the recent past, Massachusetts, a secondary <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> law state, has consistently ranked {{at or near the}} bottom of the 50 states. The foremost issue with <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage is the inherent disregard of the safety related benefits for both drivers and passengers, alike. While there is a significant amount of literature documenting the safety related benefits, there is still a need for continued study of the persistent attributes that are associated with those vehicle occupants who make the decision to not buckle up. The scope of this research encompasses the use of the collected data in the 2009 Massachusetts <b>Safety</b> <b>Belt</b> Usage Observation Study to determine what demographic variables; such as age, gender, race, occupant location, community median income, community population density, community education level, and combined demographics, are at high and low ends of the <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage spectrum.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relevance}} of non-specific <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use data for interventions to rural teens and to pilot a data collection project to provide more specific data to traffic safety stakeholders and educators in rural areas. Methods: Twelve high schools in Southeast Georgia were used for observed <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> data collection over a 16 month period. Observational surveys were conducted at the entrance to student parking lots of the studied schools in the morning or afternoon. Observers were trained and survey methods were standardized to maintain comparability between results. Results: Observational surveys revealed a <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage rate of 38. 6 % among high schools teens at the studied high schools. <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage rates ranged from 9. 5 % to 66. 9 %. Observed <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use for female vehicle occupants was 48. 4 % compared to 35. 6 % for males. Conclusion: The observational survey results from this study support research showing that rural teens have lower <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage rates than adults or urban teens. Despite efforts to target rural areas, programs must specifically target sub populations, especially rural male teens, in order to hold any traction. Because of the wide gap between measured <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use in rural Georgia (79. 9 %) and the studied rural high schools (38. 6 %), local program planners must assess actual <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage in their high risk rural teen population in order to use accurate metrics for intervention and education efforts.

40|$|This study {{examined}} parameters under which risk compensation in driving can occur following {{the use of}} <b>safety</b> <b>belts.</b> Risk compensation theories hypothesize that if individuals use <b>safety</b> <b>belts,</b> they will drive in a more risky manner than {{if they do not}} use <b>safety</b> <b>belts</b> due to an increased perception of safety. Although the existence of risk compensation in driving has been debated in the literature for many years, the current study was the first experimental analysis of this theory that permitted a controlled examination of both between-subject and within-subject effects. This study required subjects to drive a 5 -hp. go-kart around an oval track either buckled or unbuckled in the first of two phases of 15 driving trials. After the first phase the safety condition was switched for half the subjects (i. e., the <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> was removed from subjects using it or was used by subjects who previously did not use it). Dependent measures included latency for each lap, deviations from the prescribed lane, and perceived safety while driving. The amount of time it took for subjects to travel to the go-kart track and their <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use during that trip was also measured. Risk compensation theory was not supported in the between-subject analyses of the research data; however, some within-subject comparisons did demonstrate risk compensation. Subjects who switched from not using the <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> to using it increased driving speed during the second phase significantly more than subjects who used the <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> during both driving phases. The study suggested that the occurence of risk compensation is dependent upon individuals being able to compare the sensations using a <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> with those of not using a <b>safety</b> <b>belt.</b> Risk compensation did not manifest itself in between-subject studies because this comparison could not take place. The implications of this study to driving automobiles on multi-user roadways is discussed.
