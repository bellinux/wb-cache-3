5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a <b>long,</b> <b>dark</b> tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E

Yellowish-brown setae are plentiful on the cap surface, and consist of an elongated, hair-like segment up to 315μm long, attached to the surface by a bulbous base that is 3–9μm wide.|$|E
