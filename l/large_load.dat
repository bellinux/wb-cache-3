25|$|During the pre-war era, flying boats {{had been}} {{preferred}} for conducting long distance flights as, unlike their land-based counterparts, {{they were not}} limited by available runway length – the majority of which were still grass-surfaced at this point – and as a long range aeroplane {{would be required to}} carry a <b>large</b> <b>load</b> of fuel, a larger size of the aircraft could be permitted without needing to cater for factors such as limited runway and airfield sizes. In addition, for services to far-flung parts of the British Empire, the ability to land and take-off from any available area of water was a distinct advantage for services to such places, many of which at the time had no airport facilities at all. With the end of the Second World War, flying boats services were resumed with other types being operated, such as the Short Hythe, Short Sandringham, and Short Solent. However, the war had also produced a legacy of large runways and sizable airports formerly used for military purposes that could now meet the needs of a larger generation of land aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned, as the long-term survivability of floating structures {{has been successfully}} demonstrated by the marine and offshore oil industries over many decades. However, the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs {{have yet to be}} demonstrated for floating wind turbine platforms. For deepwater wind turbines, a floating structure will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines. The floating structure must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch, roll and heave motions within acceptable limits. The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water. Therefore, the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the floating structure and power distribution system, which are offset by higher offshore winds and close proximity to <b>large</b> <b>load</b> centres (e.g. shorter transmission runs).|$|E

25|$|In 1128 Suero twice {{got into}} a dispute with the monastery of Corias over {{a piece of land}} at Peñaullán. He {{appointed}} two of his own knights, Martín Martínez and Pedro Menéndez, to make an enquiry into the dispute and adjudicate it. On 1 February 1129 Suero and his brother Gutierre made exchange of properties. Later that year Suero and fellow Asturian Gonzalo Peláez were sent by the king to Almazán to negotiate with Alfonso the Battler, who still laid claim to the Leonese-Castilian throne. Gonzalo had long been a rival with Suero in western Asturias. In 1131 a monk of Corias was bringing a <b>large</b> <b>load</b> of wheat from León to Laciana through the lands governed by Suero when he was stopped by two of the count's officials and assessed a toll. He refused to pay it and the dispute became violent. Subsequently, Suero was forced by the monks of Corias to make an enquiry, appointing two of his knights, Pedro Garcés and Juan Pérez, with the task. Their finding was that a similar dispute had occurred between Corias and Suero's brother Gutierre during the reign of Alfonso VI, and that the king had ruled the monks owed no portazgo (tolls on cartage) within the tenencia of Laciana. Suero therefore renounced his right to the toll. In 1132 Suero again judged a lawsuits involving Corias.|$|E
500|$|Still about [...] {{behind the}} Frenchman, Grahame-White made a {{historic}} decision; {{he would make}} an unprecedented night flight. [...] Guided by the headlamps of his party's cars, he took off at 2:50am. [...] Within minutes of becoming airborne however, he almost crashed; while he was leaning forward to make himself comfortable, his jacket brushed the engine ignition switch and he accidentally turned the engine off, but he quickly corrected his error {{and was able to}} continue. [...] Using the lights of railway stations to guide his course through the pitch black night, within 40minutes he reached Rugby, and at 3:50am he passed Nuneaton. [...] Despite making good progress, Grahame-White was carrying a <b>large</b> <b>load</b> of fuel and oil, and his engine was not powerful enough to raise the aeroplane over the high ground before him. [...] Disappointed, he landed at Polesworth, about [...] from London, and only 10miles behind Paulhan. [...] A few minutes later the Frenchman, unaware of Grahame-White's progress, resumed his journey. [...] He passed Stafford at 4:45am, Crewe at 5:20am, and at 5:32am he landed at Barcicroft Fields near Didsbury, within five miles of the Manchester office of the Daily Mail, thereby winning the contest. [...] His party was taken by train to a civic reception, held by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. [...] Grahame-White was notified of Paulhan's success, and reportedly shouted [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, the £10,000 prize has been won by Louis Paulhan, the finest aviator that the world has ever seen. [...] Compared with him I am only a novice. [...] Three cheers for Paulhan!" [...] He retired to bed, leaving his mechanics to repair his aeroplane, and later sent Paulhan a telegram, congratulating his rival on his achievement. [...] Grahame-White attempted to resume his journey to Manchester, and reached Tamworth, but he later abandoned the flight.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{horse is}} heavily infested with parasites, dewormers {{must be given}} carefully. Small strongyles can form cysts {{embedded}} in the intestinal epithelium.

2500|$|The {{formation}} of Valles Marineris {{is thought to}} be closely tied with the {{formation of}} the Tharsis Bulge. The Tharsis Bulge was formed from the Noachian to Late Hesperian period of Mars, in three stages. [...] The first stage consisted of a combination of volcanism and isostatic uplift; soon, however, the volcanism loaded the crust to a point at which the crust could no longer support the added weight of Tharsis, leading to widespread graben formation in the elevated regions of Tharsis. Stage two consisted of more volcanism and a loss of isostatic equilibrium; the source regions of the volcanism no longer resided underneath Tharsis, creating a very <b>large</b> <b>load.</b> Finally, the crust failed to hold up Tharsis and radial fractures formed, including at Valles Marineris. Stage three mainly consisted of more volcanism and asteroid impacts. The crust, having already reached its failure point, just stayed in place and younger volcanoes formed. Tharsis volcanism involved very low viscosity magma, forming shield volcanoes {{similar to those of the}} Hawaiian Island chain, but, because there is minor or no current active plate tectonics on Mars, the hotspot activity led to very long histories of repeated volcanic eruptions at the same spots, creating some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system, including the biggest, Olympus Mons.|$|E
60|$|There {{were two}} great {{doors in the}} middle of the barn, made so large that, when they were opened, there was space enough for a <b>large</b> <b>load</b> of hay to go in. Opposite these doors there was a space floored over with plank, pretty wide, and {{extending}} through the barn to the back side. This was called the barn floor. On one side was a place divided off for stables for the horses, and on the other side was the tie-up, a place for the oxen and cows. There was also the bay, and the lofts for hay and grain; and at the end of the tie-up there was a door leading into a calf-pen, and thence, by a passage behind the calf-pen, to a work-shop and shed. The small door where the boys came in, led to a long and narrow passage, between the tie-up and the bay.|$|E

It is open to any man to say that his ship will sail without ballast; and he will say it, too, with every mark of profound conviction, especially if he is not going to sail in her himself. The risk of advertising her as able to sail without ballast is not great, since the statement does not imply a warranty of her arriving anywhere. Moreover, it is strictly true that most ships will sail without ballast for some little time before they turn turtle upon the crew.|$|E
