5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E

30|$|As {{positions}} disappear, {{the rate}} at which workers arrive at employers rises, but {{the rate at}} which workers find new vacancies drops. As noted above, the higher arrival rate of workers at vacancies <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> cost of discriminating, because a faster arrival of the next worker means less foregone output when a type B worker is turned away 14. This <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> cutoff value of c*, which in turn <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> value of search for type B workers relative to type A workers. A similar effect results from disproportionately more type A than type B workers losing jobs, raising the share of type A workers among <b>the</b> searchers and <b>lowering</b> <b>the</b> expected waiting time for the next type A applicant for firms who turn away type B workers. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> arrival rate of job offers to workers <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> value of search for both type A and type B workers, which <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> wage of both types; but it <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> value of search more for type A workers. This decreases the wage gap, but is a rather subtle, non-intuitive effect, as are the impacts of the many of the subsequent equilibrating reactions of the model’s variables to the initial events set in motion by a fall in x.|$|R

5|$|Alex Cox {{had tried}} to make a Mars Attacks film in the 1980s before Burton and Gems began {{development}} in 1993. When Gems turned in his first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski in an attempt to <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing the sound of a duck's quack.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.|$|E

5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} essential element of Pokémon gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon (other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured), the player may use a Poké Ball on the wild Pokémon. If successful, the Pokémon {{will be added to}} the player's active party (or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pokémon in his/her party). Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP (and/or status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep,) of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used: the <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.|$|E
5|$|At the time, HBO {{made their}} {{commitments}} {{for only one}} year at a time, a third season would have meant opening up a new two-season book in Daniel Knauf's six-year plan, including {{the introduction of new}} storylines for current and new characters, and further clarification and elaboration on the show's mythology. HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005. HBO's president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> price of an episode to US$2million; but the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.|$|E

After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> coffin simultaneously with the chime of bells.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Burton set Mars Attacks! up with Warner Bros. and {{the studio}} {{purchased}} the film {{rights to the}} trading card series on his behalf.
