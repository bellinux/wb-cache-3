5|$|Yaish's {{four-year}} term legally expired in December 2009. While {{elections in the}} West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled due to Fatah's lack of agreement on <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates.</b> Nablus {{was one of the}} most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor Ghassan Shakaa and one headed by Amin Makboul.|$|E
5|$|Despite the police-backed intervention, the {{university}} continued on strike. The appointed institute heads failed {{to break the}} stalemate between internal and external forces, and by early 1982, discussions begun on a new <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates</b> to the rectorship. Eventually, José Aristodemo Pinotti, a former dean of the School of Medical Sciences generally considered a moderate, was selected by the academic community and accepted by the governor. In the following week, on April 19, 1982, the intervention was lifted, and academic activities resumed normally.|$|E
30|$|For the {{semi-automatic}} term extraction in this project, the NSP {{package was}} used to generate <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> terms (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, quadrigrams, and pentagrams).

In the sequence, such <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> terms were manually cleaned by a linguist, {{as well as a}} posteriori validation <b>of</b> the <b>candidates</b> by a domain expert. As a result, it is expected to obtain validated terms that will integrate the area glossary.|$|R

In each case, 500 endorsements are required for an election list to become valid. The lists may be supported by one or more political parties, or by a group of voters as an independent list. No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Parliament of Norway {{are elected}} based on party-list {{proportional}} representation in plural member constituencies. This means that representatives from different political parties are elected from 19 constituencies, which are {{identical to the}} 19 counties. The electorate does not vote for individuals but rather for party lists, with a ranked <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates</b> nominated by the party. This means that the person {{on top of the}} list will get the seat unless the voter alters the ballot. Parties may nominate candidates from outside their own constituency, and even Norwegian citizens currently living abroad.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{substantial}} {{revision of the}} election law came in February 2015, and was partially upheld by the Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not only for a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates,</b> but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected {{as if it was}} an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E

5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the Franco-African Community {{constitutional}} referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. Legislative elections were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de Liste voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates</b> who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the months that followed, the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M'ba, now President of Gabon, decided to dissolve the Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.|$|E
5|$|Any Croatian citizen {{over age}} 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that {{a sufficient number of}} endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation on the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates,</b> or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Opus Dei's highest {{assembled}} {{bodies are}} the General Congresses, {{which are usually}} convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses {{for the men and}} women's branch of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates</b> chosen by their female counterparts. After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing his}} {{position}} in parliament, Folkvord went through a short-period of obscurity. He once again earned media attention when he publicly denounced the Lund Commission. The commission revealed there had been extensive surveillance of Norwegian communists, socialists and other radicals by the Norwegian Police Security Service. Folkvord demanded to be shown his own documentation created during the surveillance. In 1999 Folkvord topped his party's <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates</b> running for {{a seat in the}} City Council. Folkvord was successful and earned a seat on the City Council while the party noted an increase of 1.3%. Folkvords main goal during the campaign was to earn a third seat for the Red Electoral Alliance, he failed to do so though the party held its two seats on the City Council. The party earned 2% and 2.1% of the vote in the county and municipal elections of 1999.|$|E
5|$|Gellibrand was {{initially}} educated at Crespigny Preparatory School at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. In 1883 {{the family moved}} to Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, where he continued his education before completing it at the King's School, Canterbury in 1888 and 1889. After a visit to Tasmania with his mother and sister Annie in 1891, he returned to Frankfurt-am-Main in September 1891 to study for the entrance exam to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In Frankfurt he met and courted Elizabeth Helena Breul, known as Elsie to her family, who would later become his wife. He passed the entrance exam, topping the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates,</b> which was published on 17 August 1892, and entered on 1 September. He graduated {{at the top of his}} class of 87 on 18 October 1893, and was awarded the General Proficiency Sword for gaining the highest aggregate marks in the final exams. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the South Lancashire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's Volunteers) on 21 October 1893, and was posted to its 1st Battalion, then on garrison duty in Birr, County Offaly, in Ireland.|$|E

Since DTW can become computational intensive in large datasets the proposed method manages to significantly prune the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> words thus, speeding up the entire process.

5|$|Once the {{candidate}} cities are selected, they must {{submit to the}} IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file.

During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that {{it will be able to}} fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidates</b> is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running.
