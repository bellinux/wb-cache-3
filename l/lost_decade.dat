25|$|In the 1990s, a {{time period}} {{also known as}} the <b>Lost</b> <b>Decade,</b> the {{economic}} prosperity Japan had experienced came to a halt when Japan’s bubble economy collapsed. This period was characterized by a number of economic issues, an aging population, high unemployment rates, and lack of stable lifetime careers. These events translate into Sakate’s works through his criticisms of society’s issues.|$|E

He recommended pursuing aggressive fiscal policy and unconventional monetary policy to counter Japan's <b>lost</b> <b>decade</b> in the 1990s, arguing {{that the country was}} mired in a Keynesian liquidity trap. The debate he started at that time over liquidity traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} 10 {{years had}} been the worst decade for real wage growth since the 1860s. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, {{described it as a}} <b>lost</b> <b>decade.</b> Productivity was 16% below the long-term trend, and the recovery was still very unbalanced, with consumption accounting for 100% of growth in 2016. Households ran an unprecedented deficit of 3% of GDP. Unemployment continued to fall, resulting in a 42-year low of 4.4% in June 2017, while real earnings also fell due to rising inflation.|$|E

40|$|During the <b>lost</b> <b>decades</b> in the 1990 s and 2000 s, Japan {{witnessed}} the rising frequency of temporary sales and the declining hours worked. Motivated by this negative correlation, we construct a DSGE model with sales, wherein households go bargain hunting and firms determine its sale frequency endogenously. In the model, bargain hunting activity helps households substitute {{away from a}} relatively expensive brand item, but it is time consuming like labor supply. We show that the real effect of monetary policy continues to be present, but weakens because sales prices are frequently revised and endogenous bargain hunting enhances the strategic substitutability of sales. The real effect of technology shock, by contrast, strengthens. The model reveals that declines in hours worked during Japan’s <b>lost</b> <b>decades</b> account for an actual rise {{in the frequency of}} sales and a rise in the fraction of bargain hunters...|$|R
25|$|In Japan, Renault was {{formerly}} licensed by Yanase Co., Ltd., but in 1999, Renault purchased {{a stake in}} Japanese automaker Nissan after Nissan had faced financial troubles following {{the collapse of the}} Japanese asset price bubble in 1991 and subsequent <b>Lost</b> <b>Decade.</b> As a result of Renault's purchase of interest, Yanase canceled its licensing contract with Renault in the spring of 2000, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee, hence sales of the Lutecia II in Japan were transferred from Yanase Store locations to Nissan Red Stage Store locations.|$|E
25|$|After {{deciding}} against {{pursuing a}} higher education at Memphis State University, Chilton began performing {{as a solo}} artist, maintaining a working relationship with Penn for demos. During this period he began learning guitar by studying the styles of guitarists like Stax Records great Steve Cropper, recording his own material in 1969–70 at Ardent Studios with local musicians like producer Terry Manning (who had worked with Chilton as an engineer on The Box Tops' recordings) and drummer Richard Rosebrough, and producing a few local blues-rock acts. His 1970 recordings and productions from that time frame were released years later in the 1980s and 1990s on albums like <b>Lost</b> <b>Decade</b> (New Rose Records) and 1970 (Ardent Records).|$|E
25|$|In {{its first}} two decades of existence, Israel's strong {{commitment}} to development led to economic growth rates that exceeded 10% annually. Between 1950 and 1963, the expenditure among wage-earner's families rose 97% in real terms. Between 1955 and 1966, per capita consumption rose by 221%. The years after the 1973 Yom Kippur War were a <b>lost</b> <b>decade</b> economically, as growth stalled, inflation soared and government expenditures rose significantly. Also worthy of mention is the 1983 Bank stock crisis. By 1984, the economic situation became almost catastrophic with inflation reaching an annual rate close to 450% and projected to reach over 1000% {{by the end of}} the following year. However, the successful economic stabilization plan implemented in 1985 and the subsequent introduction of market-oriented structural reforms reinvigorated the economy and paved the way for its rapid growth in the 1990s and became a model for other countries facing similar economic crises.|$|E
40|$|The <b>lost</b> <b>decades</b> {{following}} the bubble burst in 1991 {{has been accompanied}} by slowdown of total factor productivity (TFP) growth in Japan. What has driven the TFP down, however, remains a puzzle. To address this question, we develop a New Keynesian sticky price model that is designed to investigate two suspects behind the TFP slowdown other than regression of technology; (i) malfunction of …nancial intermediation, and (ii) inter- and intra-sectoral misallocation of resources. Namely, our model consists of two goods producing sectors and …nancial intermediation and non-technology shocks endogenously alter the observed TFP through these channels. We use an estimated model based on the data from the 1980 s to the 2010 s to demonstrate that exogenous deteriorations of balance sheets of …nancial intermediaries and …rms contributed a sizable portion of TFP decline by hampering …nancial intermediation. We also show that such shocks play the dominant role in generating persistent de‡ation during the <b>lost</b> <b>decades...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{benefits}} Mitsubishi {{had seen}} {{because of its}} strong presence in south-east Asia reversed themselves {{as a result of}} the economic crisis in the region which began in 1991 with the advent of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, referred to in Japan as the beginning of the <b>Lost</b> <b>Decade</b> and continued to 1997. The collapse was partly the result of the Plaza Accord agreement in 1985, which sought to equalize the United States dollar with the Japanese yen and the German mark. In September of that year the company closed its Thai factory in response to a crash in the country's currency and plummeting consumer demand. The large truck plant, which had produced 8,700 trucks in 1996, was shut down indefinitely. In addition, Mitsubishi had little support from sales in Japan, which slowed considerably throughout 1997 and were affected by that country's own economic uncertainty into 1998. Other Japanese automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, bolstered their own slipping domestic sales with success in the U.S. However, with a comparatively small percentage of the American market, the impact of the turmoil in the Asian economy had a greater effect on Mitsubishi, and the company's 1997 losses were the worst in its history. In addition, it lost both its rank as the third largest automaker in Japan to Mazda, and market share overseas. Its stock price fell precipitously, prompting the company to cancel its year-end dividend payment.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1991, Japan has {{undergone}} a protracted recession known popularly as the <b>Lost</b> <b>Decades.</b> After the real estate boom from 1986 to 1991, {{also known as the}} bubble economy, where a strong economy resulted in strong demand for and low unemployment, the <b>Lost</b> <b>Decades</b> resulted in drastic cutbacks among Japanese employers, causing a large increase in unemployment. Despite signs of recovery in the mid-2000s, the 2008 global economic recession has protracted these issues. Among this macroeconomic situation, large changes have been occurring within the Japanese economy that has changed the role of the working woman in Japan. Radical changes in government policies and focus has resulted in increased social care and the creation of dual-sector employment, which have affected female employment and the working housewife. Challenges to the dominant male breadwinner model has led to changing social perspectives on the traditional role of the wife in providing familial care, although discrimination and stereotypes remain rampant. [...] The creation of the double-track personnel management strategy in response to government affirmative action policies has contributed to the lack of women in management and gendered roles in the office.|$|R

2500|$|Critics {{have often}} {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} the film is a social commentary that is reflecting the issues of Japanese society {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Some viewers see Battle Royale as a satire of the Japanese economy during the <b>Lost</b> <b>Decade.</b> Others view it as a criticism of the Japanese educational system, such as the issues of school violence and its failings to prepare students for the extremely competitive Japanese employment market that favors elitism, in which students must partake in fiercely competitive nationwide examinations in order to secure a spot into the more distinguished universities, as these will guarantee student placement into better careers. Other interpretations include the Japanese generational attitudes that is creating social, political and economic divides between the young and old.
