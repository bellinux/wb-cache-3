The aim {{was to determine the}} influence of the organic product alfalfa blend on the rate of growth of the sward from the birdsfoot trefoil. The organic preparation alfalfa blend was tested on a candidate variety of birdsfoot trefoil with the following factors and fertilizing rates: Factor A – dates of harvesting: а 1 – budding stage, а 2 – early flowering stage, Factor В – rates of fertilizing with leaf fertilizers: в 0 – no fertilizing, в 1 – <b>leaf</b> <b>fertilizing</b> at the dose of 1 l/ha, в 2 – <b>leaf</b> <b>fertilizing</b> at the dose of 2 l/ha, в 3 – <b>leaf</b> <b>fertilizing</b> at the dose of 3 l/ha. The birdsfoot trefoil treatment with an organic fertilizer as a cultivar factor exerted an effect on the height and morphological composition of the sward. As in the three years of study and on average over a significant influence on plant height was the stage of harvest than the dose of organic fertilizer. In flowering stage and during the three experimental years and three doses of the plants are higher than those harvested in the phase budding treated with the same doses. The strong positive correlation established between the height and the leaves (r = 0. 5734) and low positive correlation between the leaves and the generative organs (r = 0. 3370); between dry mass yield and the height (r = 0. 2740) and the stems.

40|$|The {{chemical}} analysis of leaves was studied {{as an indication}} of fertilizer requirements of the oil-palm in the former Belgian Congo. Position and age of the leaf both markedly influenced chemical composition. Leaflets from the same position in leaf and plant must be compared. The age of the whole palm also had its influence; climatic influences also varied with age (generally more fluctuating in younger palms). Time of year significantly influenced leaf composition. Sampling in the rainy season was advised, between 07. 00 h and 10. 00 h. Analytical error should not exceed 10 %. For 20 ha bulk samples of 20 to 25 palms should be taken; they give a sampling variation of the same order as the errors in {{chemical analysis}}. Two leaflets from each side of the middle part of the youngest leaf (with fully open leaflets) were taken. Chemical composition was directly related to growth and production of oil- palms. There was an 'optimum' leaf composition. Qualitative diagnosis of deficiencies should however be based on characteristic changes in leaf composition for all the elements (N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, B, Cu, Zn). A deficiency of a minor element may effect contents of major elements. It was possible to approach the optimum <b>leaf</b> concentration by <b>fertilizing.</b> <p/...|$|R

40|$|Increased biomass {{production}} in terrestrial ecosystems with elevated atmospheric CO{sub 2 }, may be constrained by nutrient limitations {{as a result}} of increased requirement or reduced availability caused by reduced turnover rates of nutrients. To determine the short-term impact of nitrogen (N) fertilization on plant biomass production under elevated CO{sub 2 }, we compared the response of N-fertilized tallgrass prairie at ambient and twice-ambient CO{sub 2 } levels. Native tall grass prairie plots were exposed continuously to ambient and twice-ambient CO{sub 2 }. We compared our results to an unfertilized companion experiment on the same research site. Above- and below-ground biomass production and <b>leaf</b> area of <b>fertilized</b> plots were greater with elevated than ambient CO{sub 2 }. Nitrogen concentration was lower in plants exposed to elevated CO{sub 2 }, but total standing crop N was greater at high CO{sub 2 } increased root biomass under elevated CO{sub 2 } apparently increased N uptake. The biomass production response to elevated CO{sub 2 } was much greater on N-fertilized than unfertilized prairie, particularly in the dry year. We conclude that biomass production response to elevated C{sub 2 } was suppressed by N limitation in years with below-normal precipitation. Reduced N concentration in above- and below-ground biomass could slow microbial degradation of soil organic matter and surface litter. The reduced tissue N concentration higher acid detergent fiber under elevated CO{sub 2 } compared to ambient for forage indicated that ruminant growth and reproduction could be reduced under elevated CO{sub 2 }...|$|R
40|$|The fish Sarpa salpa (L.) {{is one of}} {{the main}} macroherbivores in the western Mediterranean. Through direct and {{indirect}} mechanisms, this herbivore can exert significant control on the structure and functional dynamics of seagrass beds and macroalgae. Past research has suggested nutritional quality of their diet influences S. salpa herbivory, with the fish feeding more intensively and exerting greater top down control on macrophytes with higher internal nutrient contents. However recent findings have questioned this notion and shown that herbivores do not preferentially feed on macrophytes with higher nutrient contents, but rather feed on a wide variety of them with no apparent selectivity. To contribute to this debate, we conducted a field fertilization experiment where we enriched leaves of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, a staple diet for S. salpa, and examined the response by the herbivore. These responses included quantification of <b>leaf</b> consumption in <b>fertilized</b> and non-fertilized/control plots within the bed, and food choice assays where fertilized and non-fertilized/control leaves were simultaneously offered to the herbivore. Despite the duration of leaf exposure to herbivores (30 days) and abundant schools of S. salpa observed around the plots, leaf consumption was generally low in the plots examined. Consumption was not higher on fertilized than on non-fertilized leaves. Food choice experiments did not show strong evidence for selectivity of enriched leaves. These results add to a recent body of work reporting a broad generalist feeding behavior by S. salpa with no clear selectivity for seagrass with higher nutrient content. In concert, this and other studies suggest S. salpa is often generalist consumers not only dictated by diet nutrient content but by complex interactions between other traits of nutritional quality, habitat heterogeneity within their ample foraging area, and responses to predation risk. This research was co-funded by the Department of Marine Science and Applied Biology (University of Alicante) and the University of South Alabama (Alabama, USA) in a collaborative agreement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Since 1993, The Vetiver System (VS) {{has been}} applied both in {{construction}} and maintenance projects of mountain roads in the Northern, Northeastern, and Southern regions of Thailand. Over 2. 5 million slips are planted each year. The Department of Highways (1994) has prepared a Standard Drawing [SP- 204 1994 and SP- 206 (Revision) 1999, “ Vetiver grass planting for highway slope protection”] that consists of detail of the pattern of planting on back slope, side slope and bridge slope. The drawing covers planting at high erosible area, side ditch lining, bank protection. It also includes suitable slips, hole digging and ground preparation, planting, period for plant, planting caring, <b>leaf</b> trimming and <b>fertilizing</b> application. This drawing {{is used as a}} guideline in development of other engineering departments. The VS plays an importance role and replaces other techniques for erosion control, and solves highway slopes damage caused by erosion or scouring at the curved section of road, surface slope, the end of surface drainage systems and toe slope. Vetiver slips have been planted depending on the seriousness and tendency of erosion. Their growth on side slope was usually better than back slope. Slips were obtained from: The Highway District’s multiplication plots, Land Development Department and other agencies. Polybagged slips kept in the nursery are recommended and fertilizer should be applied {{at the bottom of the}} planting holes. The VS has been proven and accepted to be an effective and low-cost technique for erosion protection in roadworks, suitable for a sustainable economy with limited budget. Some defects of the vetiver planting in the roadworks are found in the Northern region of the country where some local weeds grow more rapidly than the vetiver. So, in the first year, more care is needed. Suitable period for planting is limited in the rainy season that is not correlated well with construction that takes place in dry season...|$|R
