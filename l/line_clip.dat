40|$|<b>Line</b> <b>clipping</b> {{and drawing}} are two {{important}} {{processes in the}} graphics output pipeline. Improving the efficiency of these two processes will improve the overall efficiency of the output pipeline. My thesis is that the efficiency of these two processes can be improved significantly.;Traditionally, <b>line</b> <b>clipping</b> is done in floating point numbers and line drawing in integers. A <b>line</b> is first <b>clipped,</b> probably more than once, and then rasterized. Since line segments must be rasterized at the end, doing clipping and rasterization together improves the overall efficiency, avoids computation in floating point numbers, and eliminates inconsistencies introduced in the <b>line</b> <b>clipping</b> process. However, <b>line</b> <b>clipping</b> in floating point numbers is still required for line segments in three and higher dimensions.;In this thesis, the efficiency of higher dimensional <b>line</b> <b>clipping</b> is improved via {{the extension of the}} Nicholl-Lee-Nicholl <b>line</b> <b>clipping</b> algorithm to higher dimensions. The efficiency of line drawing is improved by a new run-length slice line drawing algorithm which does not use multiplications and divisions. <b>Line</b> <b>clipping</b> and <b>line</b> drawing are amalgamated by using new algorithms that find the first visible grid point in constant or logarithmic time in terms of then umber of grid points from the first endpoint to the first visible grid point...|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} and method for <b>line</b> <b>clipping</b> is {{developed}} that describes clipping in an exact and mathematical form. The basic ideas form {{the foundation for}} a family of algorithms for two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and four-dimensional (homogeneous coordinates) <b>line</b> <b>clipping.</b> The <b>line</b> segment to be clipped is mapped into a parametric representation. From this, a set of conditions is derived that describes the interior of the clipping region. Observing that these conditions are all of similar form, they are rewritten such that the solution to the clipping problem is reduced to a simple max/min expression. For each dimension, the mathematics are discussed, an example is given, the algorithm is designed, and a performance test is conducted. The new algorithm is compared with the traditional Sutherland-Cohen clipping algorithm. Using randomly generated data, the new algorithm showed a 36 percent, 40 percent, and 79 percent improvement for two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and four- dimensional clipping, respectively. One of the advantages of this algorithm is the quick rejection of line segments that are invisible.

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for <b>clipping</b> <b>line</b> segments by {{a rectangular}} window on {{rectangular coordinate system}} is presented in this paper.

Thus, it is clear for the line segment to be outside or inside of the window. If the line segments intersect the window, the algorithm immediately (no solving equations) gets the intersection points. Having applied the inverse transformations to the intersection points, the algorithm has the final results. The algorithm is successful to avoid the complex classifications and computations. Besides, the algorithm is effective to simplify the processes of finding the intersection points.
