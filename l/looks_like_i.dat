500|$|One of Paul's main storylines {{culminated in}} him having his leg amputated after an accident. The storyline has {{received}} some criticism as Paul was shown on different occasions not limping with his false leg. Dennis explained {{during an interview}} how the production team helped ensure to make his limp appear more effectively, stating [...] "They made me a splint which actually makes me sort of limp, but keeps my foot rigid so it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> actually do have a non-moving piece. One time I did change my leg, as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one {{to see if anyone}} noticed." [...] Dennis revealed in May 2011, that he wears a brace on his leg as remembering which leg to limp on was becoming a [...] "little distracting." ...|$|E

I like to deal with the situation when it happens." [...] A beatboxer from Norfolk, Tom Povey, was picked to perform with her on stage after he was seen performing in a London pub. Povey, who performs with the stage name Intensi T, said it was the highlight of his career. Roberts also performed the song on British chat-shows Daybreak and Paul O'Grady Live.|$|E

I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E

2500|$|After the shooting, {{recordings}} of police radio communications during the event were {{released by the}} Snohomish County Police Staff and Auxiliary Services Center after requests for public records. A timeline was also provided by Marysville police spokesman Robb Lamoureux. According to the timeline and recordings, an anonymous 9-1-1 caller, using a cellphone, first alerted police to the shooting. The school resource officer was the first law enforcement officer {{to make contact with}} the victims, arriving at the scene a minute after the first 9-1-1 call was received. He immediately reported that a fire alarm was going off and that there were students and staff evacuating from the building. A dispatcher then informed him about a report of a possible shooting in the cafeteria. The officer responded, [...] "Ocean 12, it's confirmed. We have a shooter. We have five down." [...] He later said, [...] "Shooter is DOA [...] We have got apparently four [...] " [...] Soon afterward, he said, [...] "Ocean 12, I need aid here. I have two that are still breathing and alive. <b>Looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> have three possibly deceased."

2500|$|While {{initially}} touted {{to return}} to Augusta State University for the 2011/12 season as late as 11 July 2011, Purser announced just three days later that he was unlikely to play another NCAA season. While Purser said he enjoyed his time with the Jaguars, he said it may be better for {{him to stay in}} Perth, citing [...] "At this stage it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> might be staying, just because academically my units that I've started back here [...] don't match up. I think, just looking at a number of factors, that I may be staying." [...] Soon after, Purser informed coach Dip Metress of his departure, after joining a shortlist of players fighting for the final spot on the Perth Wildcats roster – the most successful team in the National Basketball League (NBL). Joining Purser on the shortlist included three members of the Wildcats' 2010/11 extended squad – Greg Hire, Tom Jervis and Everard Bartlett. No matter the outcome, Wildcats coach Rob Beveridge guaranteed Purser involvement with the team in 2011/12, with the worst-case scenario being a development player role. Not to Purser's displeasure, on 11 August, Hire was awarded with the final roster spot. Purser was undeterred by the Wildcats' decision not to award the final spot to him, instead relishing the prospect of becoming an NBL development player. Purser appeared in 10 games for the Wildcats during the 2011/12 season, scoring a total of 20 points. Highlights for Purser included scoring 6 points in 5½ minutes against the New Zealand Breakers at home on 23 December 2011 in just his third NBL game; being nominated for the NBL's Round 23 Play of the Week for his athletic three-point play in the final period against the Cairns Taipans on 11 March 2012; and being nominated for the NBL Rookie of the Year Award. The Wildcats finished the regular season in second place with a 19–9 record and took down the third-seeded Gold Coast Blaze 2–1 in the semi-finals, with Purser seeing game time in Game 3 on 7 April 2012. The Wildcats went on face the New Zealand Breakers in the NBL Grand Final series, where they were defeated 2–1.|$|E

[...] "I've just got to put a patch on right now or my knee'll be through," [...] he explained. He had a neat little kit of {{materials}} and everything was in order. [...] "I haven't time to turn the edges of the patch under," [...] he went on. [...] "It ought to be done--you can't make a durable patch unless you do. This 'housewife' my wife made me when we was first married. I was peddlin' then in eastern Oregon. If it hadn't been for her brother--oh, I'll smash his face in, some day"--he held up the other trouser leg: [...] "See that patch? Ain't that a daisy?--that's the way I ought to do.

6000|$|... "Sure. That's it," [...] {{replied the}} Captain, dryly. [...] "Now {{to hear what}} that service is to be. I've been a busy man since I took this job, and, {{as you may have}} heard, I've done a few things. I don't mind telling you that {{political}} influence put me in here and that up Austin way there's a good deal of friction in the Department of State in regard {{to whether or not the}} ranger service is any good--whether it should be discontinued or not. I'm on the party side who's defending the ranger service. I contend that it's made Texas habitable. Well, it's been up to me to produce results. So far I have been successful. My great ambition is to break up the outlaw gangs along the river. I have never ventured in there yet because I've been waiting to get the lieutenant I needed. You, of course, are the man I had in mind. It's my idea to start way up the Rio Grande and begin with Cheseldine. He's the strongest, the worst outlaw of the times. He's more than rustler. It's Cheseldine and his gang who are operating on the banks. They're doing bank-robbing. That's my private opinion, but it's not been backed up by any evidence. Cheseldine doesn't leave evidences. He's intelligent, cunning. No one seems to have seen him--to know what he <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> assume, of course, that you are a stranger to the country he dominates. It's five hundred miles west of your ground. There's a little town over there called Fairdale. It's the nest of a rustler gang. They rustle and murder at will. Nobody knows who the leader is. I want you to find out. Well, whatever way you decide is best you will proceed to act upon. You are your own boss. You know such men and how they can be approached. You will take all the time needed, if it's months. It will be necessary for you to communicate with me, and that will be a difficult matter. For Cheseldine dominates several whole counties. You must find some way to let me know when I and my rangers are needed. The plan is to break up Cheseldine's gang. It's the toughest job on the border. Arresting him alone isn't to be heard of. He couldn't be brought out. Killing him isn't much better, for his select men, the ones he operates with, are as dangerous to the community as he is. We want to kill or jail this choice selection of robbers and break up the rest of the gang. To find them, to get among them somehow, to learn their movements, to lay your trap for us rangers to spring--that, Duane, is your service to me, and God knows it's a great one!" ...|$|E
