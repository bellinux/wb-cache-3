50|$|As {{with any}} {{satellite}} communication link, the data rate {{that can be}} achieved with a terminal is dependent on the gain of the parabolic antenna. Antenna gain increases with the square of the ratio of aperture width to wavelength. Therefore for a fixed antenna size the gain, and hence the achievable data rate increases with frequency. Thus X band provides data rates which are much higher than can be achieved with UHF, L band, or C band. The achievable data rates will approach those achievable with Ku band, the exact values will depend on other link parameters (satellite power, <b>link</b> <b>margin,</b> modulation scheme, etc.).|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{clarifying}} {{the role of}} the outer loop power control for CDMA satellite systems with on-board power constraints. If the inner loop of the power control is perfect, the channel turns into a AWGN channel and there is no need of the outer loop. In satellite CDMA sytsems, due to the longer propagation delay with respect to a terrestrial system, the inner loop of power control is only partly able to track power variations due to fast fading. Moreover, the Rice factor, which characterizes the channel statistics, can widely vary even if the user does not move but just because of the change of the elevation angle. Because of that, a wide range of target SNIR (and larger than in typical terrestrial systems) may be necessary to get the same BER performance. Therefore, the outer loop power control turns out to be essential to minimize the dynamic of the power <b>link</b> <b>margins</b> and avoid capacity degradations induced by the systematic use of static <b>link</b> <b>margins.</b> A semi-analytical model for the capacity evaluation has been developed, which is specifically intended for the power-limited satellite-to-mobile link with multi satellite reception.

40|$|Link {{analysis}} {{is a system}} engineering process in the design, development, and operation of communication systems and networks. Link models that are mathematical abstractions representing the useful signal power and the undesirable noise and attenuation effects (including weather effects if the signal path transverses through the atmosphere) that are integrated into the link budget calculation that provides the estimates of signal power and noise power at the receiver. Then the <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> is applied which attempts to counteract the fluctuations of the signal and noise power to ensure reliable data delivery from transmitter to receiver. (<b>Link</b> <b>margin</b> is dictated by the <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> policy or requirements.) A simple link budgeting approach assumes link parameters to be deterministic values typically adopted a rule-of-thumb policy of 3 dB <b>link</b> <b>margin.</b> This policy works for most S- and X-band links due to their insensitivity to weather effects. But for higher frequency links like Ka-band, Ku-band, and optical communication links, it is unclear if a 3 dB <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> would guarantee link closure. Statistical link analysis that adopted the 2 -sigma or 3 -sigma <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> incorporates link uncertainties in the sigma calculation. (The Deep Space Network (DSN) <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> policies are 2 -sigma for downlink and 3 -sigma for uplink.) The link reliability can therefore be quantified statistically even for higher frequency links. However in the current statistical link analysis approach, link reliability is only expressed as the likelihood of exceeding the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold that corresponds to a given bit-error-rate (BER) or frame-error-rate (FER) requirement. The method does not provide the true BER or FER estimate of the link with margin, or the required signalto-noise ratio (SNR) that would meet the BER or FER requirement in the statistical sense. In this paper, we perform in-depth analysis {{on the relationship between}} BER/FER requirement, operating SNR, and coding performance curve, in the case when the channel coherence time of link fluctuation is comparable or larger than the time duration of a codeword. We compute the "true" SNR design point that would meet the BER/FER requirement by taking into account the fluctuation of signal power and noise power at the receiver, and the shape of the coding performance curve. This analysis yields a number of valuable insights on the design choices of coding scheme and <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> for the reliable data delivery of a communication system - space and ground.

30|$|The {{aforementioned}} atmospheric impairments {{are combined}} with factors that include (a) the optical power {{losses in the}} transmitter and receiver, (b) beam spreading, (c) the Strehl (optical imaging quality) ratio, and (d) pointing errors to calculate link parameters such as the <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> and link availability [164 â€“ 166]. The <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> {{is defined as the}} ratio of the transmitted power to the minimum power that is required to achieve a desired BER at the receiver. Signal fades that exceed the <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> lead to an increased BER {{for the duration of the}} fade and extremely deep fades raise the BER to 50 %, causing a total loss of data and rendering the link useless. In contrast to other wireless channels, signal fading on the OW channel is relatively slow compared to the data-rate. The duration of a fade might be up to 100 ms or longer when the clock period, which depends on the data rate, is generally less than 20 ns (50 Mb/s). Hence, during a single fade several thousand transmitted bits can be corrupted. The link availability, on the other hand, is measured over a larger timescale and is defined as the percentage of time over a year that the link is available. The link availability is primarily dependent upon the existence of obscurations in the atmosphere. Under heavy obscuration, the atmospheric losses exceed the <b>link</b> <b>margin</b> and, similar to deep fades, the link operates at an increased BER or is unusable for the duration of the obscuration. When link outage resulting from obscuration cannot be tolerated the best solution is to operate a hybrid link where the OW link is operated in parallel with a directional RF link in unlicensed regions of C-band (5.8 GHz) or Ku-band. Hybrid OW/RF systems are detailed in the next section.|$|E
