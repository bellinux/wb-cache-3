5|$|Fort Stikine {{arrived at}} Bombay {{in the early}} morning of 12 April. Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday. The {{practice}} of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels {{in the event of an}} enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into <b>lighters</b> offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as Category A, B, or C. Category A explosives, such as those carried on board Fort Stikine, were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto <b>lighters,</b> and not directly to the quayside.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{compounds}} have numerous applications as catalysts, additives in glass, {{carbon arc}} lamps for studio lights and projectors, ignition elements in <b>lighters</b> and torches, electron cathodes, scintillators, GTAW electrodes, and other things.

5|$|Considerable {{effort was}} made to market and promote Cross Days before and after its release, {{including}} the sale of brand merchandise. The limited edition of the visual novel came with a figurine of the Kotonoha character, and 0verflow and its partners also sold wall scrolls and Zippo <b>lighters,</b> as well as shower curtains, cushion mousepads, dakimakura cases.|$|E
50|$|In dry bulk, <b>lightering</b> can be {{undertaken}} {{one of two}} ways. If the vessel to be <b>lightered</b> is geared, then it can discharge cargo to smaller, ungeared vessels (typically barges). If the vessel to be <b>lightered</b> is gearless, then floating cranes are often used to transfer cargo to another vessel or barge. A roll-on/roll-off discharge facility, a floating platform, {{can also be used}} to connect the vessels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lightering</b> (also called lighterage) is {{the process}} of {{transferring}} cargo between vessels of different sizes, usually between a barge and a bulker or oil tanker. <b>Lightering</b> is undertaken to reduce a vessel's draft in order to enter port facilities which cannot accept very large ocean-going vessels. <b>Lightering</b> can also refer to the use of a lighter barge for any form of short-distance transport, such as to bring railroad cars across a river. In addition, <b>lightering</b> can refer to the process of removing oil or other hazardous chemicals from a compromised vessel to another vessel to prevent oil from spilling into the surrounding waters.|$|R

5|$|Built {{at a cost}} {{of about}} £300,000, Tubantia was, {{according}} to author Nigel Pickford, one of the most luxurious passenger ships of the era. Royal Holland Lloyd made extensive use of electricity throughout Tubantia, powering everything from fans and ventilation, to laundry equipment, to cigar <b>lighters</b> for passengers. The ship also boasted her name spelled out in lights, suspended between the two funnels. Tubantia could accommodate up to 1,520 passengers: 250 first-class, 230 intermediate-class, 140 special third-class, and 900 third-class passengers. The liner was launched on 13 November 1913, and completed trials in the River Clyde in March 1914.|$|E
5|$|Cerium was {{the first}} of the {{lanthanides}} to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. It was first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1839. Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters. Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium <b>lighters</b> for its pyrophoric properties.|$|E
5|$|In March 1917, Enns {{relocated}} to Brăila in eastern Romania, where it remained until July 1918. Sent to Linz and Budapest for an overhaul in dry dock, Enns {{then returned to}} eastern Romania and was stationed at Reni where she met a group of monitors and patrol boats that had been operating against Russia in the Black Sea. In October 1918, the Danube Flotilla was under serious threat of being cut off in the lower Danube by French forces after the Bulgarians concluded an armistice with the British and French. After the steamer Croatia was fired on by the French as it tried to get past Lom, she cut her tow line, releasing seven <b>lighters,</b> which ran aground on a sandbank. Croatia was hit, suffered casualties and grounded on the Romanian side of the river. The French retrieved three of the <b>lighters</b> and towed them into the anchorage at Lom. The following day, Enns and two other monitors managed to release three of the remaining <b>lighters</b> while under heavy French fire, and towed them upstream. The flotilla continued to retreat up the Danube, running the gauntlet of French and Serbian forces. With the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in early November, the South Slavs went ashore at Vukovar. The Austrian, Hungarian and Czech crew members of the flotilla continued on their journey, arriving in Budapest on 6 November, and Enns began flying the Hungarian flag, {{as part of the}} navy of the Hungarian People's Republic. On 8 December, the monitors were seized by the Allies, and less than two weeks later Enns was towed to Belgrade where she was handed over to Serbia to be maintained on behalf of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia).|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Beirut was a naval battle off {{the coast}} of Beirut during the Italo-Turkish War. Italian fears that the Ottoman naval forces at Beirut could be used to {{threaten}} the approach to the Suez canal led the Italian military to order the destruction of the Ottoman naval presence in the area. On 24 February 1912 two Italian armoured cruisers attacked and sank an Ottoman casemate corvette and six <b>lighters,</b> retired, then returned and sank an Ottoman torpedo boat.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' {{trip to the}} United States, merchandisers pitched many {{products}} to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette <b>lighters,</b> plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them all. This was because he had already allowed David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to one Nicky Byrne, in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles. Byrne then took over Epstein's Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards), in the United States. While the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza Hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.|$|E
5|$|In October 1920, the {{question}} was finally settled when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye provided for {{the transfer of the}} obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the repair ship Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the salvage vessel Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil <b>lighters.</b> All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch.|$|E

5|$|When the Romanians {{entered the}} war on 27 August 1916, the {{monitors}} were again at Rustschuk, and were immediately attacked by three improvised torpedo boats operating out of the Romanian river port of Giurgiu. The torpedoes that were fired missed the monitors but struck a lighter loaded with fuel. Tasked with shelling Giurgiu the following day, the Second Monitor Division, consisting of Bodrog and three other monitors, set fire to oil storage tanks, the railway station and magazines, and sank several Romanian <b>lighters.</b> While the attack was underway, the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage. Bodrog and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised minelayer {{on their way back}} to Belene. This was followed by forays of the Division both east and west of Belene, during which both Turnu Măgurele and Zimnicea were shelled.|$|E
5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and <b>lighters.</b> Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab.|$|E
25|$|The RNAS {{operated}} {{a number of}} 2F.1 Camels that were suitable for launching from platforms mounted on the turrets of major warships {{as well as from}} some of the earliest aircraft carriers to be built. Furthermore, the Camel could be deployed from aircraft <b>lighters,</b> which were specially-modified barges; these had to be towed fast enough that a Camel could successfully take off. The aircraft <b>lighters</b> served as means of launching interception sorties against incoming enemy air raids from a more advantageous position than had been possible when using shore bases alone.|$|E

By 27 May, she had 16 <b>lighters</b> alongside, with the Chinese stevedores working {{round the clock}} to stow {{the main part of}} the cargo. At 2 pm on the 28th, the job was done, giving a total of 1,230,900lbs of tea. Ariel was first to {{complete}} loading. At 5 pm she unmoored and moved down-river to anchor for the night, ready for an early start.|$|E
