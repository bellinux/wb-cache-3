2500|$|In 1987, Kramer was the {{catalyst}} {{in the founding}} of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a direct action protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay [...] "1,112 and Counting": [...] "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're in real trouble. If what you're hearing doesn't rouse you to anger, fury, rage, and action, gay men will have no future here on earth.

6000|$|Early {{the next}} morning I walked into a fish-house near our hotel, where three or four men were engaged in trundling out the pickled fish on barrows, and {{spreading}} them to dry.

[...] The cod in this fish-house, just out of the pickle, lay packed several feet deep, and three or four men stood on them in cowhide boots, pitching them on to the barrows with an instrument which had a single iron point. One young man, who chewed tobacco, spat on the fish repeatedly. Well, sir, thought I, when that older man sees you he will speak to you. But presently I saw the older man do the same thing.

6000|$|Now, I {{will give}} you a sort of general {{synopsis}} of my idea--of course, everything is subject to your own revision and change. The article, we will say, is written by a TYPICAL train hoister--one without your education and powers of expression (bouquet) but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from HIS STANDPOINT--not from John Wanamaker's. Yet, in order to please John, we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess. Comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible. Do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in, and, on the contrary, do not depreciate a profession that is really only financiering with spurs on. Describe the FACTS and DETAILS--all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a Pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see. Here is a rough draft of my idea: Begin abruptly, without any philosophizing, with your idea of the best times, places and conditions for the hold-up--compare your opinions of this with those of others--mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others, giving your opinion why--as far as possible refer to actual occurrences, and incidents--describe the manner of a hold-up, how many men is best, where they are stationed, how do they generally go into it, nervous? or joking? or solemnly. The details of stopping the train, the duties of each man of the gang--the behavior of the train crew and passengers (here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of). Your opinions on going through the passengers, when is it done and when not done. How is the boodle gotten at? How does the express clerk generally take it? Anything done with the mail car? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A TRAIN ROBBER SHOOT A PASSENGER OR A TRAIN MAN--suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands? Queer articles found on passengers (a chance here for some imaginative work)--queer and laughable incidents of any kind. Refer whenever apropos to actual hold-ups and facts concerning them of interest. What could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try? Why don't they try? How <b>long</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to do the business. Does the train man ever stand in with the hold-up? Best means of getting away--how and when is the money divided. How is it mostly spent. Best way to manoeuvre afterward. How to get caught and how not to. Comment on the methods of officials who try to capture. (Here's your chance to get even.) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether or not the perception of earthquake effects is gender dependent. The case considered is the South Iceland earthquake sequence of June 2000. This includes two moderate sized shallow strike-slip earthquakes with high peak ground acceleration in the epicentral area. After the earthquakes a survey on earthquake intensities was carried out by the Earthquake Engineering Research Centre of the University of Iceland. The survey also included questions addressing safety issues, as well as demographic information. The data dealt with herein cover a total of 249 respondents in the epicentral area. In the analysis presented the main emphasis is on the following three questions. Did you manage to seek shelter inside a house during the earthquake? Did you manage to keep your balance? How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> for you to recover? The main finding is that the data indicate a tendency towards gender depend-ent earthquake perception, which in some cases appears to be a statistically significant...|$|R

The task of archaeologists is {{to infer}} the {{cultural}} processes {{at work in}} the (often distant) past, based on an examination of the artifactual, biological, and environmental evidence of human civilizations that remains today. Ancient monuments, like other cultural constructions, can reveal clues about the societies that created them, provided researchers ask suitable questions and devise appropriate strategies for discovering the answers. Initial archaeological surveys of monumental buildings are typically designed to answer "what" types of questions: investigators describe, measure, and map the structures they uncover. The next generation of research generally deals with "how" questions, for example, how were monuments built? How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to construct them? How much labor was required? How did the buildings function? Eventually, archaeologists begin to explore the more difficult "why" questions. Why did ancient societies begin to construct monuments? Why did monumental construction persist, in some cases for hundreds of years? Finally, why did monument building decline and disappear...|$|R

In this dis-cussion we will go beyond the usual technical description to try and address certain questions that we now hear frequently, but are not covered in our past research papers. These are questions along the lines of “How did you get the idea and decide to pursue it? Did you know it was going to work?

40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of time and}} temporal concepts is critical for interacting with the world and with other agents in the world. What does a robot {{need to know to}} refer to the temporal aspects of events-could a robot gain a grounded {{understanding of}} a long journey, or soon? Cognitive maps constructed by individual agents from their own journey experiences have been used for grounding spatial concepts in robot languages. In this paper, we test whether a similar methodology can be applied to learning temporal concepts and an associated lexicon to answer the question how <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to complete a journey. Using evolutionary language games for specific and generic journeys, successful communication was established for concepts based on representations of time, distance, and amount of change. The studies demonstrate that a lexicon for journey duration can be grounded using a variety of concepts. Spatial and temporal terms are not identical, but the studies show that both can be learned using similar language evolution methods, and that time, distance, and change can serve as proxies for each other under noisy conditions. Effective concepts and names for duration provide a first step towards a grounded lexicon for temporal interval logic...|$|R
