The objectives of this present study were phytochemical screening and evaluation of antimicrobial activities of aqueous, ethanolic and methanolic extracts of different parts of the plant such as leaf, root, stem and inflorescence. Extracts of in vitro grown callus of the leaf, obtained after 4 weeks of incubation on 1 X MS medium containing 1 mg/ml 2, 4 -D and 1 mg/ml Kinetin were also screened. Fifteen extracts revealed the presence of phytochemicals such as alkaloids, carbohydrates and phytosterols. The methonolic extracts of root showed alkaloid (0. 50 mg/ml) and stem showed carbohydrate (1. 76 mg/ml). The ethanolic leaf extract showed phytosterols (3. 68 mg/ml). Antimicrobial activities revealed that among all the extracts, the highest sensitivity was recorded for the methanolic and ethanolic extract of inflorescence against Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus respectively.

LC separations were performed on an Eurosphere C 8 reversed-phase column using 30 : 70 (v/v) acetonitrile- 0. 1 % trifluoroacetic acid as a mobile phase. Quantitative determination of lobeline was performed by external standard method at 250 nm, {{in the range of}} 2. 4 - 80 mu g mL(- 1).

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1966. Bibliography: leaves [84]- 88. x, 88 l illus., tablesThe Lobelieae {{constitute}} a tribe {{of the plant}} family Campanulaceae and comprise some 22 genera. Six of these are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, the cosmopolitan genus Lobelia is represented in Hawaii by five endemic species, {{one of which is}} Lobelia yuccoides Hillebr. Of some 200 species of the genus Lobelia, only 21 have been examined chemically through 1964. As a result of these investigations 43 different alkaloids have been described, 37 of which have been characterized. No Hawaiian species have, however, been investigated chemically. An investigation of an alkaloidal extract of the root and stem bark of Lobelia yuccoides Hillebr. using two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography indicated the presence of 10 - 14 alkaloids. One of these tentatively referred to as A-l, was isolated in a yield corresponding to 0. 0006 % of dry bark through the use of column chromatography. Alkaloid A-l was shown to be identical with 8 -phenylnorlobelol (I), an alkaloid previously isolated from <b>Lobelia</b> <b>inflata.</b> The second alkaloid was isolated in yields of 0. 003 - 0. 004 % of dry bark, m. p. 208 - 210 ° (dec.), [α]D^ 22 0. 00 (water), pKa 7. 2, and is referred to as A- 2. Alkaloid A- 2 was isolated by extraction of an aqueous solution of the alkaloid hydrochlorides with chloroform, evaporation of the chloroform extract to dryness followed by trituration with chloroform, and then by cooling the resulting solution. This resulted in the selective precipitation of alkaloid A- 2. Elemental analyses, mass spectrum, and potentiometric titration of A- 2 led to a molecular formula of C 19 H 25 N 2 O 2 Cl. Chemical degradation and spectral evidence pointed to a postulated structure (II) for A- 2.

Collection and taxa groups are constructed using numerical classification and reciprocal averaging ordination.

40|$|Over 300 surface {{sediment}} {{samples from}} the Central and South Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea were investigated for the preservation state of the aragonitic test of Limacina inflata. Results are displayed in spatial distribution maps and are plotted against cross-sections of vertical water mass configurations, illustrating the relationship between preservation state, saturation state of the overlying waters, and overall water mass distribution. The microscopic investigation of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> (adults) yielded the Limacina dissolution index (LDX), and revealed three regional dissolution patterns. In the western Atlantic Ocean, sedimentary preservation states correspond to saturation states in the overlying waters. Poor preservation is found within intermediate water masses of southern origin (i. e. Antarctic intermediate water (AAIW), upper circumpolar water (UCDW)), which are distinctly aragonite-corrosive, whereas good preservation is observed within the surface waters above and within the upper North Atlantic deep water (UNADW) beneath the AAIW. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, in particular along the African continental margin, the LDX fails in most cases (i. e. less than 10 tests of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> per sample were found). This is most probably due to extensive "metabolic" aragonite dissolution at the sediment-water interface combined with a reduced abundance of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> in the surface waters. In the Caribbean Sea, a more complex preservation pattern is observed because {{of the interaction between}} different water masses, which invade the Caribbean basins through several channels, and varying input of bank-derived fine aragonite and magnesian calcite material. The solubility of aragonite increases with increasing pressure, but aragonite dissolution in the sediments does not simply increase with water depth. Worse preservation is found in intermediate water depths following an S-shaped curve. As a result, two aragonite lysoclines are observed, one above the other. In four depth transects, we show that the western Atlantic and Caribbean LDX records resemble surficial calcium carbonate data and delta 13 C and carbonate ion concentration profiles in the water column. Moreover, preservation of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> within AAIW and UCDW improves significantly to the north, whereas carbonate corrosiveness diminishes due to increased mixing of AAIW and UNADW. The close relationship between LDX values and aragonite contents in the sediments shows much promise for the quantification of the aragonite loss under the influence of different water masses. LDX failure and uncertainties may be attributed to (1) aragonite dissolution due to bottom water corrosiveness, (2) aragonite dissolution due to additional CO 2 release into the bottom water by the degradation of organic matter based on an enhanced supply of organic matter into the sediment, (3) variations in the distribution of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> and hence a lack of supply into the sediment, (4) dilution of the sediments and hence a lack of tests of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata,</b> or (5) redeposition of sediment particles...|$|R
40|$|In February 1970 {{plankton}} sampling {{has been}} {{started as a}} section of the “Cooperative Investigations in the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions” (CICAR-project). Sampling was executed by ornithologists on board the M. S. “Luymes”. Open plankton nets with meshes of 0. 056 mm diam. were used for sampling between 0 and 18 metres. Part of the samples made in 1970 has been examined. 1. The samples examined came from the area around the islands Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao (area 1, fig. 1), visited in summer and winter, and from the coast off the Guyana’s (area 2, fig. 2), visited in autumn. The second area is strongly influenced by the outflow of the Amazon, which in summer is nearly three times as much as in winter (fig. 3). 2. For area 1 only the temperature of surface layers was measured, in area 2 also the salinity, current velocity, and primary production. A temperature salinity diagram was made based on data from 42 stations (fig. 4). From this diagrim, and the position of these stations (fig. 5), it was concluded that three different watermasses are sampled in area 2. They are called “river-water” (mainly from the Amazon), “upwelling-water”, and “mixed-water” (a mixture of “river-water” with “upwelling-water”, and/or oceanic surface-water). With “upwelling-water” is meant, water coming in the coastal region from deeper layers, though this water may also originate from a divergence or turnover of a watermass. 3. A project was started concerning the distribution and relative abundance of the Crustacea Lucifer typus, an “oceanic” species, and Lucifer faxoni, a “neritic” species. The differences in their distribution were striking. In summer L. typus was in area 1 two and sometimes more than three times as abundant as L. faxoni, depending depth. However, in winter L. faxoni was about twenty times more abundant than L. typus (fig. 7). The great influence of the Amazon and the wet season in area 1 are expected to be responsible for the seasonal differences. In area 2 L. faxoni was nearly five hundred times as abundant as L. typus. The abundånce in the different watertypes was totally different (figs. 8, 9). In “mixed-water” we found about 12 specimens of L. faxoni in each sample, in “upwelling-water” 103 specimens, and in “river-water” 732 specimens. So, the “neritic” character of this area in autumn is not equally distributed. This confirms the generally accepted theory that water from the Amazon is penetrating the area in “bubbles”. 4. The following species and formae of the Euthecosomata were found: Limacina <b>inflata,</b> <b>L.</b> lesueuri, L. trochiformis, L. bulimoides, Creseis acicula forma acicula, cf. Cr. acicula forma clava, Cr. virgula forma conica, cf. Cr. virgula forma virgula, Styliola subula, Hyalocylis striata, Cuvierina columnella forma atlantica, Diacria trispinosa forma trispinosa, D. quadridentata quadridentata forma danae, Cavolinia longirostris forma longirostris, cf. Cav. longirostris forma strangulata, Cav. uncinata uncinata forma uncinata, and Cav. inflexa forma inflexa. All of these were present in area 1 during summer; <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> was by far the most abundant at that time (73, 1 %). In winter this species has also the greatest abundance (58, 3 %); L. trochiformis, Cr. acicula forma acicula, Cr. virgula s. l., St. subula, Cav. longirostris forma longirostris/strangulata, and Cav. uncinata forma uncinata were the only species also present in winter. In area 2 in autumn Cr. acicula forma acicula showed the greatest abundance (91, 4 %). The following species were also found: <b>L.</b> <b>inflata,</b> <b>L.</b> trochiformis, Cr. virgula s. l., H. striata, Cav. longirostris forma longirostris/strangulata, Cav. uncinata uncinata forma uncinata, and Cav. inflexa forma inflexa. 5. Cr. acicula forma acicula without shell and without intact columellar muscle turned out to be distinguishable from other Creseis without shell. Only this forma has the wing protusion separated from the wing gland (fig. 12). The distribution of juveniles of Cav. inflexa was obviously {{different from that of the}} adults of this species and rather in accordance with the distribution of adults of Cav. longirostris. However, the very small juveniles of this species were not described, and could resemble those of Cav. inflexa (Van der Spoel, pers. comm.). Investigation of the soft parts of the juveniles was started and series of animals with increasing length were selected. Most juveniles turned out to be young specimens of Cav. longirostris instead of Cav. inflexa (Troost & Van der Spoel, 1972). 6. The already known distribution of the Euthecosomata (Van der Spoel, 1967) could be corrected for <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> (1), <b>L.</b> lesueuri (2), L. trochiformis (3), L. bulimoides (4), Cr. acicula forma acicula (5), (probably also the forma clava (6)), Cr. virgula forma conica (7), and Cav. longirostris (8). Numbers 2, 4, 6 and 7 occur in area 1 (between 67 ° – 70 ° W and 12 ° – 13 ° N); numbers 1, 3, 5 and 8 occur in area 1, and also in area 2 (between – 47 ° – 63 ° W and 05 ° – 12 ° N). 7. The presence in different watermasses made it possible to enlarge the already known ranges for temperature and salinity of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata,</b> <b>L.</b> trochiformis, Cr. acicula forma acicula, Cr. virgula s. l., H. striata, and Cav. longirostris. These ranges are now 26. 9 °C to maximal 28. 6 °C and 33. 2 ‰ S (average value) to more than 36 ‰ S, respectively. 8. After having comparised samples collected during day-time and night-time, a diurnal vertical migration became evident for several species, except for Cr. virgula s. l., and Cav. longirostris. The already known double diurnal migration in Cr. virgula could not be proved with the present samples. 9. Biometric differences in shell dimensions have been found for all formae of Creseis (fig. 18), some of which were difficult to identify, even with intact shells. For nearly all other species and formae biometric data were collected (figs. 15, 16, 20, 22, 25). 10. Some specimens of Cav. longirostris resemble the forma flexipes from the Red Sea as to the lateral spines and sometimes the dorsal shell lip; they differ, however, in size. A comparable selective pressure in both areas may result in similar phenotypic features. For a more complete description of this variation more investigations are required. 11. Ten species of Pseudothecosomata, Gymnosomata, and Nudibranchiata were found. Of the Prosobranchiata-larvae specimens of 31 different types were found; they have been illustrated (figs. 27 - 54). 12. To simplify handling and comparison of fish larvae a new method has been developed. It was obvious, that identification was difficult. Only eight species belonging to seven families have been distinguished, and numerous specimens belonging to another eight families. The larvae of the Anquilliformes have been divided into ten different groups (Pl. I) on ground of the arrangement of the chromatophores and the total number of myomeres. It was striking, that most of the larvae of the Anguilliformes from area 2 came from stations, situated near the continental slope...|$|R

It does not occur in the low salinity, high temperature, low oxygen environment of the Gulf of Thailand and the extent of its penetration of the Sunda Shelf area of the southern South China Sea varies with season.

A new HPLC method was developed for the determination of lobetyolin and lobetyolinin, the main polyacetylene compounds of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> hairy roots. The analysis was performed on Hypersil MOS column (250 x 4 mm I. D.). The mobile phase was 15 : 85 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and water. Peaks were identified by addition of standards and by DAD. The external standardized method allowed the determination of lobetyolin and lobetyolinin with good sensitivity and reliability. This method {{was used to measure}} the polyacetylene contents of hairy roots grew intensively in bioreactor. High contents of lobetyolin (3. 6 %) and lobetyolinin (0. 8 - 1. 6 %) were detected in the hairy roots because of their great biosynthetic capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of euthecosomatous pteropods {{in the upper}} 100 m of the Hilutangan Channel, Cebu, The Philippines was studied, based on 126 samples, comprising 47, 282 individuals. Thirty-min horizontal plankton tows were performed at depths of 1, 20, 50, 70 and 100 m in January and February 1972. Thirteen species -including 3 subspecies - of juvenile and adult euthecosomes were identified. In decreasing order of abundance the species are: Creseis acicula (20. 4 %), Limacina trochiformis (19. 9 %), Creseis virgula constricta (14. 6 %), <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> (10. 5 %), Clio pyramidata (9. 9 %), Creseis virgula conica (8. 9 %), L. bulimoides (7. 3 %), Diacria quadridentata (5. 3 %), Cavolinia longirostris (1. 9 %), Creseis virgula virgula (1. 0 %), Hyalocylix striata (0. 1 %), Cuvierina columella (0. 08 %), Cavolinia uncinata (0. 002 %). In 3 species, a large percentage were juveniles; for 1 species, Clio pyramidata, only juveniles were caught. The Vertical species distribution {{was similar to the}} distribution of the respective species in Caribbean and Bermuda waters. Temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen influence {{vertical distribution}} little, if at all...|$|R
40|$|The water {{masses in}} the Florida Straits and Bahamas region are {{important}} {{sources for the}} Northern Atlantic surface ocean circulation. In this study, we analyse carbonate preservation in surface sediments located above the chemical lysocline in the Florida Straits and Bahamas region and discuss possible reasons for supralysoclinal dissolution. Calcite dissolution proxies such as the variation of the foraminiferal assemblage, Fragmentation Index, Benthic Foraminifera Index, and Resistance Index displayed a good preservation in both areas. The pteropod species Limacina inflata showed very good preservation in sediments of inter-platform channels from the Great Bahama Bank (Providence Channel, Exuma Sound) above the aragonite lysocline. Supralysoclinal aragonite dissolution, however, was observed at two water depth levels (800 - 1000 m and below 1500 m) in the Florida Straits. Our observations suggest that the supralysoclinal dissolution in the Florida Straits {{is due to the}} degradation of organic material. The presence of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) may be a contributing factor for the significant aragonite dissolution in 800 - 1000 m. The comparison of modern preservation patterns of the surface sediments with hydrographical measurements shows that the <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> Dissolution Index (LDX) might be an adequate proxy to reconstruct paleo-water mass conditions in an area which is highly saturated with respect to calcium carbonate...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{mechanisms}} {{in the seven}} species of the thecosomatous pteropod genus Limacina are described and compared. All species are protandrous hermaphrodites. Five species–L. bulimoides, L. helicina, L. lesueuri, L. retroversa and L. trochiformis–have a similar reproductive anatomy in which the gonoduct leading from the gonad to the common genital pore functions as a seminal vesicle in the male and is elaborated into mucous and albumen glands in the female. The male system consists of a prostate gland and penis connected to the common genital pore by an external ciliary tract. All five species have a free-swimming veliger stage which hatches from free-floating egg masses. Limacina helicoides has the same reproductive anatomy but is ovoviviparous, with embryos retained in capsules in the mucous gland until they are juveniles of 50 mm in shell diameter. Limacina inflata lacks mucous and albumen glands and a penis; a spermatophore formed by the prostate gland is used in aphallic sperm transfer. This species exhibits brood protection with un-encapsulated embryos retained in the mantle cavity until they are released as veligers measuring 0067 mm in diameter. <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> is the most abundant of the seven species despite lowered fecundity; reasons for its ecological success are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen surface {{sediment}} {{samples from}} the Pakistan shelf and upper continental slope and a Late Quaternary high-sedimentation rate core (573 m water depth, Pakistan continental margin) have been analysed to improve {{the understanding of the}} factors influencing pteropod preservation. The aragonite compensation depth (ACD) is located at 250 - 400 m water depth, which corroborates previous observations of a very shallow ACD in the northern Arabian Sea. With the exception of the Hab transect off Karachi, the ACD coincides with the upper boundary of the OMZ located at 250 m water depth. The shell preservation index of the pteropod Limacina inflata (LDX) was applied on six surface sediment samples showing good to very good preservation (LDX: 2. 2 to 1. 3). The 30 000 yr long record of sediment core SO 90 137 KA is characterized by alternations between bioturbated and laminated sediments. Bioturbated sediments occurring in the Early Holocene, Younger Dryas and time-equivalents of Heinrich events contain well to perfectly preserved tests of <b>L.</b> <b>inflata</b> (LDX: 2. 1 - 0. 2), whereas only traces of pteropods are found in laminated intervals. The close linkage of pteropod preservation in the surface sediments and in core 137 KA to well-oxygenated conditions can be explained by repetitive intermediate water formation in the Arabian Sea down to at least 600 m water depth in times of enhanced NE monsoons during stadials and H-equivalents. Low amounts of pteropods in laminated sediments (interstadials, Late Holocene) and in the present-day oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) indicate a weak NE monsoon, stable OMZ and shallow ACD...|$|R
