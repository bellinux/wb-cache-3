5|$|August 18–19, 1977: Hurricane Doreen denegerated into {{a remnant}} <b>low</b> <b>off</b> {{the coast of}} California. The {{remnants}} moved inland and caused flooding and crop damage as 7.01inches (178mm) of rain fell on Yuma Valley, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of the storm also brought unseasonable rainfall, although negligible, to parts of southern and central California on July11. The moisture reached the region after being pulled northward by an upper-level <b>low</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Oregon. While over open waters, the storm produced usually heavy rainfall, exceeding 2in/h (50mm/h) at times.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can be {{attributed}} to a deepening low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core <b>low</b> <b>off</b> the coast of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Kathy was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that devastated the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands in March 1984. Originating from a tropical <b>low</b> <b>off</b> the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. Tracking westward, the system attained gale-force winds by 18March before striking the Cape York Peninsula. After crossing the area, Kathy entered the Gulf of Carpentaria where environmental conditions favoured significant development. On 22March, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category5 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) with ten-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph). By this time, the storm had been tracking towards the southwest and struck the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands later on 22March before moving over the Australian mainland as a slightly weaker system. Once over land, Kathy rapidly degraded, losing gale-force winds within 24hours; the storm dissipated over the Northern Territory on 24March.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 10, all of Ida's {{convection}} appeared displaced to the northeast and the forward motion of the storm slowed substantially. Additionally, the storm had begun to undergo an extratropical transition near the United States Gulf Coast. Shortly before making landfall near Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm completed its extratropical transition. Ida crossed Mobile Bay shortly thereafter and maximum winds decreased below gale-force. After slowly tracking eastward for several hours, the surface circulation of Ida dissipated over the Florida Panhandle, late on November 10. However, energy from the storm {{led to the formation}} of a new <b>low</b> <b>off</b> the coast of North Carolina. This new low quickly intensified and became a powerful nor'easter that caused substantial damage throughout the Mid-Atlantic States. By November12, the system attained a minimum pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg) along with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The extratropical low weakened the following day and moved out to sea after stalling along the North Carolina Coastline. The remnants of the cyclone persisted through November17, by which time it had moved over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|On 16March 1984, the Bureau of Meteorology began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} <b>low</b> <b>off</b> {{the southern coast}} of Papua New Guinea for possible development into a tropical cyclone. Over the following day, the system quickly developed and attained gale-force winds as it neared the Cape York Peninsula. Attaining a pressure of 990hPa (mbar; 29.23inHg), the weak system made landfall just north of Weipa, Queensland on 19March before losing strength. Though already considered a tropical cyclone for two days by the Bureau, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the system just prior to its landfall; however, they considered {{it to be a}} tropical depression rather than a storm. After roughly 12hours over land, a weakened Kathy emerged over the warm waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria on 20March. Once over water, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm. Turning southwestward, the storm entered a region favoring significant development and soon began a period of rapid intensification.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded <b>low</b> <b>off</b> the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E
5|$|The 1940 Louisiana {{hurricane}} caused record flooding {{across much}} of the Southern United States in August1940. The second tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from a frontal <b>low</b> <b>off</b> the west coast of Florida on August3. Initially a weak disturbance, it moved generally westward, slowly gaining in intensity. Early on August4, the depression attained tropical storm intensity. Ships {{in the vicinity of the}} storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested. After reaching hurricane strength on August5 south of the Mississippi River Delta, the storm strengthened further into a Category2hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg) at 0600UTC on August7. The hurricane moved ashore near Sabine Pass, Texas later that day at peak strength. Once inland, the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened, degenerating into a tropical storm on August8 before dissipating over Arkansas on August10.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00UTC on October27, the IMD {{upgraded}} Nilofar to a {{very severe}} cyclonic storm. The storm was rapidly intensifying at the time, after the wind shear had decreased, and the eye contracted to a diameter of 19km (12mi). At 09:00UTC on October28, the IMD upgraded Nilofar further to an extremely severe cyclonic storm. Six hours later, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 215km/h (130mph); at the time, the agency anticipated further strengthening due to the favorable conditions and good organization. At 18:00UTC on October28, the IMD estimated peak 3-minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). At the time, it was the third-strongest storm on record in the Arabian Sea. On October29, Nilofar started weakening due to increased wind shear, and the convection diminished in intensity. At the same time, the storm turned northeastward while rounding the ridge to the east. Increasingly cooler and drier air, as well as cooler waters, caused the storm to degrade rapidly. The eye, previously small and well defined, dissipated by 06:00UTC on October29. Later that day, the center began decoupling from the convection, a sign of rapid weakening, and by 21:00UTC the IMD downgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm. Early on October30, the JTWC downgraded Nilofar to a tropical storm, and subsequently the circulation became exposed from the convection. At 18:00UTC that day, the JTWC posted their final advisory. Nilofar weakened further into a depression on October31, and soon after degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>off</b> coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E

25|$|England's innings – like Australia's – {{revolved}} around their opener, {{in this case}} Len Hutton, who became the second Englishman to carry his bat through an innings against Australia, the other being Bobby Abel's 132 not out at Sydney in 1891–92. Hutton made 156 not out in England's 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. Ray Lindwall (3/51) dismissed Cyril Washbrook for 2 when the pedestrian Jack Iverson took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved {{the ball to the}} leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit Ian Johnson for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by Don Tallon for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. Reg Simpson was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler Bill Johnston and England finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon that he ought to stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked Denis Compton's bat and the keeper took the catch <b>low</b> <b>off</b> the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other England batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. David Sheppard almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, Godfrey Evans tried to do the same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. Freddie Brown was caught leg before by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and Umpire Cocks gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant Roy Tattersall was crowded by the Australian fielders and was caught by Neil Harvey off Iverson for a duck. John Warr was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston. Doug Wright came in at 219/9 and held off the Australian attack for over an hour as he and Hutton added 53 for the last wicket, resembling their last stand at Brisbane. Lindwall wasn't recalled to the attack until after 5 o'clock and promptly caught the Kent spinner leg before wicket for 14. England were out for 272, 99 runs behind Australia and Hutton was applauded off the field by the Australian team.|$|E

60|$|The day {{was pushing}} aside the boughs of darkness, hunting. The poor moon would be caught when the net was flung. Siegmund {{went out on}} the balcony to look at it. There it was, like a poor white mouse, a half-moon, {{crouching}} on the mound of its course. It would run nimbly over to the western slope, then it would be caught in the net, and the sun would laugh, like a great yellow cat, as it stalked behind playing with its prey, flashing out its bright paws. The moon, before making its last run, lay crouched, palpitating. The sun crept forth, laughing to itself as it saw its prey could not escape. The lightning, however, leaped <b>low</b> <b>off</b> the nest like a bird decided to go, and flew away. Siegmund no longer saw it opening and shutting its wings in hesitation amid the disturbance of the dawn. Instead there came a flush, the white lightning gone. The brief pink butterflies of sunrise and sunset rose up from the mown fields of darkness, and fluttered low in a cloud. Even in the west they flew in a narrow, rosy swarm. They separated, thinned, rising higher. Some, flying up, became golden. Some flew rosy gold across the moon, the mouse-moon motionless with fear. Soon the pink butterflies had gone, leaving a scarlet stretch like a field of poppies in the fens. As a wind, the light of day blew in from the east, puff after puff filling with whiteness the space which had been the night. Siegmund sat watching the last morning blowing in across the mown darkness, till the whole field of the world was exposed, till the moon was like a dead mouse which floats on water.|$|E
