Words defi ned in the grammar are signals from the sensing elements of the sensor system. Processing of these words is executed by a translator modelled by an automaton with <b>LIFO</b> <b>memory.</b> This method of processing robot sensor signals enables {{the design of the}} system software. The software structure is independent of system appli-cation. The proposed method of organization of robot sensor op-eration software is also useful for the automation of its designing.
