5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is <b>labeled</b> {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is <b>labeled</b> by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge <b>labeled</b> with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs {{can be viewed as a}} compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E

The approach we are proposing transforms multilabel problem into regression problem about numerical <b>labels</b> which can reflect the hidden <b>label</b> importance. In order to explore the numerical <b>label,</b> one way is to extend the <b>label</b> space to a Euclidean space by mining the hidden <b>label</b> importance from the training instances. Such process of transforming logical <b>labels</b> into numerical <b>labels</b> is called <b>Label</b> Enhancement. Besides, we give three assumptions for numerical <b>label</b> of multi-label instance in this paper. Based on this, we propose an effective multi-label learning framework called MLL-LE, i. e., Multi-Label Learning with <b>Label</b> Enhancement, which incorporates the regression loss and the three assumptions into a unified framework.

Participants were shown six types of warning <b>labels</b> found on cigarette packages. They comprised one old Chinese <b>label,</b> one new <b>label</b> used within the Chinese market, and one Chinese overseas <b>label</b> and three foreign brand <b>labels.</b> Participants were asked {{about the impact of}} the warning <b>labels</b> on: their knowledge of harm from smoking, giving cigarettes as a gift, and quitting smoking. Results Compared with the old Chinese <b>label,</b> a higher proportion of participants said the new <b>label</b> provided clear information on harm caused by smoking (31. 2 % vs 18. 3 %). Participants were less likely to give cigarettes with the new <b>label</b> on the package compared with the old <b>label</b> (25. 2 % vs 20. 8 %).
