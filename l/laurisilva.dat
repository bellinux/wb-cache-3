2500|$|As a consequence, the {{individual}} {{islands in the}} Canary archipelago tend to have distinct microclimates. Those islands such as El Hierro, La Palma and La Gomera lying {{to the west of}} the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist Gulf Stream. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical <b>laurisilva</b> forest. As one travels east toward the African coast, the influence of the gulf stream diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. Fuerteventura and Lanzarote the islands which are closest to the African mainland are effectively desert or semi desert. Gran Canaria is known as a [...] "continent in miniature" [...] for its diverse landscapes like Maspalomas and Roque Nublo. In terms of its climate Tenerife is particularly interesting. The north of the island lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated, while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of Playa de las Americas and Los Cristianos is arid. The island rises to almost [...] above sea level, and at altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine Pinus canariensis thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the dragon tree, Dracaena draco are endemic, as noted by Sabin Berthelot and Philip Barker Webb in their epic work, L'Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries (1835–50).|$|E

50|$|The park {{provides}} {{the best example of}} Canarian <b>laurisilva,</b> a humid subtropical forest that in the Tertiary covered almost all of Southern Europe. It is also found on the Azores and the Madeira Islands. Laurus azorica, known as Azores laurel, or by the Portuguese names louro, loureiro, louro-da-terra, and louro-de-cheiro, {{can be found in the}} park, as well as Laurus novocanariensis, known as Canary laurel. Although named as a single type of forest, the national park englobes several varieties of forests. Most humid and protected valleys oriented to the North have the richest and most complex forests. It is known as valley <b>laurisilva,</b> a true subtropical rainforest where the largest laurel trees can be found. At higher altitudes, with less protection from wind and sun, the forest loses some of its more delicate species. Here it is called slope <b>laurisilva</b> (<b>laurisilva</b> de ladera). At the south the forest is mainly a mix of beech and heather, species adapted to the less humid atmosphere.|$|E

They are found in mountainous areas of southern Mexico and almost all Central American countries, normally more than 1000 m above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the Laurel family, and species of Weinmannia, Drimys, and Magnolia. The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua the cloud forests are found in the border zone with Honduras, and most were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica there are <b>laurisilvas</b> in the [...] "Cordillera de Tilarán" [...] and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{the report of}} the writers' {{ecological}} research submitted to the Simatagawa-Tyosakai (The Board of the Investigation into the River Simatagawa of the Yamaguti University), dealing with the vegetation of the basin with the object of planning to effectually keep the source and volume of water of River Simatagawa. The River Simatagawa rises among the Sy&nan Plateau and theRenge range of mountains, and empties into the Seto Inland Sea. The area of the basin is estimated to be 250. 45 km 2. The annual rainfall is 2,'l^mm. at Takamori, and 20 SCmm. at Kudamatu. The upperstream of the river is much blessed with the rainfall and the nature of soil. The vegetation is mostly composed of the secondary forests of Pinus dsnsiflora, where the undergrowth is quite poor and the flow from the soil is rather great on the other hand. The original forests might not be the pine forests, but the forests of Castanopsis ruspidata. In the region of the downstream the very forests are often mixedwith Castanopsis ruspidata var. sieboldii, and the region of the upper-stream they are mixed with Quercus glauca. These forests may have good effect upon the maintenance of the river source, keeping the plentiful volume of water and moreover being useful to protect the region from the disastrous flood. It is specially advisable to preserve and bring up the forests <b>Laurisilvae</b> in this region...|$|R
40|$|The Azores {{archipelago}} {{has provided}} significant {{clues to the}} ecological, biogeographic and evolutionary knowledge of oceanic islands. Palaeoecological records are comparatively scarce, but they can provide relevant information on these subjects. We report the palynological reconstruction of the vegetation and landscape dynamics of the São Miguel Island before and after human settlement using the sediments of Lake Azul. The landscape was dominated by dense <b>laurisilvas</b> of Juniperus brevifolia and Morella faya from ca. 1280 CE to the official European establishment (1449 CE). After this date, the original forests were replaced by a complex of Erica azorica/Myrsine africana forests/shrublands and grassy meadows, which remained until ca. 1800 CE. Extractive forestry, cereal cultivation (rye, maize, wheat) and animal husbandry progressed until another extensive deforestation (ca. 1774 CE), followed by the large-scale introduction (1845 CE) of the exotic forest species Cryptomeria japonica and Pinus pinaster, which shaped the present-day landscape. Fire was a significant driver in these vegetation changes. The lake levels experienced a progressive rise during the time interval studied, reaching a maximum by ca. 1778 – 1852 CE, followed by a hydrological decline likely due {{to a combination of}} climatic and anthropogenic drivers. Our pollen record suggests that São Miguel were already settled by humans by ca. 1287 CE, approximately one century and a half prior to the official historically documented occupation of the archipelago. The results of this study are compared with the few palynological records available from other Azores islands (Pico and Flores) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} recent studies on {{speciation}} of insects within the Canary Islands have indicated considerable within-island diversi-fication, {{similar to that}} described in the Hawaiian islands. Little work has yet been carried out on the neighboring Madeiran ar-chipelago, which is also volcanic. This study examines relationships among all known Lauxaniid flies of the genus Sapromyza from Madeira (including six newly described morphological species) based on mitochondrial gene trees constructed from cytochrome c oxidase (subunit I) and 16 S rRNA partial sequences. Phylogenies based on maximum likelihood distances, a Bayesian method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior probability distribution, and maximum parsimony show that eight of the nine Madeiran species comprise a single monophyletic group. This clade is also split into two subclades representing black- and yellow/orange-bodied forms. The latter mtDNA clade corresponds to only two species (Sapromyza imitans and Sapromyza indigena) which are not reciprocally monophyletic. Monophyly is strongly supported within {{four of the six}} black-bodied species but not for the species pair (Sapromyza inconspicua, Sapromyza <b>laurisilvae).</b> We discuss the double occurrence (at least) of introgressive hy-bridization/incomplete lineage sorting within this group and suggest that recent speciation is the most likely explanation. The re-maining species on the island, Sapromyza madeirensis, is very divergent from the aforementioned group, occupying a more basal position in the tree than the other Atlantic island and continental Sapromyza that were included in the analysis. At least two speciation events for Madeiran Sapromyza appear to correspond to quite ancient periods relative to the age of the island, whil...|$|R
