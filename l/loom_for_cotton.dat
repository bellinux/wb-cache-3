5000|$|William Horrocks secured several patents {{to improve}} the loom. The Horrocks loom Introduced in 1803, {{featured}} an improved method of taking up the cloth onto the beam once it was woven. It had a metal frame, as was described as neat and compact so hundreds could be at work in a single room. [...] As the warp was now dressed away from the loom, Horrocks loom could be run continuously being stopped only to piece broken threads and to replenish the weft in the shuttle. Two thousand four hundred were in use by 1813, by 1818 there were 32 factories containing 5732 looms. There were 14,150 looms by 1820 but 55,500 by 1829. though these would be outnumbered 4 to 1 by handlooms.

40|$|Understanding the spatiotemporal {{distribution}} pattern of hail disaster risk <b>for</b> <b>cotton</b> {{is crucial in}} mitigating hail disaster and promoting the sustainability of cotton farming. Based on such indexes as hail disaster frequency, spatiotemporal exposure, and vulnerability of cotton, we assess hail disaster risk <b>for</b> <b>cotton,</b> and analyze its spatiotemporal pattern and evolution in Mainland China from 1950 to 2009, supported by geographic information system (GIS). The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The proposed risk assessment method reveals the spatiotemporal difference of hail disaster risk <b>for</b> <b>cotton</b> at the county level. (2) Hail disaster risk <b>for</b> <b>cotton</b> is low in China, except for north of the North China Plain and the cotton-planting areas in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. From 1950 to 2009, hail disaster risk <b>for</b> <b>cotton</b> gradually increased. (3) The descending orders of hail disaster risk levels <b>for</b> <b>cotton</b> are bud stage, seedling stage, sowing and seeding stage, boll stage, and boll opening stage. The growth period with the highest risk varies across the cotton-planting areas. (4) The results of this paper are important for developing hail disaster prevention and reduction measures...|$|R
