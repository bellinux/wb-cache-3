40|$|International audienceDetailed 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology on single {{grains of}} {{muscovite}} {{was performed in}} the Variscan Tanneron Massif (SE France) to determine the precise timing of the post-collisional exhumation processes. Thirty-two plateau ages, obtained on metamorphic and magmatic rocks sampled along an east–west transect through the massif, vary from 302 ± 2 to 321 ± 2 Ma, and reveal a heterogeneous exhumation of the lower crust that lasted about 20 Ma during late Carboniferous. In {{the eastern part of}} the massif, the closure of the K–Ar isotopic system is at 311 – 315 Ma, whereas in the middle part of the massif it closes earlier at 317 – 321 Ma. These cooling paths are likely to be the result of differential exhumation processes of distinct crustal blocks controlled by a major ductile fault, the <b>La</b> <b>Moure</b> fault that separates both domains. In the western part of the massif, the ages decrease from 318 to 303 Ma approaching the Rouet granite, which provides the youngest age at 303. 6 ± 1. 2 Ma. This age distribution can be explained by the occurrence of a thermal structure spatially associated to the magmatic complex. These ages argue in favour of a cooling of the magmatic body at around 15 Ma after the country rocks in the western Tanneron. The emplacement of the Rouet granite in the core of an antiform is responsible for recrystallization and post-isotopic closure disturbances of the K–Ar chronometer in the muscovite from the host rocks. These new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages clearly outline that at least two different processes may contribute to the exhumation of the lower crust in the later stage of collision. During the first stage between 320 and 310 Ma, the differential motion of tectonic blocks limited by ductile shear zones controls the post-collisional exhumation. This event could be related to orogen parallel shearing associated with crustal-scale strike-slip faults and regional folding. The final exhumation stages at around 300 Ma take place within the tectonic doming associated to magmatic intrusions in the core of antiformal structures. Local ductile to brittle normal faulting is coeval to Upper Carboniferous intracontinental basins opening...|$|R
40|$|Background 2 ̆ 6 Rationale: Central to all {{research}} studies is {{a review of}} existing literature relevant to the subject being studied. Occupational scientists may be challenged when reviewing the literature on occupation because it appears in many sources over many years. This presentation will make use of my skills as a librarian as well as a “student of occupation” to provide a structure for thinking about approaches to locating relevant published literature on occupation. Statement of Intent: I propose there are eight key periods of publication relevant to the study of occupation that are of interest to occupational scientists. Each period has been given a name for easy reference in addition to brief descriptions of the relevant search terms and pertinent ideas of that time period. Argument: Occupation is a dynamic subject which changes over time as society and culture shift what constitutes everyday living illustrated by the differences between farming and factory-city life. The argument for this presentation is to suggest that a better knowledge of how the changes have affected publication may be helpful in providing better methods of retrieving relevant documents of interest. Eight time periods spanning the years from 1850 to the present are presented. The focus includes both “everyday” occupation and occupation as a therapeutic medium. An example is the term “habit training,” familiar to occupational scientists because Eleanor Clarke Slagle’s established programs of habit training in New York state institutions, but the concept originated in 1910 as treatment for dementia praecox, the old term for schizophrenia, and called systematic teaching or systematic occupation for temporally organizing daily occupations (Slagle, 1923; <b>La</b> <b>Moure,</b> 1910). Also in 1910 Thomas Bessell Kidner published a book entitled Educational Handwork which provides systematic instructions “for the training of the hands” in several manual training projects and occupations (Kidner, 1910, p. 9) Conclusion: Knowledge of different time periods of publication and the types or purposes of publishing during a given time period can facilitate locating literature relevant to the review of literature for a particular research study. Importance to OS: Advancing the study of occupation requires an understanding of the historical documents that provide the foundation for both occupational science and occupational therapy. Improving techniques for retrieving historical publications facilitates use of that information in current research...|$|R

50|$|Moosbrugger {{deployed}} in 1996, along with <b>La</b> <b>Moure</b> <b>County</b> (LST-1194), John L. Hall (FFG-32) and Narwhal (SSN-671), {{to take part}} in UNITAS 96, a series of combined tactical at-sea operations, amphibious operations and in-port exercises with participating South American naval forces. During that deployment, Moosbrugger spent almost two weeks in Venezuelan waters conducting anti-submarine warfare, electronic warfare and anti-air gunnery exercises in the Caribbean Sea. She then departed for Brazil for the next phase of UNITAS.|$|E
50|$|<b>La</b> <b>Moure</b> <b>County</b> {{departed}} San Diego on 9 January 1958 on {{her third}} deployment to the Far East since the Korean War. She arrived Okinawa on 12 February for duty with the 7th Fleet. Over {{the next four}} months she steamed to the Philippines, Korea, and Japan. Departing the western Pacific on 25 June, she operated along the west coast until deploying to the Far East on 29 January 1959. Based at Yokosuka, she cruised the Japanese coast and participated in amphibious exercises off Okinawa and South Korea. She then sailed from Yokosuka for the United States on 19 May and arrived at Long Beach on 14 June.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship was}} accidentally run aground near {{the coast of}} Caleta Cifuncho Bay, Chile in the pre-dawn hours of 12 September 2000 during a routine amphibious {{training}} operation with a sister vessel, the Chilean Valdiva. A combination {{of the speed of}} the ship at impact and the incoming tide resulted in extensive damage to the bow, keel, screws (propellers), and rudders. Extensive internal flooding and the dumping 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel only served to complicate matters. She was unable to get off the rocky point under her own power, and wave action continued to cause even more damage to the hull and keel. Eventually, the ship was towed off the rocks by the seagoing Chilean Navy tug Galvarino (ATF 66), which was in the immediate vicinity. Galvarino continued to provide rescue and salvage support to <b>La</b> <b>Moure</b> <b>County</b> several days after the incident.|$|E
50|$|During August and September {{she carried}} troops and {{supplies}} from Korea to Japan and transported enemy prisoners from United Nations POW camps to Inchon. After returning to Yokosuka on 24 September, she made coastal runs to Kobe and Kure and supported amphibious operations off Okinawa {{during the next}} five months. Between 26 February and 27 March 1954, she sailed from Japan to California via Pearl Harbor. She operated along the California coast out of San Diego during the remainder of 1954. Departing San Diego on 17 February 1955, LST-883 arrived Japan on 17 March to begin a six-month deployment in the Far East. Renamed USS <b>La</b> <b>Moure</b> <b>County</b> (LST-883) on 1 July, she operated with peacekeeping forces between Japan and Korea until sailing for the west coast on 20 September. Following her return to San Diego on 19 October, she resumed coastal operations and amphibious training duty off southern California. She served out of San Diego {{during the next two}} years and in 1956 completed two amphibious training cruises to Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|Moosbrugger {{deployed}} in 1998, along with <b>La</b> <b>Moure</b> <b>County,</b> Doyle (FFG-39) and Boston (SSN-703), {{to take part}} in UNITAS 39-98, serving as the USCOMSOLANT flagship with COMDESRON 32 as the Operational Commander. UNITAS, Latin for unity, consists of at-sea operations, amphibious operations, riverine operations and in port exercises conducted with nine South American navies over a four-month period. The U.S. task group circumnavigated South America in a clockwise direction, returning to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in November. The 40-year-old operation promotes a cooperative maritime strategy in the region while supporting the U.S. policy of continued engagement in South America through forward presence. The navies of Canada, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and South Africa joined the United States and South American navies for the first phase of UNITAS. This phase was led by the United States and conducted in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. The U.S. Navy's longest-running annual deployment began at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, as seven ships from four foreign navies joined a five ship U.S. task group.|$|E
