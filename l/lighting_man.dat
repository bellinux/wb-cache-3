5000|$|EMI {{released}} Anytime Anyplace Anywhere, a [...] "best of" [...] record featuring tracks {{from the}} bands birth until their switch to Cooking Vinyl. This reportedly annoyed the band {{as they were}} not consulted or even {{made aware of the}} release of the record. In 2004 two new Carter CDs were released: a live album of BBC concerts from the early 1990s, and Brixton Mortars, a compilation album of tracks from their final two studio albums. In 2006, Carter released a new compilation of unreleased tracks and rarities called The Good, The Bad, The Average And Unique. Echoing the earlier Starry Eyed And Bollock Naked, the sleeve features a Volkswagen Beetle - this time a bright green new model convertible. Autumn 2007 saw the release of a band-authorised best of compilation album spanning their entire career on EMI, under the title, You Fat Bastard. The title came from a chant performed by the crowd at gigs. It originated from MC (and <b>lighting</b> <b>man)</b> Jon [...] "Fat" [...] Beasts topless on-stage band introductions.

40|$|Synopsis: A Director and his {{assistant}} arrange the protagonist, who stands on a black block submitting to their direction. This play is the singular item in the Beckett canon expressing a political viewpoint. D, the director wears some of the standard accruements of an authoritarian figure: a fur coat and matching toque, a fat cigar, and an armchair from which only he can preside. He has only {{a short amount of}} time to devote to the rehearsal, as he must go to a caucus meeting. A, the assistant, behaves with the proper humility and alacrity but carefully wipes the armchair before she can relax in it. Her frequent recourse to her pad and pencil offers a sharp critique of excessive bureaucracy. Luke, the offstage <b>lighting</b> <b>man,</b> remains invisible throughout the play as befits a mere worker. P, the protagonist, is simply a puppet subject to the director's will and whim. It is ultimately P's ineradicable subjectivity that precipitates the catastrophe and breaches the surrounding servile unanimity. Cast: John Gielgud, Rebecca Pidgeon, Harold Pinte...|$|E
