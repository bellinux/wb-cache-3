40|$|For {{the farming}} {{industry}} {{it is essential}} to use liquid manure as natural fertilizer. Through new agricultural regulation 2015 in Germany the industry must develop new <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> systems because the ammonia and methane emission are limited. In a research project the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau and some other industry partners will develop such a new innovative <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> <b>spreader.</b> The new <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> should use pulsating air to distribute the liquid manure exactly. The pulsating air, which flows through the pipelines, should be analysed at a test station. For examinations at this test station it is important to find another substitute fluid because liquid manure smells strong, is not transparent and is also not homogeneous enough for scientific investigations. Furthermore it is important to ensure that the substitute fluid is, like liquid manure, a non-Newtonian fluid. The substitute fluid must be a shear-thinning substance - this means the viscosity decrease at higher shear rate. Many different samples like soap-water-farragoes, jelly-water-farragoes, agar-water-farragoes, soap-ethanol-farragoes and more are, for the project, examined in regard of their physical properties to find the best substitute fluid. The samples are examined at the rotational viscometer for viscosity at various shear rates and then compared with the viscosity values of liquid manure...|$|E

A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} characterize soil-vehicle interactions and to measure tractor power/fuel requirements when hauling a fully loaded tank spreader (18 m 3) fitted with rubber tracks (2721 x 635), high flotation tires (28 L 26) or conventional truck tires (445 / 65 R 22. 5). A second objective was to apply an existing soil compaction model to the data from this field trial and to determine if its estimates of wheel rut depth were reasonable. The experiment {{was carried out in}} late autumn on a harvested soybean field (silt loam soil) located in southwestern Ontario. Fuel consumption and drawbar draft were measured during the traffic treatments with an instrumented tractor, and selected soil properties were measured afterwards.

Among the first employees he hired at the shop were Fred Heckman and Henry Synck. Synck, who later married one of Joseph’s daughters, Wilhelmina, was said by contemporaries to have had “a genius for machinery and mechanics of all kinds.” and “in 1899 he entered the employ of Oppenheim and gradually familiarized himself with the technique of the business.”.

5000|$|In {{the farming}} {{communities}} of Ohio, fertilization of fields was possible {{only by the}} distribution of animal excrement, usually mixed with bedding straw to create a semi-solid mixture of manure. The task of shoveling and distributing the manure was backbreaking {{and there were many}} attempts made to mechanize this process. One such example was a patent by a Daniel Merrell in 1886 for a mechanized [...] "manure spreader". [...] There were a number of other patent filings prior to the onset of the 20th century. In 1899 John M Kramer, Fred Heckman and Henry Synck, Jr., all of whom lived in the small farming community of Maria Stein, OH were awarded a patent for a device to spread manure which they named a [...] "manure distributor". Synck subsequently worked with his future father-in-law, Joseph Oppenheim, to develop the first practical <b>manure</b> <b>spreader.</b> Oppenheim's 1900 invention was so successful that it spawned a major manufacturing company, the New Idea Spreader Works, later renamed the New Idea Farm Machinery Company in 1899. New Idea celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1999 as a division of AGCO. Synck's role in the evolution of <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> and other farm machinery technology is well documented by a steady stream of patents that not only describe improvements to the <b>manure</b> <b>spreader,</b> but also other farm machinery from 1899 to 1939.|$|R
