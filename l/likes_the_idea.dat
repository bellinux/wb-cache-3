5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{finds out}} {{on the last day}} of school how unpopular she is when nobody signs her yearbook. Meanwhile, Ned Flanders offers the Simpson family the use of his beach house over the summer. Marge <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> and {{suggests}} that Bart should bring Milhouse and that Lisa should bring a friend too. However, Lisa has no friends to bring and decides to change her image as a result. After reaching the beach house, Lisa tells Marge that she forgot to pack, so they go shopping for new clothes. Lisa buys a new set of clothes that she believes will make her look [...] "cool", and goes to look for some cool children.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Springfield {{has been}} {{devastated by the}} crime wave. Mayor Quimby decides to take action by forming a Blue Ribbon Committee. At the Simpsons' house, someone steals Lisa's Malibu Stacy collection. Homer decides to take action by looking for it. He finds the culprit, Jimbo Jones, and later foils a robbery by Snake Jailbird at the Kwik-E-Mart. He goes through a very long list of his {{previous}} jobs (during which Marge puts curlers in her hair offscreen) and decides that he <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of combining his love of helping and hurting people. Homer forms his own security company called [...] "SpringShield". Although it only has Homer, Lenny, and Carl, it is more efficient and more successful than the Springfield Police Department. When Quimby sees Chief Wiggum trying to shoot a Piñata with a shotgun while blindfolded, he dismisses Wiggum and (in a fit of rage) makes Homer the chief of police.|$|E

500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
2500|$|The {{journalist}} Peter Dizikes, {{writing in}} The Boston Globe in 2008, notes that popular culture <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability [...] "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event {{can be explained}} by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: [...] "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation." ...|$|E

Will you come and take a turn round the place before dinner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|On reading {{over his}} {{composition}} before sealing it up, Allan frankly acknowledged to himself, this time, {{that it was}} not quite faultless. [...] "'Picnic' comes in a little too often," [...] he said. [...] "Never mind; if she <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> she won't quarrel with that." [...] He sent off the letter on the spot, with strict instructions to the messenger to wait for a reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jupiter! Myra, you {{are enough}} to damp the ardour of a saint!" [...] cried Dr. Alec, with a sudden spark in his eyes. [...] "Your croaking will worry that child out of her wits, for she is an imaginative puss, and will fret and fancy untold horrors. You have put it into her head that she has no constitution, and she rather <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> If she {{had not had a}} pretty good one, she would have been 'marked for the tomb' by this time, at the rate you have been going on with her. I will not have any {{interference}} please understand that; so just wash your hands of her, and let me manage till I want help, then I'll ask for it." ...|$|E

50|$|Terrified {{of sharing}} the same fate, Willard {{suggests}} to the outlaws that ransoming his wife {{would be far more}} profitable than robbing the stage.
