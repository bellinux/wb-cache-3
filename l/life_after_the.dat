5|$|Committed {{to social}} and {{cultural}} activism in Transylvania, Ag√¢rbiceanu spent the 1910s officiating near Sibiu, with a break during World War I that eventually took him deep into Ukraine. In 1919, he moved to Cluj, where he lived {{for most of the}} remainder of his <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> war, he involved himself in both the political and cultural life of Greater Romania. He was voted into the Romanian Academy and assumed the office of Senate vice president under the National Renaissance Front dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often termed the Libellus, is {{the central part of}} the work, and is probably the original account. To the Libellus was added an introduction which summarises St-Calais' career prior to the trial. A conclusion which relates the bishop's <b>life</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> trial is appended to the end of the work. The introduction and conclusion are often referred to as the Vita, or Life.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, Governor of North Carolina Luther H. Hodges and United States Senator from North Carolina B. Everett Jordan {{requested}} a disaster declaration for the state.

According to the American Red Cross, at least 5,000people were kept in shelters after Helene. Following the large-scale evacuation procedures and resulting low loss of <b>life</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm, the Weather Bureau recommended that certain organizations be awarded the Outstanding Service to the Public certificate due to their cooperation with the Weather Bureau during the hurricane's duration.

5|$|In 1896 he {{was first}} {{appointed}} consul and later consul general for the Orange Free State. Muller held this position all through the Second Boer War and his high-profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety, which lasted all his <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902 Muller retired {{to a life of}} travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with his travel books. In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Romania, and later to Czechoslovakia, where he retired in 1932. As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests, especially in oil and electrotechnics.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Hastings {{published}} his autobiography, simply titled The Autobiography of Sir Patrick Hastings, {{and the following}} year published Cases in Court, a book giving his views on 21 of his most noted cases. The same year he published Famous and Infamous Cases, a book on noted trials through history, such as those at Nuremberg. In early 1948, he suffered a small stroke which forced him to retire permanently from work as a barrister. On 11 November 1949, {{he and his wife}} travelled to Kenya, where their son Nicky had moved to start a new <b>life</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> end of the Second World War. While there, he suffered a second stroke due to the air pressure, and he never fully recovered. Hastings spent the next two years of his life living in a flat in London, before dying on 26 February 1952 of cerebral thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|In early 1898, The Montreal Gazette {{reported}} that NL president Nicholas Young signed Chamberlain as an umpire {{for the coming}} season.

5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} in 1894 {{in the village of}} Kalinovka, which is close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was {{employed}} as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. With the help of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's purges, and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War (Eastern Front of World War II), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.|$|E
5|$|Scott's army moved farther inland from Puebla unopposed and {{attacked}} Mexico City from the south. During that campaign in 1847, Hancock first encountered battle at Contreras and Churubusco. He was appointed a brevet first lieutenant for gallant and meritorious service in those actions. Hancock {{was wounded in}} the knee at Churubusco and developed a fever. Although he was well enough to join his regiment at Molino del Rey, fever kept Hancock from participating in the final breakthrough to Mexico City, something he would regret {{for the rest of his}} <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> final victory, Hancock remained in Mexico with the 6th Infantry until the treaty of peace was signed in 1848.|$|E

Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang. As the party travels home, Chang muses that the Yeti is not a wild animal, but has a human soul. The Yeti sadly watches their departure from a distance.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and {{the relative importance of}} genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, {{in-house}} engine {{referred to}} as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, Daxter (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic camera for God of War gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the clock speed of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a firmware upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that {{it all comes down to}} how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the three}} lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed {{the strongest and}} most likely to survive the journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee jute-manufacturer and philanthropist, whose {{sponsorship}} had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter Harry McNish strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the mighty seas of the Southern Ocean. Surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a voyage lasting 16days. Shackleton and two companions then crossed the island's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side. Here he organised the relief of the Elephant Island party, {{and the return of}} his men home without loss of <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> end of the First World War in 1918, the James Caird was brought back from South Georgia to England in 1919 and put on permanent display at Shackleton's old school, Dulwich College from 1922.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2004, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) awakens disoriented in {{the jungle}} and notices a yellow Labrador {{retriever}} (Madison) darting through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage of the airplane crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), enlisting Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to watch her, and administering CPR to Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), saving her <b>life.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach to tend to his own injuries, when he notices Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping suture a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's galley and distributes them to the survivors. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) refuses chocolate offered by her brother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), believing that rescue is imminent.
