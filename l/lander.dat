5|$|Europa <b>Lander</b> (NASA) is {{a recent}} concept mission under study.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar <b>Lander.</b> This version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar <b>Lander</b> was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when the <b>lander</b> got close to the surface, the view changed to a close-up view of the <b>lander.</b> The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar <b>Lander</b> alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar <b>Lander</b> concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) was a {{partially}} developed fission-powered spacecraft with ion thrusters that was cancelled in 2006. It {{was part of}} Project Prometheus. The Europa <b>Lander</b> Mission proposed a small nuclear-powered Europa <b>lander</b> for JIMO. It would travel with the orbiter, which would also function as a communication relay to Earth.|$|E

50|$|<b>Landers</b> started racing {{when his}} father, a former racer, opened a car sales {{business}}. The business sponsored sprint car racer Tim Crawley, who built <b>Landers</b> a dirt go-kart. <b>Landers</b> stopped driving {{when he became}} an assistant of Crawley and Terrell Chastain, whom Landers' father's business also sponsored. When he turned 17, <b>Landers</b> returned to racing, driving a modified at Batesville Motor Speedway. open-wheel modifieds, <b>Landers</b> has over 100 wins in the discipline.|$|R

5|$|Maggie Faris (Amy Seimetz) is the <b>lander</b> pilot serving {{aboard the}} Covenant and Tennessee's wife. Faris pilots the <b>lander</b> {{carrying}} the excursion team {{down through the}} ionic storm, {{to the surface of}} the planet. While the excursion team makes their way to the crashed Engineer ship, Faris stays with the <b>lander,</b> to calibrate its instruments and communicate with Tennessee. She receives communications from Karine Oram that Ledward is ill, prompting her to prepare the medical bay. Upon seeing Ledward's deadly and potentially contagious condition, Faris locks Karine and him in the medical bay, refusing to allow Karine to escape. When the Neomorph emerges and escapes the room, Faris arms herself and attempts to kill it. In the process, she inadvertently damages the <b>lander,</b> causing it to explode. A burning Faris stumbles out of the ship and succumbs to her injuries on the foot ramp.|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix <b>lander</b> {{returned}} data showing Martian soil to {{be slightly}} alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth, and they are necessary for growth of plants. Experiments performed by the <b>lander</b> showed that the Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar <b>Lander,</b> which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 minicomputers. The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant, and named Moonlander; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, Moonlander is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land a lunar module {{on the surface of the}} moon using the game's telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module's landing, the module will either fly off into space or crash into the moon's surface. The game is controlled with a light pen, and the output display was a vector graphics system; the light pen allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar <b>lander.</b> Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original Lunar, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. He based the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket on the actual lunar <b>lander</b> specifications, which he obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which co-designed the <b>lander.</b> The entire game was written in ten days.|$|E

5|$|Sergeant Hallett (Nathaniel Dean) is a {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant and Sergeant Lope's husband. He embarks on the expedition {{to the source of}} Shaw's signal. At the entrance of the crashed Engineer ship, Hallett observes mutated floral pods, which he squeezes, causing the airborne mutagen to be inhaled through his nose. By the time the expedition departs from the crash site, Hallett begins to show symptoms of the parasite, which worries Lope. As they make their way back to the <b>lander,</b> Hallett's condition drastically deteriorates. Upon reaching the <b>lander,</b> which explodes, a Neomorph bursts from Hallett's throat, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant Lope (Demián Bichir) is {{the ranking}} {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant {{who is married}} to Sergeant Hallett. Lope leads the excursion on the planet's surface to the crashed Engineer ship. On the journey back to the <b>lander,</b> Lope notices Hallett's condition deteriorating, which alarms him. Upon reaching the <b>lander,</b> the ship explodes and a Neomorph attacks while another bursts from his husband's throat. A Neomorph attacks Lope when David intervenes and leads the survivors to his base, where Lope discovers Shaw's corpse. He is attacked by a Facehugger, but he is quickly and seemingly saved by Cole, who manages to cut it off him, though his face is severely burned by acid in the process. As Cole is killed by a now mature Alien, Lope escapes with the other survivors to the cargo <b>lander.</b> Aboard Covenant, Lope receives medical treatment, but dies when an Alien erupts from his chest, revealing that despite the short time that the Facehugger was on him, it succeeded in impregnating him.|$|E

5|$|Successive Reichsstatthalter decrees between 1933 and 1935 {{effectively}} {{abolished the}} existing <b>Länder</b> (constituent states) of Germany and {{replaced them with}} new administrative divisions, the Gaue, headed by NSDAP leaders (Gauleiters), who effectively became the governor of their respective regions. The change was never fully implemented, as the <b>Länder</b> were still used as administrative divisions for some government departments such as education. This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the administrative style of the Nazi regime.|$|E

50|$|The two Viking <b>landers</b> each carried {{four types}} of {{biological}} experiments {{to the surface of}} Mars in the late 1970s. These were the first Mars <b>landers</b> to carry out experiments to look for biosignatures of microbial life on Mars. The <b>landers</b> used a robotic arm to put soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two <b>landers</b> were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars' surface, Viking 1 near the equator and Viking 2 further north.|$|R

The painting shows <b>Lander's</b> Peak in the Wyoming Range of the Rocky Mountains, with an encampment of Native Americans in the foreground. It has been compared to, and exhibited with, The Heart of the Andes by Frederic Edwin Church. <b>Lander's</b> Peak immediately became a critical and popular success and sold in 1865 for $25,000.|$|R
