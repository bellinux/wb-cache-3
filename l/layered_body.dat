To overcome the restriction of plane interfaces and to calculate an extended three-dimensional transient field in a <b>layered</b> <b>body</b> with non-parallel and curved interfaces a separation approach was developed [2]. The separation method was applied successfully to obtain calculation programs {{for the design of}} ultrasonic transducers with time-harmonic excitation. Figure 1 shows the different approaches to calculate the sound field generated by a transducer. While the approaches A and B are suitable to simulate the time-harmonic sound field in a two-layered problem (angle beam probe coupled on a half-space) [3], the approach C yields the time-harmonic sound field in a layered test object with curved interfaces [4, 5]. In continuation of way C, a superposition of time-harmonic wave fields (harmonic synthesis) yields the transient sound field in a <b>layered</b> <b>body</b> with curved interfaces [6]. This is an optimized approximation method. The direct method D is based on transient Green’s functions.

40|$|J. C. Pura belt {{is a small}} komatiite – rich Archaean (3. 35 Ga) greenstone terrain in Western Dharwar Craton (Fig. 1). Extrusive {{signature}} of the komatiite {{is evident in the}} form of flow top joints, pillow structures, flow top breccias and vesicular flows. Dunitic, peridotitic and pyroxenitic(by composition) varieties of komatiites are abundant, but all of them are extensively serpentinised, chloritised and carbonatised. Most part of this belt is surrounded by synkinematically emplaced gneissic rocks, besides being domed-up in the central portion by granitic intrusion. While the extrusive ultramafic activity is more predominant in the belt, a rare, strongly <b>layered</b> <b>body</b> of dunite-peridotite-pyroxenite sill is found within this milieu. This note describes the field and petrographic characteristics of the sill with a view to understand varied emplacement conditions of magma during the development of ultramafic profiles in J. C. Pura belt. The layered dunite-peridotitepyroxenite sill is observed about 4 km north commonly seen gradational layering in peridotite, is formed by progressive increase in the modal content and size of the pyroxene crystals (cumulates) from bottom upwards (Fig. 3). Some times small shreds of pyroxenite project into peridotitic bands with sharp contacts. Serpentinisation of primary minerals namely olivine and pyroxene, has been a ubiquitous feature in the <b>layered</b> <b>body</b> especially in dunitic layers. Rarely, vestiges of olivine are found as fragmented tiny grains. In peridotite layers, pyroxene crystals are relatively better preserved whereas olivine crystals are intensely serpentinised. A very coarse cumulus texture, ought to have developed originally in the <b>layered</b> <b>body,</b> is largely obliterated due to the serpentinisation. The coarse, peanut to grape sized pyroxene cumulates, mentioned earlier, show complex texture under microscope. They contain subcumulus-looking or aggregate-like serpentinised masses surrounded by thick rims of iron oxide. Minor amounts of east of Rampura (Fig. 1). It is about a km long, trending in N-S direction with a width of about 20 m, lying close to the eastern limb of the J. C. Pura belt. The outcrops of this <b>layered</b> <b>body</b> occur in a low lying mound juxtaposed to serpentinised massive komatiite. Layering is manifested well with distinct colour bands of olive green coloured dunite, buff coloured peridotite and pinkish brown coloured pyroxenite (Figs. 1 and 2). These layers vary in size from 2 cm to nearly half a meter. The surface expression of the layers of dunite and pyroxenite is homogeneous as their predominantly monomineralic composition, but peridotite layers show heterogeneity in surface expression. Peridotite contains olivine and pyroxene cumulates and since pyroxene cumulates are more resistant (to weathering), they stand out prominently in the out crops as pea nut to grape sized crystals. The contact between layers is normally sharp. The sharp contacts are observed between dunite and pyroxenite and peridotite and pyroxenite. The le...|$|E

40|$|Transient {{heat and}} {{moisture}} diffusion {{and the resulting}} hygrothermal stress field are analysed in a layered plate subjected to hygrothermal loadings at the external surfaces. The one-dimensional transient diffusion is formulated as a one-way coupled problem wherein moisture-induced effects on heat diffusion are neglected, but the exact continuity in moisture flux at layer interfaces holds unlike existing analytical studies. An analytical solution to the diffusion problem is obtained by extending a previously derived solution for double-layered plates. Hygrothermal stresses are evaluated by superposition of stresses due to the applied temperature and moisture fields. First, numerical calculations are performed for a double-layered plate to investigate the influence of moisture-flux continuity at the layer interface on hygrothermal stress distribution. Second, the obtained solutions are applied to the hygrothermoelastic problem of a functionally graded material-like (FGM-like) non-homogeneous plate whose physical properties vary along the thickness direction. Numerical {{results show that the}} use of inappropriately simplified continuity conditions for moisture flux may cause a significant error in evaluating the transient hygrothermal stresses in a <b>layered</b> <b>body.</b> Moreover, it is demonstrated that a gradual change in the material composition of FGM-like non-homogeneous plates induces considerable hygrothermal stress relaxation.

Three other methods of assessing the zircon data yield ages of > 3830 Ma. The BIFs are interpreted as water-lain sediments, which with a minimum age of approximately 3850 Ma, are the oldest sediments yet documented. These rocks provide proof that by approximately 3850 Ma (1) there was a hydrosphere, supporting the chemical sedimentation of BIF, and that not all water was stored in hydrous minerals, and (2) that conditions satisfying the stability of liquid water imply surface temperatures were similar to present. Carbon isotope data of graphitic microdomains in apatite from the Akilia island BIF are consistent with a bio-organic origin (Mojzsis et al. 1996), extending the record of life on Earth to > 3850 Ma.

The chromite ore forms an up to ∼ 10 -m-thick layer in the lower portion of the intrusion. Uitkomst has generally been interpreted as a magma conduit, possibly related to the Bushveld event.

The main target element for mining is nickel (Ni), which is {{recovered}} by a bulk flotation process. Nkomati mine also produces copper (Cu), cobalt (Co) and platinum group metals (PGEs) as by-products. This study provides a geometallurgical assessment of different ore variants associated with the main mineralised zone at Pit 3 of the Nkomati mine. Geometallurgical assessment {{provide an opportunity for}} improving mineral processing performance in existing concentrators and for describing the undeveloped ore bodies. A detailed geometallurgical study also contributes to better control and planning at the processing plant. Optimum results can be achieved by scheduling the most appropriate combination and sequence of material-type to the feed. In such instances, geometallurgy could be considered {{as an extension of the}} mine-to-mill process. A comprehensive understanding of the ore mineralogy is the key to understanding the flotation response of various minerals in an ore body. Ore characterisation is the first step for success of any geometallurgical study. Detailed mineralogical characterisation of ore is one of the most essential steps in this process; this requires a detailed investigation of the ore body in terms of modal mineralogy, liberation potential, and grain-size distribution. For this, 29 samples from four representative boreholes were used to determine the influence of mineralogy on flotation response at the Pit 3 ore body. Optical microscopy, Mineral Liberation Analyser (MLA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used extensively for mineralogical characterisation of these samples.

40|$|In Mongolia, ore {{deposits}} spatially {{related with}} the Unidirectional Solidification Texture (UST) granite include nine rare metal occurrences, one intrusion related REE occurrence and eleven porphyry copper and porphyry gold-copper deposits. In this study {{a variety of}} quartz from different three UST granite areas associated with molybdenum mineralization has been systematically studied. Unidirectional Solidification Texture in an aplite body is recognized in the Neoproterozoic highly differentiated granitic rocks at Kharaatyagaan, central Mongolia. On the basis of crystal morphology, two main types of UST were identified in the aplite body: (i) thin crenulate UST layers, (ii) thick intergrowth UST layers. Bulk geochemistry indicates that Kharaatyagaan UST-bearing aplite and aplite dike are alkaline, and are enriched in light rare-earth elements. Scanning electron microscopy and cathadoluminescence (SEM-CL) imaging of UST quartz from Kharaatyagaan show four types quartz; Euhedral quartz phenocrysts with well-developed concentric growth zoning (Qa 1) in the aplite, euhedral quartz with weak growth zoning in the aplite (Qa 2), UST quartz exhibiting distinct growth zones (Qu 1), and UST quartz showing mosaic texture (Qu 2). <b>Layered</b> <b>body</b> is composed of the following parts (from bottom to top). Part A: UST-bearing aplite layers about 22 m wide. It consists of mostly thick UST layers. Aplite units are red pinkish colored. Biotite and albite are richer than the part C. Contacts between these layers are generally irregular and folded. All layers are directed to top of the hill. Part B: laminated fine-grained layers, about 18 m thick, with all type UST units. Part B is characterized by thin aplite units. All UST quartz layers are also directed {{toward the top of}} the hill. Part C: Part C is characterized mostly by brain texture, crenulate UST layers. Aplite units are light pinkish colored and K-feldspar rich. Also in this part REE minerals were identified. UST quartz crystals are directed toward the top of the hill. Here biotite is absent and muscovite occurs. Part D: fine-grained aplite dike, without any oriented structures, was developed in Neoproterozoic lecogranite with variable thickness from several cm to 50 c m and 20 m long. Crystallization temperatures were calculated applying the Ti-in-quartz geothermometer assuming ɑTiO 2 = 1 based on the observation that inclusions of rutile is commonly found in quartz phenocrysts and UST quartz. Contrasting bimodal light/dark-CL zonation is apparent in Qa 1 type showing dark (low Ti) cores and with light (high Ti) rim. The darker cores crystallized at a lower temperature range (540 - 730 °C) whereas rims were formed at higher crystallization temperature, 730 - 780 °C. Fluid inclusions in UST quartz from Kharaatyagaan mainly consists of two phase and polyphase fluid inclusions. The homogenization temperature and NaCI equivalent salinity of CO 2 -bearing fluid inclusions of the part A and part B UST quartz range from 120 - 550 °C< with 1 - 10 wt. % NaCI equivalent. The UST quartz from part C homogenization temperature of two phase fluid inclusions range 140 - 400 °C with 0. 1 - 12 wt. %NaCI equivalent. At the Zuun Mod porphyry molybdenum prospect, several small intrusions wherein UST is displayed are exposed as a number of small conical hills within the prospect. They are classified into the following two types. (1) Quartz ring dike consisting of a massive milky quartz layer, surrounded by a mixture of coarse-grained quartz-K-feldspar associated with muscovite. (2) Concentric UST-quartz consisting of thinly laminated crenulate quartz layers and K-feldspar-rich aplitic layers. CL imaging documents three type of quartz (Qz 1 -Qz 3). Qz 1 : Mosaic of euhedrally zoned quartz. Qz 2 : spider and cobwed texture. Qz 3 : euhedral quartz with weak growth zoning in the aplite. Crystallization temperatures determined by Ti-in-quartz geothermometer ofall type quartz range between around 600 ° and 770 °C. Fluid inclusions study in UST-quartz from Zuun Mod mainly consists of polyphase fluid inclusions. The homogenization temperature of CO 2 -free fluid inclusions in UST-quartz from Zuun Mod from range 324 ° to 598 °C< with NaCI equivalent salinity range from 1 to 18 wt. %. UST-quartz at Undur Tsakhir consisting of thinly laminated crenulate quartz layers and K-feldspar-rich aplitic layers. Aplitic layers are strongly altered by seritization. Two sample collected and described in this study contain molybdenite within the UST-bearing aplite layers. Based on CL studies three types quartz were distinguished in Undur Tsakhir: (I) phenocryst quartz showing strong growth zoning in aplite. (II) Mosaic of euhedrally quartz. (III) Spider and cobwed texture. Crystallization temperatures determined by Ti-in-quartz geothermometer of all type quartz range between around 493 ° and 756 °C. Fluid inclusions in UST-quartz from Undur Tsakhir mainly consists of three phase fluid inclusions. The homogenization temperature of CO 2 -bearing fluid inclusions of UST-quartz from Undur Tsakhir range from 198 to 398 °C with NaCI equivalent salinity ranging from 1 to 14 wt. %. Differences in morphology of phases among the various layers suggest changing condition of growth from undercooled melt. When the T and P were fluctuating, volatile activity increased and resulted in the UST. During the post magmatic stage, the closed system was opened and hydrothermal activity took place; the volatile and metal-rich fluid resulted in ore mineralization. 博士（資源学）秋田大...|$|E
