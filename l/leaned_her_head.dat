6000|$|Hours fly! it is Morn; he {{has left}} the bed of love! She follows him with a {{strained}} eye when his figure is no longer seen; she <b>leans</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> upon <b>her</b> arm. She is faithful {{to him as the}} lake to the mountain! ...|$|R
5000|$|Accept a Friendly Shoulder?: During this skit, {{there are}} two women chatting, {{and one of them}} tells a problem. Ombro Amigo (Friendly Shoulder) comes near the woman, just to <b>her</b> <b>lean</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on his shoulder. When she does that, he says [...] "Não perco uma!" [...] ("I don't miss even one!") ...|$|R
60|$|While he {{was still}} {{laughing}} he released her hand and she <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on it again without haste. She had never looked at him once.|$|E
6000|$|At last utterly {{overcome}} she <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{against my}} arm, {{closed her eyes}} and said, [...] "Take me home. I can't stand any more of it." ...|$|E

50|$|Still {{holding on}} to the pearl {{necklace}}, Joy pleads with Violet to reach out and take her hand. Instead Violet <b>leans</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back; the necklace shatters and Violet's feet slip, causing her to fall backwards down the stairs. Violet lies motionless {{at the bottom of the}} stairs, lifeless. Joy calmly exits the mansion. The loss of her entire family circle is saddening, but it may provide her with the opportunity to begin anew, and leave behind the darkness of her family past.|$|R
6000|$|Jac. Oh! perhaps not! [...] But then I {{might have}} sworn it.

60|$|The cook (divested of his decorations) and the Marquis lingered for {{a moment}} {{in the shadow of the}} grub wagon. The Marquis <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> against his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> wearily {{against his}} shoulder, {{and her body}} shivered with {{recurrent}} nervousness. He waited for a {{time for her to}} speak, and then went on.|$|E
60|$|The woman <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> for {{a moment}} against {{the tips of her}} slim and beautifully cared for fingers. She looked steadfastly across the table at her vis-à-vis.|$|E
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> small, {{delicate}} <b>head</b> upon <b>her</b> {{hand and}} began swaying her feet slowly backwards and forwards.|$|R
6000|$|ALBERTO. In a minute, my darling. There, there, poor Lucrezia. (He puts an arm round her, {{kisses her}} hair and neck. LUCREZIA <b>leans</b> <b>her</b> bowed <b>head</b> against his chest. The sound of {{footsteps}} is heard. They both look up with scared, wide-open eyes.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night," [...] murmured {{the young}} Student, [...] "and my love {{will be of}} the company. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will <b>lean</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Maresfield <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on {{one side}} and seemed almost wistful. [...] "Not even at my sister's ball? She's to have {{something}} next week. She'll write to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Marcia locked {{both her}} hands through Bartley's arm, and <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on his shoulder. Neither spoke for some minutes; then he asked, [...] "Marcia, {{do you know}} where you are?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Baroness <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{upon the}} back of her chair and closed her eyes, as if she were tired. Then opening them again, [...] "Your cousin is very charming!" [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|When {{twilight}} came {{she went}} out to the front steps and <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> aching <b>head</b> against the honeysuckle trellis. The sun had just set and the whole world swam in dusky golden light. The wonderful beauty frightened her. She felt like a blot on it.|$|R
60|$|The farther she {{got from}} home the shabbier her gown seemed {{and the more}} {{impossible}} her coat and hat. At last, as we were leaving Minneapolis {{on our way to}} Osage she <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> tired <b>head</b> against me and sobbed out a wild wish to go home.|$|R
60|$|The Misses Farquhar made {{particular}} pets of Fred and Sophy, to {{whom they}} undertook to give lessons twice a-week in writing and geography; and Mrs. Farquhar devised many treats for the little ones. Patty's treat was to stay at home, or walk about with her papa; and when he sat by the fire in an evening, after the other children were gone to bed, she would bring a stool, and, placing it against his feet, would sit down upon it and <b>lean</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> against his knee. Then his hand would rest on that fair head, and he would feel that Milly's love was not quite gone out of his life.|$|R
6000|$|Claire <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on her hand, thought hard. [...] "It's I who wasn't friendly," [...] she propounded to her father. [...] "How much I've been losing. Though I still {{refuse to}} like that coffee!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{can never}} do it!' she cried at last, and <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> against the loom and wept; {{but at that}} instant the door opened, and there entered, one behind another, a {{procession}} of cats.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're sick of me, I {{know you}} are!" [...] She <b>leaned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{on the window}} pane. Her eyes closed. [...] "Oh, I wish my heart would stop beating!" [...] she said, in a low tone.|$|E
60|$|But {{ever and}} again as she {{strengthened}} her resolution, her thoughts would run from her, carrying {{her back to the}} sweet rapture of some moment in which the man had been gracious to her; and even while she was struggling to teach herself to hate him, she would <b>lean</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on one side, as though by doing so she might once more touch his brow with hers; and unconsciously she would put out her fingers, as though they might find their way into his hand. And then she would draw them back with a shudder, as though recoiling from the touch of an adder.|$|R
60|$|Every day the fair-haired cousins came to Linda's bedside, {{and whispered}} to her with their soft voices, {{and looked at her}} with their soft eyes, and touched her with their soft hands. Linda would kiss their plump arms and <b>lean</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> against them, and would find a very paradise of {{happiness}} in this late revelation of human love. As she lay a-dying she must have known that the world had been very hard to her, and that her aunt's teaching had indeed crushed her,--body as well as spirit. But she made no complaint; and at last, when the full summer had come, she died at Cologne in Madame Staubach's arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to me, Madeline, and sit here. We shall talk better then." [...] And {{the mother}} made room {{beside her on}} the sofa for her daughter, and Madeline, running over, <b>leaned</b> with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> upon <b>her</b> mother's shoulder. [...] "Well, darling; what did he say? Did he tell you that he loved you?" ...|$|R
