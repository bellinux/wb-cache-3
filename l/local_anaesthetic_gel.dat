40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of self-treatment in men with new episode non gonococcal urethritis (NGU). METHOD [...] Three hundred consecutive men with new episode NGU attending an open access genitourinary medicine clinic were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Details of treatment used before attending the clinic were obtained. RESULTS [...] Thirty (10 %) men had used treatment, {{for an average of}} 7 days, prior to the clinic attendance. Agents used included antibiotics (11), savion or iodine (4), vitamin tablets (4), cisapride (2), <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>gel</b> (2), antiseptic cream (2), cod liver oil (1), ferrous sulphate (1), naproxen (1), clotrimazole cream (1) and a poultice (1). Over 70 % of the men reporting antibiotic use had self-medicated and in one case a fixed drug eruption had ensued. CONCLUSION [...] A significant number of men with NGU self-treat. In addition to the adverse effects of such treatment and the potential effect on culture tests, clinic attendance may be postponed, the use of appropriate therapy delayed, and sexual contacts will remain at risk. Early attendance for treatment and contact tracing is essential and should be actively promoted...|$|E

We conducted a study to identify the best location and optimum volume of anaesthetic agent {{in order to achieve}} best pain relief and cooperation from our patients. We also assessed the need for <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>gel</b> for probe lubrication and if the number of cores during biopsy makes a difference in the pain score. A total of 386 patients were randomised into 4 groups i. e. no anaesthesia (Group A), 10 cc 1 % Lignocaine at apical region of prostate (Group B), 5 cc 1 % Lignocaine each at both bases (Group C) and lastly, 4 cc at apex and 3 cc each at both bases (Group D). Pain assessment was performed using the 10 -point Visual Analog Scale after the procedure with regard to probe insertion and during the biopsy. The groups were comparable in number and mean age. Group B recorded the lowest mean pain score of 2. 59. Comparative analysis showed significant pain relief when comparing Group B vs. Group A (P = 0. 001). The other groups were not as effective. The overall mean pain score for the probe insertion and the number of cores during biopsy was also not significant. We suggest that a 10 cc 1 % Lignocaine infiltration at the apical region of the prostate be used to obtain best pain relief during this procedure. Plain lubricant jelly is sufficient for probe insertion. There is no need to alter the anaesthetic requirement if number of cores is increased...|$|E

40|$|Background. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> {{are known}} to induce {{apoptosis}} in clinically relevant concentrations. Hitherto, it is unknown what determines the apoptotic potency of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics.</b> Therefore, we compared apoptosis induction by <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> related to their physicochemical properties in human neuronal cells. Methods. Neuroblastoma cells (SHEP) were incubated with eight <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics,</b> two of the ester and six of the amide types. At least, five concentrations of each <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> were evaluated. After incubation for 24 h, rates of cells in early apoptotic stages and overall cell death were evaluated by annexin V and 7 -amino-actinomycin D double staining by flow cytometry. The concentrations that led to half-maximal neurotoxic effects (LD 50) were calculated and compared for all <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics.</b> Results. All <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> were neurotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner. All drugs induced similar rates of early apoptotic cell formation at low concentrations, whereas at high concentrations, late apoptotic or necrotic cell death predominated. Comparison of LD 50 values of the different <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> resulted {{in the following order}} of apoptotic potency from high to low toxicity: tetracaine>bupivacaine>prilocaine=mepivacaine=ropivacaine>lidocaine>proc aine=articaine. The toxicity correlated with octanol/buffer coefficients and also with experimental potency of the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic,</b> but was unrelated to the structure (ester or amide type). Conclusions. All commonly used <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> induce neuronal apoptosis in clinically used concentrations.

40|$|This review {{seeks to}} address 10 {{essential}} {{questions regarding the}} clinical use of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics.</b> Each <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> has distinctive physicochemical properties but with the same mode of action; they block voltage-gated sodium channels in the axon. Sodium channel block is brought about by a conformational change {{and the creation of}} a positive charge in the channel pore. Different <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> can reach the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> binding site in the axon from the cytoplasmic compartment (classic hydrophilic pathway), or directly via its lipid membrane (hydrophobic pathway), or can enter via large-pore channels (alternative hydrophilic pathway). Beyond the nervous system, <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> exert beneficial effects on pain and can affect the inflammatory response and the haemostatic system. There are problems with the efficacy of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> in the presence of local inflammation, and with significant intravascular toxicity, which can be fatal. But when preventive measures are taken, the incidence of cardiac arrest is low. Intralipid has been proposed to treat systemic <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> overdose and has been enthusiastically adopted worldwide, even though the mechanism of action is incompletely understood. Intralipid is an aid to the management of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> toxicity rather than an antidote and meticulous conduct of regional anaesthesia remains paramount. All <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> are toxic, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, on virtually all tissues, including nerves and muscles. The question of whether <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> protect against perioperative tumour progression cannot be answered at this moment, and results from clinical (retrospective) studies are equivocal. Future areas of interest will be the design of new subtype-specific sodium channel blockers, but as we look forward, older <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> such as 2 -chloroprocaine are being reintroduced into the clinical setting. Multimodal perineural analgesia and liposomal bupivacaine may replace catheter techniques for some indication...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{social and economic}} pressure to improve the welfare of animals in our care. In the present study plasma cortisol concentrations were measured to assess the pain-induced distress caused by ring castration plus tailing in lambs and dehorning in calves {{and the extent to}} which the distress caused by these procedures can be reduced by using different alleviation strategies. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> injected into the neck of the scrotum just before ring application significantly reduced the cortisol response to ring castration plus tailing in lambs, but <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> injected into the testes just after ring application only marginally reduced this response. A castration clamp was applied across the full width of the scrotum of lambs for 6 or 10 seconds after ring castration plus tailing to disable the innervation from the scrotal area. The application of the castration clamp for 6 seconds after placement of the ring did not reduce the cortisol response to ring castration plus tailing, whereas application for 10 seconds slightly, but significantly, reduced the peak cortisol concentration. Healing of the castration wound was not complicated by the application of the castration clamp after ring castration plus tailing. Therefore injecting <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> into the neck of the scrotum just before ring castration plus tailing significantly alleviates the pain-induced distress associated with ring castration plus tailing, but applying the castration clamp in combination with ring castration plus tailing has little benefit. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> given prior to dehorning virtually abolishes the cortisol response to dehorning for the duration of action of the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic,</b> but once the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wears off cortisol concentrations increase resulting in a delayed cortisol response equivalent to the overall cortisol response to dehorning when <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> is not used. This delayed cortisol response is thought to be stimulated by inflammation-related pain. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ketoprofen and phenylbutazone and an endogenous cortisol surge stimulated by iniecting ACTH were used to assess whether this delayed cortisol response is associated with inflammation-related pain. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> (5 hour duration of action) plus ketoprofen given prior to scoop dehorning marginally reduced the delayed cortisol response observed once the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wore off, but giving <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> and phenylbutazone prior to dehorning had no significant effect on this delayed cortisol response. The antinociceptive action and a greater anti-inflammatory potency of ketoprofen compared to phenylbutazone may explain why ketoprofen was more effective than phenylbutazone in reducing this delayed cortisol response. ACTH plus <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> given prior to dehorning only marginally reduced the delayed cortisol response observed once the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wore off, suggesting that the delayed cortisol response seen when the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wears off is not due primarily to inflammation-related pain Giving <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> prior to dehorning and cauterising the amputation wounds prevented the delayed cortisol response after the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wore off and significantly reduced the overall cortisol response to dehorning. Thus, in the present study long acting <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> (5 hour duration of action) in combination with NSAIDs had minimal alleviating effects on the pain-induced distress caused by dehorning compared to <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> alone, but <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> and cautery provided effective pain-relief...|$|R

Generalised toxic symptoms which appeared after the local anaesthesia are rare, but potentially are lethal complications.

30|$|Intraperitoneal {{administration}} of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> has been evaluated for several different laparoscopic procedures [25 – 29]. It {{is based on}} the theory that the instillation of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> in the peritoneal cavity blocks the visceral afferent signalling, thereby resulting in reduced nociception [30]. The literature presented in this review does not support the use of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> for SP reduction in benign gynaecological laparoscopy. None of the studies could demonstrate a reduction in incidence, and only two out of six studies reported a significant reduction in the severity of SP [10, 14]. Despite this, three out of six studies found a significant reduction of post-operative analgesic consumption [10, 11, 14]. The present evidence does not support a widespread use of intraperitoneal <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> in benign gynaecological laparoscopy for reduction of SP. Besides a local effect in the peritoneal cavity, the analgesic effect of intraperitoneal <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> could also be mediated through systemic absorption. There are measurable plasma levels of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> shortly after intraperitoneal administration due to absorption over the peritoneal surface. A potential risk with {{administration of}} intraperitoneal <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> is that the dosage is difficult to control. Although plasma levels of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> have been reported to be close to and above safe threshold, no clinical toxicity or adverse effects have thus far been reported [31].

Before and for 45 min after, the injection of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> touch perception, pin prick, motor strength and skin temperature were tested by a blinded investigator in the areas supplied by the median, musculocutaneous, radial and ulnar nerves. There were no differences in the onset of block between the groups. Thus, the frequency-dependent action of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> could not be demonstrate...|$|R
50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> may be instilled {{into the}} space between Tenon's capsule and the sclera to provide {{anaesthesia}} for eye surgery, principally cataract surgery. After applying <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> drops to anaesthetise the conjunctiva, a small fold of conjunctiva is lifted off the eyeball and an incision made. A blunt, curved cannula is passed through the incision into the periscleral lymph space and a volume of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> solution is instilled. The advantages are a reduced risk of bleeding and of penetration of the globe, compared to peribulbar and retrobulbar approaches. Akinesia (paralysis of the external eye muscles) may be less complete, however.|$|R
