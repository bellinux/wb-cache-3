40|$|The {{spate of}} cases {{dealing with the}} {{question}} of whether a liquidator can treat the costs of any litigation that she initiates or pursues in the exercise of her statutory functions as a <b>liquidation</b> <b>expense</b> payable in priority to other creditors shows no sign of abating. This is hardly surprising bearing in mind that a number of issues were left unresolved by the Court of Appeal in Re Floor Fourteen Ltd, Lewis v Inland Revenue Commissioners. One such case, Re Demaglass Ltd, Lewis v Dempster {{is the subject of this}} note. The likely implications of the Insolvency (Amendment) (No. 2) Rules 2002 are also briefly considered...|$|E
40|$|There {{is now an}} {{extensive}} literature chronicling the barriers that liquidators face in trying to bring avoidance proceedings under the Insolvency Act 1986. One such barrier is {{the treatment of the}} liquidator's legal costs. Broadly speaking, the liquidator is entitled to an indemnity out of the company's assets in relation to the costs incurred should the action fail. However, the value of the indemnity depends on whether the costs are treated as an expense of the liquidation ranking for payment ahead of preferential creditors and any floating charge. In Re MC Bacon (No. 2), Millett J. held that the liquidator could not recoup the costs of an unsuccessful action against the defendant bank as a <b>liquidation</b> <b>expense.</b> The liquidator contended that his costs should be treated as an expense “properly chargeable or incurred by … the liquidator in preserving, realising or getting in any assets of the company” within rule 4. 218 (1) (a) of the Insolvency Rules 1986...|$|E

5000|$|... is a UK {{insolvency}} law case, concerning {{the priority of}} claims in a liquidation. Under English law {{at the time the}} <b>expenses</b> of <b>liquidation</b> took priority over the preferred creditors, and the preferred creditors took priority over the claims of the holder of a floating charge. However, a crystallised floating charge theoretically took priority over the <b>liquidation</b> <b>expenses.</b> Accordingly the courts had to try and reconcile the apparent triangular conflict between priorities.|$|R
50|$|After {{the closure}} of the bank the first {{impression}} of the public was that Palai Central Bank had failed. They assumed foul play. When the Finance Minister of the country states in Parliament that the bank's deposits had hardly 15% asset backing, the people had no reason to disbelieve. They had to wait for years to know that even after bearing several years of <b>liquidation</b> <b>expenses,</b> the depositors got more than 90% of their money - but in petty instalments. The people knew only then that as a going concern, the bank could very well have repaid its depositors fully.|$|R
5000|$|Under the Plan, all of {{the assets}} of Apex Silver, other than a small cash reserve for the payment of <b>liquidation</b> <b>expenses,</b> were {{transferred}} to Golden Minerals Company, a Delaware corporation that is Apex Silver’s successor, who emerged from Chapter 11 on March 24, 2009. Apex Silver was being liquidated in accordance with Cayman Islands law. Golden Minerals is virtually the same company as Apex, but without being the owner of San Cristóbal and without the debt. Golden Minerals resides in Golden, Colorado. Golden Minerals owns and controls {{a large number of}} exploration properties located primarily in the high potential mining districts in Latin America, including the feasibility stage El Quevar Project in northern Argentina.|$|R

50|$|A British force under Sir Hugh Gough {{moved on}} Gwalior, {{and crossed the}} Chambal in December 1843. On 29 December {{followed}} the simultaneous battles of Panniar and Maharajpur, in which the Gwalior army was annihilated. A treaty was then made, under which certain lands {{to the value of}} 1.8 million, including Chanderi District, were ceded for the upkeep of a contingent force, besides other lands for the <b>liquidation</b> of the <b>expenses</b> incurred in the late war, the State army was reduced, and a Council of Regency was appointed during the minority, to act under the residents advice.|$|R
