Lane Top National School opened in 1840 and Chowbent Unitarian School and Hindsford St Anne's in 1860. Howe Bridge School opened in 1869 and St Philip's a year later. An undenominational school in Lee Street opened in 1871 followed by St George's and Sacred Heart School in Hindsford in 1873. In the 1890s, the technical school originally opened as a school for science and art, followed by St Richard's in 1891 and Flapper Fold Higher Grade School in 1893. Green Hall Special School opened in 1957, and a new infant school was opened on Lodge Lane for Sacred Heart. Meadowbank Primary School {{can also be found}} on Flapper Fold <b>Lane,</b> <b>marking</b> the boundary between Atherton and Hag Fold. Hesketh Fletcher Senior School opened in 1967 and closed on 31 August 2011. Atherton Community School opened in 2012.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLane {{detection}} {{plays an}} important role in vision based intelligent vehicle systems. A new lane detection method based on <b>lane</b> <b>mark</b> segment features and general a priori knowledge is proposed in this paper. Instead of detecting each feature point separately from limited local view, a <b>lane</b> <b>mark</b> segment detection method is designed for detecting each <b>lane</b> <b>mark</b> segment on the whole. Some a priori knowledge which is quite general for real traffic scenarios is used in the <b>lane</b> <b>mark</b> segment detection method as well as in the part of model fitting. The tracking process which ensures detection stability and robustness is carried out in the framework of particle filtering. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated based on the test on thousands of road images; these road images include scenarios with many kinds of uncertainties such as variation of lighting condition, existence of leading vehicles etc. The research direction for further improvements is also discusse...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this report, we {{introduce}} a mono-vision based lane detection method (pure mono-vision without the aide {{of any other}} sensor). The lane detection method consists of the sub-parts of <b>lane</b> <b>mark</b> segment extraction, <b>lane</b> model fitting, and lane tracking. The <b>lane</b> <b>mark</b> segment extractor is based on some criteria that are only related to the inherent physical properties of the <b>lane</b> <b>marks.</b> The <b>lane</b> model is parameterized in the world (the ground plane) reference instead of in the image reference. The lane tracking is {{carried out in the}} framework of the particle filter, including the evolution and the update of the lane state; a mechanism that executes on-line estimation of the vehicle pitch angle is naturally incorporated in the lane tracking process. Read-data tests are given to demonstrate the performance of the mono-vision based lane detection method.
