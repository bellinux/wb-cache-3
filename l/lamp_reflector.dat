60|$|This is {{essentially}} a theatrical neighbourhood. There is not a potboy in the vicinity who is not, {{to a greater or}} less extent, a dramatic character. The errand-boys and chandler’s-shop-keepers’ sons, are all stage-struck: they ‘gets up’ plays in back kitchens hired for the purpose, and will stand before a shop-window for hours, contemplating a great staring portrait of Mr. Somebody or other, of the Royal Coburg Theatre, ‘as he appeared in the character of Tongo the Denounced.’ The consequence is, {{that there is not a}} marine-store shop in the neighbourhood, which does not exhibit for sale some faded articles of dramatic finery, such as three or four pairs of soiled buff boots with turn-over red tops, heretofore worn by a ‘fourth robber,’ or ‘fifth mob;’ a pair of rusty broadswords, a few gauntlets, and certain resplendent ornaments, which, if they were yellow instead of white, might be taken for insurance plates of the Sun Fire-office. There are several of these shops in the narrow streets and dirty courts, of which there are so many near the national theatres, and they all have tempting goods of this description, with the addition, perhaps, of a lady’s pink dress covered with spangles; white wreaths, stage shoes, and a tiara like a tin <b>lamp</b> <b>reflector.</b> They have been purchased of some wretched supernumeraries, or sixth-rate actors, and are now offered for the benefit of the rising generation, who, on condition of making certain weekly payments, amounting in the whole to about ten times their value, may avail themselves of such desirable bargains.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{methods are}} usually {{performed}} for ideal conditions {{to determine the}} illuminance and luminance but other design limitations {{should be considered in}} the real world. Also the visibility level is calculated by using background and target luminance under ideal conditions. In reality, there are many factors, which are very difficult to predict and include in lighting design equation. Human eye is also a complex device it is difficult to accurately design an outdoor illumination system just simply based on numerous theoretical assumptions. RP- 8 is using for theoretical calculation of light distribution on pavement. This calculation method needs to include some correction constant for parameters such as pavement is not level, maintenance for cleaning, aging lamps <b>lamp</b> <b>reflector</b> and refractor is not centered, lamp is off center and tilted, pole is not vertical to the pavement, voltage fluctuation, photodetectors response, ambient temperature factors, reliability of illuminaires, roads crowned, and superelevation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{automotive}} lamp designs {{have resulted}} in a more compact, aerodynamic packaging and the use of less expensive plastic materials for the lens and housing. The smaller packaging and lower melting point of plastics have increased the need for a predictive tool for simulating the lamp temperature rise under operating conditions. The modeling of lamps requires sophisticated analysis tools incorporating computational fluid dynamics and specular radiation. These tools use a finite element method to solve a system of non-linear equations for velocity, pressure and temperature. In addition to the non-linearity, the complex parabolic shape of the <b>lamp</b> <b>reflector</b> and lens requires very powerful mesh generation capability in order to produce an adequately refined mesh. The lamp modeling is performed in two stages. First the model is generated by importing CAD data from Pro/ENGINEER or Unigraphics into the MSC/PATRAN preprocessor. The surfaces are then meshed with triangular elements which are used as a seed for creating the air volume and lamp solid wall tetrahedral element meshes. The use of the new MSC/PATRAN hybrid tetrahedral mesher has enabled the creation of very complex 3 D element meshes to represent fluid volumes with several hundred thousand elements. MSC/PATRAN has become a common pre/post-processor for many analysis codes because of the open CAE environment, advanced meshing capability, ease of applying loads and boundary conditions and effective post-processing capability for displaying results. 1 1...|$|E

Tungsten halogen lamps have an efficacy of 12-22 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-4000 hours.
