40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the genetic diversity of morphological traits in 121 genotypes of lima, red and pinto beans, and to study the relation between characters, and to get better understanding of factors affecting the interaction between characters by multivariate analysis, an experiment was conducted in 1997 as a simple lattice design at the Research Station of Agricultural College, Isfahan University of Technology. High variability was observed among genotypes for all characters studied. The phenotypic coefficients of variability were greater than the genotypic ones for all the traits. Among the characters studied seed yield, number of pods per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem, length of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem, number of nodes per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem, 100 -seed weight and number of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> had the highest genotypic and phenotypic variability, while days to maturity had the lowest variability. Traits relative to <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> were more variable than the same traits in the main stem. Factor analysis for all the genotypes and, separately, for lima, red, pinto, determinate and indeterminate genotypes revealed 4 factors which justified more than 78. 4 {{percent of the total}} variation. The results of the analysis based on all the genotypes showed that the first factor was mostly correlated to days to maturity, length of main stem and <b>lateral</b> <b>branches,</b> number of nodes per main stem and <b>lateral</b> <b>branches,</b> which was named “vegetative factor”. The second and third factors had the highest correlations with number of pods per main stem and <b>lateral</b> <b>branches,</b> number of seeds per pod in the main stem and branches and 100 -seed weight, which were named “yield component factors”. The fourth factor showed the highest correlation with number of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and was named for this trait. The first and fourth factors were related to vegetative growth characteristics and physiological source. The second and third factors were related to physiological sink. On the basis of stepwise regression analysis, number of pods per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> was the most important component of yield, and number of pods per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem had the next following ranks. Number of pods per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem had the highest relationships with yield...|$|R
40|$|Herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) is an {{emerging}} high-grade cut flower worldwide, {{which is usually}} used in wedding bouquets and known as the “wedding flower”. However, abundant <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> appear frequently in some excellent cultivars, {{and a lack of}} a method to remove Paeonia lactiflora <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> other than inefficient artificial methods is an obstacle for improving the quality of its cut flowers. In this study, paclobutrazol (PBZ) application was found to inhibit the growth of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> in Paeonia lactiflora for the first time, including 96. 82 % decreased lateral bud number per branch, 77. 79 % and 42. 31 % decreased length and diameter of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches,</b> respectively, declined cell wall materials and changed microstructures. Subsequently, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology was used for quantitative proteomics analysis of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> under PBZ application and control. The results indicated that 178 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) successfully obtained, 98 DEPs were up-regulated and 80 DEPs were down-regulated.

About a century later, its unity was finally shattered by the aggressive in Persia based rivalling Turkic federations; the Kara Koyunlu, and the Ak Koyunlu. By 1490/91, the once powerful monarchy fragmented into three independent kingdoms – Kartli (central to eastern Georgia), Kakheti (eastern Georgia), and Imereti (western Georgia) – each led by a rival branch of the Bagrationi dynasty, and into five semi-independent principalities – Odishi, Mingrelia, Guria, Abkhazia, Svaneti, and Samtskhe – dominated by their own feudal clans.|$|E

60|$|It is {{necessary}} to explain {{that one of the}} adjuncts to Hurdy-Gurdy--one to which that metropolis became afterward itself an adjunct--was a cemetery. In {{the first week of the}} camp's existence this had been thoughtfully laid out by a committee of citizens. The day after had been signalized by a debate between two members of the committee, with reference to a more eligible site, and on the third day the necropolis was inaugurated by a double funeral. As the camp had waned the cemetery had waxed; and long before the ultimate inhabitant, victorious alike over the insidious malaria and the forthright revolver, had turned the tail of his pack-ass upon Injun Creek the outlying settlement had become a populous if not popular suburb. And now, when the town was fallen into the sere and yellow leaf of an unlovely senility, the graveyard--though somewhat marred by time and circumstance, and not altogether exempt from innovations in grammar and experiments in orthography, to say nothing of the devastating coyote--answered the humble needs of its denizens with reasonable completeness. It comprised a generous two acres of ground, which with commendable thrift but needless care had been selected for its mineral unworth, contained two or three skeleton trees (one of which had a stout <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> from which a weather-wasted rope still significantly dangled), half a hundred gravelly mounds, a score of rude headboards displaying the literary peculiarities above mentioned and a struggling colony of prickly pears.

It was in the most thickly settled part of this interesting demesne that Mr. Jefferson Doman staked off his claim.

60|$|On the Nature of the Tissues {{through which}} the Motor Impulse is Transmitted.--It will be {{necessary}} first to describe briefly {{the course of the}} main fibro-vascular bundles. These are shown in the accompanying sketch (fig. 11) of a small leaf. Little vessels from the neighbouring bundles enter all the many tentacles with which the surface is studded; but these are not here represented. The central trunk, which runs up the footstalk, bifurcates near the centre of the leaf, each branch bifurcating again and again according {{to the size of the}} leaf. This central trunk sends off, low down on each side, a delicate branch, which may be called the sublateral branch. There is also, on each side, a main <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> or bundle, which bifurcates in the same manner as the others. Bifurcation does not imply that any single vessel divides, but that a bundle [page 248] divides into two. By looking to either side of the leaf, it will be seen that a branch from the great central bifurcation inosculates with a branch from the lateral bundle, and that there is a smaller inosculation between the two chief branches of the lateral bundle. The course of the vessels is very complex at the larger inosculation; and here vessels, retaining the same diameter, are often formed by the union of the bluntly pointed ends of two vessels, but whether these points open into each other by their attached surfaces, I do not know. By means of the two inosculations all the vessels on the same side of the leaf are brought into some sort of connection. Near the circumference of the larger leaves the bifurcating branches also come into close union, and then separate again, forming a continuous zigzag line of vessels round the whole circumference. But the union of the vessels in this zigzag line seems to be much less intimate than at the main inosculation. It should be added that the course of the vessels differs somewhat in different leaves, and even on opposite sides of the same leaf, but the main inosculation is always present.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the thirteenth}} chapter various peloric flowers were described, and their {{production}} {{was shown to}} be due either to arrested development, or to reversion to a primordial condition. Moquin-Tandon has remarked that the flowers which stand on {{the summit of the}} main stem or of a <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> are more liable to become peloric than those on the sides (26/13. 'Teratologie Veg.' page 192.); and he adduces, amongst other instances, that of Teucrium campanulatum. In another Labiate plant grown by me, viz., the Galeobdolon luteum, the peloric flowers were always produced on the summit of the stem, where flowers are not usually borne. In Pelargonium, a SINGLE flower in the truss is frequently peloric, and when this occurs I have during several years invariably observed it to be the central flower. This is of such frequent occurrence that one observer (26/14. 'Journal of Horticulture' July 2, 1861 page 253.) gives the names of ten varieties flowering at the same time, in every one of which the central flower was peloric. Occasionally more than one flower in the truss is peloric, and then of course the additional ones must be lateral. These flowers are interesting as showing how the whole structure is correlated. In the common Pelargonium the upper sepal is produced into a nectary which coheres with the flower-peduncle; the two upper petals differ a little in shape from the three lower ones, and are marked with dark shades of colour; the stamens are graduated in length and upturned. In the peloric flowers, the nectary aborts; all the petals become alike both in shape and colour; the stamens are generally reduced in number and become straight, so that the whole flower resembles that of the allied genus Erodium. The correlation between these changes is well shown when one of the two upper petals alone loses its dark mark, for in this case the nectary does not entirely abort, but is usually much reduced in length. (26/15. It would be worth trial to fertilise with the same pollen the central and lateral flowers of the pelargonium, or of other highly cultivated plants, protecting them of course from insects: then to sow the seed separately, and observe whether the one or the other lot of seedlings varied the most.) ...|$|E
