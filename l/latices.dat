40|$|A {{methodology}} {{developed to}} obtain rate coefficients for entry and exit (desorption) in emulsion polymerizations {{was applied to}} systems stabilized electrosterically by a copolymer of acrylic acid and styrene embedded in a styrene seed particle. This was grown as a second-stage procedure, by adding styrene and acrylic acid to a styrene seed and then polymerizing. Rate coefficients for entry (ρ) and exit (k) for subsequent homopolymerization of the resulting <b>latices</b> with styrene {{were obtained from the}} time dependence of the approach to steady state using both chemical and γ-radiolytic initiation; the latter was used in relaxation mode, which measures k directly. Compared to the same <b>latices</b> with an electrostatic stabilizer, at pH 7 the electrosteric stabilizer greatly reduced both ρ and k. When ionic strength was increased, ρ increased relative to that found for electrosterically stabilized latex in the absence of added electrolyte. For electrostatically-stabilized <b>latices,</b> entry is supposed to occur by aqueous-phase propagation to a critical degree of polymerization z which then undergoes irreversible entry; the present data for electrostatically-stabilized <b>latices</b> support this model, including its prediction that ρ be independent of particle size, all other things being equal. The decrease in ρ in the electrosterically-stabilized <b>latices</b> is ascribed to a "hairy" layer through which diffusion of a z-mer is slow, so that it may be terminated prior to actual entry. For electrostatically-stabilized <b>latices,</b> exit is supposed to occur by transfer, resulting in a monomeric radical which exits by diffusing through the aqueous phase, this event competing with intraparticle propagation; the decrease k in the electrosterically-stabilized <b>latices</b> (also seen in other polymerically-stabilized systems) can be interpreted by assuming that aqueous-phase diffusion slower in the hairy layer...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop photon migration as a potential tool for the on-line characterization of particulate suspensions. In this study, the process of determining the particle size distribution and volume fraction a colloidal suspension by the inversion of frequency domain photon migration measurements of the isotropic scattering coefficient is demonstrated on dilute and concentrated polystyrene <b>latices</b> and titanium dioxide suspensions. Measurements were performed at wavelengths between 450 nm and 835 nm on unimodal polystyrene <b>latices</b> with mean diameters between 100 nm and 600 nm. The volume fractions of the <b>latices</b> ranged from 1 % to 35 %.

Frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) has the advantage of self-calibration which makes it suitable for on-line measurement.

40|$|Water-based <b>latices,</b> {{used in the}} {{production}} of internal liners for beer/beverage cans, were investigated using a number of analytical techniques. The epoxy-graft-acrylic polymers, used to prepare the <b>latices,</b> and films, produced from those <b>latices,</b> were also examined. It was confirmed that acrylic polymer preferentially grafts onto higher molecular weight portions of the epoxy polymer. The amount of epoxy remaining ungrafted was determined to be 80 %. This figure is higher than was previously thought. Molecular weight distribution studies were carried out on the epoxy and epoxy-g-acrylic resins. A quantitative method for determining copolymer composition using GPC was evaluated. The GPC method was also used to determine polymer composition as a function of molecular weight. IR spectroscopy was used to determine the total level of acrylic modification of the polymers and NMR was used to determine the level of grafting. Particle size determinations were carried out using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Levels of stabilising amine greatly affected the viscosity of the latex, particle size and amount of soluble polymer but the core particle size, as determined using TEM, was unaffected. NMR spectra of the <b>latices</b> produced spectra only from solvents and amine modifiers. Using solid-state CP/MAS/freezing techniques spectra from the epoxy component could be observed. FT-IR spectra of the <b>latices</b> were obtained after special subtraction of water. The only difference between the spectra of the <b>latices</b> and those of the dry film were due to the presence of the solvents in the former. A distinctive morphology in the films produced from the <b>latices</b> was observed. This suggested that the micelle structure of the latex survives the film forming process.
