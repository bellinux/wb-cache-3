5|$|Games {{tended to}} be {{characterized}} by <b>low</b> <b>scores</b> and frequent punting, with crowds between 10,000 and 20,000; these numbers dropped off {{in the last two}} games of the era. A low scoring BC–Calgary game in Everett, Washington in 1967 drew just over 6,000; there would not be another CFL game in the United States until the cusp of US expansion itself in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Both sides made <b>low</b> <b>scores</b> {{in their}} first innings; Kimberley, who had opted to bat first, were {{dismissed}} for 98 runs, and in their reply Transvaal reached 117, a lead of just 19 runs. In the second innings, they both fared better; a century from Bernard Tancred helped Kimberley {{to a total of}} 235, but Transvaal reached their total in 38 five-ball overs, helped by a century from Monty Bowden.|$|E
5|$|Kohli had a {{slump in}} form when India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test {{which ended in}} a draw and {{averaged}} 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1. Kohli ended his streak of <b>low</b> <b>scores</b> by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. India came back and won the next two matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four years.|$|E

5|$|According to Kaga, upon release Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light {{received}} extensive {{criticism from}} Japanese publications, with many noting {{that it was}} difficult to understand and had fairly poor graphics, awarding it <b>low</b> <b>scores.</b> In contrast, popular opinion was more positive: in a poll taken by Family Computer Magazine, the game scored 23.48 points out of 30. Likewise, sales of the game were flat for the first two months of sales, but improved after word of mouth had spread. According to Kaga, a notable journalistic writer devoted a Famitsu column to the game, and this prompted sales to pick up around half a year after release. As of 2002, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light had sold 329,087 units, being the third best-selling title in the series to that date.|$|E
5|$|Bangladesh's second innings {{started in}} similar fashion to their first; they lost the early wicket of Imrul Kayes, and Tamim scored a quick half-century. The latter was dropped three times before being caught by Broad for 52 runs. Junaid and Jahurul both made good starts for Bangladesh, but were out for 34 and 43 respectively, which along with <b>low</b> <b>scores</b> for Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur left Bangladesh on 172 for six {{at the end of}} the fourth day. On the final morning, Shakib batted {{resiliently}} with the lower-order batsmen and narrowly missed out on a century; he was the last man out, stumped attempting to score a boundary to reach the landmark. His batting had helped establish a 208 run lead for Bangladesh, which resulted in England requiring just under four runs per over to reach the total.|$|E
5|$|Having {{broken through}} {{at the end}} of the {{preceding}} summer, Harvey played his first full season for Victoria in 1953-54. He scored two centuries and five half-centuries against full-strength teams from other states. He was hailed as the best player outside the Australian Test team, and at the start of the following season, Harvey was included in an Australian XI for a match against the touring England team for a Test trial match. However, rain curtailed the match and turned the playing surface into a sticky wicket hostile to batting. Harvey made only seven in his solitary innings. He played in all of Victoria's matches for the season, but his form slumped and he was overlooked for state selection until 1958-59, when he regained his position and made 97 and 86 in consecutive innings. However, the following season, he made only sporadic appearances and was dropped after some <b>low</b> <b>scores.</b> He shone mainly for Fitzroy; his club first-grade records for the most career runs and centuries, and the most runs in a season, still stand. He ended his first-grade career in 196061 with 19 centuries and 9,146 runs at an average of 36.15 from 247 matches.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lowest</b> <b>score</b> of {{the season}} was a record high 6.9 (45). The {{previous}} record high <b>lowest</b> <b>score</b> was 42 points in 1943.|$|R
50|$|Not much {{is known}} about the <b>lowest</b> <b>scores</b> from the Bamber Gascoigne series, except that the <b>lowest</b> <b>score</b> ever was amassed in 1971-2, when a Sussex team, fresh from two series wins, managed only 10 points. This is also the <b>lowest</b> <b>score</b> ever {{achieved}} on the programme. However, a <b>low</b> <b>score</b> was also achieved by Victoria University of Manchester in their first round match in 1975 when for much of the recording they answered only with the names of Marxists as a protest against the Oxford and Cambridge Colleges being able to enter separate teams.|$|R

5|$|In 1940, {{he began}} the year with 26 and two against Queensland, and then a 43 against New South Wales. A series of <b>low</b> <b>scores</b> {{followed}} until he hit a vein of strong form beginning in February of that year. He scored 63 against Western Australia on 16 February 1940 in his last match of the 193940 season. He began the following season with 41 in the following match against New South Wales. Hamence then enjoyed great success against Victoria, where he scored 130 and 103 not out in one inter-state match, and then 85 and 62 in the next. Following this, in a match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground between two representative selections {{to raise money for}} the war effort, he played for Don Bradman's XI and scored 73 and 35. He returned to play for South Australia for a match against New South Wales, where he scored 31 and five. He ended the 194041 season with the highest average for a single season he would achieve in his career, 569runs at 63.22, with two hundreds.|$|E
5|$|The brotherly trio {{was broken}} {{up for the}} match against Queensland, as Neil was {{selected}} for the Australian team. In his only innings, Ray scored 48 and appeared set for his maiden first-class half-century before being run out in a drawn match. He bowled eight overs for the season, conceding 32 runs without taking a wicket. Merv dropped after this match, and Ray made 9 and 15 alongside Neil in the next fixture against New South Wales, a six-wicket win. Ray played in the next match against Tasmania with none of his brothers alongside him, as Neil was again busy with the national team. Ray made two in his only innings in a ten-wicket win. Despite his run of <b>low</b> <b>scores,</b> he was retained as Neil and the other Test players returned; he made 25 and 10 as Victoria lost by four wickets in their final match of the season against South Australia. Ray ended his debut first-class season with 190 runs at a batting average of 21.11 with a best score of 48.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test at Lord's, {{the home of}} cricket. Before the match, Barnes wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century, and trained especially diligently in the lead-up to the Lord's fixture. He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match, and the refusal of the authorities at Lord's {{to allow him to}} practise there when he was in London a year earlier; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub. On the first morning, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, and Barnes continued his run of <b>low</b> <b>scores</b> since the First Test. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Len Hutton at short fine leg. Barnes tried to knock the short delivery through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton, and leaving Australia at 1/3. They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lowest</b> <b>score</b> was {{recorded}} by St. Peter's College in 1972 {{when they were}} bowled out for just 36. St Joseph’s college recorded their <b>lowest</b> <b>score</b> of 56 in 1938.|$|R
5|$|Hammond's health {{remained}} poor at {{the start}} of the 1935 season. He developed septic tonsillitis which made it difficult for him to breathe, eat and sleep, and ultimately required an operation to remove his tonsils in early 1936. Hammond's form was indifferent and he believed it was his worst season. In first-class matches, he scored 2,616 runs (average 49.35) and took 60 wickets (average 27.26). He became the ninth player to reach 100 first-class centuries, emerging from a run of bad form against Somerset. Long a regular in the side, for the first time he captained the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. In the five-Test series against South Africa, a run of <b>low</b> <b>scores</b> again brought press speculation about his place in the national side. He did not pass fifty until the third Test, when he scored 63 and 87 not out, ending a run of 22 innings without a fifty, in which time he averaged 23.47 over 14 Tests. Hammond made two more fifties in the last two Tests, although they were insufficient to prevent England from losing 1–0, their third successive series defeat. He finished the series with 389 runs at an average of 64.83, but remained unsatisfied with his form.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the Tests, Australia {{took on the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. Bradman's men batted first, and Miller came to {{the crease}} at 3/200. Sharing {{partnerships}} of 80 runs for the fourth wicket with Lindsay Hassett, 63 for the fifth with Brown and 155 with Ian Johnson for the sixth, Miller scored 163 runs in 250 minutes, hitting 20fours and three sixes. The Australians hit nine sixes off the off spin bowling of Jim Laker on the second morning of the match {{in an attempt to}} establish their mastery of him before the Test series. After Miller's dismissal, Australia were out for 552. With the ball, Miller and Lindwall attempted to maintain their ascendancy over Hutton, who was playing for MCC. On this occasion, he scored 52 and 64, but MCC were defeated by an innings and 158runs. Miller had figures of 3/28 and 1/37. He dismissed England Test batsman Bill Edrich, who had been a prolific scorer in recent English seasons, and was expected {{to be one of the}} key batsmen in the forthcoming Ashes series. Miller twice took the wicket of Jack Robertson, who was thought to be in contention for England selection; after two <b>low</b> <b>scores</b> against Miller, he was overlooked. In addition to his performance on the field, Miller solved some off-field problems. The MCC—which administered cricket at the time—provided him with legal assistance in his contract dispute with Rawtenstall Cricket Club. The Australian all-rounder had signed a contract to play for the club in the Lancashire League, but failed to honour it. Rawtenstall dropped the dispute after being offered compensation.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of <b>low</b> <b>scores,</b> and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E
