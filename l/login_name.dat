2500|$|Hackers {{would also}} use known {{software}} bugs to illicitly gain full administrative remote {{control over a}} computer, and install a hidden FTP service to host their wares. This FTP service was usually running on an unusual port number, or with a non-anonymous <b>login</b> <b>name</b> like [...] "login: warez / Password: warez" [...] to help prevent discovery by legitimate users; information about this compromised system would then be distributed to {{a select group of}} people who were part of the warez scene.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{the same}} <b>login</b> <b>name</b> and/or {{password}} for multiple accounts where one compromised account leads to other accounts being compromised.|$|E
50|$|Users could {{register}} any finger {{up to ten}} {{since the}} software has the capability to store all ten fingers for a single user. <b>Login</b> <b>names</b> and passwords associated with the registered finger prints are stored in a database located in the user's computer. When needed, the software interactively sends the <b>login</b> <b>names</b> and passwords to compatible applications and websites, {{which can be used}} to perform the login operation automatically.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on the script, {{this may}} expose the /etc/passwd file, which on Unix-like systems {{contains}} (among others) user IDs, their <b>login</b> <b>names,</b> home directory paths and shells. (See SQL injection {{for a similar}} attack.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Users {{can view}} IPs {{of people who}} write {{comments}} and guestbook messages on their site. <b>Login</b> <b>names</b> of visitors to a member's personal site are logged and stored in the member's [...] "Guests" [...] section. These options can be turned off.|$|R
5000|$|WELL members use a {{consistent}} <b>login</b> <b>name</b> when posting messages, and a non-fixed pseudonym field alongside it. The pseudonym (or [...] "pseud" [...] in WELL parlance) defaults to the user's real name, {{but can be}} changed at will and so often reflects a quotation from another user, or is an in-joke, or may be left blank. The user's real name can be easily looked-up using their <b>login</b> <b>name.</b> WELL members are not anonymous.|$|E
50|$|TNEF {{attachments}} {{can contain}} security-sensitive {{information such as}} user <b>login</b> <b>name</b> and file paths, from which access controls could possibly be inferred.|$|E
50|$|TMN {{requires}} {{registration and}} use of one's real name. TMN can only be accessed by registered users. TMN members use a consistent <b>login</b> <b>name</b> when posting messages, and a non-fixed pseudonym field alongside it. The pseudonym defaults to the user's real name, but can be changed at will but this is neither common nor is it encouraged. Although TMN is name based, the user's real name can be easily looked-up using their <b>login</b> <b>name.</b> TMN members are not anonymous.|$|E
5000|$|Password {{protection}} can {{be applied}} to reading, editing, uploading to and changing passwords for the restricted zone. The out-of-the box installation uses [...] "shared passwords" [...] rather than <b>login</b> <b>names,</b> but a built-in option can enable a sophisticated user/group based access control system on pages, groups of pages or the whole wiki.|$|R
40|$|For {{the person}} {{responsible}} for managing a UNIX system. A description of key management functions like: Bringing up the system and taking it down, creation of new <b>login</b> <b>names,</b> maintenance of file-store security, monitoring user resource usage, and machine performance considerations. Outlines of shell scripts and C programs for various system management function are given. All major versions, at the time, of UNIX and its derivatives are covere...|$|R
50|$|A key {{constraint}} {{applies to}} the set of tuples in a table at any given point in time. A key {{is not necessarily a}} unique identifier across the population of all possible instances of tuples that could be stored in a table but it does imply a data integrity rule that duplicates should not be allowed in the database table. Some possible examples of unique keys are Social Security Numbers, ISBNs, vehicle registration numbers or user <b>login</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R
50|$|Similarly {{when someone}} tries {{to log on}} a computer, they are usually first {{requested}} to identify themselves with a <b>login</b> <b>name</b> and support that with a password. Afterwards, this combination is checked against an existing login-password validity record to check if the combination is authentic. If so, the user becomes authenticated (i.e. the identification he supplied in step 1 is valid, or authentic). Finally, a set of pre-defined permissions and restrictions for that particular <b>login</b> <b>name</b> is assigned to this user, which completes the final step, authorization.|$|E
5000|$|Linking the {{information}} back together {{is the key}} to this system. In the relational model, some bit of information was used as a [...] "key", uniquely defining a particular record. When information was being collected about a user, information stored in the optional tables would be found by searching for this key. For instance, if the <b>login</b> <b>name</b> of a user is unique, addresses and phone numbers for that user would be recorded with the <b>login</b> <b>name</b> as its key. This simple [...] "re-linking" [...] of related data back into a single collection is something that traditional computer languages are not designed for.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{email addresses}} {{simply had to}} identify one user from another on one homogenous system, often a single host minicomputer or mainframe. They were therefore typically the user's <b>login</b> <b>name</b> on that system.|$|E
50|$|In the 3rd {{version of}} Radmin {{security}} options have been strengthened. The software's own security system can now maintain individual user passwords and permissions. The new authentication method {{is based on}} a Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm using 2048-bit keys. User <b>login</b> <b>names</b> and passwords are stored on the server systems for additional security. The software can still use Windows' own user authentication services, avoiding the need to maintain separate sets of user security data, with Kerberos support available as well.|$|R
50|$|Since all users {{must have}} read {{access to the}} /etc/passwd file to do many common tasks (ls -l /home will use /etc/passwd to map UIDs to <b>login</b> <b>names</b> for example), anyone could also read the {{password}} hashes of other users. To solve this problem, the file /etc/shadow was created to store the password hashes, with only root having read access. Under password shadowing, the 2nd field (password hash) is replaced by an 'x' which tells the system to retrieve the corresponding user's password via the /etc/shadow file.|$|R
5000|$|Colbert {{went on to}} type on {{a laptop}} facing away from the camera, {{claiming}} to be making the edits to the pages himself. In addition, initial edits to Wikipedia corresponding to these claimed [...] "facts" [...] were made by a user named Stephencolbert. Thus, many believe Colbert himself vandalized several Wikipedia pages {{at the time he}} was encouraging other users to do the same. The account, whether it was Stephen Colbert himself or someone posing as him, has been blocked from Wikipedia indefinitely. Wikipedia blocked the account not for the vandalism (as believed), but for violating Wikipedia's username policies, which state that using the names of celebrities as <b>login</b> <b>names</b> without permission is inappropriate.|$|R
50|$|Some {{versions}} of Unix use a relatively expensive {{implementation of the}} crypt library function for hashing an 8-character password into an 11-character string. On older hardware, this computation took a deliberately and measurably long time: {{as much as two}} or three seconds in some cases. The login program in early {{versions of}} Unix executed the crypt function only when the <b>login</b> <b>name</b> was recognized by the system. This leaked information through timing about the validity of the <b>login</b> <b>name,</b> even when the password was incorrect. An attacker could exploit such leaks by first applying brute-force to produce a list of login names known to be valid, then attempt to gain access by combining only these names with a large set of passwords known to be frequently used. Without any information on the validity of login names the time needed to execute such an approach would increase by orders of magnitude, effectively rendering it useless. Later versions of Unix have fixed this leak by always executing the crypt function, regardless of <b>login</b> <b>name</b> validity.|$|E
50|$|A user {{often has}} a user account and is {{identified}} {{to the system}} by a username (or user name). Other terms for username include <b>login</b> <b>name,</b> screenname (or screen name), nickname (or nick) and handle, which {{is derived from the}} identical Citizen's Band radio term.|$|E
5000|$|... lastlog is {{a program}} {{available}} on most Linux distributions. It formats and prints {{the contents of the}} last login log file, , including the <b>login</b> <b>name,</b> port, and last login date and time. It is similar in functionality to the BSD program last; however, last parses a different database (wtmp and btmp).|$|E
50|$|User IDs, {{also known}} as <b>logins,</b> user <b>names,</b> logons or accounts, are unique {{personal}} identifiers for agents of a computer program or network that is accessible {{by more than one}} agent. These identifiers are based on short strings of alphanumeric characters, and are either assigned or chosen by the users.|$|R
50|$|Despite the benefits, a {{self-service}} password reset {{that relies}} solely on answers to personal questions can introduce newvulnerabilities, since {{the answers to}} such questions can often be obtained by social engineering, phishing techniques or simple research. While users are frequently reminded never to reveal their password, {{they are less likely}} to treat as sensitive the answers to many commonly used security questions, such as pet names, place of birth or favorite movie. Much of this information may be publicly available on some users' personal home pages. Other answers can be elicited by someone pretending to conduct an opinion survey or offering a free dating service. Since many organizations have standard ways of determining <b>login</b> <b>names</b> from real names, an attacker who knows the names of several employees at such an organization can choose one whose security answers are most readily obtained.|$|R
40|$|Phishing emails are {{messages}} {{designed to}} fool the recipient into handing over personal information, such as <b>login</b> <b>names,</b> passwords, credit card numbers, account credentials, social security numbers etc. Fraudulent emails harm their victims through loss of funds and identity theft. They also hurt Internet business, because people lose their trust in Internet transactions for fear that they will become victims of fraud. This paper deals with the phishing detection problem and how to detect phishing emails. The proposed phishing detection model {{is based on the}} extracted email features to detect phishing emails, these features appeared in the header and HTML body of email using feed forward neural network to classify the tested email into phish or ham email. The results of the conducted tests indicated good identification rate (98. 72 %) with short required processing time (0. 00067 msec.) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} software, logname (stands for <b>Login</b> <b>Name)</b> is {{a program}} in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that prints {{the name of the}} user executing the command. It corresponds to the LOGNAME variable in the system-state environment. The logname system call and command appeared {{for the first time in}} UNIX System III.|$|E
5000|$|Some example wording:“Employees shall only request/receive {{accounts}} on systems {{they have}} a true business need to access. Employees may only have one official account per system and the account ID and <b>login</b> <b>name</b> must follow the established standards. Employees must read and sign the acceptable use policy prior to requesting an account.” ...|$|E
50|$|Recently, in Ratchadumnern table, where {{heated and}} uncivil {{political}} debates often occur, Pantip.com has started requiring that every post {{there must be}} accompanied by member login only. Thus, everyone who wishes to post in Ratchadumnern table must have member <b>login</b> <b>name.</b> However, the problem of using false identification or IDs of other people to apply for membership is still pervasive.|$|E
50|$|UUCP can use several {{different}} types of physical connections and link layer protocols, but was most commonly used over dial-up connections. Before the widespread availability of Internet access, computers were only connected by smaller private networks within a company or organization. They were also often equipped with modems {{so they could be}} used remotely from character-mode terminals via dial-up telephone lines. UUCP used the computers' modems to dial out to other computers, establishing temporary, point-to-point links between them. Each system in a UUCP network has a list of neighbor systems, with phone numbers, <b>login</b> <b>names</b> and passwords, etc. When work (file transfer or command execution requests) is queued for a neighbor system, the uucico program typically calls that system to process the work. The uucico program can also poll its neighbors periodically to check for work queued on their side; this permits neighbors without dial-out capability to participate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. PseudoID is a federated login {{system that}} protects users from {{disclosure}} of private login data held by identity providers. We offer a {{proof of concept}} implementation of PseudoID based on blind digital signatures that is backward-compatible with a popular federated <b>login</b> system <b>named</b> OpenID. We also propose several extensions and discuss some of the practical challenges that must be overcome to further protect user privacy in federated login systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The AiCPA 2 ̆ 7 s 2007 Top Technology Initiatives named 2 ̆ 2 {{identity}} and access management 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 securing and controlling information distribution 2 ̆ 2 {{as the second}} and seventh most influential technologies, respectively. These technologies depend, in part, on policies, procedures, and practices that verify (authenticate) an individual 2 ̆ 7 s identity prior to granting access to digital resources, such as a computer network and the files it contains. <b>Login</b> <b>names,</b> passwords, and personal identification numbers (PIN) arc familiar and acceptable methods for implementing authentication policies. The combination of a digital signature and certificate, however, provides a more secure authentication mechanism. When used to convey digital documents, the combination ensures that the document 2 ̆ 7 s content has not been altered, restricts document access to authorized individuals, and records who sent and received the document {{and when they did}} so. The latter feature improves on the common practices of either using PDF files or password-protecting Microsoft Office documents, which provide no assurances as to time or user identity. Used together, these features prevent the parties from repudiating their participation in a digital communication. Digital certificates, therefore, can {{play an important role in}} electronic contracts, maintaining adequate internal controls, and performing audits...|$|R
50|$|In 2001, TurboTax saved {{financial}} institution passwords entered by users to servers at Intuit {{and the home}} computer. The programming error was reportedly fixed, but as of 2012 Turbo Tax offers no option to download a data file directly from the {{financial institution}}. Instead, it prompts the user for their <b>login</b> <b>name</b> and password at the financial institution or permits the data to be entered by hand.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} records {{because the system}} {{needs to be able}} to access the {{information}} in different ways. The first line supports looking up the user by their <b>login</b> <b>name</b> and the second two allow it to look up information by the user's uid.
