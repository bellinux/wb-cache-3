25|$|ASL makes {{heavy use}} of time-sequenced {{ordering}}, meaning that events are signed {{in the order}} in which they occur.

I was weak--yes; more than that--I was ignorant. I did not know, even as <b>late</b> as <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> the monstrous vileness, the consummate wickedness of present-day conditions.

My father, my family, my husband, were willing to condone what they believed was my adultery. And for what?
