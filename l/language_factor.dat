This is also occasionally done with games in other languages, though less commonly. Some non-students who import games would learn foreign languages (English and Japanese) {{just to be able to}} play these games. Additionally, the region provisioning in some regions does not make sense- for example, NTSC/J was assigned as the region for South-East Asia and many games were released in Japanese, despite the fact that few people in the region understood Japanese.|$|E

Then he went to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he studied communications and received his Ph.D. in 1989 in the field of sociolinguistics and contemporary Middle Eastern history. The title of his thesis is The <b>language</b> <b>factor</b> in national development: The standardization of the Kurdish language, 1918-1985. His thesis was published as a book under the title:' Nationalism and Language in Kurdistan , 1918-1985 by Edwin Mellen Pr; illustrated edition (May 1992) He lived in Canada from 1986, and taught at University of Windsor, Concordia University, and University of Toronto. He was Associate Professor at the Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations at the University of Toronto. His areas of interest for the course were media, conflict and democracy and critical approaches to nationalism, ethnic conflict, genocide, and social movements. He died, aged 73, in Toronto.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, an ANOVA {{was carried}} out with two {{language}} groups as between-subject factors (native vs. non-native), and two noise factors (added vs. replaced), two phonemic factors (nasal vs. liquid), and two lexical factors (word vs. non-word) as within-subject factors. The results suggested that the speech perception of native speakers was significantly {{different from that of}} non-native speakers, F (1, 58) =  5.70, p = . 02. However, as was suggested in the previous paragraphs, native and non-native speakers share some commonalities. The added phoneme was perceived significantly more similar to the original sound than the replaced phoneme to the original sound by both native and non-native speakers, F (1, 58) =  101.11, p < . 001; there was no two-way interaction between noise and <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> F (1, 58) = . 75, p = . 39. In addition, a nasal consonant in noise was perceived significantly more similar to the original sound than a liquid consonant in noise to the original sound by both native and non-native speakers, F (1, 58) =  71.11, p < . 001; there was no two-way interaction between phonemic and <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> F (1, 58) =  1.96, p = . 17. On the other hand, while the target sound in words was perceived significantly more similar to the original sound than the target sound in non-words to the original sound, F (1, 58) =  3.80, p = . 056, there was a slight two-way interaction between lexical and <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> F (1, 58) =  3.46, p = . 068. As was suggested in the respective ANOVA in the previous paragraph, this would suggest that lexical context supported the perceptual sensitivity (added) and phonemic restoration (replaced) of native speakers, while it did not support those of non-native speakers. As for interactions, there was a significant two-way interaction between noise and phonemic factors, F (1, 58) =  22.11, p < . 001, and no significant three-way interaction among noise, phonemic, and <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> F (1, 58) = . 06, p = . 82. There was also a significant two-way interaction between noise and lexical factors, F (1, 58) =  6.17, p = . 016, and no significant three-way interaction among noise, lexical, and <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> F (1, 58) = . 68, p = . 41, while the respective ANOVA in the previous paragraph showed a significant interaction between noise and lexical factors for native speakers, and no significant interaction for non-native speakers. There was also a significant two-way interaction between phonemic and lexical factors, F (1, 58) =  11.79, p = . 001, and no significant three-way interactions among phonemic, lexical, and <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> F (1, 58) =  1.86, p = . 18, while the respective ANOVA in the previous paragraph showed a significant two-way interaction between phonemic and lexical factors for native speakers and no-significant interaction for non-native speakers. On the other hand, there was a significant three-way interaction among noise, phonemic, and lexical factors, F (1, 58) =  5.13, p = . 027, and a significant four-way interaction among noise, phonemic, lexical, and <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> F (1, 58) =  3.94, p = . 052.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{personality}} is important in computer-mediated communication (CMC), influencing both how we express ourselves, and how we are perceived. Here we build in two ways on previous work which has used the LIWC text analysis tool to derive <b>language</b> <b>factors</b> relating to personality. First, we investigate whether linguistic factor structure in e-mail {{is similar to that}} in weblogs, and how these structures compare to previous findings for non-CMC written language. Our findings broadly replicate results from offline studies, although blogs can be differentiated from non-CMC language, with e-mail sharing features with both genres. Secondly, we compare how the CMC <b>language</b> <b>factors</b> relate to personality, and seek differences between EPQ-R and Five-Factor Measures. We find that patterns of language behaviour for Neuroticism and Agreeableness distinguish CMC from non-CMC environments, while results from the two personality measures are largely compatible. ...|$|R
40|$|Machine {{translation}} systems, as a whole, {{are currently}} {{not able to}} use the output of linguistic tools, such as part-of-speech taggers, to effectively improve translation per-formance. However, a new <b>language</b> modeling technique, <b>Factored</b> <b>Language</b> Models can incorporate the additional linguistic information that is produced by these tools. In the field of automatic speech recognition, <b>Factored</b> <b>Language</b> Models smoothed with Generalized Parallel Backoff have been shown to significantly reduce language model perplexity. However, <b>Factored</b> <b>Language</b> Models have previously only been applied to statistical machine translation as part of a second-pass rescoring system. In this thesis, we show that a state-of-the-art phrase-based system using <b>factored</b> <b>language</b> models with generalized parallel backoff can improve performance over an identical system using trigram language models. These improvements can be seen both with the use of additional word features and without.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the links between family {{background}} and home <b>language</b> <b>factors</b> on English reading achievement among bi/multilingual students. To explore the potential predictors of English reading achievement among bi/multilinguals, the study included literacy related resource, family socio-economic status (SES), and immigration status as constructs for family background; while for home <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> the study looked at the orthography of home language, language preference, and multilingualism. Additionally, the study assessed the roles of school level factors (i. e., low SES students and English language learners in school) on school reading performance. The International Association for Evaluation of Educational Achievement?s Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (IEA ? PIRLS, 2006) data of Singaporean fourth grade students were used. The data were potentially nested, therefore, the models formulated in this study had multilevel structures, student- and school-levels. The results indicated that number of children?s books at home was the strongest predictor among other family background variables including parental education. However, having children?s books in English had a very small influence on English reading scores of the bi/multilingual students. More interestingly, the study found that parental immigration status did not influence students? English reading scores. Looking at home <b>language</b> <b>factors,</b> the study found that the orthography of home language linked to English reading. Importantly, the study found that Malay language, which shares the same orthography with English (i. e., alphabetic), showed the strongest link to the students? English reading achievement.

Data were collected using surveys, structured interviews, the critical incident technique, and documentation analysis. Respondents included 29 students from 6 countries, 20 instructors, 1 educational technologist, and 2 administrators. The most critical conditions were cultural values and <b>language</b> <b>factors.</b> The most effective methods were micro-strategies, management strategies, and delivery strategies. The most important traits brought to training by international students were value differences, language, and vocabulary difficulty. The most frequently mentioned value differences were about education and authority. The other two top ranked differences were motivation and group orientation. Language difficulty limited achievement of course objectives.

40|$|How {{listeners}} understand spoken words despite massive {{variation in}} the speech signal is a central issue for linguistic theory. A recent focus on lexical frequency and specificity has proved fruitful in accounting for this phenomenon. Speech perception, though, is a multi-faceted process and likely incorporates a number of mechanisms to map a variable signal to meaning. We examine a well-established <b>language</b> use <b>factor</b> — lexical frequency — and how this factor is integrated with phonetic variability during the perception of accented speech. We show that an integrated perspective highlights a low-level perceptual mechanism that accounts for the perception of accented speech absent native contrasts, while shedding light {{on the use of}} interactive <b>language</b> <b>factors</b> in the perception of spoken words...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} the latent dimensionality of Spanish in young Spanish-English dual language learners (DLLs). Method: Two-hundred eighty-six children participated. In their prekindergarten year children completed norm-referenced and experimental language measures in Spanish requiring different levels of cognitive processing in both receptive and expressive language modalities. Results: The best-fitting model suggested a bi-factor solution with a single general <b>language</b> <b>factor</b> ‘l’ plus two additional factors ‘word knowledge’ and ‘integrative language knowledge. ’ The general trait l reflects the proportion of common item variance {{for all of the}} items and the group traits of ‘word knowledge’ and ‘integrative language knowledge’ explain additional domain-specific variance for those item subsets. Conclusion: Results suggest that the Spanish language in preschool-age Spanish-English DLLs is not separable into content, form, and use, nor is it separable by higher- and lower-level language domains or processing demands. Instead, it appears that a general <b>language</b> <b>factor</b> underlies oral language in Spanish in DLL preschoolers and that other factors account for additional variance over and above l.

Wells' novel Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul. The topic is divided into four questions, that are the factors which influenc Kipps mostly and the changes have been made by him [...] The theory applied in investigating the matter is the theory of Janet Holmes which is concerned with the existance of two <b>factors,</b> <b>language</b> <b>factors</b> and social factors. As for the analysis, the writer examines the data. First, the writer deals with all kinds of <b>language</b> and social <b>factors</b> used by Kipps. Then, she will see the relationship between those factors through the table given. In this way, the writer finds out what <b>language</b> <b>factors</b> and social factors used most frequently by Kipps and show that social <b>factors</b> influence his <b>language.</b> Finally, she will show the changes of his language. To be able to do that, she uses the method of comparison. The result shows that Kipps' has undergone some changes in his language. The changes is influenced by the social factors, they are setting, participant, topic, and function. In conclusion, Holmes' theory about the relationship between <b>language</b> and social <b>factors</b> that social factors are more likely to affect the linguistic factors can be seen through this novel as all aspects in non-standard and standard English is really affected by the social factors.
