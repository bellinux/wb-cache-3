50|$|Achirus lineatus, the <b>lined</b> <b>sole,</b> is a ray-finned {{flatfish}} {{found in}} the Western Atlantic. Its common length is 17 cm. Often considered a trash fish in commercial trawling, it is of little or no economic value.|$|E
50|$|Careful {{examination}} allows A. lineatus {{and other}} right-eyed achirids to {{be distinguished from}} all co-occurring flatfish of the families Bothidae (lefteye flounders) and Cynoglossidae (tonguefishes), {{all of which have}} the left side up. The right-eyed flounders of family Pleuronectidae typically inhabit colder waters than A. lineatus. Within the Achiridae, the absence of vertical body bars should be sufficient to distinguish A. lineatus from three co-occurring species, the naked sole (Gymnachirus melas) and fringed sole (G. texae). The <b>lined</b> <b>sole</b> is sometimes confused with the hogchoker, (Trinectes maculatus) which is distinguished (at over 15 mm total length) by the latter's total lack of pectoral fin rays. <b>Lined</b> <b>sole</b> are also easily differentiated from scrawled sole (Trinectes inscriptus), whose side-up body is covered by a network of irregular dark lines.|$|E
40|$|Currently {{there are}} 29 species of {{flatfishes}} representing three families (Paralichthyidae, Pleuronectidae, and Cynoglossidae) in California, {{with an additional}} species and family (Pacific <b>lined</b> <b>sole,</b> Achirus mazatlanus; family Achiridae) reported just below the United States-Mexico International Border (Hubbs et al. 1979; Lea et al. 1989; Lea, in prep.). This paper reports the first occurrence of the 30 th species of flatfish in California and the first occurrence of the family Bothidae in the state. Seven California species (gulf sanddab, Citharichthys fragilis; Pacific sanddab, Citharichthys sordidus; speckled sanddab, Citharichthys stigmaeus; longfin sanddab, Citharichthys xanthostigma; bigmouth sole, Hippoglossina stomata; California halibut, Paralichthys californicus; and fantail sole, Xystreurys liolepis) placed in Bothidae in Robins et al. (1991) and earlier references {{have been placed in}} Paralichthyidae by most recent authoritative references (Nelson 1994, Hensley 1995 b, Moser and Sumida 1996, Eschmeyer 1998) ...|$|E

50|$|Lydd, {{situated}} 7 {{miles from}} Appledore, {{was the principal}} station {{on the line with}} a considerable goods yard and a long siding to nearby army ranges (Lydd Ranges) via the 6 mile Lydd Military Railway (1883 - c1926). The approach to Lydd from Brookland saw the line travel over nine level crossings before passing under the <b>line's</b> <b>sole</b> overbridge carrying the B2075 Station Road, before reaching a final level crossing just before the station. The station had two platforms as well as a passing loop and a signal box on the down side.|$|R

5000|$|The Leadburn line {{closed in}} 1933, leaving the Carstairs <b>line</b> the <b>sole</b> connection.

5000|$|In 1950, five trains {{operated}} a week, and with non-limestone traffic dwindling {{it was inevitable}} that the Dunback section would be closed and services concentrated on Makareao. Closure of the four kilometres from Inch Valley to Dunback took place on 1 January 1968 and limestone became the <b>line's</b> <b>sole</b> traffic. [...] Services operated thrice weekly to Dunedin's Burnside Cement Works, with the trains of four-wheeled wagons, typically hauled by DJ class locomotives, nicknamed [...] "stone trains". From at least 1952 trains were limited to 30 km/h for the entire line, and in 1988 this dropped to 20 km/h. During these later years occasional passenger excursions were operated down the line by railway enthusiasts and organisations, notably the Otago Excursion Train Trust.|$|R

5000|$|Different class {{travel was}} provided, {{but the only}} shred of {{surviving}} evidence of what that meant can be gleaned from a press report concerning the <b>line's</b> <b>sole</b> passenger accident, which occurred near Bontnewydd in June 1861. This describes the train as [...] "...consisting of the usual open passenger truck and a closed or first class carriage drawn by two horses." [...] The differences must have been real, as the return fares from Carnarvon Castle to Nantlle in 1857 were one shilling 3rd Class, one shilling and sixpence 2nd Class and Half a Crown 1st Class. In a forerunner of modern times the track was owned by and {{the responsibility of the}} Nantlle Railway Company, but the services were run by a private supplier - Edward Preston - acting under lease.|$|R

40|$|This work investigates {{comfort and}} {{performance}} properties of selected shoe upper materials manufactured in Nigeria for their suitability for diabetic footwear construction.

40|$|This study {{involved}} a macroscopic evaluation of hoof quality in 152 Lipizzaner horses (130 from Austria and 22 from other countries) and a controlled double blind {{trial of the}} effects of biotin on hoof horn growth and quality over 19 months in 42 stallions from the Spanish Riding School (SRS) in Vienna. Using a grading system that incorporated evaluation of horn wall, white <b>line,</b> <b>sole</b> and frog, the macroscopic study revealed the following: 90 % of the Austrian Lipizzaners had soft white lines and crumbling, fissured horn at the bearing border of the walls; 39 % of the stallions of the SRS, > 4 -years-old, had medium to severe hoof horn changes. Daily administration of 20 mg biotin to a test group of horses (n = 26) and a placebo to a control group (n = 16) showed that after 9 months the test group had significantly improved compared {{to the beginning of the}} trial and the placebo group (P 1000 ng/l.
