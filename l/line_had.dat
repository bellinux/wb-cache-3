5|$|A report {{published}} by the city in 2007 declared the line a success and stated that all goals for the <b>line</b> <b>had</b> been exceeded. A {{survey conducted by the}} city in 2003 and 2007 showed that the Ring <b>Line</b> <b>had</b> {{a significant impact on the}} use of public transport in the area. Total public transport usage increased from 28 to 45%; use for commuting increased from 35 to 61%. At the Norwegian School of Management (BI), 85% of the students used public transport. The Ring Line reduced the estimated number of daily car trips by 10,000, and generated 11,000 more daily public transport trips. In 2007, daily passenger numbers at the stations were 8420 for Nydalen, 3630 for Storo and 2300 at Sinsen. The line allowed travel time from the Nydalen and Storo to the city centre to be halved, and travel time from Nydalen to the city center is faster by metro than by taxi.|$|E
5|$|After much {{lobbying}} {{of local}} officials by Rickey himself, the Royals {{were allowed to}} host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach. Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus {{became the first black}} player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the de facto baseball color <b>line</b> <b>had</b> been implemented in the 1880s.|$|E

5|$|After the Stoke line opened, {{the station}} was rebuilt {{north-east}} at the junction so it could serve both lines. The new station opened on 9June 1845; at first, southbound services ran to Crewe and Poynton. By November the <b>line</b> <b>had</b> been extended to Macclesfield, and by 1849, when the original station closed, it had reached Stoke-on-Trent. The new station had four platforms, and was served by trains running between Manchester and Crewe or Stoke-on-Trent. It was renamed Cheadle Hulme in 1866, to avoid confusion with Cheadle LNW railway station which opened the same year.|$|E

His inheritance included three Morayshire estates: Altyre near Forres, Gordonstoun near Elgin and Dallas.

The Georgia introduced in 1887 was the first Old Bay Line boat to have a modern screw propeller instead of old-fashioned side paddlewheels and the Alabama launched in 1893 was the company's first steel-hulled vessel. Robinson served the Old Bay Line as president for 26years (1867–1893), longer than any other person in the company's history.|$|E

5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} <b>line</b> <b>had</b> long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The <b>line</b> <b>had</b> one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E

The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue <b>line</b> <b>had</b> fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.|$|E
