40|$|Flotation {{is one of}} the {{possibilities}} of recovering useful components both at preparation and processing of raw materials, and at recycling and exploitation of a variety of wastes. In the area of Krušné hory occur a number of dumping sites where wastes from treatment of Sn-W ores are deposited, characterized by enhanced content of lithium, rubidium and cesium. These elements are bound to <b>lithium</b> <b>mica</b> – zinwaldite; its recovering is possible through the use of flotation. This paper is devoted to the investigation of factors influencing the flotation process to recover zinwaldite concentrate with enhanced contents of lithium, rubidium and cesium...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} has been to determine a method to extract lithium from its ores {{in order to produce}} Li 2 CO 3 which is used in medicine. Lithium salts command very good prices (averaging about 1. 50 per pound) and a simple method of production would form a successful commercial enterprise. Lithium occurs in lepidolite (a <b>lithium</b> <b>mica)</b> and in amblygonite and other moderately rare minerals. In Southern California there are deposits of lepidolite with which this work has been conducted. The metal belongs to the alkali group but shows many properties characteristic of the alkaline-earths. It acts vigorously with water, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, thus resembling the alkalies. The relative insolubility of the hydroxide, carbonate and phosphate, makes it resemble the alkaline-earths. Lithium gives a very characteristic spectrum which makes it easy to test for traces with a hand spectroscope...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{structure}} of a lepidolite- 2 Ml from Biskupice, Czechoslovakia, has been redetermined. Vi-olations of systematic extinctions and of monoclinic equivalences plus {{the results of a}} second harmonic generation test indicate that the true symmetry most likely is C]'. The deviation of the data set from C 2 /c symmetry, however, proved to be too small to permit astatistically significant refinement i C/. Refinement in C 2 /c symmetry indicated no ordering of tetrahedral cations but ordering of octahedral cations o that M(I) = Li 0. 93 R 2 + 0. 06 Fe 3 + 0, 01 and M(2) = AI 0. 5 sLio. 35 []o. 07. The tetrahedra are elongated toform trigonal pyr-amids with a rotation angle of 6. 2 ~ The anomalous 9 rientation of the thermal ellipsoid for the F,OH anion plus the large equivalent isotropic B value of 2. 58 for F,OH and of 1. 74 for the interlayer K cation, whose position is partly restricted in C 2 /c symmetry, suggest a lower symmetry than C 2 /c. The compositions ofthis sample and of a second lepidolite- 2 M 1 from Western Australia fall outside the stability field of lepidolite- 2 MI in the synthetic system. Structural control of the stacking sequence isdis-counted {{on the basis of the}} structural similarity of the lepidolite unit layers. Crystallization parameters are considered more important than composition or the {{structure of}} the unit layer in determining the stability and occurrence of different layer-stacking sequences in lepidolite.

40|$|Granitic beryl-columbite-phosphate subtype aplite-pegmatite {{veins and}} sills from the Sabugal area intruded a biotite > {{muscovite}} granite which {{is related to}} another two-mica granite. Variation diagrams of major and trace elements of whole rocks show fractionation trends. REE patterns and δ 18 O of whole rocks, BaO and P 2 O 5 contents of K-feldspar, anorthite and P 2 O 5 contents of plagioclase, major element and Li contents of muscovite and lithian muscovite support this series. Least squares analysis of major elements indicate that the biotite > muscovite granite and aplite-pegmatite veins and sills are derived from the earlier two-mica granite magma by fractional crystallization of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite and ilmenite. Modelling of trace elements shows that magmatic fl uxes and fl uids controlled the Rb, Sr and Ba contents of aplite-pegmatites, probably also <b>lithium</b> <b>micas</b> (zinnwaldite, polylithionite and rare lepidolite), cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, fl uorapatite and triplite. In aplite-pegmatites, lithian muscovite replaces primary muscovite and late <b>lithium</b> <b>micas</b> replace lithian muscovite. Complexely zoned columbite crystals are chemically characterized and attributed to disequilibrium conditions. Relations of granites and aplite-pegmatites and pegmatites from other Portuguese and Spanish areas are compared. The granitic aplite-pegmatites from Sabugal are moderately fractionated and the granitic complex type aplite-pegmatites from Gonçalo are the richest in Li and Sn, derived from {{a higher degree of}} fractional crystallization and fl uxes and fl uids control the Ba and Rb behaviours and Li, Sn, F and Ta concentrations...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to mathematics, where a vector of one component defines a line, in chemical petrology a one-component {{system is a}} point, and two components are needed to define a line, three for a plane, and four for a space. Here, an attempt is made to show how these differences {{in the definition of}} a component can be resolved, with <b>lithium</b> <b>micas</b> used as an example. In particular, the condensed composition space theoretically accessible to Li-Fe-Al micas is shown to be an irregular three-dimensional polyhedron, rather than the triangle Al(3 +) -Fe(2 +) -Li(+), used by some researchers. This result is demonstrated starting with the annite composition and using exchange operators graphically as vectors that generate all of the other mica compositions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to assess the {{occurrence}} of fluoride in the drinking water sources of Langtang area. Out of the thirty seven water samples collected from drinking water sources (hand dug wells, boreholes, streams and a spring) and analysed. Results revealed that except for fluoride, all other parameters are within the World Health Organisation recommended limits for water consumption. Fluoride in the waters ranges from 0. 12 - 10. 30 mg/l with a mean of 2. 42 mg/l. low levels of fluoride are recorded in the stream samples. However, no clear variations in fluoride content have been observed in both the borehole samples and those from the hand dug wells. Negative correlation exhibited between fluoride and sulphate, fluoride and Phosphate and the poor correlation between fluoride and nitrate, fluoride and chloride rules out the possibility of anthropogenic source of the fluoride in the waters. Positive correlation between lithium and magnesium, and poor but positive correlation between fluoride and <b>lithium</b> indicate that <b>micas</b> within the host rock and the pegmatite may be responsible for leaching fluoride into the waters. Two of the major water types; Ca + Mg-HCO 3 and the Na + K-HCO 3 water type obtain in the area have good association with fluoride content. Consumption of high fluoride waters clearly manifests in the inhabitant of the area in form of dental fluorosis and bowing of legs especially in children between the ages 7 - 11 years...|$|R
40|$|The Karlovy Vary Massif (KVM) in {{northern}} Bohemia {{is a composite}} granite body built up of Late Variscan biotite, two mica and <b>lithium</b> <b>mica</b> granites. We summarize the available whole-rock geochemical and petrological data and correlate them with similar information from three boreholes in the northern and southwestern parts of the Massif. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether various types of granites differ in their physical and chemical properties, and whether any differences in physical characteristics affect the accuracy of geophysical interpretation. In accord with the earlier studies, we distinguish two geochemically and petrophysically contrasting granite suites - the Older Intrusive Complex (OIC) and Younger Intrusive Complex (YIC). The geochemical data show that the OIC and YIC granites differ significantly in the content of most major-element oxides (like SiO 2 , TiO 2 , FeO, Fe 2 O 3 tot, MgO and CaO). As to physical parameters, the granites differ markedly in magnetic susceptibilities and in the contents of radioactive elements (U and Th). From gravity and magnetic data we compiled a 22 km long geophysical profile, which crosses two of the three studied boreholes. For the construction of geological model along this profile, we used the data on the petrophysical properties measured on samples from the boreholes. Densities of the individual granite types are very similar to each other and thus the distinction of the OIC and YIC granites based on gravity data is not possible. Magnetic susceptibility differs markedly for the OIC and YIC granites in the drill logs, but absolute values of magnetic susceptibilities are very low. Modelling showed that neither gravimetry nor magnetometry are suitable methods for distinguishing between the different types of granites. On the other hand, it proved that the spatial distribution of individual granite intrusions does not affect the overall interpretation of the shape, size and depth of the whole granite body...|$|E
40|$|A <b>lithium</b> <b>mica</b> {{extracted}} magnetically {{from china}} stone is compared chemically and by X-ray methods with known lithium micas. This comparison shows a strong resemblance b tween the Cornish mica and zinnwatdite from the Zinnwald. Most publications on the geology of the St. Austell granite {{have pointed out}} the occurrence of lithium-bearing micas in the district. De la Beche in 1850 described a lithium-bearing pegmatite vein in the Trelavour Downs near St. Dennis while Ussher, Barrow and MacAlister (1909) noted {{that some of the}} Cornish biotites contained lithium. Richardson (1923) went further and divided the St. Austell granite mass into lithionite and non-lithionite types. The granite, which is thought o have been intruded into Lower De, onian rocks during the Carboniferous period, has recently been described, with particular reference to the china-stone r gion between Nanpean, St. Stephens and St. Dennis, in a series of papers by Keeling (1954) and Keeling and Exley (1954). The china-stone type of granite, which is used in the potteries as a flux, is characterized by the absence of iron and boron compounds, particularly tour-maline, and by the presence of lithium and fluorine compounds. This portion of the granite is thought o be either of later date than the remainder or to be the area which crystallized last. Interspaced throughout the whole region in a random manner, however, and forming a considerable proportion of the whole is a granite, known locally as shellstone, which is kaolinized in some areas. While commercial china stone contains a mica of the mus-covite type with very little iron or fluorine, this granite contains a characteristic golden brown mica which, in contrast o muscovite, contains iron and fluorine as well as lithium. The shellstone mica is a primary mica with crystals of average diameter 0. 5 - 1 mm, and if the granite is crushed to below this size it can be extracted by magnetic or flotation methods.
