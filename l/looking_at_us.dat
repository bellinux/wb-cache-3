5|$|To {{fill the}} demand for other aircraft, {{especially}} smaller ones like the de Havilland Mosquito, the Air Ministry began <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>US</b> manufacturers to supply the bombsight. Frederic Blin Vose of Sperry Gyroscope {{expressed an interest in}} the design and felt he could adapt the Mk. XIV to US production methods and have it in mass production rapidly. Sperry arranged for AC Spark Plug to take over manufacture, initially on a sub-contract basis and later for direct sales to the UK.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, only a {{few months}} later, the enigmatic Howard Hughes first learned of the design and leased the Jetliner {{prototype}} for testing, flying it for a few circuits when it arrived in Culver City, California. He became a believer, imagining TWA and National delivering passengers from New York City to vacation spots in Florida in half the time of the competition. He became desperate to buy 30 Jetliners, but Avro had to repeatedly turn him down due to limited manufacturing capabilities and overwork on the CF-100 project. Hughes then started <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>US</b> companies to build it for them; Convair proved interested and started studies on gearing up a production line. C.D. Howe again stepped in and insisted that Avro concentrate on its Orenda turbojet and CF-100 jet fighter programs.|$|E

An image of Rodemeyer was shown on the backdrop as Gaga announced: [...] "We lost a Little Monster this week. I wrote this record about how your identity is really all you've got when you're in school... so tonight, Jamey, I know you're up there <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>us,</b> and you're not a victim... you're a lesson to all of us. I know it's {{a bit of a}} downer, but sometimes the right thing {{is more important than the}} music", after which she sang a piano version of [...] "Hair".|$|E

500|$|Despite its success, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{had some}} detractors, {{including}} hip hop tastemakers who were unaccustomed to the album's style. [...] As the East Coast and West Coast hip hop scenes were already well-established at the time, many did not view the South {{as a legitimate}} and respectable scene. At the 1995 Source Awards, an award ceremony held by The Source magazine, OutKast won in the [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] category, but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs, while André 3000 was nervous and said, [...] "The South got somethin' to say." [...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> like 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Taken aback by the backlash, André 3000 and Big Boi channelled their frustration in the studio to improve upon their debut.|$|E

[...] Hip hop magnate Russell Simmons reacted negatively to the album at the time, but later expressed regret and said of the album in retrospect, [...] "At the time, I didn't understand their music—it sounds so different from what I was used to that I foolishly... claim that they 'weren't hip-hop.' The same way people didn't understand 'Sucker MCs' a decade earlier, I didn't understand that instead of operating outside of hip-hop, OutKast was actually expanding hip-hop. They were offering {{one of the most}} honest expressions, and expression so honest that it went completely over my head at first." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>us.</b> Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E

2500|$|She {{was young}} and tall of stature, clad in a garment of deep blue, ... Her dress was covered with {{brilliant}} gold stars. The sleeves were ample and long. She wore slippers of the same blue as the dress, ornamented with gold bows. On the head was a black veil half covering the forehead, concealing the hair and ears, and falling over the shoulders. Above this was a crown resembling a diadem, higher in front than elsewhere, and widening out at the sides. A red line encircled the crown at the middle. Her hands were small and extended toward us as in the 'miraculous medal.' Her face had the most exquisite delicacy and a smile of ineffable sweetness. The eyes, of unutterable tenderness, were fixed on us. Like a true mother, she seemed happier in <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> than we in contemplating.|$|E
2500|$|The Edens {{flew back}} to England just before Christmas 1956.

Early in January 1957, the Edens stayed with the Queen at Sandringham, where Sir Anthony informed her of his intention to resign as Prime Minister. Eden tendered his resignation formally at Buckingham Palace on 9 January. When Harold Macmillan was appointed as his successor in preference to R. A. Butler, Lady Avon wrote to Butler (whom two years earlier she had described in her diary as [...] "curiously unnatural") that she thought politics [...] "a beastly profession ... and how greatly I admire your dignity and good humour". (In 1952 she had told Duff Cooper that she thought modern politics something of a [...] "farce".) ...|$|E
