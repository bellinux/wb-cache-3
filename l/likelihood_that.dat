5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E

The growth of development teams increased the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> software bugs would appear, as code produced by programmers working in different teams was merged into a whole. A lack of technical standards among hardware manufacturers forced developers to support each manufacturer's implementation, or risk losing players.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} threat to manta rays is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> individuals from elsewhere will replace them.|$|E

He intervened in the War of Devolution and helped negotiate a peace, which increased the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> Spain and France would both aid Crete.

Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the letters {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author.

5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} two predictive <b>likelihoods</b> <b>that</b> can {{be applied}} in almost any parametric model setting. The first can sometimes be interpreted as an approximate predictive pivot (Barnard, 1986) while the second is often an approximation to a Bayesian predictive density with a flat prior. The issue of calibrating various predictive likelihoods in terms of long run predictive coverage is also discussed and a specific criterion by which these likelihoods can be compared is proposed...|$|R

5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E
5|$|The Burial Council's core {{contention}} is the city's decision {{to conduct an}} archaeological survey of the rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on {{a majority of the}} line will be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain in situ. In response to the Burial Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting an archaeological survey of the area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's programmatic agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of the Burial Council.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the forecasting performance of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) {{for a set}} of single factor models of short-term interest rates. Using weekly and high frequency data for the one-month Eurodollar rate, BMA produces predictive <b>likelihoods</b> <b>that</b> are considerably better than those associated with the majority of the short-rate models, but marginally worse than those of the best model in each dataset. We also find that BMA forecasts based on recent predictive likelihoods are preferred to those based on the marginal likelihood of the entire dataset...|$|R

Traditional methods for evaluating the log-likelihood, which are typically based on Choleksy factorisations, are not feasible for very large models due to the massive memory requirements. We present a novel approach for evaluating such <b>likelihoods</b> <b>that</b> only requires the computation of matrix-vector products. In this approach we utilise matrix functions, Krylov subspaces, and probing vectors to construct an iterative numerical method for computing the log-likelihood...|$|R

The Tales of Ise implies this journey {{was the result}} of the scandalous affair between Narihira and Fujiwara no Takaiko. There are doubts as to whether this journey actually took place, from the point of view both that the number of surviving poems is quite small for having made such a trip and composing poems along the way, and in terms of the historical <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> a courtier could have gone wandering to the other end of the country with only one or two friends keeping him company.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} of defence {{consists}} in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> the predator will attack some other individual.|$|E
5|$|The {{pulsations}} {{result from}} a process called the κ-mechanism. A part of the star's outer atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements. When these atoms lose an electron, the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> they will absorb energy increases. This results {{in an increase in}} temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.|$|E
