Samples were collected from natural communities at three different sites in the western lagoon: Barra, oceanic inlet; Ramalhete, adjacent to a urban waste water treatment plant; and Ponte, an upstream channel used for recreation and bivalve farming. These samples were enriched separately with nitrogen and phosphorous during the extreme neap tides of the summer solstice at both high (HW) and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW).</b> The experiment was repeated during the autumnal equinox to test for seasonality, and during the following summer solstice to test for replication. The addition of nitrogen consistently stimulated the productivity and biomass during summer experiments at the two sites within the lagoon, identifying N as the most likely primary ‘‘potentially limiting nutrient’ ’ {{in the western part}} of the lagoon for this period. No stimulation of biomass and productivity occurred in September at the same two sites indicating the importance of other factors such as light, sedimentation or grazing pressure, as con-trolling the pelagic community. However, these outcomes were reversed at the oceanic inlet (Barra-HW) where there was no stimulation by nitrogen during the summer months, but there was in September, suggesting that there is a different nutritional requirement for the coastal community in comparison with the lagoon community. In samples where productivity was stimulated, diatoms were the group most sensitive to enrichment...|$|E
40|$|Fluxes of CO₂ and H₂O vapour from dense {{stands of}} the C₄ {{emergent}} macrophyte grass Echinochloa polystachya were measured by eddy covariance {{in both the}} <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW)</b> and high water (HW, flooded) phases of the annual Amazon river cycle at Manaus, Brazil. Typical clear-sky midday CO₂ uptake rates by the vegetation stand (including detritus, sediment or water surface) were 30 and 35 μmol CO₂ (ground) m⁻² s⁻¹ in the LW and HW periods, respectively. A rectangular hyperbola model fitted the responses of "instantaneous" (20 - or 30 -min average) net CO₂ exchange rates to incident photosynthetic photon flux densities (PFD) well. Stand evaporation rates were linearly related to PFD. The major difference in CO₂ uptake rates between the two periods was the larger respiration flux during LW due to the CO₂ efflux from sediment, roots and litter. Integrated 20 - or 30 -min fluxes were used to derive relationships between daily CO₂ and H₂O vapour fluxes and incident radiation. The daily CO₂ fluxes were almost linearly related to incident radiation, but there was evidence of saturation at the highest daily radiation totals. Annual productivity estimated from the daily model in 1996 - 1997 agreed closely with that previously estimated for 1985 - 1986 from a leaf-scale photosynthetic model, but were some 15 % less than those derived at that time from biomass harvests. Both CO₂ uptake and water use efficiency were comparable with those found in fertilised maize fields in warm temperate conditions...|$|E

This study examines the effect of Zn supply at different water availabilities on morpho-physiological traits of Quercus suber L. in order to analyze the combined effects of both stresses. Seedlings were treated with four levels of zinc from 3 to 150 µM and exposed to <b>low</b> <b>watering</b> (<b>LW)</b> or high <b>watering</b> (HW) frequency in hydroponic culture, using a growth chamber. Under both watering regimes, Zn concentration in leaves and roots increased with Zn increment in nutrient solution. Nevertheless, at the highest Zn doses, Zn tissue concentrations were almost twice in HW than in LW seedlings. Functional traits as leaf photosynthetic rate and root hydraulic conductivity, and morphological traits as root length and root biomass decreased significantly in response to Zn supply. Auxin levels increased with Zn concentrations, suggesting the involvement of this phytohormone in the seedling response to this element. LW seedlings exposed to 150 µM Zn showed higher root length and root biomass than HW seedlings exposed to the same Zn dose. Our results suggest that <b>low</b> <b>water</b> availability could mitigate Zn toxicity by limiting internal accumulation. Morphological traits involved in the response to both stresses probably contributed to this response.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges in understanding the Amazon basin functioning is to ascertain the role played by floodplains in the organic matter (OM) cycle, crucial for a large spectrum of ecological mechanisms. Fatty acids (FAs) were combined with environmental descriptors and analyzed through multivariate and spatial tools (asymmetric eigenvector maps, AEM and principal coordinates of neighbor matrices, PCNM). This challenge allowed investigating the distribution of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), in order to trace its seasonal origin and quality, along a 800 km section of the Amazon river-floodplain system. Statistical analysis confirmed that large amounts of saturated FAs (15 : 0, 18 : 0, 24 : 0, 25 : 0 and 26 : 0), an indication of refractory OM, were concomitantly recorded with high pCO 2 in rivers, during the high water season (HW). Contrastingly, FAs marker which may be attributed in this ecosystem to aquatic plants (18 : 2 v 6 and 18 : 3 v 3) and cyanobacteria (16 : 1 v 7), were correlated with higher O 2, chlorophyll a and pheopigments in floodplains, due to a high primary production during <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> (<b>LW).</b> Decreasing concentrations of unsaturated FAs, that characterize labile OM, were recorded during HW, from upstream to downstream. Furthermore, using PCNM and AEM spatial methods, FAs compositions of SPOM displayed an upstream-downstream gradient during HW, which was attributed to OM retention and the extent of flooded forest in floodplains. Discrimination of OM quality between the Amazon River and floodplains corroborate higher autotrophic production in the latter and transfer of OM to rivers at LW season.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the seasonal and spatial pattern of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in five floodplain lakes {{of the central}} Amazon basin (Cabaliana, Janauaca, Canaçari, Miratuba, and Curuai) which have different morphologies, hydrodynamics and vegetation coverages. Surface sediments were collected in four hydrological seasons: <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW),</b> rising water (RW), high water (HW) and falling water (FW) in 2009 and 2010. We investigated commonly used bulk geochemical tracers such as the C : N ratio and the stable isotopic composition of organic carbon (δ 13 Corg). These results were compared with lignin-phenol parameters {{as an indicator of}} vascular plant detritus and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) to trace the input of soil organic matter (OM) from land to the aquatic settings. We also applied the isoprenoid GDGT (iGDGT) crenarchaeol as an indicator of riverine suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM). Our data showed that during the RW and FW seasons, the surface sediments were enriched in lignin and brGDGTs in comparison to other seasons. Our study also indicated that floodplain lake sediments primarily consisted of allochthonous, C 3 plant-derived OM. However, a downstream increase in C 4 macrophyte derived OM contribution was observed along the gradient of increasing open waters, i. e. from upstream to downstream. Accordingly, we attribute temporal and spatial difference in SOM composition to the hydrological dynamics between the floodplain lakes and the surrounding flooded forests. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Suspended {{particulate}} matter (SPM) was collected along the Amazon River {{in the central}} Amazon basin and in three tributaries during the rising water (RW), high water (HW), falling water (FW) and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW)</b> season. Changes in the concentration {{and the distribution of}} branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), i. e., the methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT) and the cyclization of brGDGTs (CBT), were seen in the Amazon main stem. The highest concentration of core lipid (CL) brGDGTs normalized to particulate organic carbon (POC) was found during the HW season. During the HW season the MBT and CBT in the Amazon main stem was also most similar to that of lowland Amazon (terra firme) soils, indicating that the highest input of soil-derived brGDGTs occurred due to increased water runoff. During the other seasons the MBT and CBT indicated an increased influence of in situ production of brGDGTs even though soils remained the main source of brGDGTs. Our results reveal that the influence of seasonal variation is relatively small, but can be clearly detected. Crenarchaeol was mostly produced in the river. Its concentration was lower during the HW season compared to that of the other seasons. Hence, our study shows the complexity of processes that influence the GDGT distribution during the transport from land to ocean. It emphasizes the importance of a detailed study of a river basin to interpret the MBT/CBT and BIT records for paleo reconstructions in adjacent marine setting...|$|E

In Paris, the authorities want to refine the current maps of the areas likely to be affected by ground movement due to gypsum dissolution in the Bartonian Saint Ouen Limestone and Beauchamp Sands, and in the Lutetian marl and limestone formation. The proposed method involves assessing separately the probabilities relative to factors that control the ground subsidence, i. e. : thickness of gypsum strata, sulphate-unsaturated water flows, groundwater level, thickness and nature of the overburden. The total susceptibility is represented in a map form by the product of these three values plotted on a grid map with a pixel size of 20 m. For this, we developed a multi-layer 3 D geological model using the same 20 m mesh grid, integrating 21 lithostratigraphic units. The hazard prone areas were calculated by geostatistical methods from the archived descriptions of more than 3900 boreholes and from existing geological maps. At the same time, the analysis of some 300 piezometers made it possible to construct the High Water (HW) and <b>Low</b> <b>Water</b> (<b>LW)</b> levels of the groundwater likely {{to have an impact on}} the dissolution of the gypsum.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the amount of}} triglyceride deposition from a lipid-containing artificial tear eye drop (Endura®) on three different types of contact lenses after one day and one month of simulated use. Methods: Simulated use of artificial tears was performed in vitro on three different types of contact lenses, including: high <b>water</b> content (HW), <b>low</b> <b>water</b> content (<b>LW),</b> and silicone hydrogel (SI) contact lenses. To simulate one day of use, contact lenses were incubated in artificial tear solution for 16 hours. To simulate a one month of use, they underwent repeated cycles of 16 -hour incubation in artificial tear solution, lens cleaning, and 8 -hour storage in a multipurpose solution daily for 30 days. Triglyceride deposited was extracted and determined. Results: After one day of simulated use, amount of deposited triglyceride was significantly different among 3 types of contact lenses with the highest deposition in SI followed by LW and HW contact lenses; the corresponding values (mean ± SD) were 3. 79 ± 0. 35, 0. 84 ± 0. 27, and 0. 26 ± 0. 17 μg/lens, respectively. Only between SI and HW was it found to be statistically different. After one month of simulated use, deposition on SI lenses was slightly increased (6. 56 ± 1. 10 μg/lens) with that on LW and HW lenses remaining low (0. 10 ± 0. 12 and 0. 55 ± 0. 34 μg/lens, respectively).

OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste trabalho foi conhecer a diversidade de gêneros, os atributos estruturais e a distribuição da comunidade de hidracáridos, como assim também a sua possível influência sobre certos parâmetros abióticos, na sub-bacia do Rio Grande, San Luis; MÉTODOS: estabeleceram-se quatro locais de amostragem (C 1, E 1, E 2 e E 3) em dois períodos hidrológicos: águas altas (AA) e águas baixas (AB). Obtiverem-se 24 amostras com rede Surber e se realizou a caracterização hidráulica, física e química dos locais de amostragem. Calculou-se a densidade (ind. m- 2), a riqueza genérica e o índice da diversidade de Shannon-Wiener; RESULTADOS: registraram-se 16 gêneros de hidracáridos. Não houve diferenças significativas entre cada local com relação aos parâmetros abióticos. Observou-se uma correlação positiva entre Sperchon, Torrentícola e Neoatractides com relação ao fluxo e à corrente, ao passo que Hygrobates mostrou uma correlação negativa. Não houve diferenças significativas nas abundâncias absolutas de hidracáridos entre os locais em AA e AB nem entre os pares de cada local em AA e em AB. Os gêneros que apresentaram as maiores densidades foram Hygrobates, Limnesia e Atractides, dos quais os dois primeiros apresentaram-se mais amplamente distribuídos. Os demais gêneros somente apareceram esporádicamente.

The zooplank-ton community of the muddy {{upper reaches of the}} Furo do Meio, Caeté system, Pará, Brazil, was studied between March and May 2001 (during the wet season). Zooplankton samples were taken during 2 lunar cycles; during each lunar phase, 4 consecutive tidal cycles were sampled, and for each tidal cycle, 4 hauls were taken (flood, high water (HW), ebb, <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW)).</b> Short-term changes in species number, abundance, and biomass were studied. Salinity (mean, 7 ± 3 psu) and water level were positively correlated. Copepods dominated the zooplankton community.

In contrast, the abundance and biomass of both total zoo-plankton and copepods were high at LW and low at HW. Copepod species number and the abundances of total zooplankton and copepods were greater during the spring than the neap tide.

Nutrient concentrations were measured monthly for 2 years within the bed sediments of a 300 m reach located 20 km downstream from the dam. Due to strong hydrological fluctuations hyporheic water was analysed during natural low and high water (HW) periods, and during water reservoir releases. Nutrient concentrations in surface water (SW) increased during water releases and in the HZ during the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW)</b> periods. Surface/hyporheic water interactions were characterized by determining the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and the chemical signature of the ground water (GW). The latter was obtained from regional GW monitoring. Hyporheic chemistry was strongly influenced by patterns of surface flow. Hyporheic and SWs had similar chloride concentrations during high flow when they were significantly lower than those of the regional GW. GWwas generally richer in nitrates and nitrites, but was lower in ammonium concentrations than interstitial and river waters. Nitrates decreased significantly from upstream to downstream within the HZ throughout the hydrological period even though temporal fluctuations were high. Ammonium concentrations in interstitial water (IW) were significantly higher than in SWand generally increased from upstream to downstream. This study demonstrates the importance of the HZ in altering the dissolved inorganic nitrogen composition and concentrations of heavily polluted arid streams.

Typical clear-sky midday CO 2 uptake rates by the vegetation stand (including detritus, sediment or water surface) were 30 and 35 µmol CO 2 (ground) m– 2 s– 1 in the LW and HW periods, respectively. A rectangular hy-perbola model fitted the responses of “instantaneous” (20 - or 30 -min average) net CO 2 exchange rates to inci-dent photosynthetic photon flux densities (PFD) well. Stand evaporation rates were linearly related to PFD. The major difference in CO 2 uptake rates between the two periods was the larger respiration flux during LW due to the CO 2 efflux from sediment, roots and litter. In-tegrated 20 - or 30 -min fluxes were used to derive rela-tionships between daily CO 2 and H 2 O vapour fluxes and incident radiation. The daily CO 2 fluxes were almost lin-early related to incident radiation, but there was evidence of saturation at the highest daily radiation totals. Annual productivity estimated from the daily model in 1996 – 1997 agreed closely with that previously estimated for 1985 – 1986 from a leaf-scale photosynthetic model, but were some 15 % less than those derived at that time from biomass harvests.

Cassytha pubescens had a significant, negative effect on the total biomass of U. europaeus, which was more severe in HW than <b>LW.</b> Regardless of <b>watering</b> treatment, infection significantly decreased shoot and root biomass, nodule biomass, nodule biomass per unit root biomass, F-v/F-m, and nitrogen concentration of U. europaeus.

In support of this, the delta C- 13 of the parasite was significantly lower in HW than in LW (and significantly higher than the host). C. pubescens also had significantly higher F-v/F-m and 66 % higher biomass per unit host in the HW compared with the LW treatment. The data suggest that the enhanced performance of C. pubescens in HW resulted in higher parasite growth rates and thus a larger demand for resources from the host, leading to poorer host performance in HW compared with LW.

Information about the water use efficiency {{in combination with}} the ecophysiological response to drought stress is still incomplete. For the study of the transpiration-biomass relations satisfactory results can be obtained under controlled conditions by using lysimeters. Nonetheless, several technical problems related to the manufacturing can bias the outcome. Pan lysimeters are economical and relatively easy to assemble, however, saturation at the lower boundary can happen. On the other hand tension lysimeters, where the suction is applied by a vacuum pump, are effective but expensive and need constant maintenance. To avoid stagnancy and reduce production costs we assembled a tension controlled wick lysimeter, where the tension at the bottom layer is actively exerted by a hanging water column through the wick material (rockwool). We aim to assess the performance of the wick lysimeter coupled with an automatic irrigation system for the study of water use-yield relation black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) under different irrigation regimes. The volumetric soil content for each treatment, namely <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW),</b> medium water (MW) and high water amount (HW), was maintained at 0. 07, 0. 14 and 0. 2 m 3 m- 3 respectively. During the vegetation period (161 days) the plants growing at LW reduced their water use by 60 %, their leaf area by 40 % and the total above ground biomass by 46 %. As a result, we found a linear correlation (R 2 = 0. 98) between the relative biomass produced and the relative water use. The calculated relative water use efficiency (RWUE) for black locust total above ground dry biomass is 0. 96. Furthermore, after the harvest we evaluated the effectiveness of the lysimeter and irrigation system: the soil moisture of the treatments was kept up at the predefined values and an unsaturated condition at the boundary layer was maintained throughout the vegetation period. Because of the improved design no roots grew into the drainage extension and no unexpected change of the lysimeters hydraulic property occurred. Considering the relatively low-cost material used and the low maintenance needed, compared to other tension controlled lysimeters, wick lysimeters are effective tools for forestry studies of young trees...|$|E
40|$|Over 100 years, {{the impact}} of {{parasitic}} plants on their hosts {{has been a major}} and fascinating field of research. Recently, there is evidence for native parasites having a greater effect on growth of introduced compared with native hosts. However, there is little known about the mechanisms behind these differential impacts. Further, there have been surprisingly very few studies in the field in general, that have incorporated the influence of abiotic factors on parasite effects on their hosts. A series of glasshouse studies were conducted to explore these gaps in the literature. Light experiment (Ch. 2) : The influence of high (HL) or low light (LL) on the effects of the Australian native stem hemiparasite Cassytha pubescens on the native and introduced perennial evergreen shrubs Leptospermum myrsinoides and Ulex europaeus, respectively. It was hypothesised {{that as a result of}} decreased parasite photosynthesis in LL, C. pubescens would become more dependent on host carbon and have a greater effect on host performance (particularly, U. europaeus) in these conditions. Parasite photosynthesis was significantly lower in LL relative to HL when infecting either host. However, contrary to my prediction, light was not found to influence the effect of C. pubescens on overall growth of these two hosts. Independent of light, the parasite did have a significant negative impact on overall growth of U. europaeus but not L. myrsinoides and also grew much more vigorously on the introduced host. Pigments (Ch. 3) : The influence of high (HL) or low light (LL) and C. pubescens on pigment dynamics and photo-damage of L. myrsinoides. It was hypothesised that excess light would occur as a result of infection effects on host photosynthesis in HL and in response; the native host would increase its photo-protective capacity (VAZ/Chl) and engagement (de-epoxidation state) in these conditions. As total xanthophyll (VAZ) and chlorophyll content (Chl) significantly decreased in parallel in response to infection, regardless of light, VAZ/Chl of L. myrsinoides was unaffected by C. pubescens in either HL or LL. The de-epoxidation state of the host was also unaffected by infection in both HL and LL. Consequently, infected L. myrsinoides had the same photo-protective capacity/engagement as uninfected plants and thus, showed no signs of photo-damage. These findings may explain why this native host shows tolerance to C. pubescens both in the light experiment (Ch. 2), and in the field. Nitrogen experiment (Ch. 4) : The influence of nitrogen (N) when supplied (HN) or not (LN) on the effect of C. pubescens on two leguminous hosts, (native: Acacia paradoxa; introduced: U. europaeus). It was hypothesised that the combination of infection along with the added carbon burden of rhizobia at LN would result in C. pubescens having a greater effect on hosts in these conditions. Contrary to this prediction, N was not found to influence the effect of the parasite on overall growth of hosts. Similarly, as with the light experiment (Ch. 2), C. pubescens had a significant negative effect on total biomass of U. europaeus but not that of A. paradoxa, regardless of N and also grew significantly greater on the introduced host, irrespective of N. Maximum electron transport rates (ETR) of U. europaeus, but not A. paradoxa were also found to be affected by C. pubescens which may explain the parasite’s negative effect on growth of U. europaeus. Water experiment (Ch. 5) : The influence of water on the effect of C. pubescens on U. europaeus. It was hypothesised that the parasite would grow better and have a greater effect on the host in well-watered (HW) compared with <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW)</b> conditions. Again, as with the experiments above, the parasite negatively affected growth of this introduced host, but in contrast, water did influence the effect of the parasite. Supporting this hypothesis, total biomass of U. europaeus was affected by C. pubescens in both treatments, but more severely in the HW treatment. This greater effect may be explained by the significantly higher photosynthetic performance (Fv/Fm) [v subscript and m subscript] and increased growth of the parasite in the HW compared with LW. Thus, it seems a more hydrated healthy C. pubescens in HW was capable of removing more resources and therefore had a greater effect on growth of U. europaeus in these conditions. These studies have revealed that light and N (specifically when hosts are legumes) may not be important in modulating the effects of stem hemiparasites on their hosts. By contrast, water was an important factor, with the parasite having a more severe effect when the host was well hydrated. It seems that from these experiments, parasite performance is controlled by host supply rather than parasite demand. Such ‘fine tuning’ between parasite and host has also been reported for the stem holoparasitic vine Cuscuta. Nevertheless, studies looking at the effects of the parasite when these abiotic factors are combined will further clarify potential outcomes of these associations. Results from these experiments also consolidate the idea that native parasites more negatively affect introduced compared with native hosts. Consequently, my data continues to support the potential-use of C. pubescens as a native bio-control agent against major introduced weeds in Australia. At the same time, my information adds to the discussion on pre-existing ecological theory; are introduced species successful invaders because their newly encountered enemies lack the effective arsenal. Or are they naïve invaders in the sense that new enemies do have an effective arsenal, my findings support the latter hypothesis. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Tese dout., Química, Universidade do Algarve, 2005 The {{input of}} {{nutrients}} to the aquatic system can have both natural (e. g. upwelling events) and human (e. g. sewage discharges, run-off of inorganic fertilizers from agricultural land) origins. The level of anthropogenic (human) eutrophication {{has grown in}} the past century. Primary production rates have increased significantly as a response, {{which can lead to}} harmful effects when the balance between the production and decomposition of organic matter is affected. These include the depletion of oxygen as excessive organic matter decomposes and the migration or death of surrounding life forms. Other consequences of nutrient enrichment may include changes in the natural autotrophic community structure by altered nutrient ratios, reduced biological diversity, increase in harmful algal blooms, poisoning of organisms, concluding in deterioration of the ecological and chemical status of waters. A decrease in fisheries, aquaculture and recreational resources may follow. To control and reverse eutrophication {{it is important to understand}} the dynamics between nutrients and the algal assemblage, identifying which nutrient is primarily limiting algae biomass and production. Within the context of the European Union (EU) several policies aim to reduce eutrophication and ensure the protection and improvement of the European aquatic environment. These include the Urban Waste Water Treatment (UWWT) Directive (91 / 271 /EEC), the Nitrate Directive (91 / 676 /EEC) and the recent Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000 / 60 /EC). The general objective of this thesis was to investigate the relation between nutrients (specifically nitrogen and phosphorus) and the activity and structure of the pelagic assemblage of microalgae in the two selected study areas, recently included as part of the intercalibration sites for the Common Implementation Strategy of the WFD. The underlying hypothesis is that the microphytoplankton assemblage is affected by nutrient concentrations and ratios. This was tested both by field and experimental work. In management terms, this study evaluates whether the microphytoplankton assemblage (and its selected supporting elements) are good tools for the identification and management of anthropogenic eutrophication within the context of the WFD. Are these elements sufficient to distinguish between Natural and Anthropogenic Eutrophication? Can we use these tools for management? The Sagres station (SW. Portugal), adjacent to the upwelling centre of Cabo S. Vicente and close to an oyster-culture was selected for the study of natural eutrophication, whereas xv the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon (S. Portugal) was representative of a system subject to both natural and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. The sampling in Sagres was performed during the upwelling season, from May to September (2001). The Ria Formosa was sampled according to the frequency recommended by the WFD (every 3 months) during representative conditions: close to the summer and winter solstice, and spring and autumn equinox, coinciding with both high (HW) and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>LW),</b> between June 2001 and July 2002. The water was collected from three contrasting stations on the western lagoon. Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment experiments were conducted additionally over short-time scales on small volumes of water collected during a period of relaxation of upwelling conditions in Sagres (September 2002), and during the growing season (summer solstice of 2001 and 2002), as well as the autumn equinox (September 2001), in the Ria Formosa. The results indicated that during the upwelling season the cold nutrient-rich waters of Sagres were dominated by the presence of diatoms. Flagellate forms developed by the end of the season when stratification occured, which was probably associated with the intrusion of the warm coastal countercurrent from the Gulf of Cádiz. Chaetoceros spp., Thalassiosira spp., Lauderia spp., Detonula spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were identified as a summer upwelling proxy. Production rates (seasonal average gross production: 25. 4 ± 19. 8 μM O 2 d- 1) were comparable to other productive systems. Respiration, on the contrary, was low during the survey. Nitrogen seemed to be the major nutrient regulating the microalgae activity, both during the upwelling season in the form of “new” nitrogen (essentially nitrate), and during relaxation stages in regenerated forms (essentially ammonium). Diatoms were the most sensitive group to nitrogen enrichment, including Pseudo-nitzschia spp. that may include toxic species. Altogether, the main factors influencing the development and structure of the algal community in Sagres were of physical nature, which in turn determined the chemical supply of nutrients to the photic zone. The microplankton community peaked in the summer solstice samplings (June 2001 and July 2002) in the Ria Formosa lagoon, with diatoms as the greatest contributors to the total numbers, whereas flagellates generally dominated the carbon biomass. The statistical analysis clustered the microplankton samples into their seasonal sampling groups. Physical factors such as temperature, salinity and solar radiation, together with the availability of nitrogen (especially in reduced forms) appear to be important parameters contributing for the microplanktonic evolution. The oceanic assemblage differed from the internal lagoon community on certain occasions. Events such as coastal upwelling in the adjacent waters and land run-off episodes within the Ria can contribute to a greater differentiation between the Primary Production in systems subject to Natural and Anthropogenic Eutrophication xvii Ria-ocean systems, and thereby to the selection of distinct biological forms. The Ria had an important role as an exporter of both algal biomass and nutrients to adjacent waters during the sampling campaigns. The importance of coastal upwelling events as a contributor for the trophic level of the lagoon was also highlighted. Further work may clarify the relative degree of natural versus anthropogenic processes for the eutrophication of the lagoon. High concentrations of nutrients and algal biomass can accumulate in regions prone to restricted water renewal such as upstream channels. High numbers of microalgae can also occur adjacent to UWWT plants. Transport mechanisms ultimately regulate the final location of the accumulated material. Nitrogen is suggested to be the potential limiting nutrient of the pelagic microalgae community of the lagoon during the growing season according to enrichment experiments, with diatoms as the most sensitive group. In temperate ecosystems, a switch in limiting factors is expected due to the seasonal change of biological and environmental variables. The systems appear to differ significantly during the growing season, both in biological and physico-chemical parameters, but these differences seem to be nevertheless not sufficient to distinguish between Natural and Anthropogenic Eutrophication. Similar responses to enrichment bioassays were also observed in both systems. Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB) taxa seem to develop mainly due to natural events (upwelling), suggesting that this parameter should be used with caution as an indicator of anthropogenic eutrophication in Portuguese coastal waters. Altogether, although the fact that the microphytoplankton assemblage responded to changing trophic conditions supports the need to incorporate these data in monitoring programmes, these tools seem not to be sufficient for the management of anthropogenic eutrophication in the selected areas. The two scenarios were in the ranges of mesotrophic conditions during the samplings, which is likely a consequence of the mechanisms of mixing and transport present in both areas. The high potential of dilution from the Atlantic Portuguese coastal waters contributes to its low degree of eutrophication problems. This works contributes to the on-going process of implementation of the WFD, and to the database of knowledge of the productive systems of Sagres and Ria Formosa.
