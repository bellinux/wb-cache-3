25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that the hiatus has been caused in part by increased sulfur emissions from volcanic activity.

According to Bohannon and Johnson, the Lancet paper indicates that the survey team avoided small back alleys for safety reasons. But this could bias the data because deaths from car bombs, street-market explosions, and shootings from vehicles should be more likely on larger streets. Burnham counters that such streets were included and that the methods section of the published Lancet paper is oversimplified.|$|E

25|$|CPR has {{continued}} to advance, with recent developments including an emphasis on constant, rapid heart stimulation, without respiration. Studies have shown that people who had rapid, constant hands-only chest compression 22% more likely to survive than those receiving conventional, CPR that included breathing. What's more, because {{people tend to be}} reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, chest-only CPR nearly doubles the chances of survival overall, by increasing the odds of receiving CPR in the first place. An analysis of 3,700 cardiac arrests published Friday in the journal Lancet found that hands-only CPR saved 22% more lives than the conventional method. All told, the switch could save up to 3,000 additional lives a year in the USA and 5,000 to 10,000 in North America and Europe, says <b>lead</b> <b>author</b> Peter Nagele of Washington University in St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|The ACR {{criteria}} for the classification of patients were originally established as inclusion {{criteria for}} research purposes and were not intended for clinical diagnosis but have now become the de facto diagnostic criteria in the clinical setting. It {{should be noted that}} the number of tender points that may be active at any one time may vary with time and circumstance. A controversial study was done by a legal team looking to prove their client's disability based primarily on tender points and their widespread presence in non-litigious communities prompted the <b>lead</b> <b>author</b> of the ACR criteria to question now the useful validity of tender points in diagnosis. Use of control points has been used to cast doubt on whether a person has fibromyalgia, and to claim the person is malingering; however, no research has been done for the use of control points to diagnose fibromyalgia, and such diagnostic tests have been advised against, and people complaining of pain all over should still have fibromyalgia considered as a diagnosis.|$|E

Populations further north are more closely related to the former, while those to the south are more related to the latter.

The implications of these findings for the conservation of giraffes were summarised by David Brown, <b>lead</b> <b>author</b> of the study, who told BBC News: [...] "Lumping all giraffes into one species obscures the reality that some kinds of giraffe are on the brink.
