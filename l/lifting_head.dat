40|$|This {{study was}} carried out {{experimentally}} and analytically about the performance of solar cell panel system for operating the pump coupled by dc motor. The solar cell panel with total area 1. 9848 m 2 consists of three modules of 80 Wp each. The small centrifugal pump powered by dc motor is operated to lift water from 1 m to 7 m heads in sequence and gives {{the amount of water}} pumped over the whole day from 08. 00 to 16. 00 h are 11988, 10851, 8874, 7695, 5760, 3600, 2340 L/d respectively. The hourly global solar radiation during the day is an average of 506 W/m 2. This study also presents the I V characteristics of the panel at global radiations 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 W/m 2 matched with the operation of the pump at the above lifting heads. It proves that the only solar radiations 800 and 1000 W/m 2 could provide <b>lifting</b> <b>head</b> from 1 m to 7 m. At radiation 200 W/m 2, the pump can???t lift water even for 1 m. The analysis shows the best efficiency point of the performance of solar cell panel system occurs at the pumping head 2. 89...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to {{the feather}} {{of the many}} mine shafts extends to the deep, a new high <b>lift</b> <b>head</b> mammoth {{electric}} diving pump for drainage was developed. To study the unsteady characteristics that caused by interaction between the impeller and guide vanes, the sliding mesh technology and RNG k −ε Turbulence models was adopted to simulate the unsteady flow in the pump. The pressure distribution characteristics of the relevant section for the impeller, guide vane and return guide vane was obtained by calculation. The unsteady pressure fluctuation characteristic of each monitoring point was analyzed in the electric diving pump. The effective <b>lift</b> <b>head</b> by calculation fits the actual situation, which {{is greater than the}} measured <b>lift</b> <b>head</b> and has only 5 % relative deviation...|$|R
6000|$|The cloaked figure recoiled, with <b>lifted</b> <b>head,</b> {{like the}} picture of a fawn I have seen, and gazed in my direction. Seeing nothing of me amidst the leaves and shadows, she was about to flee, when I called again:-- ...|$|R

6000|$|Kells had a springy step, {{a bright}} eye, a <b>lifted</b> <b>head,</b> {{and he seemed}} to be listening. Perhaps he was--to the music of his sordid dreams.

60|$|Someone has {{compared}} {{a literary}} period to a wood {{in which a}} few giant oaks <b>lift</b> <b>head</b> and shoulders above many other trees, all nourished by the same soil and air. If we follow this figure, Langland and Wyclif are the only growths that tower beside Chaucer, and Wyclif was a reformer who belongs to English history rather than to literature.|$|R
