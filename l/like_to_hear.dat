On March 2, 2010, the Council of the District of Columbia voted 12–0 in favor of stripping Barry of all committee assignments, ending his chair of the Committee on Housing and Workforce Development, and removing him from the Committee on Finance and Revenue.|$|E
25|$|On November 25 and 26, 2006, L'Arc-en-Ciel {{played two}} {{shows at the}} Tokyo Dome to {{celebrate}} their 15th anniversary. The tickets for these concerts were sold out in two minutes, breaking the previous record, which was also set by them. A poll was created on their official website, during the weeks before the concert, which allowed fans to pick the songs they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> at the show. The concert was later broadcast on the WOWOW channel on December 23, 2006, and was subsequently broadcast on Korean MTV on February 8, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is {{to be honest with}} the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E

500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Beatles' break-up, a time when he made many angry utterances, John Lennon trivialised Martin's importance to the Beatles' music. In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said, [...] " [...] another one of those people, who think they made us. They didn't. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Dick James' music and I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> George Martin's music, please, just play me some." ...|$|E
500|$|Wonderland is {{a concept}} album loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. The album took the title from the book, and was created with the {{intention}} of taking listeners on a journey, as well as showcasing Smith's voice. She said that [...] "that's something I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> in music. Whether I listen to Beyonce or Vivaldi, music is supposed to transport you away, escape from the everyday." [...] Smith said that she sometimes felt like Alice chasing White Rabbit, and, for this reason, [...] "Wonderland" [...] was a suitable title track for the album.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Robert Christgau {{wrote that}} {{although}} he had stayed away from McLachlan's music in the past, [...] "between her Lilith Fair counterpalooza and 'Building a Mystery' bonanza, [...] had to dive in, and got less than [...] bargained for." [...] He criticized McLachlan's [...] "monumental banality" [...] and summed the album up as [...] "renormalized pop at its most unnecessary." [...] A reviewer for Rolling Stone criticized the album's slow tempo, commenting that [...] "if you {{want a piece of}} her nirvana, you have to go along at her protracted, glacial pace." [...] They said that McLachlan is too [...] "rigid in her introspection" [...] and that they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her [...] "work up a good head of steam".|$|E

500|$|When Lisa, Apu, and the McCartneys {{gather on}} the Kwik-E-Mart roof, Apu tells Lisa, [...] "I learned long ago to {{tolerate}} others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know, you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, 'Live and Let Live'." [...] Paul corrects Apu {{and says the}} song's title is actually [...] "Live and Let Die". In the same scene, Apu refers to himself as the [...] "fifth Beatle", and Linda alludes to {{a line in the}} Beatles' 1969 song [...] "Octopus's Garden". The McCartneys later ask Lisa if she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a song, and Apu sings part of [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", to which the McCartneys snap along.|$|E
500|$|In one {{sequence}} {{the character}} Martin Vanger plays the song [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard. No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, what is he talking about? And he said, ‘You know, “Sail away, sail away...”’ And I thought, this {{guy is going to}} make Blomkvist as metro as we need." ...|$|E
500|$|Joe Lynch of Billboard {{described}} the song as [...] "an immediately familiar track with an epic, arresting chorus." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote the track [...] "nips at its heels", giving emphasis to [...] "the space Madonna's voice {{is given to}} shine—something we'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more often". Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times described it as an [...] "old-school pop" [...] song and picked it as a standout track, whilst John Marrs of Gay Times claimed that [...] "the mid-tempo track underpinned by a dirty bass bears {{little resemblance to the}} sparse, pedestrian demo," [...] also noting that [...] "when the melody is lush as this, she could be singing a recipe from Mary Berry's cookbook as far as we care." [...] Amy Pettifer of The Quietus saw it as [...] "Shakira's 'Whenever, Wherever' as seen through the murky lens of a lost generation." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music for}} [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] {{originated}} from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed {{the night before}} the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions. In an upstairs room at Melbeach House—his newly purchased home—The Edge used a four-track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards, bass, guitar, and a drum machine. Realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs, The Edge wanted to [...] "conjure up the ultimate U2 live-song", so he imagined what he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> at a future U2 show if he were a fan. After finishing the rough mix, he felt he had come up with [...] "the most amazing guitar part and song of [...] life". With no one in the house to share the demo with, The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration.|$|E
500|$|In July 1962 {{the first}} inklings of a {{possible}} Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov triangle had been hinted, in coded terms, in the gossip column of the society magazine Queen. Under the heading [...] "Sentences I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the end of" [...] appeared the wording: [...] "...called in MI5 because every time the chauffeur-driven Zils drew up at her front door, out of her back door into a chauffeur-driven Humber slipped..." [...] Keeler was then in New York with Rice-Davies, in an abortive attempt to launch their modelling careers there. On her return, to counter Gordon's threats, Keeler formed a relationship with Johnny Edgecombe, an ex-merchant seaman from Antigua, with whom she lived {{for a while in}} Brentford, just west of London. [...] Edgecombe was similarly [...] possessive; he and Gordon clashed [...] violently on 27 October 1962, when [...] Edgecombe slashed his rival with a knife. Keeler broke with Edgecombe shortly afterwards because of his domineering behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Echevarria {{suggested}} this to Behr over lunch, but {{he initially}} was not sure. By {{the time they}} had returned separately to the studio, Behr had an entire plan worked out based on the new premise for the character. Behr suggested that the character should be basically acting as if she's schizophrenic, saying [...] "We'd never played up the idea in the past, but it made sense. What must it be <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all those voices and opinions?" [...] The producers also decided that they wanted a younger actress who felt vulnerable in order to offset the strength that Jadzia had grown into over the years. Casting remained difficult, until Hans Beimler suggested an actress from Canada whom he had once worked with – Nicole de Boer. She had worked with Beimler on the television series Beyond Reality and TekWar. She was asked to submit an audition tape where she played out a scene between Ezri and Quark, which she recorded herself in the hotel room she was staying at, and later admitted that she did not know what a Trill was at the time.|$|E

500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. Popjustice responded positively: [...] "It must be hard being Nicola Roberts. Imagine living your life knowing {{that at any}} point you might be CRUSHED BY THE WEIGHT OF YOUR OWN AMAZINGNESS", noting that the band Dragonette was a large part behind {{the success of the}} track. Dan Lambden from the online magazine So So Gay found the song to be a [...] "perfect medium between classic pop lyrics" [...] and [...] "a pulsating dance beat", and positively commented on the riffs within the track stating they would [...] "satisfy the most Hoxton of hipsters". Emily Mackay from NME declared [...] "I'd be a bit freaked out by a phonecall like that" [...] in response to the lyrics [...] "I’d like a phone call/I’d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> something like this—WAHWAHWAHWAH". Mackay called the track [...] "classy" [...] and concluded her review saying [...] "the sugar-spun electropop goes down smooth." [...] Despite listing [...] "Lucky Day" [...] as one of the singles of the week, Alex Macpherson of Metro gave a predominantly negative review noting [...] "She’s lionised by a cult fan base, but wider appeal remains elusive" [...] and further explaining that [...] "her voice is simultaneously too weak and shrill to carry".|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E
