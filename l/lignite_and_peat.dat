40|$|Low-rank {{solid fuels}} (<b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> <b>peat)</b> are {{characterized}} by a high oxygen content on a DAF basis, {{a large proportion of}} which belongs to carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. These groups being thermally labile, the oxygen content of low rank coals can be decreased (and their heat content per unit mass correspondingly increased) by subjecting them to simple pyrolytic treatment. It has been found that the behavior of certain types of <b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> <b>peat</b> {{is similar to that of}} simple carboxylic acids in that the thermal decarboxylation process can be catalyzed by specific metal ions. Thus when <b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> <b>peat,</b> in the presence of small amounts of copper, are pyrolyzed at low temperatures (160 degree - 200 degree C) they readily undergo decarboxylation and dehydration and their higher heating values on a DAF basis show increases on the order of 30 %.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the environmental impact of fossil fuels (mainly coal) combustion, which leads to high levels of CO 2, NO x, SO 2, mercury and particulate emissions, has motivated research for potential alternatives such as switching from fossil fuels to biomass, or co-firing of both fuels. Co-firing proved to be a promising technology for large scale use of biomass for energy production, as it makes use of the extensive infrastructure associated with the existing coal-based power systems, and requires only relatively modest additional capital investment to achieve a significant CO 2 reduction. The research objectives of the present work were to: (1) Investigate on combustion/cofiring <b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> woodwaste/peat in a 16. 19 kW pilot-scale fluidized-bed combustor, and effects of fuel-blending ratios, excess air, particle size and moisture contents on CO 2, CO, SO 2, and NO x emissions in the combustion/co-combustion; and (2) Study the combustion reactivity of <b>lignite,</b> woodwaste, <b>peat,</b> <b>and</b> the blended fuels using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The combustion/co-combustion behaviour <b>and</b> kinetics of <b>lignite,</b> <b>peat</b> <b>and</b> woodwaste (white pine sawdust) and their blends were investigated using non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique. The TGA experiments were performed for pure fuels and compared to blended fuels with respect to their performance in air over a temperature range of 25 - 700 ?c and at a heating rate of 20 ?C/min. The overall kinetic de-volatilization-combustion reactions for these fuels and their blends were evaluated using the power law model. Using the differential thermal analysis (DTA) data and applying the least square multi-linear regression method, kinetic parameters for the overall devolatilization/combustion reactions including the apparent activation energy (E a), reaction order (n) and the pre-exponential (A) factor were calculated for each homogeneous fuel and the lignite-peat or lignite-pine sawdust blended fuels (50 wt%- 50 wt%%). The wood waste <b>and</b> <b>peat</b> demonstrated a higher reactivity when compared to lignite. The activation energies for <b>lignite,</b> <b>peat,</b> <b>and</b> white pine were determined to be 124. 10 kJ/mol, 83. 95 kJ/mol, and 98. 23 kJ/mol, respectively.

Coalbed methane (CBM) makes significant contributions to world natural gas industry and CBM production continues to increase. With increasing CBM production, the production of CBM co-produced water increases, which is an environmental concern. This study investigated the feasibility in re-using CBM co-produced water and other high sodic/saline water to enhance biogenic methane production from coal and other unconventional sources, such as oil shale. Microcosms were established with the selected carbon sources which included coal, oil shale, <b>lignite,</b> <b>peat,</b> <b>and</b> diesel-contaminated soil. Each microcosm contained either CBM coproduced water or groundwater with various enhancement and inhibitor combinations. Results indicated that the addition of nutrients and nutrients with additional carbon can enhance biogenic methane production from coal and oil shale. Methane production from oil shale was much greater than that from coal, which is possibly due to the greater amount of available Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) from oil shale. Inconclusive results were observed from the other sources since the incubation period was too low. WRI is continuing studies with biogenic methane production from oil shale...|$|R

40|$|Victoria holds a large {{proportion}} of the world's lignite resource, being generally easy to access at low cost. Interest in the use of lignite as an organic amendment is increasing because it is a rich source of humic acids and can reduce the bioavailability of heavy metals. To date, there is no information about the effect of this amendment on soil biological properties. The work presented in this thesis is based on a microcosm experiment to determine the influence of Victorian lignite on soil microbial communities and nitrogen dynamics and an incubation experiment to evaluate the use of lignite as a carrier material for beneficial microbial inoculants. In the first experiment, I added raw lignite to an agricultural soil, with or without additional N-fertiliser, and measured a number of chemical and microbial soil properties. The results indicated that the application of lignite either alone or in combination with urea had a minimal effect on the availability of inorganic nitrogen (NH/ and N 03 -), the microbial biomass, and the activity of three different enzymes involved in C-cycling. Shifts in the soil microbial community caused by lignite application were detected by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, and mainly occurred among microbial groups rather than as change to total microbial biomass. However, I found strong evidence that lignite addition could suppress the heterotrophic respiration and it's likely that the soil microbial community could not assimilate the organic C in lignite even with the supplementation of nitrogen fertilizer. In chapter 2 of this thesis, I present results of a study in which the use of lignite as an alternative microbial carrier in comparison with peat as a conventional carrier was explored. The physicochemical properties of <b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> <b>peat</b> were characterized by elemental analysis, solid-state NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). I found that lignite had a lower available nutrient content than commercial peat. However when the lignite was treated with 5 % CaC 03 and sterilized by gamma irradiation, it supported the growth and the survival of nitrogen fixing bacteria during a 3 -month storage period to almost the same level as the conventional peat carrier. In addition, a glasshouse experiment showed that the addition of a lignite-based inoculants significantly increased the shoot dry weight (SDW) and root dry weight (RDW) of rice in comparison with a peat-based inoculant and untreated controls. These results confirm that lignite is a suitable carrier material for microbial inoculants used in agriculture...|$|E

Superheated steam drying (SSD) {{is known}} for almost 140 years but still not as popular as it deserves. SSD uses {{superheated}} steam as the drying agent. During contact with wet solid it picks up moisture and cools down but still remains superheated. The excess steam may be purged, the rest is reheated and recycled. The advent of SSD, on the wave of interest in sustained development, {{is largely due to}} the following facts: • Excess steam can be re-used and it’s heat recovered thus the net heat used for vaporization of 1 kg of water may be reduced down to almost ¼ of its nominal value. • The cycle is closed so no pollutants, neither odors are emitted, • No oxidation nor fire hazard exist inside the dryer because of oxygenfree atmosphere. • Since product temperature reaches boiling point thus the product leaves the dryer sterilized so it is harmless for humans and ready for storage. The last point indicates that only temperature resistant solids can be dried in this way. However, the problem can be overcome by lowering the pressure in the dryer. The list of products suitable for SSD is endless. The most common are: pulp and paper, <b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> <b>peat,</b> solid biofuels, agro and food industry products and waste, raw mineral materials and many others. This book presents methods of process design of selected dryers using superheated steam. It is a summary of research on various aspects of SSD, which has been carried out at Lodz TU on such materials as tobacco, wood chips of willow and now lignite. In the initial chapter it contains the description of the process including its three stages: condensation, constant drying rate and falling drying rate. The constitutive equations for the drying rate in the tree periods are defined. The problems of inversion temperature, dependence of maximum drying rate on process pressure, depth of steam penetration in granular beds and model of internal heat and mass transfer in the solid during SSD are described. The model includes diffusion, Darcy flow and thermodiffusion terms. A collection of equations to approximate the diffusivity is presented. In the next chapter thermodynamic properties of superheated steam and thermodynamic equilibrium of steam and solid are presented. Isotherms and isobars of desorption are described and a collection of equations used to describe them is presented. Ways to describe drying kinetics are shown including thin layer equations, characteristic drying curve equations and solution of a full model of the internal heat and mass transfer...|$|E

40|$|Za izračunavanje emisije ugljikova dioksida zbog izgaranja ugljena, emisijski faktor CO 2 važan je ulazni parametar. Referentni emisijski faktori prema Uputama Međuvladinog tijela za klimatske promjene iz 2006. godine (engl. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) specificirani su prema stupnju pougljenja (coal rank), ali se pri izradi nacionalnog izvješća o stakleničkim plinovima preporučuje primjena nacionalnih emisijskih faktora. Sadržaj ugljika najvažnije je svojstvo ugljena i pokazatelj je stupnja pougljenja (karbonizacije). Međutim mnoga svojstva ugljena vrlo su specifična (npr. sadržaj sumpora, pepela, vlage i macerala) te emisijski faktori CO 2 ugljena ne ovise samo o stupnju pougljenja već i o njegovu geografskom porijeklu. U preliminarnom istraživanju, temeljem podataka dobivenih analizom goriva, izračunati su emisijski faktori CO 2 za ugljene i treset s područja Livna, BiH: 147, 9 t TJ− 1 za treset, 109, 5 t TJ− 1 za lignit i 98, 7 t TJ− 1 za smeđi ugljen, što odgovara sljedećim donjim ogrjevnim vrijednostima (Hd) : 3, 6 MJ kg− 1, 11, 5 MJ kg− 1 i 20, 6 MJ kg− 1. Razlika u ogrjevnoj vrijednosti može se djelomično objasniti različitim udjelom ukupne vlage u ispitivanim uzorcima. Usporedba izračunatih emisijskih faktora s referentnim vrijednostima, pokazala je najveća odstupanja kod treseta (39, 5 %), potom kod lignita (8, 2 %) i smeđeg ugljena (4, 3 %). Emission {{factors are}} used in {{greenhouse}} gas inventories to estimate emissions from coal combustion. In the absence of direct measures, emissions factors are frequently used as a quick, low cost way to estimate emissions values. Coal combustion {{has been a major}} contributor to the CO 2 flux into the atmosphere. Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99 %) in coal is converted to CO 2 during the combustion process. The carbon content is the most important coal parameter which is the measure of the degree of coalification (coal rank). Coalification is the alteration of vegetation to form peat, succeeded by the transformation of peat through lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous to anthracite coal. During the geochemical or metamorphic stage, the progressive changes that occur within the coal are an increase in the carbon content and a decrease in the hydrogen and oxygen content resulting in a loss of volatiles. Heterogeneous composition of coal causes variation in CO 2 emission from different coals. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has produced guidelines on how to produce emission inventories which includes emission factors. Although 2006 IPCC Guidelines provided the default values specified according to the rank of the coal, the application of country-specific emission factors was recommended when estimating the national greenhouse gas emissions. This paper discusses the differences between country-specific emission factors and default IPCC CO 2 emission factors, EF(CO 2), for coals. Also, this study estimated EF(CO 2) for two different types of coals and peat from B&H, on the basis fuel analyses. Carbon emission factors for coal mainly depend on the carbon content of the fuel and vary with both rank and geographic origin, which supports the idea of provincial variation of carbon emission factors. Also, various other factors, such as content of sulphur, minerals and macerals play an important role and influence EF(CO 2) from coal. Carbonate minerals (calcite and siderite) directly contribute CO 2 when they decompose during coal combustion. Variations in the maceral content can also influence CO 2 emissions; high inertinite contents increase CO 2 emissions. Sulphur in coal reduces EF(CO 2). Fuel analysis is very important when estimating greenhouse gas emissions and emission factors. In this preliminary study, {{based on the results of}} the fuel analysis, CO 2 emission factors for coals and peat from Livno, B&H have been calculated. EF(CO 2) is defined as the amount of carbon dioxide emission per unit net calorific values of the fuel. Net calorific value (the lower heating value) corresponds to the heat produced by combustion where total water in the combustion products exists as water vapour. The EF(CO 2) obtained for sub-bituminous coal, <b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> <b>peat</b> were: 98. 7, 109. 5, and 147. 9 t TJ− 1, respectively, which correspond to the following net calorific values: 20. 6, 11. 5 and 3. 6 MJ kg− 1. The heating value is generally known to increase with the increase in carbon content (this parameter is connected with the degree of coalification, coal age). The other indispensable parameters are hydrogen, which has a positive effect on the net calorific value, and oxygen and water which impact the net calorific value negatively. The differences in net calorific values can be explained in part by the difference of total moisture content among the different fuel types. The CO 2 emission factors calculated in this study were compared with those of IPCC. A significant difference was observed for peat (39. 5 %), followed by lignite (8. 2 %) and sub-bituminous coal (4. 3 %) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{stratigraphy}} of the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene {{has been}} revised in Avesnois thanks to drillings supporting a geological mapping project. Detailed sampling and {{analyses were performed}} along selected drillings, among which sedimentological, mineralogical, chemostratigraphic (δ 13 Corg), biostratigraphic and palynological data have been obtained. New Mbs/Fms are defined around the Paleocene-Eocene boundary (PEb) and compared to the lithostratigraphic nomenclatures of the Belgian and Paris Basins (Steurbaut, 1998; Aubry et al., 2005). Biostratigraphy based {{on the study of}} foraminifera and mammal fauna, palynological content and chemostratigraphy enable correlation to be established between adjacent basins as well as sea level and landscape evolutions to be refined during this critical interval. Upper Thanetian marine units In the AVE 007 -drilling (Mormal Forest, Locquignol, between Englefontaine, Landrecies and Maroilles villages), the Coniacian chalk is overlain by a flint conglomerate, whose sandy-clayey matrix contains Thanetian pollen and dinocysts. Widespread in Avesnois and containing often reworked Upper Cretaceous foraminifera and occasionally glauconite, this unit constitutes the Vervins Mb (cf. 'Argile à silex de Vervins' interpreted as a marine conglomerate by Gosselet, 1879). It is often overlain by the Mondrepuis-Bettrechies Sand Mb (cf. 'Sable verts de l'Avesnois'), a thin sandy glauconiferous unit, more clayey and silty westward (cf. 'Tuffeau de Valenciennes' Mb). The three Mbs constitute the Hainaut-Valenciennois Fm and can be correlated to the Belgian Grandglise Mb (upper part of the Hannut Fm) and Bois-Gilles Fm, and to the Paris Basin Châlons-sur-Vesles and Bracheux Fms, all Thanetian in age. Uppermost Paleocene to lowermost Eocene terrestrial units In AVE 007 the Vervins Mb is unconformably overlain by flint gravels (Mormal Mb), then a pyritic sand (Le Quesnoy Sand Mb, cf. 'Sables et Grès du Quesnoy' of Gosselet, 1890), and a lignitic clay (Locquignol Mb), silty and ochreous at the top. All but the top ochreous paleosol contain spores and pollen grains and are devoid of dinocysts, they were thus probably deposited in terrestrial environments. The Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE) of the PEb begins below the top of the sandy unit and continues in the lignitic clay. The palynological study confirms the Locquignol Mb's earliest Eocene age and allows correlation with the base of the Tienen Fm. To the East of AVE 007 along the Belgium-France border, fluvial fossiliferous gravels and sands have been studied in past sand quarries (Erquelinnes Sand Mb). Above a sharp unconformity, they i) overly Upper Thanetian marine sands (Bois-Gilles Fm, NP 9 a, then Grandglise Mb, NP 8), ii) contain a mammal fauna referred as MP 7 in the Mammalian biochronological scale for the European Paleogene (Missiaen et al., 2013) and iii) record {{the first part of the}} CIE onset in the basal fossiliferous gravel and marl beds. Three km west of Erquelinnes and toward AVE 007 a few drillings have recognized a sandy and pyritic unit containing resinite fragments, <b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> <b>peat</b> beds (Vieux Reng Mb), overlying a thin basal flint gravel bed (Mormal Mb). These five Mormal, Le Quesnoy, Locquignol, Vieux-Reng and Erquelinnes Sand Mbs form the Sambre Fm. Such fluvial gravels and sands, more or less lignitic, clayey or marly are widespread in northern France and southeastern Belgium. They belong to the so-called Upper "Landenian" and are correlated to the Tienen Fm. In AVE 007, they record the CIE onset marking the PEb and 2. 5 m of Upper Paleocene fluvial units, in contrast with Belgian drillings such as Doel and Kallo where a hiatus is present at the PEb. Lower Ypresian hiatus and marine units In AVE 007, a laminated silty unit overlies the Locquignol Mb, contains dinocysts Wetzeliella sp. and agglutinated foraminifera similar to those of the base of the Orchies Clay Mb. Widespread in Avesnois-Valenciennois that marine unit is named Avesnois Mb, it is locally richer in very fine sand, and correlated to the base of the Kortrijk Clay Fm (Ieper Gp). In Avesnois, Sparnacian lagoonal units are absent upon the terrestrial ones described above, again marking a reverse trend when compared with the Belgian and adjacent Basins. This may result from restricted terrestrial environments coinciding with Variscan accidents and structural highs between the Artois anticline and Ardenne Masssif, or to their deposition followed by subsequent erosion prior to the Lower Ypresian marine transgression (cf. sea level drop 2 of Dupuis et al, 2011). Correlations and PETM impact on land All terrestrial units here described fill fluvial channels incised in marine Thanetian and older units such as the Cretaceous or the Variscan basement in Avesnois and Belgium, as already reported elsewhere in northern France (cf. sea level drop 1 of Dupuis et al., 2011). They exhibit locally cross stratification, lignite, flora or vertebrate fauna, for example at Leval, Hoegaarden and Dormaal, and/or are intensively silicified with scarce root or leaf casts. Similar fluvial sediments and silcretes are recognized in the first Sparnacian units and paleogeography of the Paris, Dieppe-Hampshire and London Basins, where the PEb is also present, the CIE being recorded on thicknesses between 3 m (as in AVE 007) to > 20 m (as in Sinceny). These features may be regarded now as constant in those Sparnacian landscapes recording the PETM, with very rapid lateral and vertical facies shift, particular paleosols, a few fossiliferous fluvial to lacustrine units and variable deposition rates/sediments preservation. Terrestrial sediments, flora and fauna have been described there before the CIE onset as well, for example at Cobham, Vasterival or Rivecourt (e. g. Smith et al., 2014). Lihons, an intermediate outlier situated between AVE 007 and Sparnacian sites of those basins has further been investigated: marine Thanetian sands are overlain by thin fluvial, lacustrine then lagoonal sediments, the two latter recording the CIE of the PETM on an interval 4 m thick. Here again the basal terrestrial sediments have been deposited before the PEb. In AVE 007, depositional environments are fluvial for the Mormal and Le Quesnoy Mbs, and evolve toward flood plain then palustrine ones for the Locquignol Mb, probably here after the river bed migration, but still recording sporo-pollen fluvial inputs from the hinterland, the whole indicating a rather humid subtropical climate. Compared to the Locquignol Mb, the sporopollinic assemblage of the Mormal and Le Quesnoy Mbs (below the CIE onset) is different, particularly regarding the Normapolles distribution, the Tricolpates, Tricolporates and Monocolpates relative pollen abundances and the pollen ratio of Plicapollis pseudoexcelsus/Juglandaceae. In the three Mbs, rapid vertical variations characterize pollen and fern spores assemblages, with peaks of particular taxa reaching 25 % of the total counts, such as for P. pseudoexcelsus, T. platycaryoides, C. dorogensis, P. mcgregorii, T. robustus. They suggest rapid floral changes in the catchment and/or sources changes in the surrounding landscapes compartments for the rivers supplying the fluvial sediments. Resinite particles are irregularly abundant as well as microcharcoals are occasionally abundant, notably slightly before the CIE onset and 1. 5 m above it, still within the CIE. The clay mineral assemblage is homogeneous along marine Thanetian units and strongly dominated by Illite-Smectite (IS) mixed layers, whatever the facies, while it is more variable in the marine Ypresian silts (abundant IS, followed by Kaolinite, Illite, Chlorite and Vermiculite). In contrast terrestrial units are dominated by IS followed by Kaolinite, Illite and very rare Chlorite, and no variation is observed across the PEb. Those data would suggest that major environmental changes have regionally begun before the PETM, at the very end of the Paleocene, when terrestrial realm has settled, in relation with a regional uplift. Clay minerals reflect constant reworking of preexisting weathering profiles established upon Cretaceous strata and Variscan basement, while vegetation modifications are subtle and more likely attributable to changes of depositional environment...|$|E

The samples were leached by NH 4 OAc, HCl, HF and HNO 3 and concentrations of these elements in leachates were determined by ICP-AES and FL AAS methods. Direct element analysis of solid samples was performed by an XRF method. By application of XRD analysis quartz and kaolinite were determined for lignite, while quartz, anhydrite, calcite, mullite, portlandite, lime and anatase were determined for ash samples. Vast majority of Se, Co and Ni was associated with clay minerals both in <b>lignite</b> <b>and</b> in ash samples (the only exception was high percentage of insoluble Ni in a bottom ash sample).
