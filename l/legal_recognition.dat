5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were not known for some time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it was not able to be considered as precedent in later judgments on the <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> of gender variance.|$|E

He proposed marriage to Sarria's mother Maria. Maria was willing, but José refused to allow it.

50|$|The first {{critical}} question for Durham {{is whether it}} gained de jure University status via the 1832 act of parliament (or the subsequent 1834 act of chapter) or, despite the various <b>legal</b> <b>recognitions</b> of its status in the intervening years, not until the 1837 royal charter. If it gained university status in 1832 or 1834, then Durham is the third oldest de jure university in England. Alternatively, if London was not truly established as a university in 1836 (see discussion below), then Durham is the third oldest de jure university in England regardless of which date is taken for its foundation.|$|R

5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 1997 (a {{day after}} Flores' 35th wedding anniversary), in a {{follow-up}} report on Televisa, a handful of women {{claimed to have been}} sexually abused by Flores approximately twenty years earlier. In a third report on August 17, shortly after the church's most significant holiday, former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager. These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely's anti-cult group, which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be stripped of its <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> as a religious organization. Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed.|$|E

40|$|The {{human right}} to water and {{sanitation}} is not explicitly recognized in the International Bill of Human Rights. Some scholars deny the legal existence of this right. However, {{over the last three}} decades, a number of <b>legal</b> <b>recognitions</b> of certain aspects of this right in specific universal and regional human rights treaties have allowed scholars to evidence the existence of the legal right to {{water and sanitation}}. In addition, an increasing number of high level international documents and declarations explicitly recognize the existence of this right, as reflected in declarations of the European Union and the General Assembly of the United Nations. In this context, it may be argued that there is a customary rule of international law in status nascendi concerning the right to water and sanitation...|$|R
5|$|Prior to the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges, U.S. states passed several {{different types of}} state constitutional amendments banning <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> of same-sex unions in U.S. state constitutions, referred to by proponents as defense of marriage amendments. The amendments define marriage as a union between one man and one woman and prevent civil unions or same-sex marriages from being legalized, {{though some of the}} amendments bar only the latter. The Obergefell {{decision in}} June 2015 invalidated these state constitutional amendments insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain written into the state constitutions.|$|E

While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's Justice Minister. In {{the wake of the}} attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to LGBT rights and human rights – among them Human Rights Watch, Jamaicans for Justice, and the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> of LGBT rights on the island.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival's future.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the war, the Flemish Movement had become an increasing phenomenon in Belgian politics. Traditionally French had been the dominant language of the Belgian government and the upper class of Belgian society. After a period of marginalization, the Flemish Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, one of the movement's chief objectives, culminating in the <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> of Dutch as a national language in 1898. In 1914 new laws were passed giving further concessions to the movement, but the outbreak of war meant that their implementation had been postponed. Numerous grievances were left unaddressed. Among the outstanding grievances was the University of Ghent which, though situated in Flanders, taught exclusively in French.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 1999, {{more than}} ten {{thousand}} practitioners congregated outside Communist Party of China headquarters in Zhongnanhai to request <b>legal</b> <b>recognition.</b> That evening, then-Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin issued a decision to eradicate Falun Gong. At Jiang's direction, on 7 June 1999 a special leading group was established within the party's Central Committee to manage the persecution. The resulting organisation, called the 6-10 Office, {{assumed the role of}} coordinating the anti-Falun Gong media coverage in the state-run press, as well influencing other party and state entities such as the courts and security agencies. On 19 July, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a document effectively banning the practice of Falun Gong. The following day, hundreds of practitioners were detained by security forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{struggle}} changed significantly when Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick, killed his rival John Comyn on 10 February 1306 at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries. He was crowned king (as Robert I) less than seven weeks later. Robert I battled to restore Scottish Independence as King for over 20 years, beginning by winning Scotland back from the Norman English invaders piece by piece. Victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1315, Edward Bruce, brother of the King, was briefly appointed High King of Ireland during an ultimately unsuccessful Scottish invasion of Ireland aimed at strengthening Scotland's position in its wars against England. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the Declaration of Arbroath, won the support of Pope John XXII, leading to the <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.|$|E

5|$|While {{policies}} {{were brought in}} to improve the living conditions of the working classes, conversely many middle-class Bolivians {{felt that they had}} seen their social standing decline, with Morales personally mistrusting the middle-classes, deeming them fickle. A 2006 law reallocated state-owned lands, with this agrarian reform entailing distributing land to traditional communities rather than individuals. In 2010, a law was introduced permitting the formation of recognised indigenous territories, although the implementation of this was hampered by bureaucracy and contesting claims over ownership. Morales' regime also sought to improve women's rights in Bolivia. In 2010, it founded a Unit of Depatriarchalization to oversee this process. Further seeking to provide <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> and support to LGBT rights, it declared June 28 to be Sexual Minority Rights Day in the country, and encouraged the establishment of a gay-themed television show on the state channel.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} King Alexander III in 1286, {{and then of}} his granddaughter and heir Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked Edward I of England to arbitrate, for which he {{extracted}} <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing John Balliol, {{the man with the}} strongest claim, who became king in 1292. Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland. In 1295 John, on the urgings of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with France, known as the Auld Alliance. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year William Wallace and Andrew de Moray raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk. The English barons refuted the French-inspired papal claim to Scottish overlordship in the Barons' Letter, 1301, claiming it rather as long possessed by English kings. Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305 he fell {{into the hands of the}} English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he believed he owed no allegiance to England.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the area {{currently}} classified a World Heritage Site was under restricted access and protection during the imperial era and has been under some form of <b>legal</b> <b>recognition</b> and protection since French colonization, having been incorporated into the Colony Domains Service in 1897 and the National Inventory in 1939. It has since benefited from legal municipal protection and two national laws (passed in 1982 and 1983) protecting sites of historical and national interest. The Office of the Cultural Site of Ambohimanga (OSCAR), created by the Ministry of Culture, has managed the site and its entrance fees and state subventions since 2006, when a five-year management plan was developed for implementation by the group's 30 employees. These management and conservation activities are conducted {{in cooperation with the}} local population within the Rural Commune of Ambohimanga Rova. The Village Committee, comprising representatives of all the adjacent quarters and the local community, are also involved in the protection of the site. Conservation of Ambohimanga is further supported by a private association, Mamelomaso, which has also been active in campaigning for awareness and protection of cultural heritage and has contributed to the preservation of numerous other sites of cultural and historic significance in the highlands. In addition to helping replant the Ambohimanga woodlands, Mamelomaso has contributed to the restoration of the stones around the source of the spring, erected informational plaques around the hill, and paved a number of footpaths within the site. UNESCO contributed special financial support to restore historic structures at Ambohimanga threatened by exceptionally heavy rainfall and landslides.|$|E
