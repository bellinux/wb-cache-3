25|$|Rey Cometa was {{accompanied}} by Stuka, Jr. for his one-on-one match with Namajague, while his opponent had Okumura at ringside, bringing all four participants in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas main event back together again. Okumura helped his partner by attacking Rey Cometa before the bell could even ring, giving Namajague the advantage for the first fall, allowing him to pin Cometa after a power bomb. Stuka, Jr. helped Cometa by keeping Okumura at bay during the second fall, even when the two wrestlers fought outside the ring. At one point Rey Cometa was able to leap off the elevated stage, landing a Moonsault assault on Namajague. Once back inside the ring Rey Cometa forced Namajague to submit to an Armbar submission hold. The third fall was the longest of the match as saw both men hold the advantage in the match at different times. After <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> would lose Rey Cometa was able to outsmart Namajague, allowing him to land a 450° splash so he could pin him to win the match. Following the match Namajague, who had resisted removing his mask during the Dos Leyendas show, accepted the loss and knelt down as Rey Cometa began to cut his hair. After getting a few handfuls of Namajague's black and bleached hair he left the official CMLL barber finish up, shaving all of Namajague's hair off while still sitting {{in the center of}} the ring.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{introduction}} of the participants of the fifth match the rudos, who had entered first, jumped Guapos Internacional (Shocker and Strongman) with La Peste Negra attacking Strongman while Atlantis jumped on Shocker as he entered the ring. When Latino entered the ring rival Héctor Garza attacked him from behind. The arrival of Místico drew a standing ovation from the crowd, but it did not turn the advantage as the rudos kept beating down their opponents even before the bell. Once the bell rang the rudos ignored the referee's instructions and were disqualified for excessive violence against the tecnico team. In the second fall Latino ended up with Garza in a pinning predicament, and despite the intentionally slow count from crooked referee El Titantes Latino won the second fall, taking the match in two straight falls for his side. The main event was refereed by El Tirantes, a rudo referee that especially took the side of Los Invasores since he also worked for AAA for many years. Mr. Águila was the first, followed by Rey Bucanero who was accompanied by Perico the parrot, his mascota. The crowd was solidly behind the [...] "home team" [...] of Rey Bucanero, voicing their support even before the opening bell rang. During the first fall El Tirantes allowed Mr. Águila to blatantly cheat to take the first fall. Following the match Jose Luis Mendieta, a representative of the Mexico City boxing and wrestling commission, removed El Tirantes as referee of the match and replaced him with Baby Richards, an impartial referee. With his advantage gone Mr. Águila was on the defensive from the beginning and Bucanero managed to tie up the match with one fall apiece only minutes later. The third fall saw the advantage shift between the two with Mr. Águila <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was about to take Rey Bucanero's hair on several occasions, but in the end Bucanero pinned Mr. Águila to win the match. The crowd showed their vocal appreciation while Mr. Águila had his long mohawk shaved off {{in the middle of the}} ring.|$|E
