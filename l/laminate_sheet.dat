Together with the increasing CPO production the wastes generated at palm oil industry are in growing as well. One of the solid waste (biomass) at the palm oil mill is empty fruit bunches of oil palm (EFB). The utilization of EFB for environmental friendly composites (bio composites) can reduce the amount of this biomass which so far has less uses for technical sectors. The good properties of natural fibers of EFB for technical applications are such as high mechanical strength, good heat resistance and as lightweight material, good resistance electrical conductivity.

The effects of temperature within the blank on formability and punch force are investigated. To study the <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> behavior; three blank temperatures namely, 25 ̊ C, 100 ̊ C and 160 ̊ C are examined. In addition, the effect of grain size on punch force and material behavior for aluminum alloys 5052 and 1050 are studied. The aluminum sheets are annealed at 350 ̊ C 400 ̊ C and 450 ̊ C. The grain size effect, which strongly affects some properties such as formability parameters, stress, elongation and friction coefficient, is investigated. To measure the grain size the microstructure of Al 5052 and Al 1050 sheets is revealed by Polarized Light Microscope (PLM). In addition, to clarify the relative influences of grain size on the formability of Al 5052, some tensile tests on annealed specimen at 350 ̊ C, and 450 ̊ C are performed.

The home-built vertical mist-CVD system was used {{without the use of}} H 2 or CO gases. The tiny mist was generated using a high-frequency ultrasonic vibration. The effects of various parameters including furnace temperature, ferrocene/ethanol ratio, the deposition position in the reactor, flow rate of carrier gas, and deposition time on the SWCNTs formation were investigated using SEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopy. The furnace temperature and the flow rate of carrier gas were found to determine the diameter and crystallinity of nanotubes.

In order to survey the thinning behavior in <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> behavior during warm deep-drawing process; three blank temperatures namely, 25 ° C, 100 ° C and 160 ° C are examined.

40|$|The {{need for}} lighter weight {{vehicles}} to improve fuel efficiency {{is becoming increasingly}} imperative. Sheet magnesium alloys offer the potential as a light weight material {{for use in the}} transportation industry due to their high specific strength and stiffness. In fact, magnesium alloys have the highest strength-to-weight ratio of all the common structural metals. Though the demand for light weight materials is present and sheet magnesium is available, the use of these materials in automotive applications has been rather limited due to high production costs and poor corrosion performance and formability. A promising process to produce wrought magnesium sheet in a more cost effective manner is Twin Roll Casting (TRC). In addition, enhanced corrosion resistance and ductility may be realized in these sheet alloys with the possible introduction of a clad layer during the TRC process thereby producing a <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> where the surface properties are different from the core. The focus of this research was to investigate the potential of cladding magnesium alloy AZ 31 material during the TRC process. As part of this research, a thermal fluid mathematical model of the TRC process was developed, which was then further refined to include the addition of a clad layer during the process. The TRC model was validated through experimental work conducted at the Pohang Institute of Science and Technology (POSTECH University), where TRC experiments of AZ 31 were conducted under various casting conditions. The as-cast microstructure of the AZ 31 sheets were characterized and measurements of the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) made at the mid-region were compared to predicted microstructures from the TRC model based on solidification history. The predicted SDAS matched with the measured values, thus, validating the model. Using the validated TRC model the feasibility of adding a clad layer was assessed and various simulations were conducted to observe the effects of cast speed, cast thickness, and clad material on the thermal history and temperature profile in both the clad and core domains. The material properties and clad thickness did not seem to impact the temperature profiles significantly, while the cast speed and initial temperature dictated whether or not the cast would be successful. Using these operational parameters a process window was created (based on the CANMET facility) to illustrate the feasibility of casting and cladding during TRC. This window is beneficial for future experimentation and understanding the effects of these casting parameters...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage {{technology}} {{has become a}} possible solution {{to address the problem}} of global warming due to the increasing use of fossil fuels. The application of this technology by many carbon dioxide emitting industrial units is still hindered by the process and equipment cost associated with the capture of carbon dioxide. Zeolites have become a major player in this field due to their high adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide. Traditional use of zeolites in the form of pellets or beads has issues relating to high mass transfer resistance and increased energy consumption required to overcome high pressure drop for such systems. Novel structured adsorbents have been developed to manage these problems but they require high precision and cost for their manufacture. Although they are superior to beads/pellets in terms of breakthrough characteristics, they have very low loading of adsorbent. To overcome the limitations of high cost and low loading of non-particulate structures and the disadvantages of the conventional adsorbent structures, new preparatory techniques for adsorbent structures are being researched. For more practical applications, a zeolite structured adsorbent needs to be created that has high adsorption capacity, low pressure drop, high mass transfer and provides overall high system efficiency. In addition, the very large scale of the flue gas capture application demands that the adsorbent structure should be made using low cost materials and processes. Motivated by the low cost of papermaking technology, we have studied and adapted this technique to create a highly loaded, large surface area sheet structure. Zeolites have already found use in the paper industry as fillers and retention aids and can therefore be easily adapted to current paper mills to create structured laminate adsorbents. This project looks towards creating zeolite laminate structured adsorbent using papermaking techniques for carbon dioxide capture. The selection of materials for the preparation of laminate structures is initially done to create structures that are strong and have high porosity with high loading of zeolite. An easy method of preparing laminate zeolite sheet structures is also outlined. This leads to the next part of the project which is characterisation of the zeolite <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> structures. Although few materials were used in preparation of the sheets, the many variables involved in sheet forming would make it very time consuming to create each unique sheet structure and characterise the properties. Hence, to speed up the process, a partial factorial design method was used to characterise the laminate sheets. 16 experiments were completed. SEM and mercury porosity methods were used to characterise the porosity of the sheet structures. These results show that porosity of the structure is mainly affected by the amount of silica present in the structure. Nitrogen adsorption and carbon dioxide adsorption measurements were studied to determine the loading in the <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> structures, since the adsorption capacity is completely dependent on the zeolite. The strength of the laminate structures were measured using a novel testing method as it was difficult to apply the routine strength measurement methods to some of the weak laminate samples. Considering the application of the laminate structures, a vibratory sieve was used to determine the comparative strength of the different structures from the partial factorial design. It was found that laminate structures with either 40 - 55 wt% micron zeolite or 30 wt% nano zeolite had adequate strength for breakthrough testing. Structures with higher loading of zeolite fell apart very easily. The kinetics of the laminate samples were also measured using the Rate of Adsorption software in ASAP 2010. These results show that the presence of nano zeolite increases the adsorption kinetics of the laminate structures and on the whole the laminate structure had higher kinetics when compared to powder or beads due to overcoming macropore diffusion resistance. The structures which had the best characteristics from the partial factorial design were used for breakthrough testing. Testing for different porosities, it was found that structures with high porosity i. e. samples having 40 wt% zeolite had higher effective diffusivities and lower pressure drop when compared to structure with low porosity i. e. samples having 20 wt% zeolite. Other methods of increasing spacing between the folds of the laminate structures were also tested and using a wire to create spacing was found to be the best method to lower pressure drop. In some instances, the effective diffusivities were reduced while in other instances they were the same. But the method of winding to produce laminate structures for breakthrough testing produced highly variable results. An idea of printing hydrophobic channels on the paper samples was considered to improve breakthrough characteristics of the laminate structures. Since printing is easy, cheap and can be adapted to a large industrial setting, this method of creating channels for gas flow in the laminate structures has many advantages. An initial assessment of this method showed that using AKD to create hydrophobic patterns on the sheet was successful as different levels of depth were observed between the AKD treated and untreated sections in the final laminate structure. To create distinguishable regions of AKD treated and untreated sections, the amount of the zeolite loading and ceramic loading were also fixed at 8 g zeolite and 6. 5 g ceramic fibres. A method of printing parallel hydrophobic channels was established and the sheets were coated with two different weight % of colloidal silica (40 wt% and 20 wt%). These differing amounts of colloidal silica create laminate structures with different depths of channels as seen from SEM imaging. Breakthrough assessment of the printed laminate structures show that the structures with 20 wt% silica have higher effective diffusivities and lower pressure drop when compared to structures with 40 wt% silica or structures without hydrophobic printing, showing that laminate structures with printed channels is a very attractive adsorbent structure for CO 2 capture...|$|E
40|$|Bio-adaptable 2 -layer polytetrafluoroethylene/polyethylene (PTFE/PE) <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> were {{prepared}} {{by a new}} adhesion method, a double-step treatment consisting of applying low dose (0. 43 MGy) homogeneous low energy electron beam irradiation (HLEBI) to the 2 -layer assembly where the HLEBI penetrates through the PTFE and PE layers, respectively, prior to hot-press under 5 MPa and 433 K. Although the adhesion of the PTFE/PE sheets cannot be observed without the new double-step treatment, bonding forces were created {{as evidenced by the}} mean adhesive forces of peeling resistance (oFp). The adhesion cannot be observed without HLEBI. On the other hand, application of a small dose of HLEBI (less than 0. 43 MGy) prior to hot-press lamination enhances the oFp at each Pp. The maximum oFp values at each Pp (0. 06, 0. 50 and 0. 94) of the <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> irradiated at 0. 13, 0. 13, and 0. 22 MGy are 5. 44, 10. 7, and 19. 7 Nm 1, respectively. Based on the 3 -parameter Weibull equation, the lowest oFp value at Pp of zero (Fs) could be estimated. An increasing trend in Fs occurs by the double-step treatment applying HLEBI up to 0. 43 MGy reaching a maximum at 2. 66 Nm 1, improving the safety level without radiation damage of PTFE/PE. It was more than 6 times higher than that of PTFE/Polyurethane (PU) (0. 4 Nm 1).
