5|$|In 2006, Lexus began {{sales of}} the GS 450h, a V6 hybrid {{performance}} sedan, and launched the fourth generation <b>LS</b> <b>line,</b> comprising both standard- and long-wheelbase V8 (LS 460 and LS 460 L) and hybrid (LS 600h and LS 600h L) versions. The fifth generation ES 350 also debuted in the same year. The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as the most expensive sedan ever produced in Japan. By the end of 2006, Lexus' annual sales had reached 475,000 vehicles worldwide. In January 2007, Lexus announced a new F marque performance division, which would produce racing-inspired versions of its performance models. The IS F, made its debut at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, accompanied by a concept car, the LF-A.|$|E
50|$|By March 2007, {{the initial}} {{allocation}} of LS hybrids in the U.S. was nearly sold out, with 1,850 preorders placed months before debut. As of October 2007, Lexus sold 6,093 LS 600h's worldwide. When the LS hybrid originally {{went on sale}} in July 2007, Lexus initially targeted 7,000 total units worldwide for the first year, and 2,000 annually in other markets. Ward's Auto and other media outlets reported that the Lexus LS 600h first year's (2007) allocation was entirely sold out {{and that there was}} a one-year backorder as a result. Positioned as the halo vehicles of the <b>LS</b> <b>line,</b> the LS 600h and LS 600h L saw corporate purchases for emissions reductions, along with use as an official state car. In 2008, a redesign of the rear battery area increased trunk space by 20%.|$|E

Significantly higher total and IgG antibody responses to SRBC were found after intramuscular immunisation in the high antibody responder (H) line versus the low antibody responder (<b>L)</b> <b>line</b> and the control (C) line. Also significantly higher antibody titres {{were found in the}} C line as compared to the <b>L</b> <b>line.</b> Ca-dependent (classical) and Ca-independent (alternative) complement haemolytic activity was significantly higher in the H line than in the <b>L</b> <b>line.</b> Also initial complement haemolytic activity and C 3 levels prior to immunisation with SRBC were significantly higher in the H than in the <b>L</b> <b>line.</b> The <b>L</b> <b>line,</b> on the other hand, showed numerically higher Factor B levels. Immunisation with SRBC was followed by a different consumption of C 3 in serum of the H <b>line</b> than the <b>L</b> <b>line.</b> The results indicated that divergent selection of chickens for specific antibody responses to SRBC affected complement levels and C 3 consumption in these chickens.

50|$|The Lexus LS (XF40) is {{the fourth}} {{generation}} of the Lexus <b>LS</b> <b>line</b> of flagship sedans. Lexus debuted the model line at the 2006 North American International Auto Show, with variants including the standard wheelbase LS 460 (USF40) and long wheelbase LS 460 L (USF41); the chassis codes (USF40/USF41) are derived from the fourth generation XF40 platform code and UR series engine designation. In development from 2001, the final design was selected for the V8 models in late 2003, with the hybrid variant's design finalized in 2004. Introduced at the 2006 New York International Auto Show, all-wheel drive hybrid models, the standard wheelbase LS 600h (UVF45) and long wheelbase LS 600h L (UVF46), joined the lineup in the 2008 model year. The LS 460 and LS 460 L models feature a 4.6 L UR series V8 and an 8-speed automatic transmission, while hybrid models are powered by a 5.0 L UR series V8 engine equipped with electric motors, with a continuously variable transmission and all-wheel drive. All-wheel drive versions of the non-hybrid LS 460 (USF45) and LS 460 L (USF46) models were introduced at the 2008 Moscow International Automobile Salon. The XF40 received updates for the 2010 and 2013 model years.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Open-field {{behavior}} was examined in Japanese quail chicks genetically selected for either reduced (LS, low stress) or exaggerated (HS, high stress) plasma corticosterone response to immobilization stress. Chicks of the <b>LS</b> <b>line</b> showed less freezing and ambulated sooner {{than did their}} HS counter-parts. These findings suggest that exposure to an open-field or novel environ-ment elicited less fear in LS than in HS chicks. They also support the suggestion that tearfulness and adrenocortical activation are positively associated and indicate that selection for differential adrenocortical responsiveness exerted concomitant effects on fear-related behavior...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study proposes more {{objective}} methods for deciding the appropriate {{direction of the}} sylvian fissure dissection during surgical clip-ping in middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation aneurysms. Methods: We reviewed data of 36 consecutive patients with MCA bi-furcation aneurysms. We measured 2 indices preoperatively on 3 -dimen-sional computed tomography angiography (3 D-CTA). Analysis of the calcu-lated data allowed us to select the appropriate direction of sylvian fissure dissection for ease of proximal control of M 1. Statistically, Mann-Whitney test was used. Results: We classified subjects into 2 groups based on the technical level of M 1 exposure during surgical clipping. When {{it was difficult to}} expose M 1, subjects were assigned to Group I, and Group II were subjects in whom M 1 exposure was easy. The mean difference between the dis-tances extending from the limbus sphenoidale (<b>LS)</b> <b>line</b> to the internal carotid artery bifurcation and extending from the <b>LS</b> <b>line</b> to the MCA bi-furcation was 1. 00 ± 0. 42 mm in group I and 4. 39 ± 2. 14 mm in group II. The mean M 1 angle was 9. 36 ± 3. 73 ° in the group I and 34. 05 ± 16. 71 ° in the group II (M 1 slope gap p < 0. 05, M 1 angle p < 0. 05). Conclusion: We have found an objective method for preoperatively ver-ifying ease of exposure of M 1 artery during surgical clipping. Therefore, we suggest use of the preoperative M 1 slope gap and M 1 angle as in-dicators in 3 D-CTA selecting the direction of sylvian fissure dissection for easy proximal control of M 1.

40|$|Data of Merino sheep {{descended from}} two {{divergent}} selection lines for (H <b>line)</b> and against (<b>L</b> <b>line)</b> multiple rearing ability {{were collected in}} three different trials to compare response to stressful situations between lines. Trial 1 : the behaviour of 138, 20 -month-old sheep born in 2001 and 124, 8 -month-old sheep born in 2002 were observed in an arena test. Experimental animals amounted to 111 and 101 for the H line in the respective years. Corresponding numbers for the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> were 27 and 23, respectively. Progeny born in 2001 were accustomed to handling, as the tests were performed shortly after routine performance recording. Lambs born in 2002 were unaccustomed to handling when tested. Progeny from the H line born in 2002 allowed a smaller (P < 0. 01) minimum distance {{between them and the}} human operator seated between them and a group of similar aged sheep than <b>L</b> <b>line</b> contemporaries. Progeny born in the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> during 2002 defecated more (P < 0. 05) frequently than H line contemporaries. No line differences were found in progeny born during 2001. Trials 2 and 3 were designed to test whether the putative line difference in stress response would impact on physical meat quality. Trial 2 : a total of 103, 18 - 20 -month-old progeny from the two selection lines were slaughtered during 2001, 2002 - 2003. Mean slaughter weight, dressing percentage and carcass weight of H line animals were between 5 and 13 % higher (P < 0. 05) than that of <b>L</b> <b>line</b> animals. There were no differences in cooking loss, drip loss and tenderness between the two lines. As pertaining to the meat colour, <b>L</b> <b>line</b> progeny had less vivid red meat, as seen by their lower (P < 0. 05) a* colour reading and chroma values. The <b>L</b> <b>line</b> animals had lower (P < 0. 01) initial pH values as measured in the Musculus longissimus dorsi. These results are indicative of susceptibility to acute, short-term stress. Trial 3 : 20 progeny of the two selection lines were slaughtered and their muscle pH measured at 11 intervals from 45 min to 48 h post slaughter. As in Trial 1, the initial pH of the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> animals were lower (P < 0. 05) than that of H line animals. An opposite tendency was observed by 48 h post slaughter.

The population has been divergently selected from the same base since 1986, either for (high or H line) or against (low or <b>L</b> <b>line)</b> maternal multiple rearing ability. All animals were inspected for sheep lice (Bovicola ovis) during September / October 2002 after a wool growth period of at least 4 months.

Direct additive genetic variances - expressed as a ratio of the total phenotypic variance (h 2, direct heritability) - were estimated at 0. 12 ± 0. 03 for birth weight, 0. 70 ± 0. 05 for birth coat score and 0. 13 ± 0. 04 for weaning weight. Maternal genetic variance ratios (m 2) were estimated at 0. 23 ± 0. 04 for birth weight and 0. 10 ± 0. 04 for weaning weight. It was not significant for birth coat score. Maternal permanent environmental variance ratios (c 2) for the respective traits amounted to 0. 08 ± 0. 03 for birth weight, 0. 04 ± 0. 02 for birth coat score and 0. 08 ± 0. 03 for weaning weight. No consistent phenotypic or genetic differences in favour of either line were found for birth weight or birth coat score.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of different levels of feed restriction (FR) on immune responses of chicken lines divergently selected for high (H) and low (L) antibody responses to SRBC. We hypothesized that severe feed restriction suppresses immune responses and the level of immune suppression differs between birds with different genetic background. Therefore, we tested antibody responses, blood lymphocyte proliferative responses, and production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) by Zymosan A-stimulated blood cells in chicken lines maintained on 3 levels of FR. The H line birds had significantly higher antibody responses, higher ROI production, and lower corticosterone (CORT) levels when compared with the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> birds. Feed restriction induced no significant effect on specific antibody responses to either a T helper 1 - (Mycobacterium butyricum) or a T helper 2 - (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) type antigen. Feed-restricted birds showed a marked reduction in natural antibodies binding lipoteichoic acid, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in response to stimulation with concanavalin A, BW gain, and relative lymphoid organ weights compared with the birds fed ad libitum. However, FR birds showed a markedly enhanced ROI production, and plasma CORT levels compared with the birds fed ad libitum. The enhanced ROI production and suppressed lymphocyte proliferation coinciding with enhanced plasma CORT levels suggest stress-mediated immunomodulating effects of FR. A significant treatment by line interaction was found for ROI production; the increase of ROI production was larger in the H line than in the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> under severe FR. The increase in CORT levels was larger in the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> than in the H line under severe FR. Furthermore, the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> gained more BW than the H line under ad libitum conditions.

Previous nutritional studies suggested that the F line had a better capability to use glucose than the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> during feeding trials. Based on that, we put forward the hypothesis that F line has a greater metabolic ability to clear a glucose load effectively, compared to <b>L</b> <b>line.</b> In order to test this hypothesis, 250 mg/kg glucose was intraperitoneally injected to the two rainbow trout lines fasted for 48 h. Hyperglycemia was observed after glucose treatment in both lines without affecting the phosphorylation of AMPK (cellular energy sensor) and Akt-TOR (insulin signaling) components. Liver glucokinase and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase expression levels were increased by glucose, whereas mRNA levels of β-oxidation enzymes (CPT 1 a, CPT 1 b, HOAD and ACO) were down-regulated in the white skeletal muscle of both lines. Regarding the genotype effect, concordant with normoglycemia at 12 h after glucose treatment, higher muscle glycogen was found in F <b>line</b> compared to <b>L</b> <b>line</b> which exhibited hyperglycemia. Moreover, mRNA levels of hepatic glycolytic enzymes (GK, 6 PFK and PK), gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK and muscle fatty acid oxidation enzymes (CPT 1 a, CPT 1 b and HOAD) were concurrently higher in the F line. Overall, {{these findings suggest that}} F line may have a better ability to maintain glucose homeostasis than <b>L</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{data from}} the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT) that simulates a CIE plasma by {{sweeping}} the electron beam to approximate a Maxwellian velocity distribution. These results are compared to spectra of confirmed astronomical CIE plasmas (e. g. outer regions of x-ray clusters) observed by XMM/RGS. We utilize the Photon Clean Method (PCM) to quantify these spectra (EBIT and XMM/RGS) {{in the form of}} ratios of Fe <b>L</b> <b>lines</b> in the emission complex near 1 keV. The variances of line fluxes are measured with bootstrap methods (Efron 1979). Both of these observations are further compared with theoretical predictions of Fe <b>L</b> <b>line</b> fluxes from APED and similar atomic databases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{selection}} for growth rate on weights and qualitative carcass and muscle traits were assessed by comparing two lines selected for live body weight at 63 days {{of age and}} a cryopreserved control population raised contemporaneously with generation 5  selected rabbits. The animals were divergently selected for five generations for either a high (H line) or a low (<b>L</b> <b>line)</b> body weight, based on their BLUP breeding value. Heritability (h^ 2) was 0. 22 for 63 -d body weight (N = 4754). Growth performance and quantitative carcass traits in the C group were intermediate between the H and <b>L</b> <b>lines</b> (N = 390). Perirenal fat proportion (h^ 2 = 0. 64) and dressing out percentage (h^ 2 = 0. 55) ranked in the order L < H = C (from high to low). The weight and cross-sectional area of the Semitendinosus muscle, and the mean diameter of the constitutive myofibres were reduced in the <b>L</b> <b>line</b> only (N = 140). In the Longissimus muscle (N = 180), the ultimate pH (h^ 2 = 0. 16) and the maximum shear force reached in the Warner-Braztler test (h^ 2 = 0. 57) were slightly modified by selection...|$|R
