5|$|The conspirators {{first told}} Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, {{informed}} his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In {{order to find}} out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and <b>listened</b> <b>in.</b> Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} also {{tracked the}} Soviet moon probes, including Lunik II from 13 to 14 September 1959 as {{it hit the}} moon; this was proven by the telescope by measuring {{the effect of the}} moon's gravity on the probe,Piper, Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 42Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, pp. 269–271 and Luna 3 around 4 October 1959.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 271 Also, the telescope tracked Luna 9 in February 1966, the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon. The telescope <b>listened</b> <b>in</b> on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press – the probe transmitted, likely intentionally to increase chances of reception, in the international format for image transmission by newswire – and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5|$|James H. Doolittle {{commanding}} Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) {{was ordered}} to formulate an air interdiction campaign. He named it Operation Flax. Operation Flax called for Allied fighters to intercept the aerial convoys over the Sicily-Tunisia strait. Allied units were also briefed to carry out major offensive operations against Axis airfields in Tunisia and the overcrowded staging fields in Sicily. They were also ordered to carry out anti—shipping sweeps. Flax was an operation which was unlikely to work {{more than a few}} times, as shown by the relative impunity with which the surviving Axis air transports operated at night after the operation had begun. The flight time across the Strait of Sicily was so short that aerial interception could be made only with precise intelligence. The Germans understood this but did not know that their communications had been compromised and were being read by Allied intelligence. Ignorant of their intelligence leaks, they operated by day. Since their enemy had the option of flying by night, and the weather conditions were not ideal for interception operations, the Allies delayed the implementation of Operation Flax until the most German transport aircraft were in operation so that the blow would be as decisive as possible. Allied intelligence <b>listened</b> <b>in</b> to the Y-stations until they were sure they could strike.|$|E

Detectives reasoned that if Castor were truly genuine about her love for her late husbands, then she would eventually visit their graves. They wanted to observe her behavior while there. Castor, however, never visited. The investigators soon felt {{the only way to}} prove Castor responsible for both homicides was to have Wallace's body exhumed. A toxicology screening ruled that Wallace had also been killed through antifreeze poisoning.|$|E

The Laxalt {{children were}} raised largely by their mother as Dominique spent {{long periods of}} time away from the household as he tended to his sheep in the deserts and mountains of Nevada. The children all helped Therese at The French Hotel. It was there that Paul first acquired an interest in politics as he <b>listened</b> <b>in</b> on the conversations of the politicians who patronized the restaurant (including the legendary U.S. Senator Patrick McCarran). Paul played on the 1938 state basketball champion team at Carson High School before graduating and attending Santa Clara University. When World War II broke out, Paul joined the U.S. Army and served as a medic, seeing action in the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines. After the war, he graduated from the University of Denver (1949) law school.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal had injury {{problems}} with Horace Cope ruled out. Additional trains {{were put on}} to get Cardiff's fans to Wembley, and police reinforcements to keep fans at bay who had been sold fake tickets. A concert was held prior to the game, which included the first rendition of Abide with Me, which has since become a cup final tradition. It was the first FA Cup Final broadcast on the radio, which coined the phrase [...] "back to square one".

500|$|Irritated {{over this}} affair, shortly after Theodora's death (late 548/early 549) he became {{involved}} in the so-called [...] "Armenian Plot" [...] or [...] "Conspiracy of Artabanes". The real instigator, however, was a relative of his, named Arsaces, who proposed to assassinate Justinian, and elevate Justinian's cousin Germanus on the throne instead. The conspirators thought Germanus amenable to their plans, since he had been dissatisfied with Justinian's meddling in the settling of the will of his recently deceased brother Boraides, which had initially named Germanus as the major beneficiary as opposed to the former's sole daughter. The conspirators approached Germanus's son Justin first, and revealed to him the plot. Immediately, he informed his father, and he in turn informed the comes excubitorum Marcellus. In order to find out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus was concealed nearby and <b>listened</b> <b>in.</b> Although Marcellus hesitated to inform Justinian without further proof, eventually he revealed the conspiracy to the emperor. Justinian ordered the conspirators imprisoned and questioned, but they were otherwise treated remarkably leniently. Artabanes was stripped of his offices and confined to the palace under guard, but was soon pardoned.|$|E

500|$|Although Harding's first {{address to}} Congress called for passage of anti-lynching legislation, he {{initially}} seemed inclined to {{do no more}} for African Americans than Republican presidents of the recent past had; he asked cabinet officers to find places for blacks in their departments. Sinclair suggested {{that the fact that}} Harding received two-fifths of the Southern vote in 1920 led him to see political opportunity for his party in the Solid South. On October 26, 1921, Harding gave a speech in Birmingham, Alabama, to a segregated audience of 20,000 whites and 10,000 blacks. Harding, while stating that the social and racial differences between whites and blacks could not be bridged, urged equal political rights for the African American. Many African Americans at that time voted Republican, especially in the Democratic South, and Harding stated he did not mind seeing that support end if the result was a strong two-party system in the South. He was willing to see literacy tests for voting continue, if applied fairly to white and black. [...] "Whether you like it or not," [...] Harding told his segregated audience, [...] "unless our democracy is a lie, you must stand for that equality." [...] The white section of the audience <b>listened</b> <b>in</b> silence while the black section cheered.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Systematic Chaos was generally positive. Writing for MetalReview.com, Jon Eardley called the album, [...] "another solid outing". He complimented Petrucci for [...] "Constant Motion", writing that it contains [...] "some {{of the best}} riffs Petrucci has brought to the table". In addition, he called {{the latter part of}} [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] "the most brutal part in any song to date". Reviewing for Metal Invader, Nikos Patelis called the album, [...] "energetic, sharp– edged, full of beautiful melodies and heavy riffs, long epic compositions". He called Dream Theater's instrumentalists [...] "four masters of music that use their instruments as if they were their limbs", in addition to stating, [...] "James LaBrie sounds more mature than ever". In conclusion, Patelis called Systematic Chaos, [...] "an excellent album that needs many times to be <b>listened</b> <b>in</b> order to be digested". Greg Prato, of AllMusic, wrote [...] " [...] 'Forsaken' proves wrong those who say that Dream Theater is all about instrumental gymnastics and not songwriting". He also compared riffs in [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] to the band Pantera. Overall, he states [...] " [...] the quintet sticks to the prog metal game plan that they've followed since their inception". Reviewer Chad Bowar of About.com, wrote that [...] "In the Presence of Enemies - Part I" [...] is [...] "an effective way to {{set the tone for the}} rest of the songs". Overall, Bowar gave the album four out of five stars, calling it, [...] "one of the best Dream Theater releases in quite a while".|$|E
500|$|Ashman {{first met}} American actress and singer Jodi Benson {{while he was}} {{directing}} her in Smile. After the production closed prematurely, Ashman invited Smiles entire female cast to audition for The Little Mermaid using [...] "Part of Your World", {{although he did not}} tell them the name of the project they were auditioning for. Ashman mailed a copy of his demo of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to Benson, to which she <b>listened</b> <b>in</b> preparation for her audition. Benson then recorded a brief sample of the song on a reel-to-reel tape, which she mailed to Disney. All audition tapes were left unidentified so that the candidates would remain anonymous to Musker and Clements, delighting Ashman when the directors ultimately selected Benson's tape to be the voice of Ariel. Her first voice acting role, for which she had to be carefully trained on properly projecting into the studio microphone, Benson found the process of recording [...] "Part of Your World" [...] somewhat difficult after Ashman instructed her to approach it as though she was reciting a monologue as opposed to singing a song, although she found Ashman telling her exactly how he wanted her to perform its lyrics helpful with benefiting her entire performance. Ashman remained in the recording booth with Benson during the entire recording process, advising her on performing the song with intensity as opposed to belting it and whispering lines to her as she sang them. It was rare for a filmmaker to direct a performer from within the booth, requiring Ashman to move carefully to prevent his gestures from being recorded by the microphone. Initially struggling to capture Ariel's [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning", Benson requested that the studio's lights be dimmed to simulate the feeling of being underwater. Menken and Ashman deliberately selected segments from Benson's recording session that [...] "are not perfectly sung" [...] to include in the final version, ranging from unsustained, incorrect notes lacking in vibrato to spoken words, because the songwriters wanted her performance to sound as [...] "real" [...] as possible.|$|E

She {{subsequently}} traveled to Washington's camp in White Plains, New York under the name [...] "Mrs. Barnes". Because she {{was familiar with the}} artillery used during the Revolution, she was able to relay valuable information about the Americans' materials and strategy. Initially, Bates' mission was to find a disloyal soldier in Washington's camp who could give the British intelligence some potential intel, but she was unsuccessful in that mission. She then changed her mission while at the camp, and <b>listened</b> <b>in</b> on many conversations and counted artillery pieces on the camp. At George Washington's camp in White Plains, American troops were planning the Rhode Island Campaign. She recorded valuable intelligence on American movement into Rhode Island.|$|E
2500|$|Webern's music {{began to}} be {{performed}} more widely in the 1920s; by the mid-1940s, its effect was decisive on many composers, even as far-flung as John Cage. In part because Webern had largely remained the most obscure and arcane composer of the Second Viennese School during his own lifetime, interest in Webern's music increased after World War II as it came to represent a universally or generally valid, systematic, and compellingly logical model of new composition, with his œuvre acquiring what Alex Ross calls [...] "a saintly, visionary aura". When Webern’s Piano Variations were performed at Darmstadt in 1948, young composers <b>listened</b> <b>in</b> a quasi-religious trance. In 1955, the second issue of Eimert and Stockhausen's journal Die Reihe was devoted to Webern's œuvre, and in 1960 his lectures were published by Universal Edition.|$|E
