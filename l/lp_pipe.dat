Previous study [1] showed that a row of identical T-joints, forming a multiple side branch system is a reason-able model for corrugated pipes at low whistling frequencies. The current research is carried out to investigate the effect of various geometrical parameters (e. g. cavity width to cavity depth ratio, pipe diameter to pitch ratio) and operational parameters (e. g. system pressure). In this context several experiments {{have been carried out}} with different side branch geometries to characterize the whistling behavior of the system. In this paper the discussion is kept limited to the effect of cavity depth and edge shape on whistling frequency and pulsation amplitude. The T-joints that have been used have an internal diameter (DP) of 33 mm which is equal to the inner diameter (Dsb) and depth (Lsb) of the the side branch. The length of the main <b>pipe</b> (<b>LP)</b> of each T-joint is 100 mm and the side branch is located half way along this segment. Plugs with different heights were employed to vary the depth of the side branch segment. The multiple side branch system is connected to a high pressure air supply system. The acquisitio...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Environmental stable {{isotopes}} (15 N, 13 C, 18 O and 2 H) {{are used}} to understand the biogeochemical pathways that affect carbon and nitrogen pools at the Trail Road Landfill (TRL) leachate plume, located at about 25 km West of Ottawa City. Samples of leachate and leachate-polluted groundwater were collected at TRL site from 2003 to 2005. A variety of analytical techniques (ion-selective combination electrode, simultaneous distillation and titration, ion chromatography, denitrifier method, diffusion sampler, gas extraction line, elemental analyser (EA), total inorganic/organic carbon (TIC/TOC) analyzer and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS)) {{were used to determine}} the concentrations and isotopic compositions of ammonium, nitrate and dissolved carbon in leachate and leachate-polluted groundwater. Landfill leachate has high NH 4 + concentrations (average of 418 mg/L, 189 mg/L and 313 mg/L for leachate from leachate pumping station (LPS), leachate <b>pipes</b> (<b>LP)</b> and M 32, respectively). The shallow groundwater underneath and near the landfill border, which has relative high NH 4 + concentration up to 54 mg/L, was clearly impacted by landfill leachate. However in the deep aquifer the NH 4 + concentration are low mainly reflecting background concentrations. Based on these data, the deep aquifer has not been impacted by leachate. However, the enriched 13 CDIC values of groundwater (- 5. 0 ‰ VPDB and- 1. 9 ‰ VPDB for the shallow and deep aquifers respectively) in comparison with th...|$|R

40|$|Daylight {{has known}} to bring {{benefits}} for human, psychologically and physiologically. It also provides better indoor environment quality and thus increase {{the performance and}} productivity of office workers as stated by Paevere (2009). However, due to economic reasons, the current practice of using deep open plan building has cause a dent to having daylight in the interior spaces, which cause a dependency on artificial lighting. Hence, to provide daylight in deep interior, light distribution system is needed. Although so, according to Hansen (2003), most of the systems can only illuminate up to 8 m- 10 m depth. Therefore, light <b>pipe</b> (<b>LP)</b> plays an essential role where it can illuminate up to 20 m depth. LP’s efficiency depends on the 3 main components; collector, transporter and extractor. This research explores the effectiveness of horizontal LP through different type of transporter’s shapes which includes rectangular, triangular, square and semi-circle. Previous studies have shown differences of efficiency on the shaped while using vertical LP. This research’s analysis was done using a computer simulation, Integrated Environment Solution: Virtual Environment (IESVE), where DF of each shapes were compared to MS 1525 : 2007 benchmark. The viability of the software was also validated though an assessment with a physical scaled-model experiment that was conducted in an open car park in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia. The results from the simulation showed that semi-circle shaped transporter offered the same efficiency as rectangular shaped. These findings will promote the usage of LP in buildings as it decreases the costing for LP...|$|R

40|$|A direct {{numerical}} simulation framework is developed and validated for investigating a jet-flow configuration in which a short cylindrical nozzle and the acoustic near field {{are included in the}} simulation domain. The nozzle flow is modeled by a potential flow core and a developing turbulent wall boundary layer, which is numerically resolved. The setup allows to create well-controlled physical nozzle-exit flow conditions and to examine their impact on near-nozzle flow dynamics, jet-flow development, and the near-field sound. Turbulence at the nozzle inflow is generated by the synthetic-eddy method using flat-plate boundary-layer direct {{numerical simulation}} data and imposed softly in a sponge layer. The jet Mach number in the present investigation isMa 0. 9, the diameter-based jet Reynolds number is ReD 18; 100, and the maximum axial rms fluctuations attain 13 % at the nozzle exit. The accuracy of the numerical results is checked by varying grid resolution and computational domain size. The rapid flow development in the changeover region from wall turbulence to the turbulent free shear layer within about one nozzle diameter is documented in detail. Near-field sound pressure levels compare favorably with experimental reference data obtained at themuch higherReynolds number of 780, 000. This agreement is essentially attributed to a compensation of the effects of Reynolds number and turbulence level on the noise for which an empirical scaling is derived from published data. A brief comparison is alsomade to the jet sound field arising from a laminar nozzle-exit boundary layer.
