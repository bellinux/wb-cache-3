40|$|AbstractLane change {{model is}} a hot issue of {{microscopic}} traffic simulation and active safety. Among current studies, most of <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> models based on vehicle kinematics hypothesize that when the vehicle of adjacent <b>lane</b> <b>changes</b> <b>lane,</b> the following vehicle of target lane keeps uniform motion.

40|$|Abstract — Being able {{to predict}} the {{trajectory}} of a human driver’s potential <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> behavior in urban high way scenario is crucial for <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> risk assessment task. A good prediction of the driver’s <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> trajectory {{makes it possible to}} evaluate the risk and warn the driver beforehand. Rather than generating such a trajectory only using a math-ematical model, this paper develops a <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> trajectory prediction approach based on real human driving data stored in a database.

This thesis examines driver <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> behavior and evaluates the potential effectiveness of five warning onset rules for <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> or “side ” crash avoidance system (SCAS) technologies.

A 3 -year collaboration between Audi AG, Volkswagen Group of America Electronics Research Laboratory, and UC San Diego, the driver assistance portion of the UIA project focuses on two main use cases of vital importance in urban driving. The first, Driver Attention Guard, applies novel computer vision and machine learning research for accurately tracking the driver’s head position and rotation using an array of cameras.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in {{computational}} power and technology has enabled the automotive industry to do extensive research into autonomous vehicles. So called self- driven cars are seen everywhere, being developed from many companies like, Google, Mercedes Benz, Delphi, Tesla, Uber and many others. One of the challenging tasks for these vehicles is to track incremental motion in runtime and to analyze surroundings for accurate localization. This crucial information is used by many internal systems like active suspension control, autonomous steering, <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> <b>assist</b> and many such applications. All these systems rely on incremental motion to infer logical conclusions. Measurement of incremental change in pose or perspective, in other words, changes in motion, measured using visual only information is called Visual Odometry. This thesis proposes an approach to solve the Visual Odometry problem by using stereo-camera vision to incrementally estimate the pose of a vehicle by examining changes that motion induces on the background in the frame captured from stereo cameras. The approach in this thesis research uses a selective feature based motion tracking method to track {{the motion of the}} vehicle by analyzing the motion of its static surroundings and discarding the motion induced by dynamic background (outliers). The proposed approach considers that the surrounding may have moving objects like a truck, a car or a pedestrian body which has its own motion which may be different with respect to the vehicle. Use of stereo camera adds depth information which provides more crucial information necessary for detecting and rejecting outliers. Refining the interest point location using sinusoidal interpolation further increases the accuracy of the motion estimation results. The results show that by using a process that chooses features only on the static background and by tracking these features accurately, robust semantic information can be obtained...|$|E

40|$|By {{considering}} a <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> maneuver as primarily a longitudinal motion planning problem, {{this paper presents}} a <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> maneuver algorithm with a pragmatic approach to determine an inter-vehicle traffic gap and time instance to perform the maneuver.

3000|$|One of the {{implications}} of position preference parameter ([...] β) is that it provides incentive to make <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> even if the subject vehicle is travelling at the desired speed. In conventional models, a vehicle would require two slower leader vehicles to complete a <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> manoeuvre. A complete <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> manoeuvre may be defined as a vehicle makes a <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> for overtaking the leader vehicle and then return to the original lane. Thus, a complete <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> manoeuvre involves two <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> processes and at least one leader vehicle. But in conventional CA models, the <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> is initiated only when following slower leader vehicles. Because of this, two slower leader vehicles would be required to complete a <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> process. If <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> manoeuvres are not completed in simulation or if the vehicles could not return to their original lanes after overtaking, the vehicles would end up in positions where they are hardly observed in field [21]. For example, HMVs travel closer to shoulder lanes instead of median lane. Position preference parameter allows vehicles to drift towards their preferred position on road as observed in data. This improvement in the model significantly changes the outcome of simulation as shown in subsequent sections. Also, in CA models, <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> rules can be symmetric or asymmetric with respect to lanes or vehicle type [9]. In symmetric models, both lanes are treated equally or all vehicle types have equal probability of acquiring a position on cell lattice. Asymmetric models are applicable when left/right overtaking is banned or when certain vehicle types are not allowed to acquire a certain position on road. In our model, the position parameter ([...] β) allows to switch between symmetric and asymmetric rules. At β =  0, the model is perfectly symmetric, but as the value of ([...] β) increases it becomes more and more asymmetric.|$|R

40|$|<b>Lane</b> <b>changes</b> are an {{important}} aspect of freeway flow. Most <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> models are microscopic, describing whether individual vehicles/drives will <b>change</b> <b>lanes,</b> and hence are calibrated microscopically. Macroscopic validation often is restricted to the distribution of vehicles across lanes. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic analysis has been made of the number of <b>lane</b> <b>changes</b> as function of the operational characteristics of the origin and target lane. This paper fills that gap, by analyzing the number of <b>lane</b> <b>changes</b> as function of several incentives. Based on data availability, two “simple” sites are selected, i. e. {{as close as possible to}} a straight continuous freeway. Statistically, we find that on the selected sites, drivers <b>change</b> <b>lanes</b> on average once per two kilometer driven. Furthermore, analyzing the number of <b>lane</b> <b>changes</b> (per kilometer per hour) as function of the density in the origin lane and in the target lane, we find, as expected, this increases with the density in the origin lane for a fixed density in the target lane. Surprisingly, it also increases with the density in the target lane for a fixed density in the origin lane. The underlying mechanism is therefore different than gap acceptance theory. The analyses presented in this paper can be used to qualitatively verify (microscopic and macroscopic) <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> models, and to propose better <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> models.
