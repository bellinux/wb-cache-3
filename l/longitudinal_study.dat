5|$|In 1995 a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> was {{conducted}} at the University of Kansas, the first large-scale evaluation of Sesame Street's cognitive effects in over twenty years. Its findings supported those of previous studies: early viewing of educational children's television appeared to contribute to children's school readiness. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, {{but they did not}} watch enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching Sesame Street with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching Sesame Street daily did not increase children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E

40|$|Objective/Background: There is a {{widespread}} belief that moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) declines markedly in adolescence, particularly in girls. This belief has led to substantial research and policy effort aimed at reducing the perceived decline in MVPA during adolescence. The main aim of this review is to critically examine the belief that MVPA declines during adolescence. Methods: Review of evidence from studies with objective measures of physical activity, systematic reviews of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies,</b> insights from recent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies,</b> and evidence from the International Children's Accelerometry Database (ICAD). Results: Existing systematic review evidence, four recent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> from England, and ICAD data all failed to {{support the hypothesis that}} MVPA declines particularly markedly during adolescence, or that an MVPA decline begins at adolescence, or that declines in MVPA during adolescence are greater in girls than in boys. Systematic reviews, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies,</b> and ICAD data in fact suggest that MVPA begins to decline, and sedentary behavior begins to increase, from around the age of school entry. Recent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> also suggest that increasing sedentary behavior during adolescence displaces light-intensity physical activity. An emerging body of evidence from <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> that use trajectory analysis is providing important new insights into marked between-individual differences in the trajectories of MVPA across childhood and adolescence. Conclusion: Although gaps in the evidence remain, particularly from low- to middle-income countries, and additional <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> are required, this review suggests that efforts to promote and/or maintain MVPA should begin well before adolescence...|$|R

40|$|In a {{follow-up}} study, patients are monitored over time. <b>Longitudinal</b> and time-to-event <b>studies</b> {{are the two}} most important types of {{a follow-up}} study. In this paper, the focus is on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> with a continuous response where patients are examined at several time points. While <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> provide a powerful tool for the evaluation of a treatment effect over time, a major problem is missing data caused, for example, by patients who drop out from the <b>study.</b> Many <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> in rheumatology use inappropriate statistical methodology because either they do not address correctly the correlated nature of the repeated measurements, or they treat the problem of missing data incorrectly. We will illustrate that there are interpretational and computational issues with the "classical" approaches.
