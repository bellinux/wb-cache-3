40|$|Does an entrepreneur-friendly {{bankruptcy}} law encourage more entrepreneurship development at a societal level? How does {{bankruptcy law}} affect entrepreneurship development around the world? Drawing {{on a real}} options perspective, we argue that if bankrupt entrepreneurs are excessively punished for failure, they may pass potentially high-return but inherently high-risk opportunities. Amassing a longitudinal, cross-country data base from 35 countries spanning ten years, we find that a lenient, entrepreneur-friendly bankruptcy law encourages entrepreneurs to take risks and thus let entrepreneurship prosper. Components of an entrepreneur-friendly bankruptcy law are: (1) {{the availability of a}} reorganization bankruptcy option, (2) the time spent on bankruptcy procedure, (3) the cost of bankruptcy procedure, (4) the opportunity to have a fresh start in <b>liquidation</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> (5) the opportunity to have an automatic stay of assets, (6) the opportunity for managers to remain on the job after filing for bankruptcy, and (7) the protection of creditors at the time of bankruptcy. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{bankruptcy}} laws {{as a case}} {{of formal}} institutions, we show how formal institutions impact entrepreneurship development. Historically, bankruptcy laws usually have been harsh.

Since bankruptcy laws are not uniform around the world, {{it is important to}} understand how they differ in their friendliness to entrepreneurs. This article focuses on six dimensions of entrepreneur-friendliness: (1) the availability of a reorganization bankruptcy option, (2) the time spent on bankruptcy procedures, (3) the cost of bankruptcy procedures, (4) the opportunity to have a fresh start in <b>liquidation</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> (5) the opportunity to have an automatic stay of assets during reorganization bankruptcy, and (6) the opportunity for entrepreneurs and managers to remain on the job after filing for bankruptcy.

40|$|For many {{consecutive}} years, one of {{the main}} violations on the results of external quality auditing control is the improper validation of the going concern.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{experienced by}} firms and institutions during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) have considerably {{increased the number}} of corporate collapses and the analysis of the determinants of financial distress has attracted growing attention by researchers and practitioners. Prior to a corporate failure, the firm’s financial status is frequently in distress. Consequently, finding a method to predict corporate financial distress few step early is clearly a matter of considerable interest to investors, creditors, auditors and other stakeholders. The aim of the work is to propose a competing risk approach to analyse the determinants of the probability of different exit forms and investigate the differences in the factors driving firms to exit the market. The theoretical intuition has been supported by some empirical finding. In particular referring to a sample of Italian building firms, we consider different mutually exclusive business exit status i. e <b>liquidation,</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> and a third residual category that include firms that exit the market for any other reasons. The effect of microeconomic indicators and company-specific variables on these three states are examined. To this end, we develop a competing risk hazard model in order to identify the factors leading firms to exit the market and compare the predictive performance over single risk approach by means of same accuracy measure...|$|E
