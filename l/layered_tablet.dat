The three-layer tablets consist of non-swellable, compritol-based middle layers containing the drug to which hydrophilic top and bottom barrier layers were applied. A 23 full-factorial design was employed for optimization and to explore the effect of different variables on the release rate of the drug from the three-layer tablets. The optimized levels of each independent variable were based on the criterion of desirability. The calculated values of f 1 and f 2 were 4. 131 and 79. 356, respectively; indicating that the release profile of the optimized PEO <b>layered</b> <b>tablet</b> formulation is comparable to that of the target release model.

We therefore sought to develop a monolayer tablet with a similar dissolution profile to the commercial alfuzosin sustained-release triple <b>layered</b> <b>tablet</b> (Xatral XL®). We prepared four different mono-layered alfuzosin tablets with different concentrations of hydroxypropyl methycellulose and PVP K- 90. Fomulation III with alfu-zosion / mg-stearate / HPMC / PVP K- 90 (10 / 5 / 110 / 95 mg/tab) has a similar dissolution rate to Xatral XL®, with a similarity factor score of 81. 4. However, the swelling and erosion rates of the two formulations were different, and NIR analysis showed differences in the mechanisms of drug release.

Here we successfully test the proposed new nacre TT thermometer on two Jurassic Pinna shells. The increase of TT with T is consistent with greater aragonite growth rate at higher T, and with greater metabolic rate at higher T.

Additionally, solid dispersions of Felodipine were developed aiming to the dissolution enhancement of the drug substance {{as it was a}} requirement in order to achieve bimodal release profile. The characterization of the solid dispersion systems between Felodipine and Polyvilylpyrrolidone showed that these are amorphous nanodispersions with enhanced dissolution characteristics. The optimal dispersion was based on the development of drug-polymer interactions via the creation of hydrogen bonds. In parallel, the dissolution enhancement was found to be highly correlated to the intense of the hydrogen bond. Several methods like electronic microscopy (SEM,TEM), spectroscopy (UVvis, 1 H-NMR, FT-IR, micro Raman), Thermal analysis (DSC) and XRD, were used for the characterization of the dispersion systems. Multi matrix capsules were used as vehicles for the drug delivery systems with bimodal release kinetics (quick-slow-quick). Matrices with different release characteristics (immediate release, controlled release & delay release) were developed. The immediate release matrices were composed by the nanodispersion systems and super disintegrants. The release profile of these matrices met the requirements of immediate release formulations. The development of the controlled release matrices was based on the study of several cellulose derivatives and the application of appropriate formulations. The investigation of the release mechanism showed that it corresponded to erosion and bulk erosion resulting to a zero order kinetic. The delayed release matrices were developed via the technique of double <b>layered</b> <b>tablets.</b> They were composed by an active core and an inactive coating layer composed by miscible polymer blends of Hydroxypropymethylcellulose and Polyvinylpyrrolidone. The rapture time of the behavior of the coating layer was predictable and adjusted the release of the drug substance from the active core. Additionally, the polymeric coating layer showed enhanced mucoadhesive characteristics.

40|$|The {{number of}} fungi causing {{systemic}} disease is growing {{and the number of}} systemic diseases caused by fungi is increasing. The currently available antifungal agents for the treatment of systemic mycoses include polyene antibiotics (Amphotericin B), fluoropyrimidine (Flu cytosine), and Nystatin andazole group of drugs (Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, and Itraconazole). Novel drug delivery systems for antifungal therapy, based on the type of formulation are classified as Liposomes Nanocochleates, Nanospheres, Carbon Nanotubes, Doubled <b>layered</b> Mucoadhesive <b>Tablets,</b> Mucoadhesive Thermo Sensitive Pronged release gels, and Parenteral Micro emulsions. Amphotericin B is the only fungicidal agent available and is the â€˜goldstandardâ€™ for the treatment of most of the systemic mycoses. The three currently available lipid formulations are Amphotericin B Lipid Complex (ABLC), Amphotericin B Colloidal Dispersion (ABCD) and Liposomal Amphotericin B (Lâ€AmB). Nystatin and ketoconazole are also commercially available as liposomes. Novel Drug delivery systems for antifungal therapy, aiming at reducing the side effects and maximizing the antifungal activity have added a new dimension to the treatment of fungal infections. Without fungi we would not have bread, beer, wine or antibiotics, but more importantly without the nutrient recycling and plant nutrition provided by fungi - we probably could not survive at all...|$|R

40|$|Extended release {{formulation}} of alfuzosin, an -antagonist used for prostatic hypertrophy, {{is available in}} market. It is convenient for older patients to take only one tablet a day. Marketed alfuzosin formulation is three <b>layered</b> geomatrix <b>tablet</b> that requires special facilities, high cost, more time and complex operation than normal direct compression formulation. Therefore, a less complicated formulation is desired which can be prepared by conventional tools. The aim {{of the study was}} the development and in vitro evaluation of a controlled release dosage form of a freely soluble weakly basic drug (alfuzosin hydrochloride). Binary mixer of one hydrophilic polymer (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) and one hydrophobic polymer (ethyl cellulose) was used in tablets prepared by direct compression, 32 factorial design was chosen and the amount of two polymers were taken as independent variables. The percent drug released at 1, 6, 12, and 20 h were selected as response. The main effect and interaction terms were quantitatively evaluated using mathematical model. Dissolution data were fitted to zero order, first order, and Higuchi’s release kinetics to evaluate kinetic data. According to Korsmeyer's equation drug release followed both diffusion and erosion mechanism in all cases. Drug release was different from three fillers (microcrystalline cellulose, lactose and dibasic calcium phosphate) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to develop bilayer tablets of atorvastatin and atenolol that are characterized by initial fast-release of atorvastatin in the stomach and comply with the release requirements of sustained-release of atenolol. An amorphous, solvent evaporation inclusion complex of atorvastatin with β-cyclodextrin, present in 1 [*]:[*] 3 (drug/cyclodextrin) molar ratio, was employed in the fast-release layer to enhance the dissolution of atorvastatin. Xanthan gum and guar gum were integrated in the sustained-release <b>layer.</b> Bilayer <b>tablets</b> composed of sustained-release layer (10 % w/w of xanthan gum and guar gum) and fast-release layer [1 [*]:[*] 3 (drug/cyclodextrin) ] showed the desired release profile. The atorvastatin contained in the fast-release layer showed an initial fast-release of more than 60 % of its drug content within 2 [*]h, followed by sustained release of the atenolol for a period of 12 [*]h. The pharmacokinetic study illustrated that the fast absorption and increased oral bioavailability of atorvastatin as well as therapeutic concentration of atenolol in blood were made available through adoption of formulation strategy of bilayer tablets. It can be concluded that the bilayer tablets of atorvastatin and atenolol can be successfully employed for the treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia together through oral administration of single tablet...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} research, an attempt {{has been made}} to {{formulate}} sustained release matrix tablet of nicorandil, a novel potassium channel opener used in cardiovascular disease. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation method and studied the effect of matrix former xanthan gum and guar gum separately. Tablets were evaluated for uniformity of weight, drug content, friability, hardness, thickness, in vitro dissolution and swelling study. All the formulation showed compliance with pharmacopoeial standard. As the time increases, the swelling index was increased; later on it decreases gradually due to dissolution of outermost –gelled <b>layer</b> of <b>tablet</b> into dissolution medium. Comparison between xanthan gum and guar gum, it has been observed that swelling index of guar gum was significantly more compared to xanthan gum. The dissolution result shows that an increased amount of polymer resulted in retarded drug release. The maximum drug release was found to be 90 % over a period of 12 hours in guar gum based tablets (F 4). Similarly maximum drug release was found to be 96 % over a period of 12 hours in Xanthan gum based tablets (F 1). This indicates that the minimum quantity of guar gum and Xanthan gum that is drug to gum ratio of 1 : 1 is required to prepare the sustain release matrix tablets of nicorandil...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study mucoadhesive bilayer buccal tablets of propranolol hydrochloride using the bioadhesive polymers sodium alginate (Na-alginate) and Carbopol 934 P (CP) along with ethyl cellulose as an impermeable backing <b>layer.</b> The <b>tablets</b> were evaluated for weight variation, thickness, hardness, friability, surface pH, mucoadhesive strength, swelling index, in vitro drug release, ex vivo drug permeation, ex vivo mucoadhesion, and in vivo pharmacodynamics in rabbits. Tablets containing Na-alginate and CP in the ratio of 5 ∶ 1 (F 2) had the maximum percentage of in vitro drug release without disinte-gration in 12 hours. The swelling index was proportional to Na-alginate content and inversely proportional to CP content. The surface pH of all tablets was found to be satis-factory (7. 0 ± 1. 5), close to neutral pH; hence, buccal cavity irritation should not occur with these tablets. The mechanism of drug release was found to be non-Fickian diffusion and followed zero-order kinetics. The formulation F 4 was optimized based on good biodhesive strength (28. 9 ± 0. 99 g) and sustained in vitro drug permeation (68. 65 %± 3. 69 % for 12 hours). The behavior of formulation F 4 was examined in human saliva, and both the drug and the buccal tablet were found to be stable. The formulation F 4 was applied to rabbit oral mucosa for in vivo studies. The formulation inhibited isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. The studies conducted in rabbits confirmed the sustained release as compared with intravenous administration...|$|R
