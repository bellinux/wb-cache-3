40|$|A {{method has}} been devised for the rapid {{identification}} of nonsense mutations (UAG, UAA, UGA codons) in Salmonella. The mutations {{to be tested}} are reverted, and the revertants are replica-printed onto lactose plates spread with lawns of tester strains. These tester strains contain F′ lac episomes with nonsense mutations in the episomal Z gene. The revertants are infected with the episome from the tester strain lawn. Because S. typhimurium is unable to ferment <b>lactose,</b> <b>only</b> those revertants which have nonsense suppressors are able to grow on lactose.

40|$|A mutant of Escherichia coli is {{described}} that grew on <b>lactose</b> <b>only</b> {{in the presence}} of isopropylthiogalactoside. This cell contained a defect in the lacY gene that resulted in the formation of a transport system with a poor affinity for lactose. The inability to grow on lactose alone was due to the failure of induction by this disaccharide. This failure of inducation was presumably due to a defect in lactose accumulation which resulted in significant reduction in the formation of allo-lactose, the true inducer of lac operon. These results are consistent with the view that the capacity to accumulate lactose plays an important physiological role in the induction of the enzymes necessary for its utilization...|$|E

In addition, re-deposition of a co-adhering and non-co-adhering streptococcal strain to brushed pellicles was studied. First, actinomyces {{were allowed to}} adhere to a pellicle in a flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 degreesC. Pellicles with adhering bacterial pairs were brushed {{and the number of}} bacteria remaining determined. Whereas sonic brushing removed nearly all adhering bacteria, greater numbers of larger aggregates of the co-adhering pair, involving Streptococcus oralis J 22, were left behind after hand and electric brushing than of the non-co-adhering pair with Streptococcus sanguis PK 1889. Re-deposition of streptococci to electrically and sonically brushed pellicles, however, was two-fold higher for the co-adhering pair than for the non-co-adhering pair. This demonstrates a role for co-adhesion in de novo plaque formation. Removal by the three different modes of brushing was not affected by the presence of fluoride, indicating that fluoride is not able to disrupt calcium bridges between co-adhering pairs.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of glycoconjugate receptors on sialidase-treated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) by the Gal/GalNAc-reactive fimbrial lectin of Actinomyces viscosus T 14 V {{has previously been}} shown to initiate lactose-inhibitable phagocytosis and subsequent killing of the bacteria. Although a mutant lacking fimbriae, A. viscosus 147, was not destroyed by this mechanism, the present studies demonstrate that the deposition of C 3 fragments on this bacterium by anti-A. viscosus 147 immunoglobulin M (IgM) prior to incubation with either untreated or sialidase-treated PMNs correlated with a reduction in viability of approximately 2 log 10. This bactericidal activity was unaffected by lactose. A similar decrease in viability was observed following the addition of untreated PMNs to A. viscosus T 14 V preincubated with anti-A. viscosus 147 IgM and complement, conditions favorable for C 3 - but not lectin-mediated bactericidal activity. Neither IgM nor complement alone was opsonic for either strain, and individually they did not alter killing of A. viscosus T 14 V by sialidase-treated PMNs or inhibition of this bactericidal activity by lactose. The number of viable A. viscosus T 14 V cells was decreased by approximately 3. 5 log 10 when the bacteria were incubated with IgM and complement prior to the addition of sialidase-treated PMNs, and <b>lactose</b> <b>only</b> partially inhibited this response.

40|$|The lactose {{utilization}} {{genes of}} Staphylococcus xylosus have been isolated and characterized. The system {{is comprised of}} two structural genes, lacP and lacH, encoding the lactose permease and the β-galactosidase proteins, respectively, and a regulatory gene, lacR, coding for an activator of the AraC/XylS family. The lactose utilization genes are divergently arranged, the lacPH genes being opposite to lacR. The lacPH genes are cotranscribed from one promoter in front of lacP, whereas lacR is transcribed from two promoters of different strengths. Lactose transport as well as β-galactosidase activity are inducible {{by the addition of}} lactose to the growth medium. Primer extension experiments demonstrated that regulation is achieved at the level of lacPH transcription initiation. Inducibility and efficient lacPH transcription are dependent on a functional lacR gene. Inactivation of lacR resulted in low and constitutive lacPH expression. Expression of lacR itself is practically constitutive, since transcription initiated at the major lacR promoter does not respond to the availability of <b>lactose.</b> <b>Only</b> the minor lacR promoter is lactose inducible. Apart from lactose-specific, LacR-dependent control, the lacPH promoter is also subject to carbon catabolite repression mediated by the catabolite control protein CcpA. When glucose is present in the growth medium, lacPH transcription initiation is reduced. Upon ccpA inactivation, repression at the lacPH promoter is relieved. Despite this loss of transcriptional regulation in the ccpA mutant strain, β-galactosidase activity is still reduced by glucose, suggesting another level of control...|$|E

40|$|Goodman, R. E. (University of California, Los Angeles), and M. J. Pickett. Delayed lactose {{fermentation}} by Enterobacteriaceae. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 318 – 327. 1966. —When 171 Citrobacter freundii strains and 14 Paracolobactrum arizonae strains examined, 51 of the C. freundii strains and 13 of the P. arizonae strains {{were found}} to be delayed or negative lactose fermenters. Of the slow fermenters, 65 % yielded rapidly fermenting mutants in cultures undergoing delayed fermentation. Lactose fermentation could generally be hastened by increasing lactose concentrations. Many organisms which fermented lactose slowly grew readily on a medium containing lactose as the sole carbon source. Regardless of their ability to ferment lactose, all strains of C. freundii and P. arizonae investigated could be shown to possess β-galactosidase. Delayed fermenters failed to take up lactose from the culture medium, whereas prompt fermenters did so readily. The β-galactosidases of 12 strains of enteric bacteria were studied in crude cell extracts with respect to specific activity, stability, and activity at varying substrate (o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) concentrations, at varying pH, and in the presence of sodium, potassium, and magnesium. The widely varying specific activities and the approximate similarity of the Michaelis constants (about 2 × 10 − 4 m) suggested that the strains investigated produced differing amounts of β-galactosidase. Moreover, qualitative differences in the enzymes provided evidence that these strains synthesized different molecular forms of β-galactosidase. The results suggested that organisms which ferment <b>lactose</b> <b>only</b> after a prolonged delay do so because they possess multiple defects in their lactose-metabolizing machinery...|$|E
40|$|The role of stochasticity on gene {{expression}} is widely discussed. Both potential {{advantages and disadvantages}} have been revealed. In some systems, noise in {{gene expression}} has been quantified, in among others the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Whether stochastic gene expression in this system is detrimental or beneficial for the cells is, however, still unclear. We {{are interested in the}} effects of stochasticity from an evolutionary point of view. We study this question in the lac operon, taking a computational approach: using a detailed, quantitative, spatial model, we evolve through a mutation–selection process the shape of the promoter function and therewith the effective amount of stochasticity. We find that noise values for lactose, the natural inducer, are much lower than for artificial, nonmetabolizable inducers, because these artificial inducers experience a stronger positive feedback. In the evolved promoter functions, noise due to stochasticity in gene expression, when induced by <b>lactose,</b> <b>only</b> plays a very minor role in short-term physiological adaptation, because other sources of population heterogeneity dominate. Finally, promoter functions evolved in the stochastic model evolve to higher repressed transcription rates than those evolved in a deterministic version of the model. This causes these promoter functions to experience less stochasticity in gene expression. We show that a high repression rate and hence high stochasticity increases the delay in lactose uptake in a variable environment. We conclude that the lac operon evolved such that the impact of stochastic gene expression is minor in its natural environment, but happens to respond with much stronger stochasticity when confronted with artificial inducers.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study how organisms adapt their {{metabolism}} to a changing environment. Metabolic adaptation occurs at different timescales. Organisms adapt their metabolism via metabolic regulation, which {{happens in the}} order of minutes to hours and via evolution, which takes many generations. Here we study the interplay between these timescales by studying the evolution of metabolic adaptation. In chapter 2, we develop an individual-oriented, spatial model of cells that evolve their lac operon promoter function. In this way we study what kind of promoter function evolves. The promoter function that evolves in the simulations is surprisingly similar to the experimentally observed promoter function. Furthermore we show that, in contrast to the current belief, the lac operon is not a bistable switch when induced by the natural inducer <b>lactose.</b> <b>Only</b> when induced by artificial inducers, the lac operon behaves bistably. We modified this model to incorporate the effect of stochasticity in gene expression. In this way we study the effect of stochasticity by comparing the results between the deterministic and stochastic model. We find that in our model cells avoid stochastic gene expression by evolving to larger repressed transcription rates and therefore we conclude that stochasticity in the lac operon is detrimental for the cells. In chapter 4 we study the mutational dynamics of massive gene loss. We find that the pattern of gene loss in S. cerevisiae cannot be explained by random single gene loss. If we however assume that large base pair deletions cause simultaneous deletion of neighboring genes, we can explain the pattern of gene loss in S. cerevisiae satisfactorily. This model predicts that genes that have smaller intergenic regions in a yeast species that did not underwent WGD {{are more likely to be}} both deleted in S. cerevisiae and this is exactly what we find in the data. In chapter 5 we study the effect of a WGD on the metabolic network of S. cerevisiae using metabolic modeling. We find that we can satisfactorily predict which genes are retained in duplicate after WGD. Furthermore, we predict that both transporter genes and genes functioning in glycolysis are more likely to be retained in duplicate after WGD, which we also found to be true in S. cerevisiae. Finally we show that a WGD can lead to a fitness increase in environments to which the cells are not yet perfectly adapted. Concluding, we have shown that combining detailed, quantitative modeling with an evolutionary, individual based approach is a promising way to study the evolution of biological systems. This approach has not only given us insight how, from an evolutionary point of view, such systems came about, but also how such systems work. Ignoring the evolutionary aspects of biological systems has, in the case of the lac operon, led to a wrong understanding of the dynamics of the system. Furthermore we have shown that even for such a large scale system as the metabolic network of S. cerevisiae, this approach leads to accurate predictions of the evolutionary outcome...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the utility of inverse gas chromatography (IGC) in discriminating the differences in surface energy between salmeterol xinafoate (SX) powders prepared by conventional sequential batch crystallization and micronization and by supercritical fluid crystallization. In the present study, solubility parameters derived from IGC analysis at infinite dilution (zero coverage) were further utilized to evaluate the influence of solid-solid interactions on the in vitro aerosol performance of these SX samples, {{with or without the}} inclusion of a lactose carrier. To this end, the strength of cohesive SX-SX interactions and that of adhesive SX-lactose interactions were computed for the samples from the corresponding solubility parameters, and their fine particle fractions determined using a multi-stage liquid impinger. It was found that the aerosol performance of SX could be substantially improved by the addition of <b>lactose</b> carrier <b>only</b> if the adhesive SX-lactose interactions were stronger than the cohesive SX-SX interactions. The difference in strength between these two forms of interactions also displayed a significant correlation with the increase in fine particle fraction after the addition of lactose carrier. These results suggest that IGC-based interparticulate interaction measurements may serve as a useful means for predicting the aerosol performance of dry powder inhalation formulations.

40|$|Cells of Escherichia coli ML 308 - 225, {{harvested}} from the exponential phase, were heated in 50 mM potassium phosphate, {{and the loss}} in viability and inability to transport lactose, proline, and alpha-methylglucoside was compared. After cells were heated at 48 degrees C for 15 min, there was a 16 % loss in viability and a similarly small reduction in the steady-state accumulation of lactose at 25 degrees C. The initial rates of lactose and proline transport were severely inhibited by heating at either 48 or 50 degrees C, but substantial recovery occurred within 5 to 7 min at 25 degrees C. Heating at 50 degrees C for 15 min caused an 86 % loss in viability, but only a 53 % decrease in the steady-state accumulation of <b>lactose</b> and <b>only</b> a 24 % reduction in the initial rate of alpha-methylglucoside uptake. Twice as much alpha-methylglucoside was accumulated at 50 degrees C as at 25 degrees C. Although alpha-methylglucoside phosphate leaked from the cells at 50 degrees C, the concentration retained within the cells was about 500 times that externally, when only about 14 % of the cells were viable. Overall, {{these results indicate that}} cells made nonviable by heating at 50 degrees C still have significant membrane integrity...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{has been}} applied as probiotic mainly to prevent pathogens. This group of bacteria {{can be found in}} marine fish products including fermented, shrimp product, cincaluk. The objective of this research was to isolate LAB from cincaluk, and examined the activity against pathogen V. alginolyticus and A. hydrophila. The research was conducted on March-Juny, total of 12 isolates were obtained from cincaluk survey method. The result of research showed that all isolates round, creamy white, smooth-edged, raised surface, and the size is 1. 0 to 3. 0 mm. The physiological and biochemical test showed that get all isolates had a Gram-positive, catalase positive and are indole negative, 10 isolates were motile, as many as five isolates have citric positive, 10 isolates is Methyl Red (+), all isolates ferment sucrose and <b>lactose,</b> while <b>only</b> 9 isolates ferment glucose, and as much as 6 isolates that produce sulfide. All isolates were found to have inhibitory effects against bacteria V. alginolyticus and A. hydrophila. The highest antimicrobial activity is indicated by B isolates with an average diameter of 12. 3 mm and inhibition zone antivibrio activity of 6. 3 units. Isolates B with an average diameter of inhibition zone of 9. 7 mm and 3. 7 units antiaeromonas activity...|$|R
