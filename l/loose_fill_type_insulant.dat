Numerical models simulating a 20 m high 35 degrees <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slope were set up. With the use of an undrained strain-softening soil model, the behaviour of a <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slope reinforced with soil nails subjected to rainfall infiltration was studied. Results indicated that soil nails together with a proper facing structure may reduce the deformation of a <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slope caused by rainfall infiltration and hence maintain the stability of the slope. Tensile forces in the soil nails were mobilised through the effective connections between the facing structure and the nail heads when a potential slide was being initiated. Through this mechanism, the development of a flow slide at shallow depths could be avoided by the pull out resistance between the soil and the nails at deeper locations of the slope. Results also showed that, if the soil nails were not connected to a facing structure or nail heads at the slope surface, a global failure mechanism involving the development of a flow slide could be observed, which was similar to that of a <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slope without soil nails.

40|$|Soil nailing is {{commonly}} used for stabilizing cut slopes and retaining structures. The technique is, however, seldom used in stabilizing old <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes that were not constructed to the current standards. There is a concern that soil-nailed <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes may not render safety during heavy rainstorms. Little work {{has been carried out}} to investigate the behavior of soil-nailed <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes. This paper presents a comprehensive field test on a <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slope that was constructed by end tipping without any compaction - in the same way old fill slopes were formed. The slope was 4. 75 m high, 9 m wide, and 33 deg to the horizontal. Two rows of five grouted nails were installed at a grid of 1. 5 m × 1. 5 m at an inclination of 20 deg from the horizontal. A surface grillage was used to connect the six nails {{in the middle of the}} grid. Performance of the nailed slope was monitored with various instruments for about six months until the slope was tested to fail by surcharging and wetting. The overall results show that soil nailing with a surface grillage is a potentially effective way to enhance the stability of old fill slopes. © 2008 ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{technique}} of soil nailing is seldom used in stabilizing <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes {{because there is}} a lack of understanding of the interaction behaviour of nails in <b>loose</b> <b>fills.</b> A large-scale laboratory apparatus has been built to study the soil-nail interaction in <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> materials. Pullout tests were performed in a displacement-rate-controlled manner on steel bars embedded in loose, completely decomposed granitic soils. The load-displacement curves have distinct peak values followed by a sharp decrease in the pullout force. The test results also show that the normal stress acting on the nail changes because of the volume-change tendency and arching effect of the soil being sheared around the nail. The post-peak decrease in the pullout force is mainly due to the reduction in the normal stress caused by the arching effect of soil around the nail. The conventional method of analysis tends to give a low interface friction angle and high interface adhesion. The correct interface parameters can be determined by taking the changes in the normal stress acting on the nail into account. © 2004 NRC Canada. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|A plane-strain {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to mimic a nailed <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slope under surcharge loading. The model {{has been used to}} back-analyse a field test that was conducted to examine the behaviour of soil nails in <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes under surcharge loading. Incremental elasto-plastic analyses coupled with pore water diffusion have been performed to study the internal deformation, water content redistribution in the soil, and the performance of the soil nails during and after the application of surcharge loading. The model parameters describing the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the nailed slope were obtained from field or laboratory tests. Different modelling techniques and boundary conditions for mimicking soil-nail interaction in <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> material have been examined. Comparisons between numerical predictions and field measurements demonstrate that a new interfacial model, denoted as the embedded bond-slip interface model, is more suitable for mimicking the interfacial behaviour. Despite the simplicity of the {{numerical model}}, the predicted responses are in close agreement with the field test results, in particular the mobilisation and distribution of nail forces in response to surcharge loading. Both the numerical and the field test results suggest that soil nails are capable of increasing the overall stability of a <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slope for the loading conditions considered in this study. The increase in confining stress along the soil nails near the surcharge area is central to the overall stabilising mechanism. On the contrary, the nail forces mobilised near the nail heads are much smaller, indicating that the beneficial effect of having a structural grillage system at the slope face is limited for the range of surcharge pressures considered in this study. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this research are to investigate the triggering and failure mechanisms of static liquefaction in <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes and to study role of soil nails during slope liquefaction. This research consists of three major components, namely centrifuge modeling of static liquefaction of <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes using Leighton Buzzard (LB) sand, investigation of role of soil nails during liquefaction of <b>loose</b> sand <b>fill</b> slopes in dynamic centrifuge tests and evaluation of liquefaction potential of <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes using completely decomposed granite (CDG) in both static and dynamic centrifuge tests. In addition, preliminary numerical analyses are carried out {{to assist in the}} explanation of results obtained from the centrifuge model tests. Model slopes were formed by compacting LB sand with water content of 5 % and CDG with water content of 11 % to an initial relative compaction ranging from 65 % to 70 %. In static centrifuge tests, ground water was raised or rainfall infiltration was simulated in initially unsaturated slopes. In dynamic centrifuge tests, sand slopes were shaken after slopes had been subjected to limited shallow seepage failure and was submerged under water and CDG slopes were saturated with viscous fluid and shaken at high g. A sudden and brittle liquefied rapid flow failure was observed and recorded in a 24 ° <b>loose</b> sand <b>fill</b> slope with a prototype height of 12. 9 m. This type of failure was only induced by raising the ground water table but was not triggered by rainfall infiltration. During the rapid liquefied flowslide, significant excess positive pore water pressures were measured. It was illustrated that the rapid flowslide was caused by static liquefaction of the loose sand resulting from the strain-softening of the sand under 'undrained' conditions. However, the strain-softening behaviour of loose materials was only a necessary but not sufficient condition to induce static liquefaction failure. A trigger was needed. Based on the numerical analysis, the observed fluidised rapid flowslide was triggered by the sliding of the edge of the crest, which had been induced by a seepage flow failure under 'drained' condition. During the rise of ground water, soil nails helped to reduce wetting-induced volume change in <b>loose</b> sand <b>fill</b> slopes. Shallow seepage failure was not prevented by soil nails. The 15 ° nailed slope with height of 5. 9 m was subjected to a shaking with a peak acceleration of 0. 16 g, which was 8. 8 times that applied to the unreinforced slope. A relatively shallower failure was observed in the nailed slope with the measured maximum excess pore pressure reduced by 17. 5 %, the settlement and the lateral movement of sand mass reduced by 62 % and 41 %, respectively. Soil nails were illustrated and verified to reduce volume contraction of the slope and to resist soil deformation before slope liquefaction. However, with shaking as a trigger, liquefied flowslide cannot be prevented by soil nails. Excessive settlements were measured at the 29 °, 16 m high <b>loose</b> CDG <b>fill</b> slopes during rise of ground water. Surface erosion was induced by heavy rainfall. No flowslide and liquefied flowslide was triggered under both static and dynamic conditions since CDG had a much lower liquefaction potential as compared with that of LB sand. This is consistent with the findings from a 33 °, 4. 5 m high <b>loose</b> CDG <b>fill</b> slope subjected to rise of ground water table and rainfall infiltration in the field. It is very unlikely, if not possible to induce liquefied flowslide in <b>loose</b> CDG <b>fill</b> slope but shallow non-liquefied flowslide is possible...|$|R

The deformation, imposed to the extrudate, was 1 %, guaranteeing the permanency in the domain of the linear viscoelasticity. The models were fitted to experimental data (stress x time) by nonlinear regression. The generalized Maxwell model with three units in parallel and the Burgers model represented the relaxation curves of stress satisfactorily. The viscoelastic properties varied in a way that they were less dependent on the initial stress levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{prescriptive}} re-compaction {{method has}} been used as a common technique for upgrading <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes in Hong Kong. Due to the heavy plants required for the re-compaction work, the method may be extremely difficult and dangerous to be applied in many congested areas. To explore the possibility of using soil nails to tackle with the potential problem of liquefaction of <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes, experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out. The experimental work aims at studying the liquefaction behaviour of loosely compacted decomposed granites, which have been commonly used as a filling material. Undrained triaxial tests have been conducted on two decomposed granites with similar fines content. The use of fines content as a quantifier of the liquefaction potential, which is defined as the percentage drop of deviator stress during undrained strain softening, has been examined. The influence of moisture content at preparation on the liquefaction potential of decomposed granites has also been studied. In the numerical analyses, a 20 m high 35 ° <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slope was set up using a finite difference code. By employing a "pseudo" static liquefaction soil constitutive model, the behaviour of <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes with and without soil nails subjected to the effect of surface infiltration has been investigated under different assumed conditions. Reverse behaviour reported in silty sand is observed in decomposed granites which is characterised by an increase of liquefaction resistance as the confining pressure is increased. Moreover, liquefaction potential of a soil specimen is dependent on the moisture content at preparation. When a specimen is prepared at moisture contents drier than the optimum, a lower liquefaction potential would result as compared to specimens prepared at optimum moisture content. Fines content alone is found not to be a good measure for quantifying the liquefaction potential of soils. An empirical method to estimate the liquefaction potential is proposed. The method is based on the observation of the existence of an instability line in the p'-q-e space and it is evaluated by the experimental results. Based on the numerical analyses, soil nails may enhance the stability of <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes if a proper structural facing is provided. The whole structural system acts like an earth retaining structure anchored with soil nails. When the potential sliding mass is initiated due to static liquefaction, the facing at the slope surface limits the movement of the flow slide. As the failing mass pushes the facing away from the slope, axial force and bending moment in the facing are induced. At the same time, tensile forces in the soil nails are also mobilised by the outward movement of the facing. Through this mechanism, the development of a flow slide at shallow depth can be avoided by transferring the loading generated from the potential sliding mass to the pull out resistance of the soil nails at deeper locations of the slope...|$|R

The effect of the rise of ground water level was simulated by increasing the mass density of pore water in the soil elements between the initial and targeted ground water levels.

In order to investigate the seismic stability and potential flow liquefaction of <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> slopes, dynamic centrifuge tests in uni-axial and bi-axial directions were performed on saturated model embankments made of loose completely decomposed granite (CDG). Three windowed sinusoidal waves with peak shaking amplitudes ranging from 0. 08 g to 0. 3 g (prototype scale) were adopted. During the strong uni-axial shaking of 0. 3 g, the measured maximum excess pore pressure ratios ranged from 0. 70 to 0. 85 and a relatively small crest settlement of 5. 8 mm (0. 22 m prototype) was measured. No soil liquefaction or flow slides were observed. Comparing the results between the strong uni-axial and bi-axial shaking, the maximum pore pressure ratios measured from the bi-axial test varied from 0. 75 to 0. 87, which were marginally larger than those obtained from the uni-axial test. Although the measured crest settlement during the bi-axial shaking was about 27 % larger than that of the uni-axial test, soil liquefaction and flow slide did not occur. These test results suggest that <b>loose</b> CDG <b>fill</b> slopes are likely to be stable under the proposed design PGA ranging from 0. 08 to 0. 11 g in Hong Kong. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
