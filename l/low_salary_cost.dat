The impacts of individual factors, such as <b>low</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cost</b> and low land price, on the FDI are decreasing gradually. The convergent power of colony greatly surpasses the decentralized power of <b>low</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cost</b> and land price. The Regional Industry colony superiority attracts FDI greatly and the FDI colony trend is constantly enhanced. In this paper the author proposed that the Regional Industry colony superiority is the main element to attract FDI. And the author has performed related prove by demonstration research. So the traditional policies on inviting capital should be adjusted and the government must strive on creating colony competitive advantages. That is {{an important}} choice to expand FDI...|$|E

The shorter operation times may reflect a tighter planning with fewer delays, which is possible in an ambulatory regime, thus resulting in more efficient use of resources when compared with the traditional inpatient regime.|$|R

Data were analyzed using multiple regression. Classical assumption test show that data were normal, so that the regression could be implemented properly. The result showed that performance positively affected the market value of football players, ages negatively affected market value of football players, incoming transfer fees positively affected the market value of football players and <b>salary</b> <b>costs</b> positively affected the market value of football players. The conclusion from this study is that the performance, age, incoming transfer fees and <b>salary</b> <b>costs</b> can be used for estimating the underlying price of football players in the football transfer market, but the cost of development is still not proven to affect the market value of a football playe...|$|R

The areas of greatest concern were workload and <b>low</b> <b>salary</b> [...] <b>Low</b> teacher <b>salaries</b> {{may be attributed to}} the unique situation TCU’s are in regarding funding. Most Tribal colleges are located on reservations and therefore are not supported by local taxes. They only receive support federally and remain chronically underfunded.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{direct wage}} subsidy programs to Finnish SMEs utilising as {{the unit of}} interest the firm and its characteristics. In estimating Average Treatment effects on the Treated firms (ATT) we apply recent techniques of propensity score matching algorithms developed by Becker and Ichino (2002) together with Difference in Differences (DiD) estimations. We define our outcome indicator as the net <b>salary</b> <b>costs</b> growth of the treated firms {{for up to two}} years after the first receipt of the wage subsidy. We find that, on average, the subsidised firms compared to the non-subsidised ones have higher payroll costs during the first year after the receipt of wage subsidies. Also, the first post-subsidies-year average net payroll growth comes out larger than the estimated average wages spent for the subsidised workers only. This may indicate that firms employ the subsidised workers for at least one year after the subsidised period and perhaps employ, in addition, extra staff. Although still positive, the net aggregate <b>salary</b> <b>costs</b> growth measured two years after the receipt of subsidies diminishes and seems not to cover all of the subsidised workers? <b>salary</b> <b>costs.</b> One could interpret these results as initial signs of lay-offs of the subsidised workers and/or of the extra staff employed the previous period. From a pure economic efficiency as well as a distributive justice point of view this two year employment spell for the previously unemployed could be considered as an adequate program effect. On the contrary, the diminishing <b>salary</b> <b>costs</b> growth already during the second year after the subsidies receipt might indicate non-sustainable positive wage subsidies effects even on a short term basis.
