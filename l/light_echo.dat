25|$|V838 Monocerotis, a {{variable}} red supergiant star, had an outburst starting on January 6, 2002; in February of that year, its brightness increased {{by a factor}} of 10,000 in one day.

500|$|Another {{accusation}} frequently made by websites {{predicting the}} collision {{is that the}} U.S. government built the South Pole Telescope (SPT) to track Nibiru's trajectory, and that the object has been imaged optically. However, the SPT (which is not funded by NASA) is a radio telescope, and cannot take optical images. Its South Pole location was chosen due to the low-humidity environment, {{and there is no}} way an approaching object could be seen only from the South Pole.

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>echoes,</b> <b>light</b> from a {{variable}} source scattered off dust, {{have been observed}} for over a century. The recent discovery of <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> around centuries-old supernovae in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud have allowed the spectroscopic characterization of these events, even without contemporaneous photometry and spectroscopy using modern instrumentation. Here we review the recent scientific advances using <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> of ancient and historic transients, and focus on our latest work on SN 1987 A's and Eta Carinae's <b>light</b> <b>echoes.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, IAU 296 conference proceeding...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Astronomical <b>light</b> <b>echoes,</b> the {{time-dependent}} <b>light</b> scattered by dust in {{the vicinity}} of varying objects, have been recognized for over a century. Initially, their utility was thought to be confined to mapping out the three-dimensional distribution of interstellar dust. Recently, the discovery of spectroscopically useful <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> around centuries-old supernovae in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud has opened up new scientific opportunities to exploit <b>light</b> <b>echoes.</b> In this review, we describe the history of <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> in the local Universe and cover the many new developments in both the observation of <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> and the interpretation of the light scattered from them. Among other benefits, we highlight our new ability to classify outbursting objects spectroscopically, view them from multiple perspectives, obtain a spectroscopic time series of the outburst, and establish accurate distances to the source event. We also describe the broader range of variable objects with properties that may be better understood from light-echo observations. Finally, we discuss the prospects of new light-echo techniques not yet realized in practice...|$|R

50|$|Within {{the last}} decade, objects known either as quasar light echoes or quasar {{ionisation}} echoes have been investigated. A well studied {{example of a}} quasar <b>light</b> <b>echo</b> is the object known as Hanny's Voorwerp (HsV).|$|E
50|$|For example, a <b>light</b> <b>echo</b> is {{produced}} when a sudden flash from a nova is reflected off a cosmic dust cloud, and {{arrives at the}} viewer after a longer duration than it otherwise would have taken with a direct path. Because of their geometries, light echoes can produce the illusion of superluminal speeds.|$|E
50|$|A <b>light</b> <b>echo</b> is a {{physical}} phenomenon caused by light reflected off surfaces distant from the source, and arriving at the observer with a delay relative to this distance. The phenomenon is analogous to an echo of sound, but due to the much faster speed of light, it mostly only manifests itself over astronomical distances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Light</b> <b>echoes</b> {{have also}} been used to study the {{supernova}} that produced the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The light from Cassiopeia A would have been visible on Earth around 1660, but went unnoticed, probably because dust obscured the direct view. Reflections from different directions allow astronomers {{to determine if a}} supernova was asymmetrical and shone more brightly in some directions than in others. The progenitor of Cassiopeia A has been suspected as being asymmetric, and looking at the <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> of Cassiopeia A allowed for the first detection of supernova asymmetry in 2010.|$|R

50|$|Modern 8-meter-class optical telescopes have {{discovered}} eclipsing binaries throughout the Local Group.

5000|$|NGC 2441 is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} located in the {{northern}} constellation of Camelopardalis. A Type 1a supernova, SN1995E, occurred in NGC 2441, and observations suggest it may display a <b>light</b> <b>echo,</b> where light from the supernova is reflected from matter along our line of sight, making it appear to [...] "echo" [...] outwards from the source.|$|E
50|$|Recent data {{indicates}} {{his distance}} estimate is five times too close. Astronomers used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope {{to observe the}} light emitted during its latest outburst in April 2011. The team also used the <b>light</b> <b>echo</b> to refine estimates of the nova's distance from Earth. The new distance is 15,600 light-years (4780 pc) from Earth. Previous estimates were between 6,500 and 16,000 light-years (2000 and 4900 pc).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Light</b> <b>echoes</b> {{were used}} to {{determine}} the distance to the Cepheid variable RS Puppis to an accuracy of 1%. Pierre Kavella at the European Southern Observatory described this measurement as so far [...] "the most accurate distance to a Cepheid".|$|R
5000|$|An {{example is}} {{supernova}} SN 1987A, the closest supernova in modern times.

40|$|Aims. The goal of {{the paper}} is to present new results on <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> from young stellar objects. Methods. Broad band CCD images were {{obtained}} over three months at one-to-two week intervals for the field of NGC 6726, using the large field-of-view remotely-operated telescope on top of Cerro Burek. Results. We detected scattered <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> around two young, low-amplitude, irregular variable stars. Observations revealed not just one, but multiple <b>light</b> <b>echoes</b> from brightness pulses of the T Tauri star S CrA and the Herbig Ae/Be star R CrA. Analysis of S CrA’s recurring echoes suggests that the star is located 138 ± 16 pc from Earth, making these the closest echoes ever detected. The environment that scatters the stellar light from S CrA is compatible with an incomplete dust shell or an inclined torus some 10, 000 AU in radius and containing ∼ 2 × 10 − 3 M of dust. The cause of such concentration at ∼ 10, 000 AU from the star is unknown. It could be the remnant of the envelope from which the star formed, but {{the distance of the}} cloud is remarkably similar to the nominal distance of the Oort cloud to the Sun, leading us to also speculate that the dust (or ice) seen around S CrA might have the same origin as the Solar System Oort cloud...|$|R
50|$|Some {{details are}} {{emerging}} {{on the nature}} of the star that experienced the outburst. Based on an incorrect interpretation of the <b>light</b> <b>echo</b> the eruption generated, the distance of the star was first estimated to be 1,900 to 2,900 light years. Combined with the apparent magnitude measured from pre-eruption photographs, it was thought to be an underluminous F-type dwarf not much unlike the Sun, which posed a considerable enigma.|$|E
50|$|SNR 0509-67.5 is {{a remnant}} from a {{supernova}} in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), that is 160,000 {{light years away}} in the constellation Dorado. It was probably a type Ia supernova, {{as indicated by the}} detection in 2004 of the elements silicon and iron. Any surviving stars have not moved far from the site of the explosion. The supernova occurred about 400 years delayed in Earth's time frame. However, researchers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. have identified light from the supernova that was reflected off of interstellar dust, delaying its arrival at Earth by 400 years. This delay, called a <b>light</b> <b>echo</b> of the supernova explosion also allowed the astronomers to measure the spectral signature of the light from the explosion. By virtue of the color signature, astronomers were able to deduce it was a Type Ia supernova. Scientists have also observed the supernova remnant at X-ray and visible wavelengths, and studied a <b>light</b> <b>echo</b> that helps assess the energy involved in this unusually energetic supernova.|$|E
