5|$|The new candle was {{designed}} by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & Marcon Inc., Eisenhardt Mills, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Dectis Painting, and the construction done by the Carpenters Union Local 600, Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council. It <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> {{exactly the same as}} the old previous candle, with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft. The candle cost $35,000 to build, but Panto said without the help from volunteers, it would have cost around $150,000, not including labor. In order to cover the $15,000 shortfall in funds raised, the city sold Christmas cards, posters, ornaments and $10 Peace Candle ownership shares. The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held November 23, 1990.|$|E
25|$|While {{retaining}} his WBC and WBA super flyweight belts, Darchinyan vacated his IBF belt {{in order}} to move up to bantamweight to fight IBF champion Joseph Agbeko in Sunrise, Florida on 11 July 2009. He lost a unanimous decision in a fight he <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> too overly aggressive in and couldn't seem to cope with the Ghanan's style and repeatedly walked into straight right hands. Agbeko spoiled Darchinyan's goal of winning his third world title in a different division. Two judges scored the bout 114-113 for Agbeko, while the third had it for the Ghanaian Agbeko, 116-111. Despite the defeat at bantamweight, Darchinyan was still recognized as super flyweight champion by both the WBC and WBA.|$|E
25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|E

500|$|Hutton {{remained}} in the middle order for the second Test, which England lost by 28 runs, but resumed his role as opener {{for the rest of}} the tour and scored a century in the following state game. Hutton scored 62 in the third Test, but the Australian spinner Jack Iverson, who caused the touring batsmen huge problems all series, bowled Australia to victory. Hutton's form continued in the fourth Test as he carried his bat for the second time in six months. Wisden observed: [...] "Against Hutton the bowling <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> mediocre, but most of the other batsmen made it appear lethal." [...] He scored 156 not out and added 45 more runs in the second innings, but Australian won by 274 runs. With the series lost, England won the final game, their first victory over Australia since the war and Australia's first defeat in 26 matches; Hutton contributed scores of 79 and 60 not out and struck the winning run. Hutton scored 553 Test runs at an average of 88.83, and in all first-class matches accumulated 1,199 runs with five centuries and an average of 70.52. In contrast to his previous Australian tour, Hutton played the short ball comfortably. Reviewing the tour, Wisden stated, [...] "With Hutton, figures did not lie. He stood head and shoulders above every other batsman and, taking all factors into consideration, worthily earned the description of the finest present-day batsman in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted {{the words}} [...] "Trois Jours" [...] ("Three Days"), {{along with a}} picture of the {{official}} single artwork, via TwitPic. Gaga is shown topless in the black-and-white cover art and displays the tattoos on her back. Her hair is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulders. The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran. Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the [...] "stark black and white image" [...] had a glossy eighties air about it. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> [...] "animalistic" [...] in the picture, and her flowing hair made her look like a creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was [...] "totally and completely fierce". Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover art and [...] Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single [...] "2 Hearts". Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's [...] "wild side" [...] and her [...] "glamorous" [...] looks. Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make-up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song.|$|E

Out Run offered players {{a wide variety of}} driving paths and routes to complete the game, adding elements of nonlinear gameplay and increasing replay value.

2500|$|Cantwell, {{an aging}} {{military}} officer {{in love with}} the teenaged Renata, (whose name means [...] "reborn"), is shown unlikeable as a character; one critic writes of him that his [...] "lovemaking is described in terms of an infantry attack over difficult terrain". [...] He is dying of heart disease and his relationship with Renata can be interpreted as a means of seeking youth or immortality. Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers believes Renata represents the city of Venice, she [...] "connected" [...] Cantwell (and Hemingway) to Italy, and in her characterization Hemingway romanticized what may have been a father-daughter relationship and he says Hemingway probably used Cantwell's fictional relationship with Renata as a substitute for his own relationship with Adriana, who <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> identical to Renata's description.|$|E

[...] In spring 1918 French wrote Lloyd George a long letter complaining of how Haig had intrigued against him in 1915, including criticising him to his subordinates, and how Haig and Robertson had (allegedly) conspired to gain military supremacy over the civil power. [...] French was pleased at the removal of Robertson and Derby early in 1918, and during the German Spring Offensive urged that Haig be sacked and replaced by Plumer. [...] In May 1918 he again suggested to Wilson (now CIGS) that Haig be appointed his successor as Commander-in-Chief Home Forces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{explanation}} of the letter ng also differs from the traditional account.

Also, the expected shape of ng (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of [...] ) would have <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> identical to the vowel [...] Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from [...] {{was added to the}} null symbol [...] to create [...] (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation [...] in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null [...] and ng [...] was eventually lost.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Quiet {{was modeled}} after, motion {{captured}} and voiced by Japan-based Dutch model Stefanie Joosten. She {{received a phone}} call from her agency to audition as a motion capture actress for an unspecified video game. However, being a big fan of video games she recognized Hideo Kojima at the audition and suspected it was for a new Metal Gear game. After getting the role and beginning the motion capture process, Joosten was shown artwork of the character, which she said <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> exactly the same as the finished product, but was not told specifically what character she would be playing. The process took two years and, having never held a gun before, she received professional combat training in order to handle several weapons. Although the character does not speak during most of the game, Joosten does provide her groans and hums. The hums are based on [...] "Quiet's Theme", a piece composed by Akihiro Honda, written by Ludvig Forrsell and sung by Joosten for the game's original soundtrack.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the Chinese convention of initial and final, Sejong and his ministers needed a null symbol to refer to the lack of a consonant with an initial vowel. He chose the circle, ㅇ, with the subsequent derivation of the glottal stop ㆆ ’ , by adding a vertical top stroke by analogy with the other stops, and the aspirate ㅎ h , parallel the account in the Haerye. (Perhaps the reason he created a new letter rather than adopting one from ’Phags-pa was that it was awkward to write these Chinese initials in ’Phags-pa, where ㅇ and ㆆ were both written as digraphs beginning with y, ꡭꡝ and ꡗꡖ.) However, Ledyard's explanation of the letter ㆁ ng [...] differs from the Haerye account; he sees it as a fusion of velar ㄱ g and null ㅇ, reflecting its variable pronunciation. Hangul was designed not just to write Korean, but to accurately represent Chinese. Many Chinese words historically began with , but by Sejong's day this had been lost in many regions of China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean, so that [...] only remained at the middle and end of Korean words. The expected shape of a velar nasal, the short vertical stroke (⃓) that would be left by removing the top stroke of ㄱ g, had the additional problem that it would have <b>looked</b> <b>almost</b> identical to the vowel ㅣ i [...] Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from ㄱ g was added to the null symbol ㅇ to create ㆁ ng, iconically capturing both regional pronunciations as well as being easily legible. Eventually the graphic distinction between the two silent initials ㅇ and ㆁ was lost, as they never contrasted in Korean words.|$|E
