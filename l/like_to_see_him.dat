On March 14, he had a D-League career-high 21 points and 7 assists against Sioux Falls Skyforce, the next night he broke those personal records with 24 points and 8 assists, and four nights later he scored a new career-high 27 points which included five three-pointers. [...] In 24 regular and post-season games, he averaged 13.1 points, 4.0 assists, and 4.0 rebounds as the team finished the season as runner-up in the championship.

500|$|Bo's {{first wife}} was Li Danyu, the {{daughter}} of former Beijing Party First Secretary Li Xuefeng. They wed in September 1976 and had a son, [...] "Brendan" [...] Li Wangzhi (李望知), the following year. Their son graduated from Columbia University in 2001. Li Danyu insisted that her son change his surname to Li following her divorce from Bo Xilai in 1984. Li Wangzhi was reportedly low-key and modest and was not commonly associated with his father during the latter's political heyday. Li Wangzhi obtained a master's degree in media studies and worked {{for a few years}} at Citibank, then worked for a law firm in Beijing; he eventually went into private equity. Li had remarked publicly that his father's arrest [...] "destroyed his life". In 2014, Li released a statement on his microblog feed revealing that his father was doing well in prison and that medical treatment is available to him should he need it. Li wrote, [...] "life is short... if the law allows, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> more. Come to think of it, the only times I've seen him [...] was at funerals, in the courtroom, or in prison." ...|$|E

500|$|Ivan {{starts to}} pursue Paul {{and they start}} {{sleeping}} together. However, Ivan's lax and secretive attitude to their relationship soon annoys Paul. Bose told a writer from Inside Soap that his character is a [...] "serial monogamist" [...] and [...] "has {{a lot of love}} to give". Ivan is the opposite and he has [...] "been cracking on to all the girls in the village and Paul can't relate to that". His bisexuality and secretive nature becomes an issue for Paul; Ivan cannot offer Paul [...] "100 per cent – physically, emotionally or spiritually, no matter how much they like each other". Paul attempts {{to come to terms with}} the situation and tries to dump him. The next time they are around each other they struggle to keep their flirtation hidden. Bose added that Ivan still [...] "wants to do everything on the quiet", which is a [...] "real hardship" [...] for Paul. The dynamic of their relationship proves to be an [...] "explosive combination". Ivan later has to decide if he is ready for a gay relationship, while Paul weighs up the risks of getting hurt by Ivan. Bose told Laura Davidson from the Sunday Mail that [...] "whether or not Ivan is the one for Paul, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> with someone who makes him happy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the show's flexibility, Arbuckle stated, [...] " [...] One Tree Hill doesn't focus {{exclusively}} on the teenagers, but also stretches out to include dedicated subplots for their parents and other adults." [...] He said {{there is not much}} of a maturity gap between the two sides. [...] "stead, to keep the structure somewhat separate, the respective focuses are on different emotions. For the teens, it's love; for the adults, it's revenge." [...] For example, one of the audience's main concerns has been [...] "Who should Lucas end up with?" [...] "If you're a huge fan of One Tree Hill, chances are you've had a debate at some point about who Lucas Scott should ultimately settle down with," [...] stated Don Williams of BuddyTV.com. [...] shippers can be an extremely rabid bunch. There are some fans who want Lucas with Peyton, others who'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> go back to Brooke, and even a few who think that Lindsey was his perfect match." ...|$|E

2500|$|Riding a {{horse and}} revisiting places of his childhood, Napoleon stops in Milelli gardens and {{considers}} whether to retreat and protect his family, or to advance into the political arena. Later {{in the streets of}} Ajaccio, Pozzo di Borgo (Acho Chakatouny) encourages a mob to put Napoleon to death for opposing Paoli, and the townsfolk surround the Buonaparte home. Napoleon stands outside the door and stares the crowd down, dispersing them silently. Paoli signs a death warrant, putting a price on Napoleon's head. Napoleon's brothers, Lucien (Sylvio Cavicchia) and Joseph (Georges Lampin), leave for Calvi to see if French authorities can intervene. Napoleon faces the danger alone, walking into an inn where men are arguing politics, all of whom would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> dead. He confronts the men and says, [...] "Our fatherland is France...with me!" [...] His arguments subdue the crowd, but di Borgo enters the inn, accompanied by gendarmes. Napoleon evades capture and rides away on his horse, pursued by di Borgo and his men.|$|E
2500|$|Also in {{the fall}} of 1986, Hercules rekindled a feud with Billy Jack Haynes that went back through every {{promotion}} the two were ever in together, including the WWF earlier in 1986. As part of the feud, Hercules started using Haynes' finishing move, the full nelson submission hold, as his finisher. On an episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge, Heenan called out Haynes saying he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> get out of Hercules' version of the hold. Haynes promptly answered the challenge and was waiting for Hercules to apply the hold when Heenan appeared to have second thoughts. Haynes grew tired of the charade and shoved Heenan. This gave Hercules the opening he needed to clothesline Haynes. Haynes was unable to defend himself and Hercules applied the full nelson and maintained the hold until Haynes passed out. This incident set the stage for their match at WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome in front of a reported 93,173 fans. The momentum swung back and forth throughout the contest until Haynes attempted to apply the full nelson; both men tumbled to the floor after Hercules reached the ropes. Haynes applied the full nelson on the floor as both men were counted out. Heenan broke the hold by driving a knee into the back of Haynes, who then turned his attention to Heenan and chased him into the ring, allowing Hercules to blindside him with a shot to the head with his steel chain wrapped around his fist, causing Haynes to bleed profusely (a closeup shot of Haynes on the mat clearly showed him [...] "blading" [...] himself in order to draw blood). The feud culminated some weeks later in a chain match that saw Hercules as the victor.|$|E
60|$|She also--alas, for romance!--cooked {{the dishes}} David loved, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> enjoy {{them with the}} {{appetite}} which once had shocked her so.

6000|$|... "Indeed, I wasn't at all {{afraid of}} him," [...] Elma answered, {{slipping}} her change into her pocket, and looking prettier through her blush than even her usual self.

60|$|Why Tom {{should look}} troubled and turn grave all at once, {{she could n't}} understand, but she <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> stroke his mother's cheek so softly, as he stood with his head resting on the high back of her chair, for Polly fancied that he felt a man's pity for her weakness, and was {{learning}} a son's patient love for a mother who had had much to bear with him.|$|R

60|$|The widow's breast {{was full}} of care, was laden heavily with secret dread and sorrow; but her boy's gaiety of heart gladdened her, and beguiled the long journey.
