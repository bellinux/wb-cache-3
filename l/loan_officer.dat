40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} providing <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> with a compensation structure that rewards loan volume and penalizes poor performance versus a fixed wage unrelated to performance. We study detailed transaction information for more than 45, 000 loans issued by 240 <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> of a large commercial bank in Europe. We examine the three main activities that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> perform: monitoring, originating, and screening. We find that when {{the performance of their}} portfolio deteriorates, <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> increase their effort to monitor existing borrowers, reduce loan origination, and approve a higher fraction of loan applications. These loans, however, are of above-average quality. Consistent with the theoretical literature on multitasking in incomplete contracts, we show that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> neglect activities that are not directly rewarded under the contract, but are {{in the interest of the}} bank. In addition, while the response by <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> constitutes a rational response to a time allocation problem, their reaction to incentives appears myopic in other dimensions...|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} explore the perceptions held by bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> of male and female business owners, using Bourdieu's theory of practice and Kelly's personal construct methodology. The research literature might lead to an expectation that the characteristics of the business owners would be relatively homogenous but that men and women business owners would be construed differently (for example women might be seen to lack drive). However, the results demonstrate heterogeneity in the constructs held by bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers,</b> and a particular concern with the character of the business owner. Significant gender differences were observed in only 20 of the 325 constructs elicited from 35 bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers.</b> Female bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> were as likely as male bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> to draw gender distinctions between business owners.

40|$|We {{surveyed}} agricultural <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> {{and their}} supervisors in North Dakota {{to learn what}} factors influenced the decision to make loans to farmers investing in new agricultural cooperatives. We found that the Farm Credit Services and other large institutions made a disproportionately large share of the loans. Furthermore, institutions with minimal equity, but {{with low levels of}} non- current loans and a high return on equity, were more likely than others to make the loans. Experienced agricultural <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> and those who attended a cooperative's information meeting or reviewed the business plan were more likely to make <b>loans.</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>officers</b> granted <b>loans</b> to applicants who met conservative lending criteria. The decision was not based on the <b>loan</b> <b>officer's</b> attitudes toward cooperatives. Attitudes of <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> toward cooperatives were generally positive. Most negative attitudes were expressed about the price of the stock, and the delivery contracts required by the cooperatives. Finally, <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> believed cooperative stock was a risky investment, inferior to stock and mutual funds as stand alone investments. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{liability}} {{limit of}} the owner's policy is typically the purchase price paid for the property. As {{with other types of}} insurance, coverages can also be added or deleted with an endorsement. There are many forms of standard endorsements to cover a variety of common issues. The premium for the policy may be paid by the seller or buyer as the parties agree. Usually a custom in a particular state or county on this matter reflects in most local real estate contracts. One should inquire about the cost of title insurance before signing a real estate contract that provides that he pay for title charges. A real estate attorney, broker, escrow officer (in the western states), or <b>loan</b> <b>officer</b> can provide detailed information as to the price of title search and insurance before the real estate contract is signed. Title insurance coverage lasts as long as the insured retains an interest in the land insured and typically no additional premium is paid after the policy is issued.|$|E

In the U.S., it is common business practice for the initial lender to provide an interim loan (the [...] "construction loan") to build a building.

Riggs Bank, a local D.C. bank, had provided the interim construction loan to Nassif. The New York City Employees Retirement System was to have paid off this construction loan.

40|$|To {{understand}} better {{the role of}} <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> in {{the origins of the}} financial crisis, we study a controlled experiment conducted by a large bank. In the experiment, the incentive structure of a subset of small business <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> was changed from fixed salary to commission-based compensation. We use a diffin-diff design to show that while the characteristics of loan applications did not change, commissionbased <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> are 19 % more likely to accept loan applications, and approve loan amounts larger by 23 %. Although the observable credit quality of loans booked by commission-based <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> increased, they were 28 % more likely to default. We show that the increase in default occurs primarily at the population of loans {{that would not have been}} accepted in the absence of commission-based compensation.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} loan {{decisions}} {{are affected by}} the internal decision structure of the bank. Banks typically grant decision rights on straight-forward loans entirely to individual <b>loan</b> <b>officers.</b> For more risky <b>loans</b> these <b>officers</b> have to seek ratification for their loan proposals at higher hierarchical levels within banks (e. g., a credit committee). As banks typically provide <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> with incentives to make <b>loans,</b> <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> can increase the likelihood of loan approval by communicating the risk-return characteristics of the loan request favorably. Using internal records from a bank, our sample consists of approved loan requests coming from small firms.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{illustrate}} {{and explain the}} variable take-up of microfinance from the particular standpoint of the actors who actually produce and deliver microfinance. It draws attention to issues of relationships, action, tensions, and compromises in the real work of <b>loan</b> <b>officers,</b> which ultimately define how micro finance works. Few existing studies have used data outside South Asia to examine what <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> actually do at the interface with clients and {{their role in the}} diffusion of microfinance. A central concern of this thesis is that microfinance relies heavily upon <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> to be a critical link and facilitators of 'bottom-up' development, yet the activities of <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> in sub-Saharan Africa and Zambia in particular, where microfinance is emerging, remain relatively under-researched. This qualitative ethnographic study was designed to examine the processes of microfinance and how it works by interviewing and observing loan officers’ interactions with clients and everyday practices. Analysis of data was conducted in accordance with grounded theory principles and organised {{with the assistance of the}} software programme, QSR NVIVO. The results reported in this thesis indicate that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> had multiple, ambiguous and fast changing roles, mainly driven by an institution's economic survival rather than clients' 'empowerment'. Pressure for institutional sustainability and commercialisation were also found to be changing relationships and the original character of microfinance. Furthermore, the practice of microfinance in Zambia risked transforming <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> into 'loan repayment agents' as opposed to 'development workers' or 'enablers' of growth. The thesis concludes that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> are so critical that without an appropriate fieldwork-culture, microfinance cannot effectively diffuse whatever its design. The central contention of the thesis is that, sustainability and diffusion of microfinance could be flawed if it is so dependent on <b>loan</b> <b>officers.</b> Furthermore, those studies which have excluded the voice of <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> may not be an accurate predictor of its likely performance.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to examine how loan officers’ think and act when making {{assessments}} of loan proposals from companies. The importance of valid loan assessments can be understood through the substantial economic crises that the global economy has suffered {{as well as the}} severe problems invalid lending decisions brings for both banks and clients. In Study I we conducted a review of the research on lending decision making concerning company credits between 2000 and 2010 to create a basis for subsequent research could benefit from. The results from the review tell us that lending technology influence the lending decisions, that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> are susceptible to cognitive biases when assessing customers and that intuitive reasoning seems to be part of lending decision making. We discussed the findings on the basis of earlier research and proposed three conclusions. In study II we examined how <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> make decisions about loan proposals through 88 critical incident interviews conducted in the four biggest banks in Sweden. The results showed that <b>loan</b> <b>officer’s</b> used deliberate reasoning to a higher extent than intuitive reasoning when making lending decisions. Furthermore, when reporting which kind of problems the <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> experienced, typical problems were the assessment of soft information, e. g., relationship with client. We discussed the findings on the basis of relevant decision making literature and emphasize the potential problems that could arise in lending decision making. Study III investigated the occurrence of different thinking styles among <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> and the antecedents of lending technology. The results showed that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> reported a higher degree of analytic thinking than an experiential thinking style. Lending technology was shown to be a result of organizational differences, e. g., bank affiliation rather than of individual differences, e. g., thinking styles or lending experience. In Study IV, a web-based experiment was conducted to investigate the validity of different information processes in lending decision-making. The participants were induced with either an intuitive or analytic way of processing information and were then tested on their susceptibility to the sunk-cost effect. Results showed that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> are victims of the sunk-cost effect, but the effect is not depending on differences in intuitive and analytic information processing. In all, these studies suggest that both organizational and personal factors affects lending decision making, that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> use predominately analytic rather than intuitive information processing when making decisions and that <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> are victims of the sunk cost-effect...|$|R

40|$|Segments of the {{business}} commmunity and the accounting profession have become increasingly concerned about the quantity and complexity of generally accepted accounting principles. The fundamental {{problem is that the}} financial statements of small private companies may be too complex. ^ Prior studies have gathered data from <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> in large commercial banks. This study gathers data from <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> of banks with $ 50 million to $ 150 million in deposits. It examines the usefulness of selected GAAP basis accounting information items in the small private company loan decision process and assesses the attitudes of commercial bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> regarding the use of GAAP basis accounting information. ^ Questionnaires were mailed to 176 banks chartered in Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota; 109 usable responses were received. The questionnaire requested that the <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> rate the usefulness of twenty-nine accounting information items and respond to nine general accounting questions. By utilizing a case study, detailed verbal protocols were developed to analyze the specific decision process followed by eight <b>loan</b> <b>officers.</b> These verbal protocols were designed to identify the accounting information actually used. ^ Of the twenty-nine information items evaluated, seven are perceived as highly useful, sixteen, intermediately useful and six, not useful. The verbal protocols substantiated all but three of the usefulness ratings. The <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> agree that they: (1) receive GAAP basis financial statements but routinely accept financial statements prepared using another basis, (2) have different information needs for small private companies, (3) believe that the financial statements of small private companies are less useful than those of large public companies and are not cost efficient and (4) believe that differential measurement and differential disclosure should be permitted. The <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> also agree that the usefulness of the information items varies with the characteristics of the loan request. Contradictions with other studies are noted. ^ Further research directed toward modeling the small private company loan decision process is recommended. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{conflicting}} body {{of evidence}} surrounds womens claims that they are discriminated against {{when it comes to}} obtaining business loans. Fay and Williams (1991) found that when identical loan applications were submitted by men and women, women {{were less likely to be}} granted a loan. It was proposed in this study that gender discrimination could be occurring as a result of bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> attitudes about women as successful business owners. Seventy bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> from North Island branches of the ANZ, ASB and WestpacTrust banks filled in questionnaires assessing their attitudes towards women, men and successful business owners (Buttner & Rosen, 1988). Bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> also read a mock loan application (Fay & Williams, 1991) and indicated whether they would grant the loan. Results showed that bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> did not differentially approve bank loans on the basis of the applicants gender (male or female) or level of education (Highschool or University). Loan approval was harder for male applicants to obtain as 'type of business entering' and 'lease agreement' were considered more important for males than females. Attitudes of bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> indicated that they perceived women, compared to men, to be least like successful business owners. These results were discussed in relation to bank <b>loan</b> <b>officers</b> and prospective business owners. Limitations of the study included the possibility of response bias, participants being aware of the purpose of the study and the fact that the loan application was limited to one scenario and within the context of a hypothetical situation.
