5000|$|Designed by Charles A. Cregar, one of Springfield's most {{prominent}} architects, St. John's is a Romanesque Revival structure with a prominent corner tower. [...] Although built primarily of brick, the walls also feature copious amounts of limestone {{and other types}} of stone.

The main entrance is placed {{at the base of the}} tower, which features narrow arched windows on three stories below the tall <b>louvering</b> that shelters the belfry. Because the church sits on a street corner, two different sides of the building include massive gabled sections, each rising above groups of small windows.

5000|$|Built with weatherboarded {{walls and}} covered with a {{shingled}} roof, Zion is a Carpenter Gothic structure. [...] Its architectural style distinguishes it among rural mid-nineteenth-century churches in the Connecticut Western Reserve region of northeastern Ohio, many of which were Greek Revival buildings without the single tall tower so prominent in Zion's design. At the same time, Zion differs from the typical Carpenter Gothic church in its use of angled gable-shaped windows instead of the ogive traditional in Gothic Revival buildings. [...] Worshippers enter the building though double doors in the base of the tower, above which are placed one large window and one small. A belfry with <b>louvering</b> occupies the highest level of the tower, above which stands a cross-tipped steeple. The roof rises steeply to front and rear gables, with a small section of the roof and much of the front gable being obscured by the tower.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} fin pitch, <b>louver</b> angle and thickness, and flow depth on the onset, propagation, and {{characteristic}} frequencies of instabilities in multilouvered fins is investigated. The initial instability {{appears in the}} wake of the exit lo. uver. Subsequently, instabilities are established in the interior of the <b>louver</b> bank which spread upstream as the Reynolds number increases. It is shown that the interior instabilities are completely independent of the exit wake instability. On the other hand, the exit wake instability is not only dependent on the exit <b>louver</b> geometry but also on the internal geometry of the <b>louver</b> bank. Increasing <b>louver</b> thickness and angle increases the propensity of the flow to become unstable.
