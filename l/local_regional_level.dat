The motivation for this work is the increasing availability and use of digital photography within the home and the lack of suitable search facilities based on the content of the images therein. The selection of images from the database is performed by Radial Basis Function networks, the placement of which is carried out by Kohonen's Learning Vector Quantisation approach. The work, which has been carried out in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Labs in Bristol, has shown that the use of features extracted on a <b>local</b> <b>regional</b> <b>level,</b> rather than a global scale can provide a high success rate when used as keys for a database query. A manual region classification was carried out on a test set of images in order to evaluate the performance of the system and it was found that, of the regions returned with a classification, an impressive 76. 6 % [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} human health risk {{assessment}} {{there are three}} main exposure pathways for a given contaminant present in soil. The largest area of concern is the oral/ingestion pathway followed by the dermal and respiratory exposure routes (Paustenbach, 2000). Whether contaminated soils pose a human health risk depends on {{the potential of the}} contaminant to leave the soil and enter the human bloodstream. The use of total contaminant concentrations in soils provides a conservative approach as it assumes that all of the metal present in the soil can enter the bloodstream. Results from animal tests e. g. (Denys et al., 2012) suggest that contaminants in a soil matrix maybe absorbed to a lesser extent and show fewer toxic effects compared to the same concentration of soluble salts of the contaminants in a food or liquid matrix. This presentation will give an overview of the interdisciplinary inputs required to develop and validate methods for measuring the bioavailability /bioaccessibility of contaminants in soil, contrasting and comparing the requirements for inorganic and organic substances. The need for allied methodologies for understanding the processes which control the bioavailability /bioaccessibility of contaminants in soil will be discussed and examples of how both the properties of the contaminant and the physico-chemical properties of the soil can be used to provide an insight to bioavailability mechanisms. Finally, case studies of how bioaccessibility measurements have been applied on a <b>local</b> <b>regional</b> <b>level</b> will be presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Livestock {{is poorly}} {{represented}} in N budgets for the African continent although {{some studies have}} examined livestock-related N flows at different levels. Livestock {{plays an important role}} in N cycling and therefore on N budgets including livestock-related flows. This study reviews the literature on N budgets for Africa to identify factors contributing to uncertainties. Livestock densities are usually modelled because of the lack of observational spatial data. Even though feed availability and quality varies across seasons, most studies use constant livestock excretion rates, and excreta are usually assumed to be uniformly distributed onto the land. Major uncertainties originate in the fraction of manure managed, and emission factors which may not reflect the situation of Africa. N budgets use coarse assumptions on production, availability, and use of crop residues as livestock feed. No flows between croplands-livestock and rangelands reflect the lack of data. Joint efforts are needed for spatial data collection of livestock data, crowdsourcing appears to be a promising option. The focus of the assessment of N budgets must go beyond croplands to include livestock and crop-livestock flows. We propose a nested systems definition of livestock systems to link <b>local,</b> <b>regional</b> <b>level,</b> and continental level and to increase the usefulness of point measurements of N losses. Scientists working at all levels should generate data to calibrate process-based models. Measurements in the field should not only concentrate on greenhouse gas emissions, but need to include crop and livestock production measurements, soil stock changes and other N loss pathways such as leaching, run-off and volatilization to assess management practices and trade-offs. Compared to the research done in other continents on N flows in livestock systems, there are few data for Africa, and therefore concerted effort will be needed to generate sufficient data for modelling...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the inner economical structure of communities and their population distribution through a rank-rank analysis of official data, along statistical physics ideas within two techniques. The data is taken on Italian cities. The analysis is performed both at a global (national) and at a more <b>local</b> (<b>regional)</b> <b>level</b> in order to distinguish "macro" and "micro" aspects. First, the rank-size rule is found not to be a standard power law, as in many other studies, but a doubly decreasing power law. Next, the Kendall and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients which measure pair concordance and the correlation between fluctuations in two rankings, respectively, - as a correlation function does in thermodynamics, are calculated for finding rank correlation (if any) between demography and wealth. Results show non only global disparities for the whole (country) set, but also (regional) disparities, when comparing the number of cities in regions, the number of inhabitants in cities and that in regions, as well as when comparing the aggregated tax income of the cities and that of regions. Different outliers are pointed out and justified. Interestingly, two classes of cities in the country and two classes of regions in the country are found. "Common sense" social, political, and economic considerations sustain the findings. More importantly, the methods show that they allow to distinguish communities, very clearly, when specific criteria are numerically sound. A specific modeling for the findings is presented, i. e. for the doubly decreasing power law and the two phase system, based on statistics theory, e. g., urn filling. The model ideas can be expected to hold when similar rank relationship features are observed in fields. It is emphasized that the analysis makes more sense than one through a Pearson value-value correlation analysis.

40|$|The {{choice of}} centralizing tourism {{policies}} {{at the national}} level or, on the contrary, of decentralizing them at the local level is widely discussed in the literature, which highlights the related pros and cons. In fact, the simultaneous role of originator and attractor of tourism of each spatial unit may imply a range of complex and competing interests at various geographical scales. At any one time, organizations at the national, regional and local level are actively engaged in promoting tourism destinations in order to attract tourists. Nevertheless, potential competition/complementarity between regions in terms of their attractivity factors may imply a range of complex and competing interests at various geographical scales. In particular, in a framework of regional competition, a central (national) policy may be necessary to offset or coordinate the clashing regional interests. An increasingly important force of attraction for tourists (both domestic and international) is cultural tourism. For this reason, national and regional governments make great efforts to implement effective cultural tourism policies, for example to obtain an official certification for their historical/cultural attractions, like UNESCO?s World Heritage Sites (WHS) list. The WHS endowment of the regions surrounding a tourism destination may {{have a negative effect on}} its inflows of tourists (Patuelli et al. in J Geogr Syst 15 : 369 ? 402, 2013). Indeed, tourists consider, in forming their travelling choices, the WHS endowment of alternative destinations, generating a phenomenon of spatial substitution (competition). This paper focuses on the choice between implementing tourism governance and policymaking at the central (national) or at the <b>local</b> (<b>regional)</b> <b>level.</b> The issue is raised by the following problem: (1) regional endowment (i. e., attractivity factors) may positively influence arrivals to tourism destinations, providing a justification for local policies (e. g., lobbying towards the national government for obtaining UNESCO?s WHS designations); (2) however, regional competition may reduce the positive direct effect, so that it may be necessary the intervention of the central (national) policy maker, to ?compensate? or ?correct? the local (regional) policies. The issue concerns the choice of how managing regional spillovers: regions could use their attractivity factors to gain a competitive advantage over other regions, but at the same time they risk damaging the national interest to attract tourists and increase the international market share. It is therefore critical to correctly balance and coordinate the tourism policies between the national and regional levels in order to effectively manage the regional endowment to cater to the cultural tourism demand. We stress that more profound insights into the problems and challenges of (de) centralized tourism policies can be gained by examining the national-regional choice, and in particular by using as a modelling framework, the ?normative? spatial interaction model...|$|E
