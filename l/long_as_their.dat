5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E

But with the expansion of the war across the border they might have to take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> orange counterparts. Attempts {{have been made to}} cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict {{the number of}} flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted {{at any time of}} year.|$|E

5|$|By {{this point}} in his life Beebe was {{developing}} a close friendship with the American romance novelist Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and her first novel Riders of the Wind was devoted to him. The novel was an account of a young woman who falls in love with, and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe. Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth's tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old she was when she and Beebe were married, ranging from 23 to 28. Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual exclusivity from the other so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> life together was not damaged.|$|E
5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E
5|$|From the 1994–95 to 2013–14 seasons the Regional League, {{along with}} the Midland Football Combination, served {{as one of the}} two {{official}} feeders to the Midland Football Alliance. The highest-placed team which met the Alliance's entry requirements was promoted to the Alliance, and one or more teams were relegated into the Regional League from the Alliance depending on the number of clubs remaining in each league. (These requirements were inherited by the second Midland League; see last paragraph.) Prior to the 2006–07 season, the league was defined as a step 7 league within the National League System, even though it fed into the Alliance, which was graded as step 5. In 2006 the Regional League was re-graded by the Football Association as a step 6 league. Teams in the top two divisions are eligible {{to take part in the}} FA Cup and FA Vase as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> grounds meet the required standards.|$|E

5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|The Army also {{conducted}} a weapons demonstration for the Senate Armed Services Committee in early 1972, {{to show off}} the Cheyenne's firepower and garner support for attack helicopter development. The first TOW missile that was fired in the demonstration failed and went into the ground. The second missile was fired and hit the target. Previously, 130 TOW missiles had been fired without failure, but the failure of the first missile was now linked to perception of the aircraft. In April 1972, the Senate published its report on CAS. The report recommended funding of the Air Force's A-X program, which would become the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and limited procurement of the Harrier for the Marine Corps. The report never referred to the Cheyenne by name and only offered a lukewarm recommendation for the Army to continue procurement of attack helicopters, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> survivability could be improved.|$|E

On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold {{announced that he was}} willing to temporarily delegate his authority.
