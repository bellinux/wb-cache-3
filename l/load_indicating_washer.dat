40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a review of}} different techniques to tighten a bolted joint and investigates {{the ability of the}} methods to tighten the joint to a prescribed bolt tension. A literature survey was undertaken which revealed that different opinions exist regarding the performance of certain tightening methods and the influence of several commonly encountered factors on them. Test equipment was designed and built to study the performance of five tightening methods: torque control, angle control - elastic range, angle control - yield range, yield control, and <b>load</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>washers.</b> The effects of a number of practical factors on the performance of these methods were investigated. The main factors investigated were: joint stiffness, nut and bolt plating and geometry, and washer type. The tests have shown that yield controlled tightening and angle control (yield range) provide the most accurate methods of tightening a bolted joint to a prescribed bolt tension (+/- 5 %). Torque control and <b>load</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>washers</b> (Coronet) can tighten the joint to +/- 10 %. Angle control (elastic range) gives relatively poor control over bolt tension (+/- 14 %), largely due to variations in snug position and tension-angle gradient. The deflections of the joint components influence the performance of the angle-related tightening methods. The deflection of the threaded connection itself is significant, especially for 'hard' joints. This contribution to the overall deflection has been largely neglected in previous studies. Methods to improve the accuracy of the tightening methods are discussed. In particular the use of hardened washers to improve the accuracy and repeatability of torque control is recommended. Furthermore, preliminary tests were conducted on the design of a <b>washer,</b> which would <b>indicate</b> when the joint has been tightened to a prescribed tension...|$|R

The sides bulge because the material, although strong enough to not crack or otherwise fail, is not strong enough to support the load without change, thus the material is forced out laterally. Internal forces (in this case at right angles to the deformation) resist the applied load.|$|R
