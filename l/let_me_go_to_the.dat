500|$|For Thriller 25, The Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am remixed the {{demo version}} of [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)". The singer commented on Jackson and the project, [...] "You always just dream of meeting him, let alone working with him. I wouldn't have {{believed}} it. I {{grew up in}} the projects in East Los Angeles and Thriller was filmed about two blocks from my house, but my mother was really strict and she wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> factories—she didn't care who was filming a video there; but I'm on the 25th anniversary, 25 years later—that's pretty awesome." [...] Entitled [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) 2008", the remix was well received by Rolling Stone. The publication described the track, along with [...] "The Girl Is Mine 2008", as being one of the best songs on the album. They noted that will.i.am [...] "updates the songs' original sound to make them dancefloor-worthy twenty-five years after their release".|$|E
2500|$|Although Knievel never {{attempted}} to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash. [...] During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, [...] "I don't {{care if they}} say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that thing {{off the edge of}} the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it. I want to be the first. If they'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there." [...] For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon. Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.|$|E
60|$|As for steering, {{they never}} would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> helm, except during a calm, when I and the figure-head on the bow were about equally employed.|$|E
6000|$|... "In short," [...] {{suggested}} the Arethusa, [...] "you want {{to wash your}} hands of further responsibility? Well, then, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{heart was}} sick for poor Cecile. 'My brother-in-law!' I said. 'Oh, Mademoiselle, I entreat of you <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> his aid.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--yes--no. I {{have not}} forgotten," [...] she said, passing {{her hand over}} her brow; [...] "but, oh! <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> her before I die!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{appeared}} to shrink from being seated in her mistress's presence. [...] "Please to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window," [...] she said; [...] "the air will help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think Kaliko is {{treating}} them dreadfully mean," [...] declared Dorothy, [...] "and I wish you'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nome Country {{and help them}} out of their troubles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My child," [...] {{said the}} Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, [...] "I have saved him. What {{weakness}} is this, my dear! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him," [...] {{began the}} lady, with more feeling in face and voice than one would believe her capable of showing.|$|R
6000|$|She was {{starting}} up, as {{the opening of}} the door let out another scream. 'There he is still! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him for one minute.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's no {{accounting}} for tastes,' said Merry; 'at least I didn't {{mean to say}} that. I don't know what I mean. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, now. And {{you must}} tell him. You <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theatre with him." [...] The faintest shadow of resentment clouded the girl's face, but still Mrs. Kenton, thought {{she knew her}} own guilt, could not yield.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think, sir, I {{had better}} read {{his letter to}} you. It has been written with that intention, and I am bound {{to let you know}} the contents. Perhaps Mrs. Bolton will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end so that we may discuss it afterwards.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me go {{into some}} profession. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar. I am sure I could earn my own living. Earn it! of course I could, why not I {{as well as}} others? I should like of all things to be a barrister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For God's sake <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go--I can't stand it. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> hell--that's where I belong. What do you {{bother with}} me for? I've got a right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> my room," [...] entreated {{the poor}} prisoner, who felt as ineffable disgust at her jailor, and was {{becoming}} sensible to extreme fatigue.|$|R
6000|$|He {{caught up}} with her, he laid his hand upon her arm to stay her. [...] "If you're going <b>to</b> Venice, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Venice with you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot help thinking," [...] he went on, [...] "about {{those men}} who watched the house last night. They could have been after no good. I wish you would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police-station. Or {{would you like me}} to come and watch myself, to-night or to-morrow night, to see if they come again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The boys {{said you}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Temple all I want to; but I {{told them the}} Miracle was different, and I'd {{have to ask you}} first. I told Mis' Hingston, and I told the boys. Me 'n' Benny got them to come round. Kin I, mother? Mis' Hingston thought may be--may be--you might come yourself. But I told her I didn't believe you would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{go to the}} picnic!" [...] Anne {{sprang to}} her feet and {{clutched}} Marilla's hand. [...] "But you PROMISED me I might! Oh, Marilla, I must go to the picnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that. Oh, Marilla, please, please, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> picnic. Think of the ice cream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven and earth! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> her. If {{she were}} to tell me so herself I would not believe it of her. Ah! she has told you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear T., I {{have been}} working so hard all night; and I do think you ought <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep now, instead of scolding me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This woman {{wishes to}} speak to me. Stand aside, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> her!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "If she be indeed dying, surely you should respect her wishes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{give the}} true reason. I {{can find no}} studio here big enough for me--as I have told you. And, even if I could find a studio, I should be doing no good, if I {{remained}} at Dimchurch. My intellect would contract, my brains would rust, in this remote place. Let Oscar live his quiet married life here. And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere that is fitter for me--the atmosphere of London or Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. He implored me in {{his letter}} to run away and be married. But I cannot do that, Rilla, not even for Joe. My only comfort is that I {{will be able to see}} him for a little while {{tomorrow}} afternoon. Father has to go to Charlottetown on business. At least we will have one good farewell talk. But oh--afterwards--why, Rilla, I know father won't even <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station Friday morning to see Joe off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{you said}} you'd keep me here until I confessed," [...] {{returned}} Anne wearily, [...] "and so I decided to confess because I {{was bound to}} get to the picnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I wouldn't forget it. But you wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> picnic after all, so all my trouble was wasted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Fran, it was lovely!" [...] cried Cecilia. [...] "But I felt so sorry--why didn't you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Ashland? It was too bad {{you missed}} it--and Sara Beaumont." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My baby, my blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed baby!' screamed Mrs Kenwigs, making every blessed {{louder than}} the last. 'My own darling, sweet, {{innocent}} Lillyvick--Oh <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> go-o-o-o!' ...|$|R
60|$|Hect. I feel it for thee: <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Priam, I'll {{break this}} treaty off; or <b>let</b> <b>me</b> fight: I'll be thy champion, and secure both her, And thee, and Troy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{what about}} me?" [...] Gerald exclaimed. [...] "I don't want to complain, but listen. You dragged me {{home from a}} public school before I could even join my cadet corps. You've kept me banging around here with a tutor. You wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> university. You've stopped my {{entering}} either of the services. I am nineteen years old and useless. Do you know what I should do to-morrow if war broke out? Enlist! It's {{the only thing left}} for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nuttie {{got through}} her morning's work she hardly knew how, though {{her father was}} dry and {{fault-finding}} all the time. Her eyes were so full of tears when she was released that she hardly saw where she was going, and nearly ran against her aunt, who had just walked into the hall. Mrs. Egremont was too prudent a woman to let her burst out there with her grievance, but made her come into the tent-room before she exclaimed, 'He {{is going to take}} me away to London; he won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wedding.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am in {{the mosaic}} department. Oh, Miss Gillian, I am so {{grateful}} to Miss Merrifield. Don't you remember her looking at my little attempts, and persuading Lady Merrifield to get mother to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> School of Art? I began only as the girls do who are mere hands, and now I have to prepare all the designs for them, and have a nice little office of my own for it. Sometimes I get {{one of my own}} designs taken, and then I am paid extra.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's never interfered, and he's {{always seemed}} to understand. I shall never forget his <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> South Africa in the Boer War when I {{was in love with}} Val." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Sir John. [...] "Only, I put it shorter. Why can't {{you put it}} shorter, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep again? Everything to my wife. That's my Will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't scream," [...] said Mrs. Gibbs, [...] "not if I know it's {{flesh and}} blood. Oh, where is he? Why don't you bring 'im in? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> 'im." ...|$|R
