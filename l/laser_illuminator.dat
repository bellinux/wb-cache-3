40|$|Holographic glass light-shaping {{diffusers}} (GLSDs) are optical {{components for}} use in special-purpose illumination systems (see figure). When properly positioned with respect to lamps and areas to be illuminated, holographic GLSDs efficiently channel light from the lamps onto specified areas with specified distributions of illumination for example, uniform or nearly uniform irradiance can be concentrated with intensity confined to a peak a few degrees wide about normal incidence, over a circular or elliptical area. Holographic light diffusers were developed during the 1990 s. The development of the present holographic GLSDs extends the prior development to incorporate sol-gel optical glass. To fabricate a holographic GLSD, one records a hologram on a sol-gel silica film formulated specially for this purpose. The hologram is a quasi-random, micro-sculpted pattern of smoothly varying changes in the index of refraction of the glass. The structures in this pattern act as an array of numerous miniature lenses that refract light passing through the GLSD, such that the transmitted light beam exhibits a precisely tailored energy distribution. In comparison with other light diffusers, holographic GLSDs function with remarkably high efficiency: they typically transmit 90 {{percent or more of}} the incident lamp light onto the designated areas. In addition, they can withstand temperatures in excess of 1, 000 C. These characteristics make holographic GLSDs attractive {{for use in}} diverse lighting applications that involve high temperatures and/or requirements for high transmission efficiency for ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. Examples include projectors, automobile headlights, aircraft landing lights, high-power <b>laser</b> <b>illuminators,</b> and industrial and scientific illuminators...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFor Terahertz (THz) imaging {{to be useful}} outside of a laboratory setting, inexpensive yet sensitive detectors such as uncooled microbolometers will be required. Metamaterials can improve THz absorption without significantly increasing the thermal mass or using exotic materials because their absorption is primarily dependent on the geometry of the materials and not their individual optical properties. Finite Element (FE) simulations revealed that an array of squares above a ground plane separated by a dielectric is efficient, yet thin. Metamaterials were fabricated and their absorption characteristics were measured using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) indicating that the FE simulations are accurate. Metamaterial structures tuned to a quantum cascade <b>laser</b> (QCL) <b>illuminator</b> were incorporated into a bi-material sensor, which was used for detection of THz radiation from the QCL source with good sensitivity. In the case of microbolometers, a bolometric layer needs to be embedded in the metamaterial to form a thin microbridge. Simulations indicated that if the bolometric layer was resistive enough or {{close enough to the}} ground plane, then absorption would be largely unaltered.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{atmospheric}} turbulence can severely degrade performance of various optical systems including the laser beam projection systems discussed here. These systems are designed to create and maintain a laser spot of the smallest possible size on a remotely located object in the atmosphere. Compensation (mitigation) of turbulence effects in the laser beam projection systems is typically performed using adaptive optics (AO) wavefront correctors. In several applications the outgoing beam scattering off an extended object rough surface results in strong speckle modulation of the return wave. This speckle modulation is the major problem for the existing AO wavefront control techniques. In this paper we consider a new approach for speckle-effect mitigation in adaptive laser beam projection systems by creating an incoherent beacon (Collett-Wolf beacon) using either the projected beam itself or a single auxiliary <b>laser</b> <b>illuminator</b> beam.

40|$|High-power lasers {{are useful}} {{instruments}} suitable for applications in various fields; {{the most common}} industrial applications include cutting and welding. We propose a new application of high-power laser diodes as in-bulk heating source for food industry. Current heating processes use surface heating with different approaches to make the heat distribution more uniform and the process more efficient. High-power lasers can in theory provide in-bulk heating which can sufficiently increase the uniformity of heat distribution thus making the process more efficient. We chose two media (vegetable fat and glucose) for feasibility experiments. First, we checked if the media have necessary absorption coefficients on the wavelengths of commercially available laser diodes (940 - 980 nm). This was done using spectrophotometer at 700 - 1100 nm which provided the dependences of transmission from the wavelength. The results indicate that vegetable fat has noticeable transmission dip around 925 nm and glucose has sufficient dip at 990 nm. Then, after the feasibility check, we did numerical simulation of the heat distribution in bulk using finite elements method. Based on the results, optimal <b>laser</b> wavelength and <b>illuminator</b> configuration were selected.
