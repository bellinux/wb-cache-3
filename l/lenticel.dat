He forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen, John Burns and Bradlaugh. Besides, he reflected, the glimpse {{of the rest of}} the slip he had had was, after all, quite accidental, forced upon him by chance, a kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage. It was not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of Broome, who believed in the efficacy of prayer, to pray daily for a first-class. [...] "Five minutes more," [...] said the demonstrator, folding up his paper and becoming observant. Hill watched the clock hands until two minutes remained; then he opened the book of answers, and, with hot ears and an affectation of ease, gave his drawing of the <b>lenticel</b> its name.|$|E
60|$|Then, slowly, {{he turned}} his head. The {{professor}} {{was out of the}} room; the demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum, reading the Q. Jour. Mi. Sci.; the rest of the examinees were busy, and with their backs to him. Should he own up to the accident now? He knew quite clearly what the thing was. It was a <b>lenticel,</b> a characteristic preparation from the elder-tree. His eyes roved over his intent fellow-students, and Wedderburn suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his eyes. The mental excitement that had kept Hill at an abnormal pitch of vigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension. His book of answers was beside him. He did not write down what the thing was, but with one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it. His mind was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung upon him. Should he identify it? or should he leave this question unanswered? In that case Wedderburn would probably come out first in the second result. How could he tell now whether he might not have identified the thing without shifting it? It was possible that Wedderburn had failed to recognise it, of course. Suppose Wedderburn too had shifted the slide? He looked up at the clock. There were fifteen minutes in which to make up his mind. He gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he used in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat.|$|E

40|$|Lenticels are {{macroscopic}} openings occurring on {{the surface}} of roots, shoots and some fruits like apples, pears, avocados and mangos and are responsible for gaseous exchange and transpiration. The discolouration of the lenticels of some mango cultivars is a serious problem, affecting the economic value of the fruit, especially in ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ while problems with <b>lenticel</b> discolouration are seldom found in ‘Kent’. Mango fruit lenticels develop from ruptured stomata on fruit from about 20 mm in ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ and 30 to 40 mm in ‘Kent’. Lenticels enlarge as the fruit grows due to stretching of the fruit surface, reaching their maximum size on adult fruit. Fully developed lenticels of ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ are larger in size than those of ‘Kent’. ‘Kent’ lenticels are also better insulated than ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’, having a thick cuticle in the <b>lenticel</b> cavity and in some instances a phellogen is also present, while both of above mentioned characteristics are absent in ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’. Resin present in the skin of the fruit {{plays an important role in}} the discolouration of ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ lenticels. The resin of both ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ fruit contain a considerable amount of an aggressive compound termed terpenes. These terpenes are volatile and are able to move out of the resin ducts via the sublenticellular cells to the outside of the fruit through the lenticels. The integrity of tonoplasts of the sublenticellular cells are lost due to the action of the terpenes, causing vacuolar bound phenols to come into contact with polyphenol oxidase present in the cell walls. The product of the resultant reaction is a quinone accumulating as a brownish deposit in the cell walls, visible from the outside as black markings around the lenticels. <b>Lenticel</b> discolouration may, however also occur due to maltreatment or rough handling of fruit, high temperatures in the warm water bath, extended brushing on packline or breaking of the cold chain and spilling of resin onto the surface of the fruit.

Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the cause-effect relationship between the ability to form morphological adaptations (hypertrophied <b>lenticels</b> and adventitious roots) and the capacity to maintain high assimilation rate and growth. Methods The occurrence of morphological adaptations and the parameters of photosynthesisweremonitored over 20 days of waterlogging in 5 -week-old pedunculate oak seedlings presenting similar morphological development. Results Based on the development or not of morphological adaptations, the following three categories of responses were identified: development of hypertrophied <b>lenticels</b> and adventitious roots, development of hypertrophied <b>lenticels</b> alone, and the lack of development of adaptive structures. These categories, ranked in the order given, corresponded to decreasing levels of initial net CO 2 assimilation rate growth and photosynthesis parameters observed during waterlogging. Conclusion We observed a two-way cause-effect relationship between the capacity to form adaptive structures and the assimilation rate. Indeed, the initial assimilation rate determined the occurrence of hypertrophied <b>lenticels</b> and growth during stress, and then the development of morphological adaptations enhanced the ability to maintain assimilation levels during the stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{symbiosis}} between legume {{plants and}} rhizobia causes {{the development of}} new organs, nodules which function as an apparatus for nitrogen fixation. In this study, the roles of auxin in nodule development in Lotus japonicus have been demonstrated using molecular genetic tools and auxin inhibitors. The expression of an auxin-reporter GH 3 fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) was analyzed in L. japonicus roots, and showed a strong signal in the central cylinder of the root, whereas upon rhizobium infection, generation of GUS signal was observed at the dividing outer cortical cells during the first nodule cell divisions. When nodules were developed to maturity, strong GUS staining was detected in vascular tissues of nodules, suggesting distinct auxin involvement in the determinate nodule development. Numbers and the development of nodules were affected by auxin transport inhibitors (1 -naphthylphthalamic acid, NPA and triindobenzoic acid, TIBA), and by a newly synthesized auxin antagonist, α-(phenyl ethyl- 2 -one) -indole- 3 -acetic acid (PEO-IAA). The common phenotypical alteration by these auxin inhibitors was the inhibition in forming <b>lenticel</b> which is normally developed on the nodule surface from the root outer cortex. The inhibition of <b>lenticel</b> formation was correlated with the inhibition of nodule vascular bundle development.

40|$|Common scab, {{caused by}} plant {{pathogenic}} Streptomyces sp., {{is a major}} soil and tuber borne bacterial disease of potato. Whilst the disease seldom affects tuber yield, infections produce unsightly blemishes on tubers that reduce their value. It causes significant economic losses in the fresh, processing and seed market sectors of the potato industry. Despite several decades of research activity, no single measure has been developed that is able to provide effective control of this disease and comhlon scab therefore remains {{a serious threat to}} the potato production throughout the potato growing areas of the world. This project investigated links between tuber structural attributes and susceptibility to infection, an area of study under-represented in the literature and offering potential to deliver new knowledge on common scab disease that may lead to improved approaches to disease management. A series of experiments was conducted under field, glasshouse and hydroponic conditions to investigate changes in morphology and anatomy of the potato tuber. Inoculation treatments were developed to investigate relationships between structural features at the time of inoculation and the subsequent levels of infection. A novel hydroponic system was developed that allowed inoculation of individual tubers at specific times or stages of development and permitted non-destructive observation of the development of common scab symptoms. A second novel system involved the use of netting in potting bags to separate tubers from the root zone and allowed inoculation at different times during plant growth. This system facilitated study of the pathogen infection window on the tubers, and pathogen-induced structural changes in the tubers, under glasshouse conditions. Field studies were undertaken in 12 commercial crops across a range of production environments, and utilised seed from a single source to allow assessment of site effects on tuber development and disease incidence. Many tuber anatomical and morphological features (stomata and <b>lenticel</b> number, periderm thickness, <b>lenticel</b> structure, pattern of suberisation and internode expansion rate on the tubers) were found to be highly variable under different field and glasshouse conditions, and significant variability within crops/treatments was also observed. <b>Lenticel</b> diameter was determined by growmg environment, but other structural features varied as much between tubers within sites or treatments as between sites or treatments. Given the sporadic nature of occurrence of common scab symptoms within and between crops, the observations of variation in structural features was sufficient to indicate that anatomical features could be playing a role in susceptibility to infection. Detailed study of <b>lenticel</b> development on tubers revealed that two pathways of <b>lenticel</b> formation exist in potato tubers. Formation of lenticels from stomata, the commonly accepted pathway in the literature, occurred on all tubers, but when tubers expanded rapidly, lenticels were found to have also formed directly from peridermal rupture. In most tubers, the majority of lenticels were concluded to have formed from this second pathway. The initiation of <b>lenticel</b> formation in both pathways was shown to be via localised zones of increased cell division in the phellem layer, placing pressure on the outer cell layers and leading to rupture of the periderm. Continued cell division and expansion under the rupture site creates the characteristic raised lenticular shaped structure of a mature <b>lenticel.</b> Suberization in lenticels was observed to occur very late m Luber development in most glasshouse and hydroponically grown tubers, and lenticels with no suberisation were found in mature tubers under all growing conditions in the project. No relationship was found between tuber anatomical features at the time of exposure to the pathogen and either incidence or severity of common scab symptoms. While trends were observed within trials, when data from all experiments were examined there was no structural attribute that was consistently present or absent in treatments that induced high levels of common scab symptoms. Under field conditions, suberisation in the periderm was noted in young tubers in crops that subsequently developed high incidence of common scab, but under glasshouse conditions nonsuberized tubers at the point of inoculation were found to be highly susceptible to the disease. No evidence was found of increased suberisation in lenticels during tuber maturation being associated with reduced susceptibility to infection, with the timing of suberisation varying markedly between trials and in many conditions not recorded until very late in tuber development. The window of tuber susceptibility to common scab disease infection was shown to vary with the season or conditions under which the plants were grown. In addition, the first direct evidence that different intemodes on tubers were susceptible to infection at different times during tuber development was produced. Basal intemodes, which are the first sections of the tuber to expand, are susceptible earliest in tuber development with apical intemodes only becoming susceptible later in tuber growth by which time the basal intemodes are no longer susceptible. Basal intemodes in older tubers, which were less susceptible to common scab infection, were shown to rapidly produce additional phellem cell layers when exposed to the pathogen, whereas the same internodes in young, susceptible tubers were slower to respond. A pathogen-induced suberin deposition in phellem and filling cells was observed in less susceptible tubers in addition to the increased thickness and number of cell layers in the phellem. This result suggested that the phellem layer rather than the lenticels may be involved in common scab infection, with infection occurring directly through the periderm, as suggested by Loria et al. (2003), rather than through the lenticels as suggested by most other authors. This project has contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the role and relationships between pre-existing or induced structural features of the tuber and common scab disease infection of potato. Further investigations on the role of phellem layers in disease infection and pathogen-induced phellem layer responses are recommended...|$|E
