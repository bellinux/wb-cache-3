40|$|A polyacrylonitrile-based {{carbon fiber}} {{modified}} with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was prepared in this paper. Three chitosan derivatives, phthaloyl chitosan (PhthCS), naphthoyl chitosan and carboxymethyl chitosan, {{were used for}} surface treatments of MWNTs {{in order to improve}} their dispersion and stability. Acidizing MWNTs and original MWNTs were also used for comparison with the MWNTs treated with chitosan derivatives. Results indicate that the dispersion and stability of PhthCS-MWNTs were improved significantly in those solvents possessed of polarity from 6 to 10. The effects of molecular weight and concentration of PhthCS on the dispersion stability of the MWNTs were evaluated. Results of transmission electron microscopy and element analysis of the MWNTs reveal that part of MWNTs' surfaces are coated by a layer of PhthCS with the thickness of 5 similar to 10 nm, which changes the surface properties and dispersion stability of the MWNTs. A composite PhthCS-MWNTs/carbon fiber was fabricated through gel-spinning, preoxidation, <b>low-temperature</b> <b>carbonization</b> and high-temperature carbonization. SEM results exhibit that the PhthCS-MWNTs dispersed uniformly and oriented preferentially within the composite fibers, which led to improved mechanical properties of the composite carbon fiber.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research program was to demonstrate EnerTech�s and the Energy & Environmental Research Center�s (EERC) process of slurry carbonization for producing homogeneous, pumpable titels from refuse-derived fuel (RDF) with continuous pilot plant facilities, and to characterize flue gas and ash emissions from combustion of the carbonizd RDF slurry fuel. Please note that �Wet Thermal Oxidation� is EnerTech�s trademark mme for combustion of the carbonized RDF slurry fuel. Carbonized RDF slurry fuels were produced with the EERC�S 7. 5 -tpd (wet basis) pilot plant facility. A hose diaphragm pump pressurized a 7 - lo-wt% feed RDF slurry, with a viscosity of 500 cP, to approximately 2500 psig. The pressurized RDF slurry was heated by indirect heat exchangers to between 5850 - 626 �F, and its temperature and pressure was maintained in a downflow reactor. The carbonized slurry was flashed, concentrated in a filter press, and ground in an attritor. During operation of the pilot plant, samples of the feed RDF slurry, <b>carbonization</b> <b>gas,</b> condensate, carbonized solids, and filtrate were taken and analyzed. Pilot-scale slurry carbonization experiments with RDF produced a homogeneous pumpable slurry fuel with a higher heating value (HHV) of 3, 000 - 6, 600 Btu/lb (as-received basis), at a viscosity of 500 CP at 100 Hz decreasing, and ambient temperature. Greater-heating-value slurry fuels were produced at higher slurry carbonization temperatures. During slurry carbonization, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics in the feed RDF also decompose to form hydrochloric acid and salts.

It should be emphasized that molecular hydrogen is an energy carrier but not a primary energy resource, and thus H 2 must be produced using other energy resource. By energy and atomic hydrogen sources, hydrogen can be produced from coal (gasification, <b>carbonization),</b> natural <b>gas</b> and propane gas (steam reforming, partial oxidation, autothermal reforming, plasma reforming), petroleum fractions (dehydrocyclization and aromatization, oxidative steam reforming, pyrolytic decomposition), biomass (gasification, steam reforming, biological conversion), and water (electrolysis, photocatalytic conversion, chemical and catalytic conversion).

40|$|Membranes {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} separation processes, particularly for gas separation and desalination processes. To develop membrane materials with improved permeability, selectivity can achieve more energy-efficient membrane separations and reduce costs. Since composite membranes offer improved performance, {{the aim of this}} research is to develop polymer-based composite membranes with improved performance for gas separation and water desalination applications. First, in order to obtain a composite membranes with high chlorine tolerance, a carbonaceous poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) composite membrane was synthesized at a low temperature carbonation by formation and post-treatment of a thin PFA layer on porous polymer substrates. The carbonaceous PFA membrane exhibits high selectivity and excellent chemical stability in seawater desalination. The <b>low-temperature</b> <b>carbonization</b> method developed in this study is promising for developing a wide range of other carbonaceous polymer composite membranes for water desalination. Next, in order to apply PFA to other applications, understanding the effects of polymerization conditions on the properties of the PFA composite membrane is required. The PFA membrane was fully characterized in terms of microstructure and separation properties. Suitable synthesis conditions for the preparation of PFA composite membranes with smooth surfaces and uniform structure were (1) FA/ H 2 SO 4 molar ratios: 74 - 300, (2) polymerization temperatures: 80 - 100 °C and (3) solvents: ethanol and acetone. The preparation conditions were also optimized. The PFA composite membrane prepared with a FA/ H 2 SO 4 molar ratio of 250, a polymerization temperature of 80 °C and with ethanol as the solvent exhibited the highest H 2 /N 2 ideal selectivity (αH 2 /N 2 = 24. 9), and a H 2 permeability of 206 Barrers. This work led {{to a better understanding of}} the effect of the preparation procedures on the membrane performance. In order to investigate the effects of the incorporation of molecular sieve nanoparticles on the membrane structure and membrane performance, silicalite-poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) mixed matrix composite membranes were successfully synthesized based on the best synthesis condition obtained previously. The silicalite-PFA mixed matrix composite membrane with 20 % w/w silicalite loading had a high ideal selectivity (αo 2 /N 2 = 3. 5 and αco 2 /N 2 = 5. 4) and a good permeability (Po 2 = 821. 2, Pco 2 = 1263. 7, PN 2 = 233. 3 Barrers) at room temperature. This membrane can be a good candidate for oxygen enrichment applications. Finally, in order to investigate the effects of the incorporation of silicalite nanocrystals on the desalination property of polyamide membranes, silicalite nanocrystals were also incorporated into polyamide matrix to synthesize silicalite-polyamide mixed matrix membranes. With an increase in the loading of silicalite nanocrystals, the water flux of silicalite-polyamide mixed matrix composite membranes increased whereas the salt selectivity significantly decreased. The silicalite-polyamide mixed matrix composite membrane prepared from TMC-hexane with 0. 5 % (w/v) silicalite had water flux of 2. 7 × 10 - 6 m 3 /m 2 ·s and NaCl rejection of 50 % at a feed pressure of 34. 5 bar which 2000 ppm salt solution was used as the feed. The silicalite-polyamide mixed matrix composite membrane is promising for developing high water flux composite membranes for water desalination. In this research, composite membranes with improved permeability, selectivity and chemical resistance were successfully synthesized for desalination and gas separation. For desalination, carbonaceous PFA composite membranes with high chlorine tolerance and silicalite-PA mixed matrix composite membranes with high salt rejection and water flux were successfully obtained. For gas separation, an optimized composite membranes PFA synthesis condition was found and silicalite-PFA mixed matrix composite membranes with high O 2 /N 2 separation were successfully synthesized...|$|R
