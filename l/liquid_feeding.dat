40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} experiments on pulse induction by cycling the <b>liquid</b> <b>feed</b> {{in a column}} of 3. 2 m height. Based on a square-wave cycled <b>liquid</b> <b>feed,</b> two feed strategies are developed that involve the artificial induction of natural pulses and a separation of the wetting efficiency in time. The feed strategies aim at increasing the mass transfer rate of the limiting reactant and to prevent flow maldistribution and hot spot formation. The feed strategies are categorized upon a relatively fast and slow cycling of the <b>liquid</b> <b>feed.</b> The potential consequences of the developed feed strategies on reactor performance are evaluated. Cycling the <b>liquid</b> <b>feed</b> results {{in the formation of}} continuity shock waves in the column. The shock waves decay by leaving liquid behind their tail. This decaying process limits the frequency of the cycled <b>liquid</b> <b>feed</b> to rather low values since at relatively high frequencies, total collapse of the shock waves occurs. By the induction of natural pulses inside the shock waves, the integral mass and heat transfer rates during the liquid flush will be improved. Shorter flushes can therefore be applied and the usual encountered periodic operation is optimized. This feed strategy is termed the slow mode of liquid-induced pulsing flow. The second feed strategy termed the fast mode of liquid-induced pulsing flow may be viewed as an extension of natural pulsing flow. Individual natural pulses are induced at an externally set pulse frequency less than 1 Hz. This feed strategy is the only fast mode of periodic operation possible since pulses are stable while shock waves decay. The characteristics of the induced pulses equal the pulse characteristics of natural pulsing flow at equivalent gas flow rates.

The RDG (Rappaz Drezet Gremaud) criterion for the appearance of hot tears in metallic alloys [1] is based upon a mass balance performed over the liquid and solid phases and accounts for the tensile deformation of the solid skeleton perpendicular to the growing den-drites and for the induced interdendritic <b>liquid</b> <b>feeding.</b> When tackling the problem of hot tearing in welding of aluminium alloys, the RDG criterion can be used at three levels of increasing complexity by: − ranking the alloy with regards to their sensitivity to hot cracking − studying the risk of hot tearing in the process using only the thermal field (thermal criterion), − and studying the influence of the mechanical behaviour of the mushy alloy on the risk of hot cracking (thermo-mechanical criterion). Each level is illustrated by an example dealing with laser beam welding.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the effect of {{periodic}} <b>liquid</b> <b>feeding</b> on trickle bed fluid mechanical and mass transfer characteristics and on the effect of packing particle shape by comparing data obtained with cylindrical extrudates and with spherical particles. Cylindrical-extrudate particles are employed to study air-water downflow (steady trickling flow) in a packed bed of 14 cm i. d. The effect of particle shape, neglected in the literature so far, is shown to be very significant. A packed bed of extrudates displays significantly greater global dynamic liquid holdup hd and pressure drop, as well as a trickling-to-pulsing transition boundary at higher gas flow rates, compared to beds of spheres of comparable size. Moreover, packed extrudates exhibit a significant increase of holdup, hd, in the axial flow direction, a trend reported {{for the first time as}} there are no similar data available in the literature; on the contrary beds of spherical particles are characterized by practically constant hd in the axial direction. Although an explanation for this hd axial variation is not obvious, one might attribute it to the anisotropy and non-uniformity of interstitial voids of packed cylindrical particles. Comparisons are reported with literature methods for predicting the measured parameters; discrepancies between data and predictions may be partly due to the inadequacy of a single “equivalent” diameter to represent both shape and size of non-spherical particles; predictive methods performing best are also identified. Periodic <b>liquid</b> <b>feeding</b> is investigated – at sufficiently high frequencies to be classified as “fast” mode of induced pulsing – in the range of mean gas and liquid flow rates corresponding to the steady “trickling flow” regime. Detailed information is obtained, on the axial propagation and attenuation of pulses, from instantaneous, cross-sectionally averaged holdup measurements. Key fluid-mechanical parameters studied include, aside from dynamic holdup and pressure drop, pulse celerity and intensity, as a function of fluid feed rates (G, L) and liquid cyclic frequency. Data from previous work for 6 mm glass spheres and 3 mm spheroid particles, are employed for comparison; it is shown that, for the particles examined, particle-size has a pronounced effect, but not as significant as that of particle shape. For particles of comparable volume, the cylindrical shape is associated with much greater global dynamic holdup and pressure drop, and with increased pulse attenuation. Moreover, packed extrudates exhibit a significant increase of holdup in the axial direction, as in the case of steady trickling flow. For spherical particles, both time-average holdup and pulse celerity are practically constant along the bed for fixed liquid and gas flow rates. Pressure drop, global holdup and pulse celerity are not affected by cyclic <b>liquid</b> <b>feeding</b> frequency, for both spherical and cylindrical extrudate particles. For the mass transfer study, experiments aimed at determining local and global liquid/solid mass transfer rates, mainly for the so-called fast mode of periodic <b>liquid</b> <b>feeding.</b> Uniform 6 mm spheres and cylindrical extrudates, of 1. 5 mm diameter and a narrow distribution of lengths, are employed in the tests. For completeness, results are also reported for single-phase (liquid) and trickling flow through the same packed beds. A well-known electrochemical technique is employed to measure instantaneous local mass transfer coefficients by means of quite a few probes distributed throughout the bed. The hydrodynamic characteristics under the above conditions, are helpful in interpreting the new mass transfer data. There is a wide spread of measured local mass transfer rates, in all cases tested, apparently due to packing and flow non-uniformities. This spread is much smaller in the case of packed uniform spheres. In general, the benefits of cyclic <b>liquid</b> <b>feeding</b> are more evident in the packed bed of spheres than in that of cylindrical extrudates; for instance, with increasing mean liquid rate, induced pulsing tends to reduce the spread of local mass transfer coefficients, which suggests that more uniform fluids distribution is promoted. Other trends of local mass transfer rates are identified and discussed in relation to measured variation of liquid holdup, under the same conditions. For packed spheres, the measured global mass transfer rates are in fair agreement with literature correlations obtained for the trickling flow regime, unlike the case of packed extrudates where significant discrepancies are observed. In conclusion, imposed pulsing flow appears to promote a uniform distribution of fluids in the packing characteristics. Moreover, for comparable particle size and mean packing void fraction ε, the uniform spherical shape displays clear advantages over the cylindrical extrudates, both with respect to fluid mechanical parameters and to mass transfer rates. ...|$|E
