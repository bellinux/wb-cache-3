40|$|<b>Lombazole</b> had {{no effect}} on {{respiration}} at any tested concentration and had little effect on the K+ permeability of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Of the major metabolic processes investigated in this bacterium, only de novo synthesis of the cell envelope was inhibited by <b>lombazole</b> well in advance of an effect on growth. The time course of inhibition indicated that <b>lombazole</b> exerted its primary effect via inhibition of lipid synthesis; other induced changes, such as reduced synthesis of lipoteichoic acid and cell wall components, were considered to be secondary effects. Although the precise site of action in S. epidermidis has to be established, the absence of alterations in lipid patterns after treatment with <b>lombazole</b> suggests the toxicant may affect an essential step in lipid biosynthesis. In Candida albicans, <b>lombazole</b> inhibited the sterol C- 14 demethylation step in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lombazole,</b> an {{antimicrobial}} {{agent of the}} imidazole class, induced profound ultrastructural changes in Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans, as observed by freeze fracture electron microscopy. In S. epidermidis cells, the primary effect on ultrastructure was characterized by a distinct change in the morphology of the plasma membrane. Secondary effects of <b>lombazole</b> were cell wall thickening, accumulations of lipidlike material, abnormal cell division, severe change of shape, separation of the plasma membrane from the cell wall, and disruption of cells. The alterations in C. albicans were characterized by the deformation of {{and a decrease in}} the number of invaginations in the protoplasmic fracture face and corresponding ridges on the exoplasmic fracture face and by separation of the plasma membrane from the cell wall, leaving a gap which frequently contained small vesicles. Moreover, a considerable thickening of the cell wall occurred at localized regions. These structural alterations are discussed in relation to biochemical changes which may correlate with these phenomena...|$|E
