40|$|International audienceNative tree {{populations have}} been {{fragmented}} by anthropogenic disturbance worldwide, leaving {{them at risk}} from extinction. The possibility of sizable recovery of fragmented populations {{is a function of}} their dispersal, the abiotic conditions, and the biotic interactions. The relative importance of these three drivers for the recruitment rate of a fragmented population of the late-successional Fagus sylvatica L. was analysed at the landscape scale in Causse du Larzac, southern margins of the Massif Central, in the South of France. We used regression models on observational data to analyse the response of Fagus recruitment rate to the distance to the nearest mature population, to climatic and geological variables, and to variables describing biotic interactions (pine vs. grassland, <b>light,</b> <b>shrub</b> cover). Distance to the nearest F. sylvatica adult population was the most important explanatory variable. Recruitment rate was also influenced by facilitative biotic interactions with shrubs, and by the climatic conditions of the plot. Recruitment occurred at a greater distance from the nearest mature population of Fagus in pine forests than in grassland. Dispersal was the major limitation to recruitment of F. sylvatica in this landscape. The recruitment rate was then modulated by the climate and positive biotic interactions. The activity of the European jay could be of great importance for such fragmented populations, because it can lead to long-distance dispersal events and may result in a preferential dispersal towards pine forests...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} century, woody plants and shrubs have {{increased}} in abundance {{at the expense of}} grasslands in many semiarid regions. The availability and concentrations of nutrients influence the relative success of plants, but the effects of fire frequency on soil nutrients is unknown for semiarid grasslands. On the gunnery ranges of Fort Huachuca in southeastern Arizona, study sites were established {{to examine the effects of}} fire frequency on soil biogeochemistry, plant biochemistry, and δ¹³C values in soil organic matter (SOM). The sites were on homogeneous granitic alluvium where wildfire frequency history is known from 1973 to present and no cattle grazing has occurred in recent decades. Subplots represent fire frequencies of no burns, 3 fires per decade, and 5 fires per decade. The "no burn" plot has abundant C 3 Prosopis velentina (mesquite) trees, whereas the burned plots are open C 4 -dominated grasslands with scattered mesquite trees. Prosopis trees have altered SOM pools by the concentration of plant nutrients and the addition of isotopically <b>light</b> <b>shrub</b> litter. Frequent fires have altered the basic geochemistry and nutrient availabilities of the soil, and the changes appear to be significant enough to affect plant growth. Soil pH increases with burning frequency, and TOC, total nitrogen, and plant-available phosphorus show significant increases on the infrequently burned plot. Burning is advantageous for preservation or restoration of grasslands, as total living grass biomass is greater on the two burned plots. Root biomass 11 is significantly lower on the "frequently burned" plot. Concentrations of the key nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are reduced in plants on the burned sites compared to plants on the unburned site. Fires help re-distribute nutrients but evidence of nutrient concentrations and δ¹³C values are retained in SOM for many decades. Estimates of bulk carbon turnover rates range from 112 to 504 years. Evidence for modern C 3 shrub expansion is found in the shift of SOM δ¹³C values from values characteristic of C 4 grasses to C 3 shrubs in surface soil layers. δ¹³CSOM values indicate that the Holocene and Late Pleistocene were dominated by C 4 grasslands, and the pre-Late Pleistocene vegetation was a C 4 -grass savanna with abundant C 3 plants...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWildland {{fires are}} driven by the heat {{transferred}} from the fire source to the unburned fuel bed and this transfer {{is likely to be}} affected by the spatial heterogeneity of fuel element distributions at different scales from shoot to stand. In a context of theoretical fire modelling, we investigated the impact of a departure from randomness of fuel distributions on the radiative transfer of energy. Our methodology was derived from the approach developed for solar radiation in heterogeneous canopies or clouds and was modified to suit an analysis of fire behaviour. Some fine and coarse fuel distributions for several Mediterranean fuel types were derived from field measurements and plant architecture modelling. A comparison of the average irradiances in different fuels showed whether heterogeneity effects were significant or not. Results showed that both marked spatial variability in fuel distribution (low cover fraction and large clumps) and a high vegetation density were required to provide significant effects. The radiative transfer in heterogeneous maritime pines and in dense shrub stands was significantly affected by heterogeneity, mainly at crown and shoot scales. Less pronounced effects were observed in Aleppo pine stand and <b>light</b> <b>shrubs.</b> In terms of fuel modelling, the 2 -m resolution used in a fire model such as FIRETEC seems to be sufficient for the fuel types investigated here, with the exception of dense small clumps in shrublands.

40|$|Young {{stands in}} urban forests often lack a shrub layer, though shrubs play an {{important}} structural and biological role in forests. All layers {{interact with one another}} to form a multilayered stand, in which shrubs have a vital role. In this diploma thesis, theoretical models for forest dynamics are compared with four reference stands to detect factors, and principals for introduction of shrubs in young stands. In these stands four different ways of introduction were found. In one trees and shrubs were planted together at the same time. Shrubs spontaneous spread under a canopy of mature forest, in another. In a third stand an open shrubland became overgrown by trees into a forest. In the fourth stand the shrublayer was actively planted into a young forest. Shrubs constitution and growing properties decide in which stand they are able to establish. Different types of shrub have different tolerances to light and shadow. This makes them suitable for different types of <b>light</b> conditions. <b>Shrubs</b> with longitudinal length growth characteristics, is likely to compete with trees to seek <b>light.</b> While <b>shrubs</b> with lateral or bastion growth will be broaden in shape. Shrublayer is formed in a late stage of the theoretical models that describes natural forest development. One model calls this the understorey reinitiations stage. These light conditions are what one has to obtain to introduce shrubs in a younger stand. One needs to clear a stand to get the properties of an older stage, if one wants to establish a shrub layer. A stable multilayered stand with a vital shrub layer is possible to create in a young stand, that doesn't need constant management. Such a stand can provide structural-and biological amenities for urban recreation despite it's young age...|$|R

40|$|Shrub {{expansion}} in herbaceous ecosystems {{is emerging as}} an important ecological response to global change, especially in mesic systems where increases in canopy biomass are greatest. Two consequences of woody encroachment are increases in belowground resources, such as carbon and nitrogen, and reductions in above-ground resources such as light, which affect diversity, community trajectory, and ecosystem function. My objective was to determine how expansion of the nitrogen-fixing shrub Morella cerifera affected the resource environment across a chronosequence of shrub expansion on a Virginia barrier island. I quantified changes in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling, canopy structure and understory light associated with M. cerifera expansion. Litterfall in shrub thickets exceeded litterfall for other woody communities in the same region, and due to high N concentration, resulted in a return {{of as much as}} 169 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 to the soil, 70 % of which was from symbiotic N fixation. Litter and soil C and N pools were 3 - 10 times higher in shrub thickets than in adjacent grasslands. Understory <b>light</b> in <b>shrub</b> thickets decreased to as low as 0. 5 % of above-canopy <b>light.</b> Sunflecks in <b>shrub</b> thickets were shorter, smaller and less intense than sunflecks in forest understories. However, relative to other shrub species such as Elaeagnus umbellata, M. cerifera was less efficient at intercepting light. Although M. cerifera had the highest leaf area index (LAI) of five shrub species studied, M. cerifera was relatively inefficient at light attenuation due to low levels of branching, steep leaf angles and a relatively shallow canopy. The shift from grassland to shrub thicket on barrier islands, and in other mesic systems, results in a significant change in canopy structure that alters understory resource availability and greatly alters ecosystem function and trajectory...|$|R

We examined the understory of an old-growth mixed-conifer Sierran forest and its distribution in relation to microsite conditions.

Using overstory tree cover and microsite environmental conditions, four habitats were identified; tree cluster, partial canopy, gap, and rock/shallow soil. Herb and shrub species were strongly linked with habitats. Soil moisture, litter depth and diffuse light were the most significant environmental gradients influencing understory plant distribution. Herb cover was most strongly influenced by soil moisture. Shrub cover is associated with more diffuse light, less direct light, and sites with lower soil moisture. Herb richness is most affected by conditions which influence soil moisture.

Our aim {{was to assess the}} use of shelterwoods in Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) woodlands in southern France to promote the survival and growth of two co-occurring oak species: the deciduous Quercus pubescens and the evergreen Quercus ilex. Twelve Aleppo pine stands were selected and differentially thinned to create a light shelterwood (G = 32 m 2 /ha, irradiance 13 %), a medium shelterwood (G = 19 m 2 /ha, irradiance 33 %) and a dense shelterwood (G = 10 m 2 /ha, irradiance 52 %). A total of 1248 sowing points, half composed of Q. pubescens and half of Q. ilex, were then set up in these three conditions. Seedling survival and growth were monitored for three years and plant stress was assessed by measuring predawn leaf potential and photosynthetic performance through the Fv ∕Fm ratio. Soil moisture was also recorded at two depths during two growing seasons. Survival was high for both species in all three conditions due to three consecutive wet years. The lowest survival was recorded for Q. pubescens in the dense shelterwoods. Growth in diameter and height increased from the dense to the <b>light</b> shelterwoods. <b>Shrubs</b> developed more strongly in the light shelterwood, and increasing shrub cover enhanced height growth. Photosynthetic performance was lowest for Q. pubescens in dense shelterwoods and highest in light shelterwoods, whereas the reverse was true for Q. ilex. The lowest predawn potentials were recorded in the dense shelterwoods even though higher soil water content values were measured in this treatment during the summer drought. We show that light shelterwoods were more beneficial to growth than denser ones, indicating control by light availability during the three years of the study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} seedling recruitment beneath kanuka forest at Tiromoana Bush, North Canterbury. The regeneration of broadleaved tree species is evident throughout Tiromoana Bush. This research aimed to quantify the biotic and abiotic factors influencing the distribution of small and large seedlings of canopy tree species, their relative growth rates, their survival, abundance and composition throughout the forest understorey of Tiromoana Bush. Tiromoana Bush is a forest restoration area of 410 hectares adjacent to the Kate Valley landfill. To determine the future tree species composition at Tiromoana Bush, seedling recruitment, growth and survival was quantified through remeasuring tagged seedlings in 26 permanent vegetation monitoring plots located in the major forest patches at Tiromoana Bush. In addition, seedling data from 78 temporary vegetation survey plots established in three major forest patches were used to assess the influence of different factors on seedling abundance. At Tiromoana Bush, the most common canopy tree species as seedlings in the permanent vegetation monitoring plots was mahoe followed by fivefinger. Mahoe seedling density was significantly affected by canopy openness, distance to seed sources, <b>light</b> index, <b>shrub</b> cover and slope, but not by aspect, basal area and time. For fivefinger, seedlings increased in abundance with time, but the difference was not statistically significant. The relative growth rate of mahoe in the 20 - 49 cm height class (in which most seedlings occurred) was significantly affected by <b>shrub</b> cover, <b>light</b> index and canopy vii openness. Mahoe seedling recruits were significantly affected by light index and canopy openness. Survivability of mahoe was affected by aspect. For fivefinger, individual relative growth rates were significantly affected by canopy openness and light index. Similar results were found for tree species seedlings present in the temporary survey plots provided with mahoe and fivefinger again the most common species, followed by kohuhu. Light index significantly affected golden akeake small seedlings as well as canopy openness. Light index significantly affected ngaio large seedling distribution. Aspect was the only significant factor for kohuhu large seedling distribution. Distance from seed sources significantly affected fivefinger small seedling distribution as seedlings are dependent upon dispersal away from the parent trees. Slope significantly affected the distribution of red matipou small seedlings. The most important environmental attribute influencing seedling abundance is light. This is evident in both the permanent seedling monitoring plots and the temporary vegetation survey plots.

40|$|Rapid {{colonization}} by invasive {{plants can}} lead to failures of wetland restoration, particularly in forested wetlands where mature plant communities are slow to develop. To develop more effective methods for reducing the spread of invasive plants, I tested the hypothesis that planting native shrubs {{during the early stages}} of wetland creation can provide an alternative to herbicides by enhancing competition for light and other resources with invasive herbaceous plants, such as Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass). Planting native shrub live stakes in two created forested wetlands in Western New York State, USA, increased overall native herbaceous plant cover and biodiversity relative to plots without shrubs over a four-year period. Invasive species richness was lowest in plots containing Cephalanthus occidentalis, while other planting combinations showed lower invasive species richness but less difference in invasive species richness relative to neighboring plots without shrubs. This finding was confirmed in a controlled greenhouse experiment, where shrubs limited growth of P. arundinacea, without negative reciprocal effects on the shrubs. One mechanism for the reduction in invasive plant cover was likely the significantly reduced <b>light</b> availability beneath <b>shrubs.</b> Shrub health varied among species over time, with a substantial reduction in survivorship following a winter with extreme low temperatures. Overall health was highest for the winter-hardy shrub species C. occidentalis. All species tested had higher survival rates and health assessment when planted in single-species plots rather than in combination with other shrub species and plantings in varying hydrological settings indicated that C. occidentalis and Cornus amomum drier soil than Salix sericea.

One omnipresent form of habitat modification is the creation of transmission lines by electricity distribution companies. Due to safety concerns, the vegetation beneath electricity transmission lines is maintained at young succession stages by frequent cutting. Data was collected from 51 study sites in the south east Norway. All the sites were situated in forests intersected by a power-line corridor, and represent a range of boreal forest types. I focused on plant responses that may be of particular interest for managers, such as differences in plant community composition between the corridor and forest, total plant species richness and diversity, richness and relative abundance of some functional groups or single keystone species. Likewise, I focused on environmental factors that may be influenced by managers and planners. Greater diversity of species was found to exist in the power-line corridors compared to the interior of the forest. Specifically, I found an increase in richness and relative abundance of forbs, <b>shrubs,</b> <b>light</b> tolerant species and species preferring nutrient rich soils. Although some other species such as bilberry and mosses decreased in the corridors. More importantly, it suggests that the corridors are able to resist plant invasions and support a greater diversity of cultural landscape species. The site index was found to be highly significant in influencing the species composition of the corridor habitats. Total species richness and relative abundance of forbs, shrubs, and cultural landscape species increased with the site index, while the stage of succession and landscape heterogeneity also proved to be significant in shaping the species composition of the power-line corridors. Synthesis and applications. This study confirms that less severe forms of disturbance such as the creation of power-line corridors can cause species diversity to increase and as such provide an opportunity to conserve biodiversity in the face of increasing human land use changes.

40|$|University of Ph. D. dissertation. March 2012. Major: Natural Resources Science and Management. Advisors: Dr. Peter B. Reich and Dr. Lee E. Frelich. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 120 pages, appendices A-C. The upper Great Lakes region in central North America contains a forest transition zone where temperate and boreal tree species reach their {{northern and southern}} range limits, respectively. It is only within this narrow latitudinal band (~ 3 degrees), that relatively warm-adapted temperate and cold-adapted boreal tree species are found growing together in upland mesic sites. If climate is a main driver of forest dynamics within this region, recent and predicted climate change should result in major forest shifts, including the expansion of temperate species and range contraction of boreal species. Such changes should first be manifest in growth and abundance trends of tree species in the understory regeneration layers. In addition to climate, numerous other factors such as overstory composition, understory abiotic environment, competition with shrub and herbaceous layers, and browse pressure drive tree regeneration trends. Interrelationships and interactions among these drivers will ultimately determine the direction and rate of forest change. We explored these research topics through field studies of naturally established seedlings and saplings at 124 upland mesic forest sites across a three state (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan U. S. A) 170, 000 km 2 area of the temperate-boreal transition zone. Chapter 1 examined relative abundance shifts of temperate and boreal tree regeneration at two spatial scales: local ecotonal boundaries between temperate and boreal dominated stands and across the regional temperate-boreal transition zone. Because we compared understory performance across locally changing overstory composition, we calculated species regeneration success as the difference in relative abundance between the understory and overstory layers. At the local scale, both shade-tolerant temperate and boreal species exhibited positive tree regeneration success across ecotonal boundaries. However, across the region, regeneration performance varied with mean summer temperature {{and to a lesser}} extent mean annual precipitation. Changes in regeneration success were generally greatest at the warm end of the transition zone, with temperate broadleaf Acer saccharum, Fraxinus nigra, and Ostrya virginiana responding positively and boreal Abies balsamea showing significantly reduced performance. For the most frequent temperate species, Acer rubrum, regeneration success was greatest in boreal neighborhoods and at cool and dry sites. Other species did not exhibit detectable shifts in regeneration success, potentially due to traits such as shade-tolerance, palatability, and mode of reproduction. Overall we found that numerous tree species growing across the temperate-boreal transition zone are likely sensitive to climate at early stages of development, with observed shifts in regeneration success concomitant with the direction predicted in response to climate change. Chapter 2 assessed the relative importance of and interrelationships among explanatory variable sets in explaining the composition of the tree regeneration layer. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning to quantify the unique, shared, and total explanatory power of four sets of drivers: climate, understory abiotic environment, overstory composition, and understory biota. The results showed that all four driver sets individually explained a significant portion of tree regeneration compositional variation and additionally that there were strong relationships among explanatory variables. Overstory composition, which directly influences seed availability and also was found to be closely associated with understory environmental conditions and biota, had approximately twice the explanatory power of any of the other three driver sets. Some of the strongest individual drivers were overstory Acer saccharum and Populus tremuloides, soil pH, mean summer temperature, and mean annual precipitation. Suites of associated drivers included cool, moist, sandy, and acidic conditions; overstory boreal broadleaf species, <b>light</b> availability, <b>shrub</b> abundance, and forb cover; and warm temperatures and graminoid cover. Due to the strong interrelationships among drivers, the direction and rate of forest change will likely depend on how the importance of drivers shifts with climate and, for the biotic drivers, on the rate and magnitude of their own responses to climate change. Chapter 3 investigated sapling height and radial growth rates of five temperate and boreal species. This study included over 1700 stems of naturally established, competing saplings growing at 14 sites across the temperate-boreal transition zone. Top performing linear mixed-effects models typically included two-way interactions among mean summer temperature, browse pressure, understory light levels, and initial sapling size. As hypothesized, temperate sapling growth increased and boreal growth decreased with increasing temperatures. However, the relative performance of competing species shifted depending on the level of browse pressure. Positive temperate growth responses to temperature were eliminated by heavy browse pressure, tilting growth rates in favor of less palatable boreal conifers at all but the warmest sites. Spatial variations in browse pressure levels across the region suggest that temperate expansion may proceed most rapidly in areas where browsing is least intense. Growth responses to temperature also varied with sapling size and, for the least shade-tolerant species in the study, Quercus rubra, light availability. Enhanced growth by temperate species in response to warmer temperatures was most detectable under favorable conditions including low browse pressure and high understory light availability, suggesting that any efforts to facilitate forest compositional changes will need to take into account these trends...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the mutual {{interactions between the}} population dynamics of large herbivores and wood-pasture cycles in eutrophic wetlands. Therefore, habitat use and population dynamics of large herbivores, the effects of large herbivores on vegetation development, and the mutual interactions between vegetation development and herbivore population dynamics were studied in the eutrophic wetland the Oostvaardersplassen. At the Oostvaardersplassen cattle, horses and red deer were introduced in a fenced area with no predators, and population numbers are bottom-up controlled by food supply. The study showed that high densities of cattle, horses and red deer were able to break down woody vegetation and create grasslands. As the populations of large herbivores increased, {{the amount of the}} preferred grass available per animal decreased. This forced the large herbivores to use other food plants in other vegetation types, such as scrub, and transforming these into grasslands. In this way, the large herbivores facilitated high numbers of geese. As geese can clip the grass very short (< 2 cm), they forced the large herbivores even more to forage in alternative vegetation types. Cattle, the largest herbivore in the system, were the first to experience the negative consequences of this strong competition, and their numbers declined. This raises the question whether an assemblage of bottom-up regulated populations of cattle, horses and red deer, or other large herbivores, can sustainably coexist under these circumstances. The results of our modelling study and experiences in the field suggest that resource partitioning may be a more reliable mechanism for long term coexistence than temporal variability due to climatic extremes or disease outbreaks. The best way to provide opportunities for resource partitioning in the Oostvaardersplassen is to enlarge the area and connect it to other reserves in order to increase the heterogeneity of the grazed system. Although the results of our model suggest that weather variability and presence of geese gave minor opportunities for the coexistence of large herbivores, both factors were necessary for creating windows of opportunity for the establishment of thorny shrubs. Weather variability creates strong reductions of the large herbivore populations  while geese influence the maximum and minimum numbers, which are lower when geese are present. The effects of geese on the minimum numbers are small, but apparently sufficient to make the wood-pasture cycle operate. This raises another question whether a large predator, such as the wolf, could have similar effects on these ecosystems as the geese in the model. The impact of geese combined with a possible positive effect of wolves on wood-pasture cycles could perhaps increase the frequency of the windows of opportunity and increase the survival of established thorny shrubs. Until now, we have seen that a few conditions for the wood-pasture cycle are met by the herbivores. However, a few important requirements are not satisfied: (a) a temporary reduction of large herbivore numbers allowing the establishment of <b>light</b> demanding thorny <b>shrubs</b> and the development of thorny scrubland within the created grasslands; (b) the establishment of palatable trees within these thorny scrubs; (c) the formation of closed canopies which shade out the shrubs and lead to unprotected groups of trees and groves. This means that we still cannot conclude if the large herbivores are a driving force for the whole cycle in a highly productive environment. As long as we have not experienced a complete wood-pasture cycle in the Oostvaardersplassen or any other area, {{it remains to be seen}} what will happen in the future. Whatever the outcome will be, the results of our study suggest that some adjustments would benefit the Oostvaardersplassen-system such as increasing heterogeneity through connecting the area with other large nature reserves. This will not only increase opportunities for resource and space partitioning and thus increase opportunities for the coexistence of the large herbivores, but also for wood-pasture cycles and increased biodiversity...|$|R
