Other ordeals existed in the island--such as passing a red-hot iron over the tongue, or plunging the naked arm into a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling water and picking out a pebble thrown therein for the purpose of trial. Alas for both innocent and guilty subjected to either trial! But the ordeal most universally in favour was that of the Tangena.|$|E

60|$|The Efficient Baxter, who {{had just}} left his presence, was feeling much the same about his noble employer. After a sleepless night he had begun at an early hour to try and corner Lord Emsworth in order {{to explain to him}} the true inwardness of last night's happenings. Eventually he had tracked him to the museum, where he found him happily engaged in {{painting}} a cabinet of birds' eggs. He was seated on a small stool, a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> red paint on the floor beside him, dabbing at the cabinet with a dripping brush.

60|$|Silence {{being with}} {{difficulty}} obtained, Gaff did begin his story, intending {{to run over}} {{a few of the}} leading facts regarding his life since he disappeared, but, having begun, he found it impossible to stop, all the more so that no one wanted to stop him. He became so excited, too, that he forgot to take note of time, and his audience were so interested that they paid no attention whatever to the Dutch clock with the horrified countenance, which, by the way, looked if possible more horrified than it used to do in the Bu'ster's early days. Its preliminary hissing and frequent ringings were unheeded; so were the more dignified admonitions of the new clock; so was the tea-kettle, which hissed with the utmost fury at being boiled so long, but hissed in vain, for it was allowed to hiss its entire contents into thin air, and then to burn its bottom red hot! In like manner the <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> potatoes evaporated its water, red-heated its bottom, and burned its contents to charcoal.|$|E

Came a day when for forty hours he had not tasted food. He could not hope for a meal at Ruth's, for she was away to San Rafael on a two weeks' visit; and for very shame's sake he could not go to his sister's. To cap misfortune, the postman, in his afternoon round, brought him five returned manuscripts. Then it was that Martin wore his overcoat down into Oakland, and came back without it, but with five dollars tinkling in his pocket. He paid a dollar each on account to the four tradesmen, and in his kitchen fried steak and onions, made coffee, and stewed a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> prunes. And having dined, {{he sat down at}} his table-desk and completed before midnight an essay which he entitled [...] "The Dignity of Usury." [...] Having typed it out, he flung it under the table, for there had been nothing left from the five dollars with which to buy stamps.|$|E

60|$|Under {{the power}} of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, {{prepared}} every thing for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left,) and a basket of raisins: and thus, loading myself with every thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her, put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese: all which, with great labour and sweat, I carried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and rowing, or paddling, the canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side. And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly {{on both sides of the}} island at a distance, and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.|$|E

50|$|The {{growth of}} C. {{perfringens}} spores {{can be prevented}} by most importantly cooking food, especially beef and poultry, thoroughly to the recommended temperatures.

Based on his flawed idea Dr. Dinwiddie began a daily practice of placing his surgical bedding and instruments into a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling pine tea.

It consists of hammering the piece from the inside to push the shape outwards. After this shape is made, details are added by chiseling and engraving.
