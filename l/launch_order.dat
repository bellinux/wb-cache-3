5|$|Since {{the small}} initial <b>launch</b> <b>order</b> for twenty 737-300s split between two airlines, over 5,000 Boeing 737 {{aircraft}} had been delivered with CFM56 turbofans by April 2010.|$|E
5|$|After {{launching}} the -200 with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7 engines, on August1, 1972 Boeing {{announced that it}} had reached an agreement with General Electric to certify the 747 with CF6-50 series engines to increase the aircraft's market potential. Rolls-Royce followed 747 engine production with a <b>launch</b> <b>order</b> from British Airways for four aircraft. The option of RB211-524B engines was announced on June 17, 1975. The -200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant from the three major engine manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained stagnant {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a <b>launch</b> <b>order</b> for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.|$|E

5000|$|The Looking Glass {{staff and}} crew agree with Alice's {{remaining}} option [...] - [...] ram Looking Glass into Nightwatch before Condor can send his <b>launch</b> <b>orders.</b> Looking Glass had been flying to rendezvous with Nightwatch for some time, and now makes all effort {{to close the}} remaining gap. Fargo realizes what Looking Glass is doing, so Condor orders his pilot to fly evasively until the <b>launch</b> <b>orders</b> can be transmitted. Realizing what Condor and Fargo plan to do, the Nightwatch flight crew sacrifice themselves, turning Nightwatch {{into the path of}} the oncoming Looking Glass. Once the two planes are destroyed, the real President successfully issues a message to stand down the US attack.|$|R
5|$|The Su-35 {{project was}} aimed {{primarily}} at the export market. During {{the early stages}} of the flight-test programme, Sukhoi estimated that there was such a market for 160 aircraft, with a particular emphasis on Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Some of the candidate countries, such as Algeria, Malaysia, and India, were already operators of the Su-30MK family. As the aircraft was to be available for export starting in 2010, the actual <b>launch</b> <b>order</b> for 48 Su-35S aircraft was placed by the Russian Defence Ministry at the 2009 MAKS Air Show (as part of a larger deal worth US$2.5billion for 64 fighter aircraft). During the type's international debut at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Mikhail Pogosyan, General Director of Sukhoi's parent company United Aircraft Corporation, stated that there was an estimated demand for 200 aircraft, split evenly between the domestic and export markets. It was not until the end of 2015 when the first export contract was signed with China; by then, the Russian government had placed a follow-up order for 50 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In early April 1965, BUA {{received}} {{the first of}} the short-haul BAC One-Elevens, for which it had placed the <b>launch</b> <b>order</b> back in 1961, into its fleet. BUA operated the world's first commercial One-Eleven flight on 9 April 1965 from London Gatwick to Genoa.|$|E
25|$|Until 1998, {{when it was}} {{withdrawn}} from service, the WE.177 bomb was armed with a standard tubular pin tumbler lock (as used on bicycle locks) and a standard allen key was used to set yield and burst height. Currently, British Trident missile commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American colleagues cannot. At {{the end of the}} Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a <b>launch</b> <b>order</b> had been sent.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2000s, Boeing began {{studying}} {{the conversion of}} 777-200ER and -200 passenger airliners into freighters, under the name 777 BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter). [...] The company has been in discussion with several airline customers, including FedEx Express, UPS Airlines, and GE Capital Aviation Services, to provide <b>launch</b> <b>orders</b> for a 777 BCF program.|$|R

500|$|After the Challenger disaster, NASA {{returned}} to using a sequential numbering system, {{with the number}} counting {{from the beginning of}} the STS program. Unlike the initial system, however, the numbers were assigned based on the initial mission schedule, and did not always reflect actual <b>launch</b> <b>order.</b> This numbering scheme started at 26, with the first flight as STS-26R—the R suffix stood for [...] "reflight" [...] to disambiguate from prior missions. The suffix was used for two years through STS-33R, then the R was dropped. As a result of the changes in systems, flights under different numbering systems could have the same number with one having a letter appended, e.g. flight STS-51 (a mission carried out by Discovery in 1993) was many years after STS-51-A (Discovery's second flight in 1984).|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>launch</b> <b>order</b> at the 2009 MAKS Air Show, the Russian {{government}} and the state-owned VEB development bank agreed to provide Sukhoi with capital for the aircraft's production. In November 2009, KnAAPO (which was renamed KnAAZ in 2013 after it {{became part of the}} Sukhoi Company) started manufacturing the first production aircraft, the general assembly of which was completed in October 2010; by then, pilots and engineers had successfully completed preliminary tests of the aircraft's systems. The first Su-35S took its maiden flight in May 2011, and would be delivered (along with other aircraft) to Akhtubinsk to start state joint tests with the Defence Ministry to prepare the aircraft for service. Because production of the [...] Su-35S occurred alongside trials, some early-production aircraft were later modified as a result of such tests.|$|E
500|$|In September 1996, {{following}} a <b>launch</b> <b>order</b> for 12 aircraft from charter carrier Condor, Boeing announced the stretched [...] at the Farnborough Airshow. The new model was a [...] {{stretch of the}} , resulting in room for 50 more passengers and nearly 50percent more cargo. The type's design phase {{was intended to be}} the shortest in its manufacturer's history, with 27 months from launch to certification. Due to development and cost concerns, radical upgrades such as a Next Generation 737-style advanced cockpit were not implemented. Instead, the stretched derivative received upgraded engines, enhanced avionics, and a redesigned interior. The first [...] rolled out on May 31, 1998, and completed its maiden flight on August 2, 1998. Following regulatory certification in January 1999, the type entered service with Condor on March 19, 1999.|$|E
50|$|The L-1011-100 (FAA {{certification}} L-1011-385-1-15) was {{the second}} production model of the L-1011 and first flew in 1975 and featured a new center fuel tank and higher gross weights that increased the aircraft's range by nearly 930 mi. <b>Launch</b> <b>orders</b> for the L-1011-100 were placed by Saudia and Cathay Pacific, for two each, in May 1974.

2500|$|The {{operational}} IM-99A {{missiles were}} based horizontally in semi-hardened shelters, nicknamed [...] "coffins". After the <b>launch</b> <b>order,</b> the shelter's roof would slide open, and the missile {{raised to the}} vertical. After the missile was supplied with fuel for the booster rocket, it would be launched by the Aerojet General LR59-AJ-13 booster.

The command would be carried out by a Nuclear and Missile Operations Officer (a member of a missile combat crew, also called a [...] "missileer") at a missile launch control center. A two-man rule applies to the launch of missiles, meaning that two officers must turn keys simultaneously (far enough apart that this cannot be done by one man).|$|E
