30|$|Banerjee et al. [2] {{reported}} a case series of five patients who presented with gross trunnion failure after primary THA, necessitating revision. In this report, gross trunnion failures {{were defined as}} trunnions that exhibited a fracture or gross loss of material volume upon revision. All patients received modular components from five different manufacturers with femoral head diameters ranging from 28 - to 40 -mm. The authors were unable to locate a common link among these patients. However, it was suspected that the trunnion failures were due {{to a combination of}} patient, surgical, and component factors such as comorbidities, trunnion composition, skirted necks, formation of heterotopic ossification, and component damage during insertion. Hohman et al. [34] described a case of a THA that failed 3  years postoperatively. Intraoperative findings included a damaged <b>liner</b> <b>insert,</b> an intact femoral head, diffuse metallic debris, and excessive wear of the trunnion. Additionally, Pansard et al. [35] {{reported a}} patient who had unexplained pain at 2  years following THA and was found to have asymmetric fit of the trunnion and head on radiographic imaging. During revision, abnormal mobility was found between the femoral head and the 12 -mm/ 14 -mm trunnion, with severe damage at the taper. Further examination of the trunnion showed macroscopic pitting and wear. Histological analysis of periprosthetic tissues showed inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and multinucleate giant cells containing fine black particles indicative of metallosis. Botti et al. [36] presented a patient who suffered from trunnion fracture 14  years after the index THA, with no preceeding trauma. Upon retrieval analysis, it was determined that the fracture surface exhibited characteristics of pitting and crevice corrosion. Black metallic debris was also observed on the proximal region of the femoral stem, which was suspected to be caused by repetitive contact of the fractured surfaces.|$|E

A unique source array consisting of two concentric rings of sources, providing phase and amplitude control in the radial as well as circumferential direction, was developed to generate plane waves and both spinning and non-spinning higher order modes. Measurement of attenuation and radial mode shapes were taken with various finite length <b>liners</b> <b>inserted</b> between the hard wall sections of a duct with an anechoic termination. A search technique was developed to find the complex eigenvalues for a liner under the assumption of a locally reacting boundary condition.

40|$|Modern light metals {{processing}} {{technologies are}} very complex and involve a diverse set of variables {{that must be}} quantitatively evaluated. The {{most effective way to}} design new casting processes that deliver specified metallurgical and mechanical properties is to develop a method of simulating the "real-time " process within a test sample of sufficient size. The results can then be analyzed and the required optimizations can be performed. This paper presents a novel method of simulating the industrial casting processes in a laboratory environment using an experimental apparatus based on the principle of high frequency induction heating. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed analytical method is demonstrated, for example, by simulation of the solidification and heat treatment of a test sample composed of two dissimilar materials.

40|$|Prosthetic socket liners {{provide both}} {{suspension}} and stability, {{and they do}} so best when they cover the remaining limb without breaks in the liner surface. This full coverage conflicts {{with the need to}} acquire myoelectric signals directly from the skin. Early solutions to this problem include windows in the liner and metal electrodes piercing and thereby weakening the liner. Windows compromise the integrity of the liner and often lead to discomfort {{at the edge of the}} window. Metal electrodes require attachment of external wires after donning. Another alternative is to mount cased electrodes in molded silicone receptacles. This may result in a proper seal, but it requires repeated removal of the electrode from the liner. The problems identified above can be addressed by passing the myoelectric signals directly though the liner with flexible Conductive Inserts. This approach allows metal electrodes in the outer socket to acquire the myoelectric signals as if they were in direct contact with the skin with no wires attached to the liner. LTI has developed Conductive Inserts that not only pass myoelectric signals through the liner but also allow for misalignment when the <b>liner</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the socket. These Inserts can be installed by prosthetic technicians in a commercial liner, or they can be built into a custom <b>liner.</b> With <b>Inserts</b> installed, a <b>liner</b> is a separate part that can be easily removed for cleaning...|$|R

5000|$|A {{wet liner}} {{cylinder}} block features cylinder walls that are entirely removable, which {{fit into the}} block by means of special gaskets. They {{are referred to as}} [...] "wet liners" [...] because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine's coolant. In other words, the liner is the entire wall, rather than being merely a sleeve. Wet liner designs are popular with European manufacturers, most notably Renault and Peugeot, who continue to use them to the present. Dry liner designs use either the block's material or a discrete <b>liner</b> <b>inserted</b> into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall. Additional sleeves are inserted within, which remain [...] "dry" [...] on their outside, surrounded by the block's material. With either wet or dry liner designs, the liners (or sleeves) can be replaced, potentially allowing overhaul or rebuild without replacement of the block itself; but in reality, they are difficult to remove and install, and for many applications (such as most late-model cars and trucks), an engine will never undergo such a procedure in its working lifespan. It is likelier to be scrapped, with new equipment—engine or entire vehicle—replacing it. This is sometimes rightfully disparaged as a symptom of a throw-away society, but on the other hand, it is actually sometimes more cost-efficient and even environmentally protective to recycle machinery and build new instances with efficient manufacturing processes (and superior machine performance and emission control) than it is to overvalue old machinery and craft production.|$|R

50|$|The closure is {{supplied}} to the bottler with an aluminum foil layer <b>liner</b> already <b>inserted.</b> Although {{there are various}} liners to choose from, a typical induction liner is multi-layered. The top layer is a paper pulp that is generally spot-glued to the cap. The next layer is wax {{that is used to}} bond a layer of aluminum foil to the pulp. The bottom layer is a polymer film laminated to the foil. After the cap or closure is applied, the container passes under an induction coil, which emits an oscillating electromagnetic field. As the container passes under the induction coil (sealing head) the conductive aluminum foil liner begins to heat due to eddy currents. The heat melts the wax, which is absorbed into the pulp backing and releases the foil from the cap. The polymer film also heats and flows onto the lip of the container. When cooled, the polymer creates a bond with the container resulting in a hermetically sealed product. Neither the container nor its contents are negatively affected; The heat generated does not harm the contents.|$|R
