30|$|Due to the {{presence}} of oxygen functionalities at the edges (–COOH) and in basal plane (C–O–C and –OH), graphene oxide (GO) is well dispersible in different solvents [11, 12]. As a well <b>dispersible</b> <b>material,</b> GO is easy to modify chemically. Chemical functionalization of GO serves as a fascinating mean to increase the affinity of graphene toward various gaseous and liquid substances. Both non-oxidized graphitic domains and oxygen-containing groups of GO can be modified by either non-covalent or covalent functionalization. Non-covalent functionalization involves strong π-π interactions between graphitic domains and functionalizing groups as reported by Dubey et al. [13] and Yang et al. [14].|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that in the}} process of {{cultivation}} of Bacillus subtilis IMV V- 7023 in the medium with vermiculite (1. 5 – 5. 0 g/l) one can observe the oppressing of some indexes of antioxidant properties of cultural medium of bacteria. In particular, a decline of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in the Fenton reaction by 2. 8 – 11. 6 %, ability to inhibit formation of malondialdehyde – by 4. 4 – 13. 1 % and inactivation of 2, 2 ′-Diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH·) radical – by 3. 1 – 8. 5 % were observed. Thus oxidant activity increased substantially. Besides oppressing influence of particles of vermiculite on protector properties of the cultural medium of bacilli it is found out that with the increase of the content of <b>dispersible</b> <b>material</b> in the nutrient medium the reducing power of cultural medium of these bacteria increased...|$|R
40|$|Resonance Raman {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} analytical tool for detecting and identifying analytes, but the associated strong fluorescence background severely limits {{the use of the}} technique. Here, we show that by attaching beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) cavities to reduced graphene-oxide (rGO) sheets we obtain a water <b>dispersible</b> <b>material</b> (beta-CD: rGO) that combines the hydrophobicity associated with rGO with that of the cyclodextrin cavities and provides a versatile platform for resonance Raman detection. Planar aromatic and dye molecules that adsorb on the rGO domains and nonplanar molecules included within the tethered beta-CD cavities have their fluorescence effectively quenched. We show that it is possible using the water dispersible beta-CD: rGO sheets to record the resonance Raman spectra of adsorbed and included organic chromophores directly in aqueous media without having to extract or deposit on a substrate. This is significant, as it allows us to identify and estimate organic analytes present in water by resonance Raman spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|To asses {{the risks}} {{associated}} with transport accidents involving solid LSA-II and LSA-III materials a comprehensive experimental programme was conducted to qantify and characterise airborne release of radioactive particulate matter in transport and handling accidents with mechanical impact of varying severities and to determine the dependency from influencing parameters such as LSA material and packaging properties and size. The experimental approach combined wellcontrolled and very reproducible impact experiments with small scale specimens and drop tests of larger scale specimens from different heights up to 27 m. In both cases the associated airborne release of particulate matter is determined by measuring the amount and aerodynamic particle size characteristics of released dust. The small scale tests revealed fundamental results on airborne release and size distribution which helped to design the test matrix of the large scale experiments, especially with brittle material. In the large scale tests, volumes of specimens were varied systematically up to 200 L and the LSA material was contained either within packaging or without protective packaging {{in order to determine the}} influence of the packaging on the airborne release and to be able to extrapolate other configurations of package sizes and impact severities. The LSA surrogate materials were either concrete, used to immobilize radioactive wastes as representive brittle material, or appropiately chosen powders representing <b>dispersible</b> <b>materials.</b> Based on the experimental results it can be concluded that the requirements of the current IAEA Transport Regulations sufficiently limit potential radiological consequences from transport accidents with mechanical impact involving packages with LSA-II or LSA-III materials...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous {{materials}} with well-defined pore size and structure have applications {{in a wide}} range of topics from catalysis, environment and medicine to electronics. This work presents the methods and procedures for preparing functional mesoporous materials for applications in the environment from removal of toxic metals to clean synthesis of fine chemicals. Magnetic mesoporous silica (magMCM- 41) of large surface area (800 m 2 g- 1) and high magnetization (8. 30 emu g- 1) was prepared by grafting 10 nm magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the silica matrix, and this highly <b>dispersible</b> <b>material</b> can be easily separated from aqueous solution by a magnetic field. Functionalization of the surface with selected ligands and metal complexes creates powerful capabilities for chemical separation and catalysis. Fe 3 +-magMCM- 41 prepared by grafting aminopropyls and then adsorbing Fe 3 + was found to be a highly selective adsorbent which adsorbed only As(V) and Cr(VI) oxyanions (70 and 100 mg g- 1, respectively) without any Cu(II). A series of salt-tolerant sorbents with designed functionalized groups were capable of removing 97 ~ 99 % toxic heavy metals with a Kd (distribution coefficient) value as high as 106 from seawater. Meanwhile, the catalytic performances of modified materials were tested for Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The result showed the conversion excessed 97 % (30 min) at 393 K on the catalyst “Mag-NH 2 -MCM- 41 ” which was easily recovered with external magnetic field. Thus, the chemically-modified materials based on MCM- 41 were proven to be excellent selective sorbents and good catalysts. A more efficient, continuous, cleaner and reliable manufacturing method for mesoporous materials was developed using a microfluidic reactor. MCM- 41 was successfully prepared in the microreactor and the physical properties were examined by different characterization techniques to ensure the quality. The continuous synthesis of mesoporous silica has a great potential industrial application...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The Bacopa monnieri is {{traditional}} Ayurvedic medicine, and reported for memory-enhancing effects. The Bacoside is poorly soluble, bitter in taste and {{responsible for the}} memory enhancement action. Memory enhancer is commonly prescribed for children or elder people. Objective: Poor solubility, patient compliance and bitterness were a major driving force to develop taste masked β-cyclodextrin complex and <b>dispersible</b> tablets. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: The inclusion complex of Bacopa monnieri and β-cyclodextrin was prepared in different molar ratios of Bacopa monnieri by Co-precipitation method. Phase solubility {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of β-cyclodextrin on aqueous solubility of Bacoside A. The characterization was determined by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction study (XRD). Crospovidone and croscarmallose sodium were used as super disintigrant. The 32 full factorial design was adopted to investigate the influence of two superdisintegrants on the wetting time and disntegration time of the tablets. Conclusion: The result revels that molar ratio (1 : 4) of inclusion complex enhance 3 -fold solubility. Full factorial design was successfully employed for the optimization of dispersible tablet of B. monnieri. The short-term accelerated stability study confirmed that high stability of B. monnieri in inclusion complex...|$|R
40|$|Chromium (VI) oxyanions {{were removed}} {{selectively}} from various aqueous systems using magnetic MCM- 41 nanosorbents of {{large surface area}} (> 550 m(2) g(- 1)) and high magnetization (>= 8. 0 emu g(- 1)). 10 nm magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were embedded within 250 1 50 nm MCM- 41 to obtain a highly <b>dispersible</b> magnetic <b>material,</b> magMCM- 41 {{that can be easily}} removed by a magnetic field. A highly selective nanosorbent was obtained by grafting aminopropyls and adsorbing Fe(3 +) on the pores of the magMCM- 41. Chromium oxyanions were selectively removed over the pH range of 2 - 7 with high adsorption capacity of ca. 1. 9 mmol g(- 1) (ca. 100 mg g(- 1)) and K(d) > 25, 000 mL g(- 1) for single and binary component adsorptions from distilled, tap, mountain stream and river waters. The presence of calcium in the tap and natural waters as well as humic compounds in mountain stream and river waters resulted in a slightly lower chromium adsorption, but did not affect its superb selectivity (ca. 97 %). The adsorption and separation of the chromium oxyanions were adequately described by Freundlich and LeVan-Vermeulen equations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} a proposed residual contamination guide (RCG) for the 324 Building B-Cell Cleanout Project, Phase 1, at the Hanford Site. The RCG is {{expressed as a}} fraction of the amount of highly <b>dispersible</b> radioactive <b>material</b> that would result in offsite doses equal to the Pacific Northwest Laboratory radiological risk guidelines following the worst credible accident scenario for release of the holdup material. The proposed RCG is 10 {sup {minus} 1 } to 10 {sup {minus} 2 } of the PNL radiological risk guidelines. As part of the development of the RCG, a number of factors were considered. These include the need to provide an appropriate level of flexibility for other activities within the 324 Building that could contribute to the facility`s overall radiological risk, uncertainties inherent in safety analyses, and the possible contribution of other 300 Area facilities to overall radiological risk. Because of these factors {{and the nature of the}} cleanout project, the RCG is expressed as a range rather than a point value. This report also provides guidance on determining conformance to the RCG, including inspection and measurement techniques, quality assurance requirements, and consideration of uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Staff of the King County Wastewater Treatment Division (WTD) have {{concern about}} the {{aftermath}} of a radiological dispersion event (RDE) leading to the introduction of significant quantities of radioactive material into the combined sanitary and storm sewer system in King County, Washington. Radioactive material could come from the use of a radiological dispersion device (RDD). RDDs include "dirty bombs" that are not nuclear detonations but are explosives designed to spread radioactive material (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) 2001). Radioactive material also could come from deliberate introduction or dispersion of radioactive material into the environment, including waterways and water supply systems. This document develops plausible and/or likely scenarios, including the identification of likely radioactive materials and quantities of those radioactive materials to be involved. These include 60 Co, 90 Sr, 137 Cs, 192 Ir, 226 Ra, plutonium, and 241 Am. Two broad categories of scenarios are considered. The first category includes events that may be suspected from the outset, such as an explosion of a "dirty bomb" in downtown Seattle. The explosion would most likely be heard, but the type of explosion (e. g., sewer methane gas or RDD) may not be immediately known. Emergency first responders must be able to quickly detect the radioisotopes previously listed, assess the situation, and deploy a response to contain and mitigate (if possible) detrimental effects resulting from the incident. In such scenarios, advance notice of about an hour or two might be available before any contaminated wastewater reaches a treatment plant. The second category includes events that could go initially undetected by emergency personnel. Examples of such a scenario would be the inadvertent or surreptitious introduction of radioactive material into the sewer system. Intact rogue radioactive sources from industrial radiography devices, well-logging apparatus, or moisture density gages may get into wastewater and be carried to a treatment plant. Other scenarios might include a terrorist deliberately putting a <b>dispersible</b> radioactive <b>material</b> into wastewater. Alternatively, a botched terrorism preparation of an RDD may result in radioactive material entering wastewater without anyone's knowledge. Drinking water supplies may also be contaminated, with the result that some or most of the radioactivity ends up in wastewater...|$|R
