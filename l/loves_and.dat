50|$|The first dialogue, titled, “Philo <b>and</b> Sophia on <b>Love</b> <b>and</b> Desire” is a contemplation on {{the distinctions}} between <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire, or the types of <b>love</b> <b>and</b> {{the true nature of}} love. In Sophia’s opinion, <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire are exclusive; however, Philo argues that <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire mix in things we find pleasurable, and that desire assumes {{knowledge}} of its object and, thus, its existence. Philo defines desire as that which seeks to become united with its object <b>and</b> <b>love</b> as that which, in union with its object, is enjoyed. When <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire intersect, there are three different qualities of objects: useful, pleasant and good. Useful objects are not <b>loved</b> <b>and</b> desired together. Useful objects are those that are possessed. Meanwhile, <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire of pleasant objects grows and perishes at the same time; pleasant objects exist because of privation. Good objects, on the other hand, exist when <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire have no limit.|$|R

5|$|Mr. Nobody is a 2009 {{science fiction}} drama film written and {{directed}} by Jaco Van Dormael and starring Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Linh Dan Pham, Rhys Ifans, Natasha Little, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple. The film tells the life story of Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man who is the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. Nemo, memory fading, refers to his three main <b>loves</b> <b>and</b> to his parents' divorce and subsequent hardships endured at three critical junctions in his life: at age nine, fifteen, and thirty-four. Alternate life paths branching out from each of those critical junctions are examined. The speculative narrative often changes course with the flick of a different possible decision at each of those ages. The film uses nonlinear narrative and the multiverse hypothesis style.|$|E
5|$|Soraya {{is a young}} Afghan {{woman whom}} Amir meets and marries in the United States. Hosseini {{originally}} scripted the character as an American woman, but he later agreed to rewrite her as an Afghan immigrant after his editor did not find her background believable {{for her role in}} the story. The change contributed towards an extensive revision of Part III. In the final draft, Soraya lives with her parents, Afghan general Taheri and his wife, and wants to become an English teacher. Before meeting Amir, she ran away with an Afghan boyfriend in Virginia, which, according to Afghan tradition, made her unsuitable for marriage. Because Amir also had his own regrets, he <b>loves</b> <b>and</b> marries her anyway.|$|E

25|$|Since this theory, the 'closet scene' {{in which}} Hamlet confronts {{his mother in}} her private {{quarters}} has been portrayed in a sexual light in several performances. Hamlet is played as scolding his mother for having sex with Claudius while simultaneously wishing (unconsciously) that he could take Claudius' place; adultery and incest is what he simultaneously <b>loves</b> <b>and</b> hates about his mother. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may be read through the Freudian lens {{as a reaction to}} the death of her hoped-for lover, her father.

25|$|Tulsidas was {{inspired}} by Adhyatma Ramayana, where Rama and other characters of the Valmiki Ramayana along with their attributes (saguna narrative) were transposed into spiritual terms and abstract rendering of an Atma (soul, self, Brahman) without attributes (nirguna reality). According to Kapoor, Rama's life story in the Ramacharitamanasa combines mythology, philosophy and religious beliefs into a story of life, a code of ethics, a treatise on universal human values. It debates in its dialogues the human dilemmas, the ideal standards of behavior, duties to those one <b>loves,</b> <b>and</b> mutual responsibilities. It inspires the audience to view their own lives from a spiritual plane, encouraging the virtuous to keep going, and comforting those oppressed with a healing balm.|$|E

One way to see this part of town is the Noche de Leyendas (Night of Legends), which is a hybrid between interactive theater and a recounting of history. A group of actors guide visitors through the streets of the city narrating stories about what has happened in these places.
