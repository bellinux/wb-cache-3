40|$|Simple {{computer}} algorithms {{for processing}} source program and text data files {{in order to}} extract change detection, version control, version history, and current status information are described. These algorithms presuppose {{that it is possible}} to attach to each record of the source files a 6 -character code, placed within delimiters that will cause the compiler, or other using program, to ignore this code field. The code contains a 2 -character code for a character-by-character position-sensitive checksum of the record, another for the record number in the file, and a third for the data on which the encoding took place. Once the source file has been thus encoded, it is possible to detect the following transactions on the file since the most recent version coding; (1) addition of new records (having no version code), (2) modification of existing records, (3) deletion of a number of records, (4) movement and/or duplication of existing records, and (5) modification and duplication of records. In addition, it is possible to extract a version history of the number of records created or modified by date. A special file <b>listing</b> <b>program</b> is described which prints the file records without showing the version codes, but places a "change bar" at the right margin whenever a change is detected. The program also provides a list of changed pages and a version history...|$|E
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the issues of}} civil aviation aircraft onboard computers data safety. Infor- mation security undeclared capabilities stand for technical equipment or software possibilities, which are {{not mentioned in the}} documentation. Documentation and tests content requirements are imposed during the software certification. Documentation requirements include documents composition and content of control (specification, description and program code, the source code). Test requirements include: static analysis of program codes (including the compliance of the sources with their loading modules monitoring); dynamic analysis of source code (including implementation of routes monitor- ing). Currently, there are no complex measures for checking onboard computer software. There are no rules and regulations that can allow controlling foreign production aircraft software, and the actual receiving of software is difficult. Consequently, the author suggests developing the basics of aviation rules and regulations, which allow to analyze the programs of CA aircraft onboard computers. If there are no software source codes the two approaches of code analysis are used: a structural static and dy- namic analysis of the source code; signature-heuristic analysis of potentially dangerous operations. Static analysis determines the behavior of the program by reading the program code (without running the program) which is represented in the assembler language - disassembly <b>listing.</b> <b>Program</b> tracing is performed by the dynamic analysis. The analysis of aircraft software ability to detect undeclared capa- bilities using the interactive disassembler was considered in this article...|$|E
40|$|There {{is now an}} ongoing, {{unprecedented}} loss {{of species}} diversity throughout {{the world as well}} as a decline in the absolute numbers of organisms from the smallest microorganism to the largest mammal. The current loss of biota has several causes. One is the destruction, conversion, or degradation of entire ecosystems with the consequent loss of entire assemblages of species. Another is the accelerating loss of individual species within communities or ecosystems as a result of habitat disturbance, pollution, and exploitation. Third, and more subtle, is the loss of genetic variability. Selective pressures such as habitat alteration, the presence of chemical toxins, or regional climate changes may eliminate some genetically distinct parts of the population, yet not cause extinction of the entire species. This is the first of several issues of Museum Notes that will discuss Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s Endangered and Threatened species. Future issues will deal with fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and plants. As a prelude to this series of Museum Notes, we might ask 2 ̆ 2 {{what does it mean to}} be Endangered or Threatened? 2 ̆ 2 As defined by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the term 2 ̆ 7 endangered species 2 ̆ 7 means any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Excluded from this definition would be any insect species determined to constitute a pest whose protection under the provisions of this Act would present an overwhelming and overriding risk to man. A 2 ̆ 7 threatened species 2 ̆ 7 is any species that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Before a plant or animal species can receive protection under the Endangered Species Act, it must first be placed on the Federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants.
