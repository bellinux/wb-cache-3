5|$|In 1969, a 500 MW {{nuclear power}} plant was {{proposed}} for the Jervis Bay Territory, 200km south of Sydney. A local opposition campaign began, and the South Coast Trades and <b>Labour</b> <b>Council</b> (covering workers in the region) {{announced that it would}} refuse to build the reactor. Some environmental studies and site works were completed, and two rounds of tenders were called and evaluated, but in 1971 the Australian government decided not to proceed with the project, citing economic reasons.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, Sohyo was {{replaced}} with a {{formation of a new}} confederation: Rengo. This restructuring impacted the relationship that <b>labour</b> <b>councils</b> had with community unions: <b>labour</b> <b>councils</b> would no longer organize workers; they were now a part of Rengo’s Regional Organizations. These Regional Organizations do not have the freedom and activities that <b>labour</b> <b>councils</b> once had and do not support community unions thus some community unions broke up during this time. Community unions that remained faced challenges dealing with finances and autonomy workers.|$|R

5|$|Wimbledon's {{success as}} a club in the top flight of English {{football}} was founded on unorthodox financial management and judicious dealings in the transfer market. Rumours of a move or a merger with another London side persisted, leading the club's chief executive Colin Hutchinson to resign in 1987 amid talk of an amalgamation with Ron Noades's new club Crystal Palace or a groundshare at Queens Park Rangers' Loftus Road ground in Shepherd's Bush. Wimbledon were granted planning permission to build a 20,000-seater ground in their home borough of Merton in 1988, soon after they won the FA Cup, but the site was instead made into a car park by a newly elected <b>Labour</b> <b>council</b> in 1990. Wimbledon's desire to move was made a necessity a year later, when the Taylor Report, which ordered the extensive redevelopment of football grounds, was released.|$|E

25|$|On 15 February, the Croatian Parliament adopted {{amendments}} to the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and passed a package of electoral laws to facilitate multiparty elections, but left the parliamentary system unchanged. Elections were scheduled for all 356 seats in the tricameral parliament consisting of the Socio-Political Council (80 seats), the Council of Associated Labour (160 seats) and the Council of Municipalities (116 seats). The electoral legislation established constituencies for each parliamentary chamber, whose sizes varied greatly. The eighty Socio-Political Council constituencies encompassed many small municipalities or parts of large ones, varying in population from fewer than 32,000 to more than 80,000. Council of Municipalities constituencies corresponded to municipalities with greater population variations of fewer than 1,000 to more than 150,000. The Associated <b>Labour</b> <b>Council</b> members were to be elected in 160 constituencies whose populations also varied greatly.

5000|$|Increasingly, some <b>Labour</b> <b>councils</b> were radicalised {{to act in}} open {{defiance}} of the Thatcher Government. Instead of cutting expenditure, they raised rates {{and all kinds of}} borrowing and lease-back arrangements were entered into with overseas banks and private financial institutions in order to sustain capital programmes. The increased radicalisation of <b>Labour</b> <b>councils</b> during this period could be attributed to the policies of the Thatcher Government, which involved reductions in government financial aid to both council housing and local authorities, together with a change in the government's allocation formula so that local authority areas of high expenditure were disproportionately affected.

25|$|Still, a turn {{of events}} {{eventually}} led to his breaking with Wilhelm. Bismarck, feeling pressured and unappreciated by the Emperor and undermined by ambitious advisers, refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm, as was required by the German constitution.

25|$|Trade {{unions are}} {{recognized}} within the 1996 Constitution of South Africa, which {{provides for the}} right to join trade unions, and for unions to collectively bargain and strike.
