5|$|As {{sovereign}} of Madagascar, Ranavalona III {{became a}} pawn in the endgame of the maneuvering {{that had been}} taking place between the British and French {{since the beginning of}} the century. The tension between France and Madagascar had grown especially acute in the three years prior to Ranavalona's succession, with an intensification of attacks in the months prior to her coronation. In February 1883 the northwestern coast was bombarded, followed by the occupation of Mahajanga by the French in May, and bombardment and capture of Toamasina in June. Attacks along the northern coast were ongoing at the time Ranavalona III was crowned in the summer of 1883. Shortly after the French initiated this <b>latest</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> hostilities, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony decided to engage Lieutenant Colonel Digby Willoughby, a Briton who had gained combat experience in the Anglo-Zulu War (but without having been a member of the British armed forces), to oversee the nation's military affairs and train the queen's army to defend the island against the seemingly inevitable French invasion.|$|E

25|$|In April 1913 Montenegro {{seized control}} of Scutari in the <b>latest</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> {{hostilities}} between the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro during the closing stages of the First Balkan War. The view taken at the London Conference was that Scutari should be handed over to Albania.

On arrival he blockaded Antivari and then, from May to November 1913, also commanded the international force occupying Scutari as part of its transition to Albanian control. For his very successful handling of this situation he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 3 June 1913 and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 27 October 1913.|$|E
25|$|When the Subway first opened, single-carriage four axle (twin truck) trains were operated. Late in {{the evening}} on the opening day, after 11pm, one car laden with 60 {{passengers}} was run into by another under the River Clyde. Four people were injured, one being taken to the infirmary. This entailed {{the closure of the}} Subway until 19 January 1897. The 20 original wooden bodied carriages were built by the Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, of Oldbury, Worcestershire. Many continued in service until 1977 in an upgraded form. A further 10 were delivered by the same manufacturer in 1897. From 1898, second four axle (trailer) carriages without a cable gripper mechanism were added, though they were considerably shorter than the front (gripper) carriage. These additional carriages, eventually numbering 30, were built by Hurst Nelson & Company, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. These carriages were soon expanded to match the length of the front carriages, although carriage 41T has been restored to its original length and cut longitudinally and number 39T is preserved in the Riverside Museum. Carriage 41T was on display at Buchanan Street subway station but was removed with the <b>latest</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> station modernisations. Enquiries with station staff on 27 September 2017 reveal that the removal was conducted {{in the middle of the}} night at the end of 2015 or the start of 2016. The removal sparked protests. Its location is currently unknown. Most of the gripper carriages were subsequently converted to electric traction in 1935. All carriages were originally built with lattice gates (instead of doors) at the ends; many were converted to air-operated sliding doors in the 1960s, but a few retained the gates until 1977.|$|E
500|$|In early 1952, Hughes {{fought off}} a lawsuit by screenwriter Paul Jarrico, {{who had been}} {{caught up in the}} <b>latest</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> HUAC hearings—Hughes had fired him and removed his name from the credits of a recent release. The studio owner {{subsequently}} ordered 100 RKO employees on [...] "leave of absence" [...] while he established a [...] "security office" [...] to oversee an ideological vetting system. [...] "We are going to screen everyone in a creative or executive capacity", he declared. [...] "The work of Communist sympathizers will not be used." [...] As more credits were expunged, some in the industry began to question whether Hughes's hunt for subversives served primarily as a convenient rationale for further curtailing production and trimming expenses.|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and we realized we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when we realized we were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the <b>latest</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E
