5|$|Mourning doves sunbathe or rainbathe by {{lying on}} the ground or on a flat tree limb, <b>leaning</b> <b>over,</b> {{stretching}} one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. Dustbathing is common as well.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the cross link the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was <b>leaning</b> <b>over,</b> a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
50|$|Its {{consistently}} changing boundaries {{together with}} its existence in a high-growth area {{do not provide}} consistent political <b>leanings</b> <b>over</b> time, although it has shown more inclination towards the Labor Party over time than any other Gold Coast seat.|$|R

25|$|The Saracens have invaded France and {{are laying}} siege to Paris. The Saracen king has a giant {{to whom he}} has promised the hand of his {{beautiful}} daughter Marsabelle if he can bring to her {{the head of the}} French king, Dagobert. At this moment, the giant is <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the city wall of Paris, taunting the population and threatening to destroy them all. Everyone is terrified. Six knights have already sallied out and been slaughtered by this giant. Now he is <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the wall again and taunting them all once more.|$|E
25|$|A great terrace in the Palace of Herod, set {{above the}} banqueting hall. Some {{soldiers}} are <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the balcony. To the right {{there is a}} gigantic staircase, to the left, at the back, an old cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze. The moon is shining very brightly.|$|E
25|$|Sweepers are trees {{fallen in}} or heavily <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the river, still rooted {{on the shore}} and not fully submerged. Its trunk and {{branches}} may form an obstruction in the river like strainers. Since it is an obstruction from above, it often does not contribute to whitewater features but may create turbulence. In fast water sweepers can pose a serious hazard to paddlers.|$|E
5000|$|Payam-e-Zan is a women's {{magazine}} {{published in}} Afghanistan by the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA). Literally translated, the name means [...] "Women's Message." [...] It {{began as a}} quarterly publication in [...] Persian/Pushto and Urdu that focused on women's rights and opposing fundamentalism with strong socialist <b>leanings.</b> <b>Over</b> time, it became a major source for news on politics and society more generally. It is now an online magazine as part of www.rawa.org.|$|R

25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> in his seat, and unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to get his}} attention. After she {{asked him what he}} was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the TATP and prevented it from igniting.|$|E
25|$|The hips {{should be}} relaxed and the rider should lean {{forwards}} slightly {{with the movement}} of the horse. In cross country, the rider tends {{to stay out of the}} saddle and be standing up with their knees bent and the upper body <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the horse's withers. The heel of the rider should be in line with their shoulders and then the back of their riding hat in dressage to make the canter look neat.|$|E
25|$|In an {{alternative}} method, {{a large piece}} of fuel wood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile. Then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuel wood, and the other resting on the ground, so that the kindling is <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the tinder pile. This method is useful in very high winds, as the piece of fuel wood acts as a windbreak.|$|E

25|$|Chesney didn't {{acknowledge}} the injury {{during the early}} part of his performance. However, he was visibly limping and seemed to rest near a drum riser while <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> and holding his knee during the instrumental breaks of his hit songs. As he came offstage, a doctor from the University of South Carolina cut off Chesney’s cowboy boot and immediately began treating the foot injury. X-rays that were taken afterwards revealed several crushed bones in his right foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{first task}} that the earl gives to Sir Eglamour, {{in order to}} win the hand of his daughter, is to defeat a giant far to the west. Giants are commonplace in medieval romance. Florent kills one that has been <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the outer wall of the city of Paris, taunting its inhabitants, in the medieval romance Octavian. King Arthur kills one that lives on the top of Mont Saint-Michel, on his way to defeat a Roman army in the Alliterative Morte Arthure. Sir Yvain kills one in Chrétien de Troyes' Arthurian romance Yvain, the Knight of the Lion. Sir Gawain {{encounters}} one in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle.|$|E
500|$|She wrote {{liner notes}} for each {{piece in the}} album, {{describing}} exactly what type of vision she was attempting to evoke with her compositions. For her description of the first track on the album, [...] "Rose Coloured Lights", Hubbard wrote that the picture {{she was trying to}} bring about for the listener was [...] "a yacht in the Mediterranean. <b>Leaning</b> <b>over</b> a rail at night thinking. The whole spectrum of love: the champagne of c'est la vie in a million stories..." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{convention}} dealt with other matters, the nominations for president {{opened on the}} morning of Friday, June 11. Harding had asked Willis to place his name in nomination, and the former governor responded with a speech popular among the delegates both for its folksiness and for its brevity in the intense Chicago heat. Reporter Mark Sullivan, who was present, called it a splendid combination of [...] "oratory, grand opera, and hog calling". Willis confided, <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the podium railing, [...] "Say, boys—and girls too—why not name Warren Harding?" [...] The laughter and applause that followed created a warm feeling for Harding.|$|E
500|$|Back in Oak Brook, Mulder has {{followed}} Pincus {{to the house}} of VinylRight employee Gretchen Starns. [...] Mulder looks through the window and sees the monster <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the woman as she watches TV. [...] Mulder breaks the window and then kicks in the door. Inside the house he sees that Starns has been transformed into a zombie. Behind him, out of his sight, the monster walks across the ceiling. Mulder catches a glimpse of it crawling up the outside of the house. Later at the FBI office, Starns and Pincus complain to A.D. Skinner about Mulder's behavior. Mulder, seeing Pincus begin to transform into the creature again, draws his weapon. He is restrained by a disbelieving Skinner and then sedated in a hospital.|$|E
500|$|The critic Michael Billington, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave a mixed review: [...] "Once or twice one of Stoppard's brightly {{coloured}} balls {{falls to the}} ground, partly because Michael Hordern's moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But {{this is not to}} deny that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> his desk as if he is doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the Ministry of Home Affairs began arresting left-wing {{political}} dissidents, generally {{in order to}} exact a confession and renouncement of anti-state <b>leanings.</b> <b>Over</b> 30,000 such arrests were made between 1930 and 1933. In response, {{a large group of}} writers founded a Japanese branch of the International Popular Front Against Fascism, and published articles in major literary journals warning of the dangers of statism. Their periodical, The People's Library (人民文庫), achieved a circulation of over five thousand and was widely read in literary circles, but was eventually censored, and later dismantled in January 1938.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{too hot for}} anger, father," [...] a voice said; and Dom Pedro, turning, saw his {{daughter}} <b>leaning</b> languidly <b>over</b> the balustrade. She, too, was watching the hammock with a curious expression.|$|R
500|$|The visual {{opens with}} a hand {{inserting}} a coin into a machine. Subsequently, a space full of cameras is shown, {{with one of them}} displaying Pitbull rapping in front of a blue backdrop. Next, Inna makes appearance performing a choreography accompanied by several background dancers; she wears a blonde wig and a white jumpsuit. Over the rest of the visual, the cameras display different words or phrases, to which Inna and the backup dancers are dressed to. The clip portrays them playing baseball, golf, paintball, acting as cheerleaders and being engaged with barbie dolls among other activities. A scene from the visual portrays the crowd <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> a Fiat car; American singer Jennifer Lopez used the same model for the music video of her 2011 single, [...] "Papi".|$|E
500|$|Each of {{the three}} Black Triptychs {{displays}} sequential views of a single figure, and each seems to be intended {{to be viewed as}} if stills from a film. The figures rendered are not drawn from any of Bacon's usual intellectual sources; they do not depict Golgotha, Handes, or Leopold Bloom. In these pictures Bacon strips Dyer from the context of both Dyer's own life and the artist's life, and presents him as a nameless, slumped, gathering of flesh, awaiting the onset of death. Describing the Black Triptychs in 1993, the art critic Juan Vicente Aliaga wrote that [...] "the horror, the abjection that oozed from the crucifixes has been transformed in his last paintings into quiet solitude. The masculine bodies entwined in a carnal embrace have given way to the solitary figure <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> the washbasin, standing firm on the smooth ground, neutral, bald-headed, his convex back deformed, his testicles contracted in a fold." ...|$|E
500|$|Painter Maqbool Fida Hussain {{found his}} muse in Madhuri Dixit after {{watching}} the part of Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! where [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana" [...] is performed. He went on to watch the film 67 times. About Dixit's dance in the song Hussain confessed, [...] "That movement of the hips is out of this world. I have {{never seen such a}} dancer, and I have seen the best. Her words are transformed into body language." [...] He painted a series of paintings inspired from Dixit. Madhuri as Menaka with Vishwamitra, Madhuri as Radha with Nand Lala, Madhuri playing tennis at Wimbledon were some of those paintings. The Menaka painting was inspired from the famous painting of apsara Menaka as painted by Raja Ravi Verma. Another painting also showed Dixit with Meryl Streep <b>leaning</b> <b>over</b> a bridge in Madison County and Clint Eastwood on horseback below. The painting Nautanki showed Dixit with a backless blouse turning behind like the step in [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", however this time sporting a nine yards Maharashtrian saree.|$|E
