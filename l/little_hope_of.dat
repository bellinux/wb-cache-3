Nearly 4,000relief workers and rescue team members were {{still searching for}} survivors, with <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> finding any. By then, the {{official}} death toll was registered at 22,540people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000homeless, and 4,000injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most of the relief workers, their job was over.|$|E

To alleviate the Mormon population's concerns over religious freedom, Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece.

Outnumbered almost three to one, Bonnet's men would have had <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> winning a boarding action. Bonnet ordered his gunner, George Ross, {{to blow up the}} Royal James's powder magazine. Ross apparently attempted this, but was overruled by the remainder of the crew, who surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and returned to Charles Town with his prisoners on 3October.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{gradually}} became clogged with weed, and the railway took {{much of the}} trade. Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700. Three years later, the Bristol and Exeter Railway merged with the Great Western Railway. The new owners were remote, and {{were more interested in}} the water supply for Taunton station and for the Bridgwater Dock, than running the canal as a going concern, with the result that the canal deteriorated further. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, but had <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> any improvements being made.|$|E

After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> resurrecting his football career.|$|E
5|$|Before marching towards Antioch, Khalid and Abu Ubaidah {{decided to}} isolate the city from Anatolia; this was done by {{capturing}} all the fortresses that were providing strategic defense to Antioch, most importantly A'zāz at north east of Antioch. In order to save the empire from annihilation, a desperate battle was fought between the Muslim army {{and that of the}} defenders of Antioch outside the city near Orontes river, popularly known as Battle of Iron bridge. The Byzantine army was composed of the survivors of Yarmouk and other Syrian campaigns. After being defeated, the Byzantines retreated to Antioch and the Muslims besieged the city. Having <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> help from emperor, Antioch surrendered on 30 October 637, with the terms that all Byzantine troops would be given safe passage to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|For most of Scott's {{tenure as}} governor, {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment {{in favor of a}} U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians resented the replacement of the Embargo Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly, however, that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses.|$|E

5|$|In 1852 Morton campaigned and {{was elected}} {{to serve as a}} circuit court judge, but {{resigned}} after only a year; he found that he preferred to practice law. By 1854 he was active in Indiana politics. Initially, Morton was an anti-slavery Democrat, but living in a region dominated by the Whig Party he had <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> furthering a political career without changing his party affiliation. Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which repealed the Missouri Compromise's ban on slavery in the western territories, beyond Missouri, had a divisive effect on both parties. As the Democrats divided over the issue, Morton took a stand with the Free Soil supporters and opposed the Act. Under the influence of U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the state's Democrats expel its anti-slavery members, including Morton, from the Indiana state convention in 1854. That same year Morton joined with other political factions to form the People's party, the forerunner to the state's Republican party.|$|E
5|$|On 1October 1965, a {{group of}} Indonesian National Armed Forces members calling {{themselves}} the 30September Movement killed six Army generals and announced {{that the president was}} under their power; the coup was quashed the following day. Contemporary reports indicated that the PKI had been behind the G30S, a position endorsed by the Indonesian government. As a result, hundreds of thousands of registered and suspected PKI members were killed or exiled over the following decade, effectively destroying the Party. By 1974 Buru held some 10,000prisoners, while others were held elsewhere or forced to stay abroad. Political prisoners began to be released by the 1970s, but saw systematic discrimination at all levels of society: they found themselves under surveillance and with <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> employment.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians sent 8,000 hoplites, led by Aristides, {{along with}} 600 Plataean exiles {{to join the}} Allied army. The army then marched in Boeotia across the passes of Mount Cithaeron, {{arriving}} near Plataea, and above the Persian position on the Asopus. Under {{the guidance of the}} commanding general, Pausanias, the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground. Knowing that he had <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension among the Allies or lure them down into the plain. Plutarch reports that a conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius' attempts of intrigue within the Greek ranks.|$|E

But he kept stolidly at work, perhaps with a larger trust than he knew. And then, one day, he received a letter addressed in a handwriting that made his heart leap, though he had seen it but once, when it conveyed the news of Sir William Dornton's sudden illness. It was from Miss Eversleigh, but the postmark was Callao!

5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E
5|$|Events at Ulm {{were now}} {{reaching}} a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments {{and on the}} 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack {{began to realize that}} there was <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, Ségur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, {{but the vast majority of}} the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, Johann von Klenau, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Prince Liechtenstein, and Ignaz Gyulai.|$|E
5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E

5|$|Themistocles {{first went}} to live in exile in Argos. However, perceiving that they now had a prime {{opportunity}} to bring Themistocles down for good, the Spartans again levelled accusations of Themistocles's complicity in Pausanias's treason. They demanded that he be tried by the 'Congress of Greeks', rather than in Athens, although it seems {{that in the end}} he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial. Perhaps realising he had <b>little</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> surviving this trial, Themistocles fled, first to Kerkyra, and thence to Admetus, king of Molossia. Themistocles's flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in Athens, his property to be confiscated. It should be noted that both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles. The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus, threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles. Admetus, however, allowed Themistocles to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way. Themistocles then fled from Greece, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.|$|E
