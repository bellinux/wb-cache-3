A 1990 U.S. Appeals Court decision, High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, upheld the denial of security clearances to homosexual employees of government contractors. In 1992, U.S. Army Col.

500|$|The erotic {{nature of}} the books has been noted as adding to their uniqueness. Loewenstein remarks on the {{intensity}} of Laura's passion: [...] "The presentation of a woman as a joyfully aggressive person is, in itself, a rare achievement in 1957". A 2002 retrospective of Bannon's books claims [...] "there were more explicit and nuanced representations of sexuality in those paperbacks than could be found almost anywhere else". Author Suzana Danuta Walters represents the eroticism in Bannon's books {{as a form of}} rebellion. In the Harvard Gay & <b>Lesbian</b> <b>Review,</b> Jenifer Levin writes, [...] "Know this: Beebo lives.

500|$|Tripp {{was interviewed}} about his book by Thom Willenbecher in Christopher Street magazine. Phil Derbyshire {{dismissed}} The Homosexual Matrix in Gay Left, {{arguing that it}} was based in [...] "bourgeois social science" [...] and that Tripp did not appreciate the role of sexism in supporting taboos against homosexuality, which he viewed through [...] "the ideological forms of advanced capitalism" [...] and therefore misunderstood as a [...] "unitary and trans-historical category", that Tripp had a sexist focus on gay men and mostly ignored lesbians, that he viewed male and female sexuality as [...] "biological givens", and ignored alternative feminist and Marxist accounts of the oppression of gay men and lesbians. Derbyshire contrasted Tripp's work unfavorably {{with that of the}} philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault. The novelist Lewis Gannett, writing in The Gay & <b>Lesbian</b> <b>Review</b> Worldwide, credited Tripp with writing [...] "the first work to explain in cogent psychological terms why homosexuality is not a developmental failure to achieve heterosexuality." [...] According to Gannett, Tripp's view that [...] "gay people and straight people develop their orientations in exactly the same ways" [...] appalled [...] "many clinicians and much of the general public", while Tripp's message, based on [...] "impeccable science", that [...] "homosexuality is an integral and natural component of human sexuality" [...] made an enormous impact, with Pomeroy calling The Homosexual Matrix [...] "the best book I have ever read on the subject of homosexuality". Gannett wrote that the book influenced prominent sex researchers, critics, and the public, and sold nearly half a million copies. Paul Varnell, writing in the Chicago Free Press, described The Homosexual Matrix as one of the ten best non-fiction books relating to homosexuality.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores lesbian experience, or {{the psychological}} meaning of being lesbian {{from the point}} of view of women who call themselves lesbian. The researcher suspended the binary paradigm of sex and gender, and argued that lesbians' identity development must be understood against the background of how patriarchy understands the category 'woman' through history. Towards this purpose the pOSition of women in the West, as well as contemporary images and literature about <b>lesbians,</b> was <b>reviewed.</b> On the basis of this <b>review</b> questions about <b>lesbian</b> gender construction, lesbian identity development and lesbian individuation were identified. In order to access the psychological meaning of being lesbian, or lesbian experience from the inside out, the dream-series of three lesbians constituted an empirical basis for further exploration. These dream-series were amplified with intensive face-to-face interviews, transcribed, and subjected to a hermeneutic-phenomenological inductive method. Common inter-case concerns were identified and synthesized. In dialogue with the literature reviewed, twenty-two statements of meaning about being lesbian were distilled. These revealed two possible constructions of gender for primary lesbians. In addition, primary lesbians involved in the research demonstrated remarkable flexibility with respect to their gender orientations and gender identifications, were in the process of integrating with and differentiating from different aspects of their masculine and feminine potentials, and developed and negotiated their gender identities in relationship to both their lovers and friends. The explication also revealed that participants identified with archetypal aspects of the father that their fathers' did not express, and desired archetypal aspects of the mother that their mother's did not express. Finally, in so much as the method distinguished ~ sex, sexual identity and sexual orientation from gender, gender identity, gender identification and gender orientation, it may prove useful for exploring gender in heterosexual relating. ...|$|R
40|$|Selected nursing {{theories}} about the childbearing experience are examined as t h y a p p b to {{the assessment of the}} pregnant <b>lesbian</b> couple. A <b>review</b> of the women’s health literature sugests that the lesbian pregnancy experience is characterized by the use of donor insemination, social discrimination and a dependence on peer rather than f a m i b networks for social support. Based on these sociocultural constraints, the authors propose that the lesbian couple is faced with greater bar-riers than are heterosexual parents to achieving the dcvelopmentnl tasks of “fafe passage ” and acceptance by others of the pregnancy. Future research should document how a lesbian identi 9 af/ects the pregnant woman’s relationship with her mother, her partner’s psychosocial deve lopmt as a parent and the maternal-infant attachment process. Nursing guidelines for assessing parental role development are presented. W ’ith the growing acceptance of nontraditional childbearing options, a variety of new clients has emerged to challenge traditional approaches to perinatal care.

However, she also found the book overcomplicated and technical.

He wrote that those who considered gender primarily a social construct would dislike it, and that LeVay relied on studies that were open to many objections, such as {{the small size of}} their samples. However, he considered the book necessary to bring together the information from such studies.

40|$|The {{literature}} on career counseling and <b>lesbian</b> women was <b>reviewed</b> {{resulting in the}} identification of 10 maxims regarding providing career counseling to lesbian women. The maxims are as follows: (1) sexual orientation is essential information when providing career counseling; (2) {{it is important that the}} workplace be lesbian-affirming; (3) lesbian women have nothing to protect them from discrimination on the job; (4) potential violence must be discussed; (5) ongoing career counseling needs to be considered for the lesbian woman's career planning; (6) there are several positive aspects to a lesbian being "out " on the job; (7) there are several negative aspects to a lesbian being "out " on the job; (8) not all lesbians fit into the stereotypical careers of lesbian women; (9) geography may be crucial; and (10) if a lesbian is partnered, couples counseling needs to be considered. Each of these maxims was discussed in detail.

25|$|Poetry {{submissions}} began almost immediately, as did {{short story}} submissions with <b>lesbian</b> themes. Book <b>reviews</b> of current paperbacks were regular features, including a heated exchange in print between contributors to The Ladder and author Marijane Meaker as Ann Aldrich from 1957 to 1963. Meaker {{had written the}} immensely successful Spring Fire in 1952 under the name Vin Packer and was known to the Daughters of Bilitis. Meaker's books We Walk Alone from 1955 and We, Too, Must Love from 1958 were her version of Donald Webster Cory's The Homosexual in America, a nonfiction account published in 1951 {{about what it was}} like to live as a gay man in the US. Meaker's books, published by Gold Medal Books, were distributed all over the US, and gave people in remote places an idea of what it was like to live as a lesbian. The books, however, were not particularly sympathetic to lesbians, and Del Martin and Barbara Grier took issue with Meaker's portrayals. They began to criticize the books in The Ladder and suggest that Meaker was expressing self-hatred in the books. Del Martin wrote to Meaker personally in 1958, giving her a free subscription to the magazine. Meaker's reach to women was much broader through the distribution of her books, and she received so much mail from women asking for resources and support that she was unable to respond to all of it, so she referred the letter writers to the Daughters of Bilitis. However, in print, Meaker responded to the open letters to her in The Ladder in her next book Carol in a Thousand Cities in 1960, by skewering the magazine's amateurish homemade appearance, fiction and poetry she did not appreciate, and the ideas presented in the magazine. Again, The Ladder responded, once more calling Meaker's loyalties into question. However negative Carol in a Thousand Cities was to The Ladder, it was major advertising for the DOB and letters poured in for them from all over the U.S.|$|R
