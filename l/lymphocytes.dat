40|$|Background : Department of Health of Republic Indonesia {{data shows}} that the {{majority}} of people with HIV-AIDS in Indonesia are from productive age and one of the possible complication found is cognitive function impairment related to the immunity of the patients. Objective : This study was aimed to investigate the association between total <b>lymphocyte</b> count and CD 4 + T <b>lymphocyte</b> with cognitive impairment in HIVAIDS patients. Method : The design was a cross sectional study, which is conduct at Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang. 32 subjects are HIV-AIDS patients in within inclusion criteria: age ≥ 14 years, could reading and writing. The venous total <b>lymphocyte</b> count and CD 4 + T <b>lymphocyte</b> are examined. Cognitive function was tested using MoCA-Ina. Correlation test were analyzed with Spearman’s rho, cut off value total <b>lymphocyte</b> count with 2 x 2 tabel, cut off value CD 4 + T <b>lymphocyte</b> count with median value. Equivalent value with linier regression Result : Significant correlation was found between total <b>lymphocyte</b> count (r = 0, 392) and CD 4 + T <b>lymphocyte</b> (r = 0, 379) with cognitive function. Total <b>lymphocyte</b> count < 1331 cells/mm 3 and CD 4 + T <b>lymphocyte</b> < 208 cells/mm 3 may caused early cognitive function impairment in productive age HIV-AIDS patient. Positive correlation was found between CD 4 + T <b>lymphocyte</b> with total <b>lymphocyte</b> count (r = 0, 718). CD 4 + T <b>lymphocyte</b> value 200 cells/mm 3 equivalent with total <b>lymphocyte</b> count value 990 cells/mm 3.

40|$|Advanced multivariate data-analytical {{techniques}} are proposed to concisely represent and evaluate complex <b>lymphocyte</b> profiles (i. e., compound <b>lymphocyte</b> subset distributions) of individual subjects in easily interpretable, two-dimensional, graphical correlation biplots.

Thirty minutes after insulin injection plasma glucose levels were markedly decreased; concomitantly, plasma epinephrine levels had increased about 10 -fold; plasma norepinephrine levels, however, increased only moderately. <b>Lymphocyte</b> beta 2 -adrenoceptor density and the cAMP response to 10 mumol/L isoproterenol stimulation were elevated; <b>lymphocyte</b> Ts/c-cells had increased, whereas Th-cells had decreased, resulting in {{a decrease in the}} Th-/Ts/c-cell ratio from 1. 7 to 1. 0.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} if leucocyte volume distribution analysis (LVDA), obtained using a Coulter Counter Model S Plus IV, {{can be used}} to aid differentiation of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (CLPD) subtypes. METHODS: Mean <b>lymphocyte</b> volume and <b>lymphocyte</b> distribution width were measured on each patient (n = 90) using a hard copy of an amplified LVDA histogram. The mean <b>lymphocyte</b> volume was taken as the mean of the values {{on either side of the}} peak at half maximum height. The <b>lymphocyte</b> distribution width was taken as the range of cell values between the two values used to calibrate the mean <b>lymphocyte</b> volume. A template showing typical histograms from commonly occurring CLPD was also produced on an acetate sheet. This was used to examine the histogram from each new patient to evaluate its usefulness as an alternative to the calculation of mean <b>lymphocyte</b> volume and <b>lymphocyte</b> distribution width. RESULTS: Mean <b>lymphocyte</b> volume and <b>lymphocyte</b> distribution width were significantly higher in B cell lymphocytic leukaemia of mixed cell type (B CLL/PL), B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with peripheral blood spill, hairy cell leukaemia and T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia than in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B CLL). The mean <b>lymphocyte</b> volume, but not the <b>lymphocyte</b> distribution width, was also significantly higher in T cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia than in B CLL. The template gave an immediate preliminary indication of possible subtype(s) of disorder and could be used as an alternative to measurement of mean <b>lymphocyte</b> volume and <b>lymphocyte</b> distribution width.

25|$|The {{human body}} has many defense {{mechanisms}} against pathogens, {{one of which}} is humoral immunity. This defence mechanism produces antibodies (large glycoproteins) in response to an immune stimulus. Many cells of the immune system are required for this process, including <b>lymphocytes</b> (T-cells and B-cells) and antigen presenting cells. These cells coordinate an immune response upon the detection of foreign proteins (antigens), producing antibodies that bind to these antigens. In normal physiology, <b>lymphocytes</b> that recognise human proteins (autoantigens) either undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) or become non-functional. This self-tolerance means that <b>lymphocytes</b> should not incite an immune response against human cellular antigens. Sometimes, however, this process malfunctions and antibodies are produced against human antigens, which may lead to autoimmune disease.|$|E
