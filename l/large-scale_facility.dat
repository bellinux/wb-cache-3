40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies the}} fixed-charge {{facility}} location problem—an important problem in logistics and operations {{research that has}} wide application to many areas of commerce and industry. The problem is to locate {{a small number of}} facilities among nodes in a network to provide good service to the client nodes while confining the total construction cost. The problem is NP-hard, but of sufficient importance to warrant developing practical heuristics. To handle large instances, we propose an algorithm based on recent advances in belief propagation and graphical models. In particular, we adapt a form of affinity propagation to approximate the problem at hand. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over other popular heuristics for <b>large-scale</b> <b>facility</b> location problems.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis is divided in the five main chapters. First chapter generally defines the term ?contamination?, which {{is closely related to}} the decontamination. Second chapter is focused on the microbial contamination, defines infectious agents, the mechanisms of its spread and points out microbes most likely to be misused as a biological weapon. Third chapter of the {{theoretical part}} addresses the decontamination itself. It defines the decontamination in general aiming for microbial decontamination, i. e. the biological agent surface and environment removal. Two basic groups of decontamination e. g. physical and chemical procedures are mentioned in this chapter. Fourth chapter presents valid standards describing various types of examinations for the desinfecting preparations efficacy evaluation. The last chapter of the theoretical part covers large-scale facilities, defines them and describes experimental facilities at the Department of large-scale testing in the National institute for nuclear, chemical and biological protection in Kamenna. The aim of the thesis is to create own methodology of the disinfactant efficiency testing with emphasis on the real condition simulation. The decontamination was carried out by means of following methods: aerosol generator method, decontamination by evaporation, manual sprayer and engine sprayer respectively. For the analysis we chose these disinfactants: Chirosan? Plus, Incidin OxyDes, Kohrsolin? FF, Korsolex? basic, Persteril? 36 and Sanosil? Super 25 Ag. The disinfectant efficiency was tested in 30, 60 and 120 m 3 facilities. The tested B-agents were: Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus atrophaeus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. For the decontamination efficiency verification we used a modified surface assay, a modified suspension assay and an agarose assay. The following issues were of concern: We found out that, based on the analysis of different techniques of decontamination, the <b>large-scale</b> <b>facility</b> decontamination is feasible. The most effective method of decontamination appears the manual and engine spraying with the latter more convenient for spaces over the 30 m 3 in the matter of time. The decontamination by evaporation was inefficient for the <b>large-scale</b> <b>facility</b> decontamination. Experiments revealed that method based on aerosol distribution is convenient for <b>large-scale</b> <b>facility</b> decontamination. However, the nature of decontaminating preparation has to be considered. All disinfactants tested have shown good bactericidal activity. Nevertheless, only Korsolex? basic a Persteril? 36 have shown sufficient sporicidal activity with equal effect. The disadvantage of the preparation Persteril? 36 is its significant corrosive activity, on the other hand is inexpensive. The preparation Korsolex? basic contains anticorrosive compounds, but is more expensive than Persteril? 36. Our results demonstrated that the most convenient method for the decomtamination of facilities up to the 30 m 3 is the manual aerosol sprayer. For facilities of larger volume the engine sprayer decontamination is more convenient. From the preparations tested, only Korsolex? basic a Persteril? 36 are, with respect to advantages and disadvantages, usable in the Department of large-scale testing in the National institute for nuclear, chemical and biological protection in Kamenna...|$|E

When mice were exposed to radon at 2000 day•Bq/m 3, activation of SOD activities in plasma, liver, pancreas, heart, thymus, and kidney showed dose–rate effects. Our results also suggested that continuous exposure to radon increased SOD activity, but SOD activity transiently returned to normal levels at around 2 days. Moreover, we classified the organs into four groups (1. plasma, brain, lung; 2. heart, liver, pancreas, small intestine; 3. kidney, thymus; 4. stomach) based on changes in SOD activity.
