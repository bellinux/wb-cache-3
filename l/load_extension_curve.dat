The ‘In press‘ version is available at [URL] of the main engineering challenges for floating marine renewable energy devices is the design of reliable, yet cost-effective mooring solutions for the harsh and dynamic marine environment. The mooring system must be able to withstand the ultimate limit state during storm conditions as well as the fatigue limit state due to the highly cyclic wave motions. This paper presents the performance and service simulation testing of a novel mooring tether that combines the material properties of elastomeric and thermoplastic elements. This allows to 'tailor' the load-extension curve to exhibit a low stiffness response for the expected normal, operating, load conditions and a high stiffness response for the envisaged extreme, storm, conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the working principle of the mooring element and show good agreement between the theoretical <b>load</b> <b>extension</b> <b>curve</b> and the conducted performance tests with a distinct hysteresis effect caused by the thermoplastic element. The hysteresis is dependant on the applied pre-tension and load cycle amplitude of the element {{and to a lesser extent}} on the cycle frequency. The relaxation of the elastomeric element is quantified, giving insight into the expected longterm performance of the tether. The demonstrated working principle and the possibility to tailor the mooring response allows engineers to load- and cost-optimise the mooring system of floating marine energy converters.

The elongation can be read with precision {{with the aid of a}} micrometer device and an indicator which has an attach-ment for practically eliminating parallactic errors. Read-ings are taken in the state of substantial equilibrium of load-versus-extension. With this machine it is possible to give special consideration to such critical points as the yield point. The instrument lends itself readily, further-more, to the determination of hysteresis loops and also to the investigation of crimp in yarns. Reliable data are given of <b>load</b> <b>extension</b> <b>curves</b> of representative synthetic yarns. In addition to taking the stretch-versus-tension diagrams, as such, the hysteresis loops are determined for various points of the load-strain curve and their theoretical and practical importance is discussed.

40|$|Fracture {{toughness}} of {{bulk materials}} {{is a topic}} of classical measurements, but that of thin films, especially hard and superhard thin films, is a different matter owing to specimen dimensions (thickness) and lack of convincing test procedure. Fracture toughness {{is the ability of}} a material to resist the growth of a pre-existing crack. For thin films, however, the testing usually includes crack initiation together with crack propagation thus the result {{is not the same as}} the classical “fracture toughness”. For thin films, it is better to use term “toughness” to avoid confusion. For engineering applications, it is of vital importance that the toughness of thin films be evaluated with a convincing method and procedure. This paper presents a new and relatively easy method in which two-step uniaxial tensile test is performed to characterise toughness of ceramic thin films. In the test, the film/substrate system is subjected to uniaxial tensile stress until the film fractures. After the load is removed to allow complete elastic recovering, this system is subjected to a second loading to the earlier extension. The toughness of the thin film is derived from the energy difference between the two subsequent <b>loading</b> <b>extension</b> <b>curves.</b> The crack initiation and propagation patterns are examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM). As an example, toughness of a nc-TiN/a-SiNx nanocomposite thin film has been tested with satisfactory results...|$|R

40|$|Some tough, {{crystalline}} polymers {{can fail}} by fast brittle fracture. This thesis explores {{the role of}} ductile 'shear lips', which form at the fracture surface verges, in brittle-tough transitions. A new laboratory method was used to isolate this region, and to test its ability to draw rapidly, in polyethylenes. The test uses a conventional Charpy type specimen that is deeply notched and impact loaded in three-point bending by a single striker. The ligament, rapidly loaded in almost pure tension, first yields, and then necks down until failure. Initial results are encouraging and correlate well with the in-service performance. A fundamental study of large strain deformation, that avoids the complexity associated with impact tests, was then conducted {{with the aim of}} isolating the dominating influences that furnish a polymer with the ability to sustain rapid large strain deformation. True stress vs. true strain curves have been interpreted using the one dimensional spring dashpot model of Haward and Thackray (H-T). The analysis led to the computation of <b>load</b> <b>extension</b> <b>curves</b> in both plane strain compression and uniaxial tension and has successfully simulated analogous necking and drawing behaviour at rates spanning both isothermal and adiabatic conditions. The excellent comparison between computed results and those measured experimentally vindicates use of the HT model and corroborates the physical principles upon which it is based. Finally, the relevance of this behaviour to craze fibril drawing, and hence to fracture, is explored.

This paper demonstrates a technique, which is novel and relatively simple, to evaluate the stretchability of Mozzarella cheese objectively. In an oil bath, melted cheese is stretched by a hook probe, controlled by an Instron tensile tester (Instron Corp., Norwood, MA); cheese strands are lifted from the melted cheese reservoir to a stretch length of 300 mm, when the <b>load</b> and <b>extension</b> data are recorded by the Instron tensile tester. This test overcomes other tests' drawbacks, such as subjective stretching speeds and variations in ambient temperature and humidity. Through the test comparison on standard Mozzarella, the modified stretching test in an oil bath has greater repeatability than the original test without oil bath. From the <b>load</b> and <b>extension</b> <b>curve,</b> the yield <b>load</b> is measured to evaluate the stretchability. In the meantime, the inversion point extension of necking is also measured based on polymer study, producing more repeatable results than the yield load.

The values of the CTOD/CTOA are initially high at initiation, but rapidly decrease to a nearly constant value. When the common practice is adopted by using only the constant part of CTOD/CTOA as the fracture criterion, the crack growth behavior is shown to be severely underestimated. However, with a bilinear form of CTOD/CTOA fracture criterion which approximates the initial non-constant portion, the experimental <b>load</b> vs. crack <b>extension</b> <b>curves</b> can be closely predicted.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the study of cavitation behaviour of two-phase superplastic alloys, using mainly a hot microhardness technique. Cavitation is a serious problem in copper and iron base alloys, it drastically limits the elongation to failure and may affect the service properties of superplastically formed components. There is some empirical evidence to suggest that, for cavitation to occur, the two phases involved must be 'incompatible' that is, they show marked differences in certain properties. Ideally, this phenomenon would be investigated directly by an in-situ study of the deformation behaviour of each phase separately in the microduplex alloy at the superplastic temperature and hence pinpointing the phase incompatibilities, but existing techniques do not allow for this. Here, a hot microhardness tester was commissioned and used to determine the hardness and activation energy of each phase in-situ in a duplex alloy in thc superplastic temperature range. Zn/Al eutectoid and 60 / 40 brass were here used as models to represent a non-cavitating and cavitating class of superplastic alloys. In addition, a series of alloys were produced of compositions corresponding to those of the individual phases in these systems over a supcrplastic temperature range. These alloys were hot tensile. tested to find the ductility and ten'fle strength of each phase of superplastic alloy. The hot hardness data was correlated with the hot tensile data for the alloys over the whole temperature range from 0. 4 to 0. 84 Tm. Variation of Young's modulus with temperature was determined by a vibration technique and activation energy calculated form LnH versus Tm plots for all the alloys. In 60; 40 brass, the amount E of -T cavitation decreased with an increase in temperatur% and this alloy gave a maximum elongation of ti 110 pct at 250 °C 1, 0. 45 Trrj, but it still exhibited extensive cavitation. In the Zn/Al eutectoid, no cavitation was observed apart from that associated with a few large inclusions. The hardness values of the two phases in a/ß brass were very different at the superplastic temperature, as were the <b>load</b> <b>extension</b> <b>curves</b> from the tensile tests and the calculated activation energies. In. the Zn/Al eutectoid however, the mechanical properties of the two phases were similar, though the activation energies were different. Finally, an attempt was made to explain the occurrence of cavitation in Supral 150 and certain steels, in some cases experimentally and in others from data available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{the common}} belief that crack {{propagation}} {{behavior can be}} predicted successfully by employing fracture criteria based on a constant crack tip opening displacement or angle (CTOD/CTOA), this paper shows that the initially non-constant portion of the CTOD/CTOA plays {{an essential role in}} predicting the fracture load for a growing crack. Three- and two-dimensional finite element analyses indicate that a severe underestimate of the experimental <b>load</b> vs. crack <b>extension</b> <b>curve</b> would occur if a constant CTOD/CTOA criterion is used. However, the use of a simplified, bilinear CTOD/CTOA criterion including its non-constant portion will closely duplicate the test data. Furthermore, as a result of using the experimental data from J-integral test with various crack length to specimen width ratios (a/W), it is demonstrated that the CTOD/CTOA is crack tip constraint dependent. The initially higher values of the CTOD/CTOA are in fact a natural consequence of crack growth process which is refl ected by the J-resistance curve and its slope (tearing modulus) ...|$|R

In this paper, an analytical method is developed for determining the crack <b>extension</b> resistance <b>curve</b> of concrete. It is assumed that, when the difference in stress intensity factor caused by external forces and by the cohesive stress within the fracture process zone {{is equal to the}} initial cracking toughness, crack propagation is initiated. According to this assumption, the crack <b>extension</b> resistance <b>curve</b> of concrete is expressed analytically as either the stress intensity factor caused by external forces, or the sum of the initial cracking toughness and the stress intensity factor by the cohesive stress within the fracture process zone. One advantage of this method is that, unlike other methods, the experimentally measured load-crack mouth opening displacement curve is not required in calculating the crack <b>extension</b> resistance <b>curve.</b> Based on numerical results, it is found that the crack <b>extension</b> resistance <b>curve</b> is independent of initial crack length.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of the force versus <b>extension</b> <b>curves</b> in stretched single stranded DNA, under conditions where the hydrogen bonding between complementary bases is inhibited, provide a new handle {{for the study of}} self-avoiding effects in a flexible polymer. We report in this paper upon analytic computations of the force versus <b>extension</b> <b>curves</b> within a continuous version of the freely joining chain model, with monomermonomer repulsive interactions. The problem is formulated as a Statistical Field Theory model, endowed with a fixed cutoff associated with the curvature of the <b>extension</b> versus force <b>curve,</b> in the free polymer limit. Using a Field Theory version of the Hartree-Fock approximation, the self-avoiding single polymer problem reduces to the solving of a one-dimension self-consistent integral equation. Taking the short range potential limit, we obtain an explicit analytical solution, involving the roots of an algebraic equation. In the low force regime, we find that the slope of the relative extension at zero force increases steadily with the total monomer number N, while it stays constant for a free polymer. We compare, for N = 100, our analytic results with those obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of a discrete freely joining chain, in presence of excluded volume effects. Despite a difference between the repulsive potential ranges d, an appropriate choice of our single free parameter leads to a good agreement between the two computations. This may be considered as an indication that the shape of the <b>extension</b> <b>curve</b> is not very sensitive to d, if it is equal to or less than the monomer length...|$|R

40|$|Graphite {{has high}} {{in-plane}} thermal conductivity {{and is a}} potential candidate to combat the thermal management problems in high density electronic devices. However, the properties of graphite are not fully exploited and this study was carried out {{with the aim of}} fabricating and analysing high thermally conducting graphite based composites. Model composites were prepared with three different average flake sizes: 180 μm, 300 μm and 600 μm. The constituents(flakes and binders) were characterised in terms of density, carbon yield and crystallographic perfection using combination of techniques. The electrical resistivity of a single flake was found to be 0. 6 μS 2 m. A fabrication route was developed using 75 % starting volume fraction (67 % - 72 %) estimated volume fraction in the composite) of small flake graphite. A high volume fraction was used so as to obtain composites with properties dominated by the flakes. The selection of the optimum route of fabrication was based on achieving the lowest electrical resistivity of the composite after carbonisation (1000 °C). An extensive study was carried out on composites prepared using 75 % (starting volume fraction) flakes. The mis-alignment of the 002 plane was found to decrease with an increase in the flake size. The optical texture of small flake composites showed that the binder was inhomogeneously distributed and was observed to shrink away from the flakes whereas in the case of composites with large flakes, the binder was found to wet the flakes. The layers of the binder were also found to align along the basal planes of the flakes {{in the vicinity of the}} flakes. The composites with small flakes were found to be `brittle' whereas the large flake composites showed a more `ductile' behaviour. The Young's modulus and work-of-fracture were estimated from <b>load</b> versus <b>extension</b> <b>curves.</b> Raman studies showed an increase in the a-direction coherence length in the binder with an increase in heat-treatment temperature and the electrical resistivity of the composites was found to decrease with increase in flake size and heat-treatment temperature. The thermal conductivities were determined and samples were imaged in a thermal microscope. Comparison between quantitative thermal conductivity and that predicted using Lavin's relationship showed that Lavin's relationship is not applicable to these composites. A thermal conductivity of 655 W/m K (160 % of that of copper) was achieved in graphitised large flake composites. The volume fraction of graphite was varied (estimated volume fraction 45 %- 75 % in the composite) and graphitised large flake composites were studied. The density of the composites increased with an increase in the volume fraction whereas the mis-alignment of the 002 plane was found to decrease with an increase in the estimated volume fraction of graphite up to - 70 %. When the estimated volume fraction of graphite was further increased (- 75 %), the mis-alignment was found to increase. This was attributed to the microstructure which showed high packing density giving rise to twisting and distortion of flakes in the composite. Existing composite-type models failed to correctly predict the transport properties and hence, a first approach to developing a model specifically for these composites was attempted. However, due to their complex nature and insufficient information to define the modelling parameters its validity is uncertain. A thermal conductivity of 750 W/m K (190 % that of copper) and density - 1. 8 g/cm 3 (nearly one fourth of that of copper) and all this at relatively lower cost was achieved in graphitised large flake composites with - 75 % estimated volume fraction of graphite.

40|$|In this thesis, a new {{modeling}} methodology {{applicable to}} adhesively bonded joints for crash simulations is presented. Using this approach, adhesive joints can be modeled without using minute solid elements thus reducing {{the size of}} the model. Moreover, coarse mesh can be used for substrates in the overlap region of a joint. Both of these improvements together yield significant reduction in simulation run times in crash analysis when compared to solid element representation of adhesive. The modeling can also capture effects of strain rate for a given ambient temperature. In order to develop the efficient modeling procedure mentioned above, experimental, analytical and numerical studies have been carried out. Mechanical behaviors of adhesively bonded joints are studied with the help of double lap shear (DLS) coupon tests conducted at different extension rates and temperatures. The joint specimens are made from dual-phase (DP) steel coupons bonded with epoxy resin. Tests are also carried out to ascertain the behaviors of these component materials at different extension rates and temperatures. A new semi-analytical solution procedure is developed considering material nonlinearity to predict mechanical behaviors of adhesively bonded DLS joints. The joint behaviors using the semi-analytical approach are predicted separately using the Von Mises and exponent Drucker-Prager yield criteria. The predicted force versus <b>extension</b> <b>curves</b> using semi-analytical solution are compared with test results. It is also hypothesized here that, the semi-analytical solution procedure {{can be used as a}} base to develop efficient modeling procedures of adhesively bonded joints in FEA.
