40|$|Abstract. Several tag {{models with}} {{intriguing}} properties have been advanced recently. But currently {{there is little}} detailed understanding of the underlying processes. Specifically it is not know what (if any) are the necessary conditions for tag systems to produce high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation.</b> We identify, for the first time, {{what appears to be}} a necessary condition that previous tag models implicitly contained. It appears that, in general, for tag-based systems to support high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> tags must mutate faster than strategies because cooperative tag groups need to spread (by mutation of tags) before free riders (by mutation on strategies) invade the group.

40|$|Humans show great {{flexibility}} in adjusting their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{to account for}} current and future circumstances. For example, <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> are higher if there is more competition at the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the whole population than with interacting partners [1] and when individuals are likely to gain social prestige [2]. Humans also show the capacity to increase current <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> to account for future payoffs if {{it is likely that}} repeated interactions will occur with the same partner (known as ‘the Shadow of the Future’) [3]. Here, we provide the first evidence for this capacity in a non-human animal, the cleaner fish Labroides bicolor. L. bicolor individuals show uneven frequency of use of different areas within a large home range, which should in turn affect the delay between repeated interactions with individual reef fish ‘clients’. In areas where the frequency of clients encountering cleaners is higher, cleaners are more likely to experience future costs of cheating, so future payoffs are of more concern for current decisions. In line with this, we found a negative correlation between cheating and the frequency of clients encountering cleaners in L. bicolor home ranges...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores EU-Brazil {{relations}} and answers {{the question of}} why these two actors have failed to use the bilateral <b>level</b> <b>of</b> their <b>cooperation</b> as a platform to enhance their coordination in multilateral arenas. The thesis develops a framework to explain the linkage between <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> within a particular bilateral relationship that focuses on both agents and issues. The argument of “level-linkage” is empirically tested in three case-studies: climate change, trade, and human rights. The thesis finds that the greater the openness of a regime to influences from other <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation,</b> the more likely level-linkage is to occur. However, level-linkage is restricted to where the approaches of the two partners towards multilateralism are compatible. Preferences for partners were also not the main constraint to the promotion of an EU-Brazil strategic partnership in multilateral arenas. Instead, as this thesis reveals, the degree of coordination in national foreign policy-making institutions is the key determinant of level-linkage. These findings support the argument that the dynamics between agents and the specificities of issues do matter in explaining the relation between bilateral and multilateral <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation.</b> In this light, this thesis contributes to the analysis of bilateral relationships within a multi-level structure, ultimately advancing academic research in international cooperation. It also contributes to the literature on foreign policy analysis and to an emerging body of scholarship in EU-Brazil relations...|$|R

The Venetians claimed they could not intervene directly, and encouraged the Mamluk Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri to take action by getting into contact with Indian princes at Cochin and Cananor to entice them not to trade with the Portuguese, and the Sultans of Calicut and Cambay to fight against them. Some sort of alliance was thus concluded between the Venetians and the Mamluks against the Portuguese. There were claims, voiced during the War of the League of Cambrai, that the Venetians had supplied the Mamluks with weapons and skilled shipwrights.|$|E

In May 1991, the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde, or ZNG) was formed as the military of Croatia and was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska, or HV) in November. Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the Battle of the Barracks, the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In January 1992, a ceasefire agreement to implement the Vance plan was signed by representatives of Croatia, the JNA, and the UN, and fighting paused. The Vance plan was designed to stop hostilities in Croatia and allow negotiations by neutralizing any influence caused by fighting, but offered no political solutions in advance. The plan entailed deployment of the 10,000-person United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the major conflict areas known as [...] "UN Protected Areas" [...] (UNPAs). UNPROFOR was tasked with creating a buffer between the belligerents, disarming Croatian Serb elements of the TO, overseeing JNA and HV withdrawal from the UNPAs, and return of refugees to the area. United Nations Security Council Resolution 743 of 21 February 1992 described the legal basis of the UN mission that had been requested and agreed upon in November 1991, and made no explicit reference to Chapter VI or Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Only a reference to Chapter VII would have permitted the peacekeeping force to enforce its mandate regardless of the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> of the belligerents.|$|E
40|$|Reciprocity and {{repeated}} games {{have been at}} the center of attention when studying the evolution <b>of</b> human <b>cooperation.</b> Direct reciprocity is considered to be a powerful mechanism for the evolution <b>of</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and it is generally assumed that it can lead to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Here we explore an open-ended, infinite strategy space, where every strategy that can be encoded by a finite state automaton is a possible mutant. Surprisingly, we find that direct reciprocity alone does not lead to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Instead we observe perpetual oscillations between cooperation and defection, with defection being substantially more frequent than cooperation. The reason for this is that "indirect invasions" remove equilibrium strategies: every strategy has neutral mutants, which in turn can be invaded by other strategies. However, reciprocity is not the only way to promote cooperation. Another mechanism for the evolution <b>of</b> <b>cooperation,</b> which has received as much attention, is assortment because of population structure. Here we develop a theory that allows us to study the synergistic interaction between direct reciprocity and assortment. This framework is particularly well suited for understanding human interactions, which are typically repeated and occur in relatively fluid but not unstructured populations. We show that if repeated games are combined with only a small amount of assortment, then natural selection favors the behavior typically observed among humans: high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> implemented using conditional strategies...|$|R

40|$|SummaryHumans {{may help}} others even in situations where the {{recipient}} will not reciprocate [1 – 5]. In some cases, such {{behavior can be}} explained by the helpers increasing their image score, which will increase the probability that bystanders will help them in the future [5 – 7]. For other animals, the notion that many interactions take place in an environment containing an audience of eavesdropping bystanders has also been proposed to have important consequences for social behavior, including <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> [8]. However, experimental evidence is currently restricted to the demonstration that cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus can learn to solve a foraging task [9]. The cleaners learned to feed against their preference on artificial clients if that allowed them to access additional artificial clients, which would translate into cooperatively eating ectoparasites rather than cheating by eating client mucus under natural conditions [10]. Here we show that cleaners immediately increase current <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the presence of bystander client reef fish. Furthermore, we find that bystanders respond to any occurrence of cleaners cheating their current client with avoidance. In conclusion, the results demonstrate, for the first time, that image scoring by an audience indeed leads to increased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> in a nonhuman animal...|$|R
