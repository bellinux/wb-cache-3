500|$|My {{survey of}} Rasay did not furnish much which can {{interest}} my readers; I shall therefore put into as short a compass as I can, the observations upon it, which I find registered in my journal. It is about fifteen English miles long, and four broad. On {{the south side}} is the laird’s family seat, situated on a pleasing <b>low</b> <b>spot.</b> The old tower of three stories, mentioned by Martin, was taken down soon after 1746, and a modern house supplies its place. There are very good grass-fields and corn-lands about it, well dressed. I observed, however, hardly any inclosures, except a good garden plentifully stocked with vegetables, and strawberries, raspberries, currants, ...|$|E

2500|$|The Valparaiso Moraine is the {{dominant}} geologic form that created the various landscape forms of the Indiana Dunes, about 40,000 YBP. [...] Within the arc created by the Valparaiso Moraine are two younger recessional moraines of the Tinley Moraine and the Lake Border Moraine. Each moraine created an artificial dam across the southern outflow of the melt waters of the receding glaciers. [...] As each glacial lake breached a <b>low</b> <b>spot</b> in the moraines, water levels receded, leaving a series of shorelines and dune ridges.|$|E

2500|$|From this <b>low</b> <b>spot,</b> Porter made a {{conspicuous}} comeback, in 1948, with Kiss Me, Kate. It {{was by far}} his most successful show, running for 1,077 performances in New York and 400 in London. The production won the Tony Award for best musical (the first Tony awarded in that category), and Porter won for best composer and lyricist. The score includes [...] "Another Op'nin', Another Show", [...] "Wunderbar", [...] "So In Love", [...] "We Open in Venice", [...] "Tom, Dick or Harry", [...] "I've Come to Wive It Wealthily in Padua", [...] "Too Darn Hot", [...] "Always True to You (in My Fashion)", and [...] "Brush Up Your Shakespeare".|$|E
2500|$|A {{saddle dam}} is an {{auxiliary}} dam constructed to confine the reservoir {{created by a}} primary dam either to permit a higher water elevation and storage or to limit the extent of a reservoir for increased efficiency. An auxiliary dam is constructed in a <b>low</b> <b>spot</b> or [...] "saddle" [...] through which the reservoir would otherwise escape. On occasion, a reservoir is contained by a similar structure called a dike to prevent inundation of nearby land. Dikes are commonly used for reclamation of arable land from a shallow lake. This {{is similar to a}} levee, which is a wall or embankment built along a river or stream to protect adjacent land from flooding.|$|E
2500|$|Feighnter was {{assigned}} as the Navy's project pilot for the Vought F7U Cutlass, a carrier-based jet fighter-bomber with swept wings and an unusual tailless design. From July 23 to August 14, 1951, he performed carrier suitability {{tests of the}} Cutlass on board the USS Midway. Feightner survived a number of near-fatal incidents in the Cutlass. During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a <b>low</b> <b>spot</b> in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine. On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier [...] Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme nose-up attitude that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the Landing Signal Officer (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly struck the ramp. Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did {{not live up to}} its potential and remained in service less than four years.|$|E

2500|$|Expansion of the Alexander Crummell School was {{proposed}} {{several times over}} the next six decades, to no avail. [...] A six-room, $100,000 addition was approved the DCPS in 1924, but cut by Congress every time it {{was proposed}} from 1924 to 1927. By 1930, the school was no longer in good condition. The building was constructed on a <b>low</b> <b>spot</b> on the site, which meant that water (sometimes [...] deep) ponded on the property when it rained. The old coal heating system failed to keep the school warm in winter, and covered the walls in soot. The playground was far too small to accommodate the school's growing enrollment, and there was no gymnasium or assembly hall. A $36,000 two-room addition was proposed in 1931, a $25,000 two-room addition in 1932, and a $10,800 doubling of the school's size in 1933. No action was taken on these proposals. [...] The Great Depression and World War II limited funding for school construction. Ivy City continued to grow in the 1930s and 1940s, and in 1949 local residents asked the city to build an eight-room addition and pool for the school as well as expand the playground. A similar request was made in 1950, with residents also demanding an assembly hall and gymnasium. An addition was proposed in 1954 and a 12-room addition, auditorium, and modernization of the heating and lighting requested in 1957. These requests were also turned down.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor had {{thoughts}} of retiring {{by the time}} he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. [...] "I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while," [...] he recalled in 1995. [...] "I sort of hit a <b>low</b> <b>spot.</b> I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track." [...] The song [...] "Only a Dream in Rio" [...] was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song [...] "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61. On the album track [...] "Only You," [...] the backing vocals were performed by an all star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.|$|E

60|$|This {{place was}} the lowest point of the valley, in that {{particular}} location, and must have been upwards of two hundred feet below sea level. The <b>lowest</b> <b>spot,</b> called the Sink Hole, lay some miles distant, and was the terminus of this river of salty white.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} objects of the scene, from Ravenshaw's point of view, was poor Winklemann's house--a small one which stood on a <b>low</b> <b>spot</b> already surrounded by water. In front of it was Winklemann himself, wading through the flood, without coat or hat, and carrying a large bundle in his arms.|$|E
60|$|On the {{farthest}} bank of this brook, we perceived some huts of negroes, not many, {{and in a}} little <b>low</b> <b>spot</b> of ground, some maize, or Indian corn, growing, which intimated presently to us, {{that there were some}} inhabitants on that side less barbarous than what we had met with in other places where we had been.|$|E
60|$|We {{passed an}} anxious night, fearful of again {{breaking}} our anchor or rattan cable. In the morning (23d), finding all secure, I waded on shore with my two men, leaving the old steersman and the cook on board, with a loaded musketto recall us if needed. We first {{walked along the}} beach, till stopped by the vertical cliffs at {{the east end of}} the island, finding a place where meat had been smoked, a turtle-shell still greasy, and some cut wood, the leaves of which were still green, showing that some boat had been here very recently. We then entered the jungle, cutting our way {{up to the top of}} the hill, but when we got there could see nothing, owing to the thickness of the forest. Returning, we cut some bamboos, and sharpened them to dig for water in a <b>low</b> <b>spot</b> where some sago-trees were growing; when, just as we were going to begin, Hoi, the Wahai man, called out to say he had found water. It was a deep hole among the Sago trees, in stiff black clay, full of water, which was fresh, but smelt horribly from the quantity of dead leaves and sago refuse that had fallen in. Hastily concluding that it was a spring, or that the water had filtered in, we baled it all out as well as a dozen or twenty buckets of mud and rubbish, hoping by night to have a good supply of clean water. I then went on board to breakfast, leaving my two men to make a bamboo raft to carry us on shore and back without wading. I had scarcely finished when our cable broke, and we bumped against the rocks. Luckily it was smooth and calm, and no damage was done. We searched for and got up our anchor, and found teat the cable had been cut by grating all night upon the coral. Had it given way in the night, we might have drifted out to sea without our anchor, or been seriously damaged. In the evening we went to fetch water from the well, when, greatly to our dismay, we found nothing but a little liquid mud at the bottom, and it then became evident that the hole was one which had been made to collect rain water, and would never fill again as long as the present drought continued. As we did not know what we might suffer for want of water, we filled our jar with this muddy stuff so that it might settle. In the afternoon I crossed over to the other side of the island, and made a large fire, in order that our men might see we were still there.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{during the}} night of May 19–20, dacite lava {{somewhat}} more fluid than that which erupted {{on the night of}} May 14–15 welled up into and filled the new crater at Lassen's summit, spilled over <b>low</b> <b>spots</b> on its rim, and flowed [...] down the steep west and northeast flanks of the volcano.|$|R
50|$|When the {{ice sheet}} melts northward from a moraine, water begins to be ponded between this moraine (aka a divide) {{and the ice}} front. The ice acts as a dam. The water cannot drain through the ice sheet, which for the Wisconsin period covered most of the proglacial river valleys. Numerous small, {{isolated}} water bodies form between the moraine and the ice front. As the ice sheet continues to melt and recede northward, these ponds combine into a proglacial lake. Without an available outlet, the water levels continue to rise until it reaches one or more <b>low</b> <b>spots</b> along {{the rim of the}} moraine, or the ice sheet retreats opening access to a lower portion of the moraine. An outlet forms through these <b>low</b> <b>spots,</b> until one becomes dominant when erosion, lowers the outlet and lake surface.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a drywell with {{a series}} of gravel layers near the <b>lowest</b> <b>spot</b> in the rain garden will help {{facilitate}} percolation. However, a drywell placed at the <b>lowest</b> <b>spot</b> can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an infiltration basin defeating its purpose. Depression-focused recharge of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high water table. In some cases lined bioretention cells with subsurface drainage are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.|$|R
