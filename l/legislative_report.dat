Data were collected from 470 elementary school teachers from urban and rural government and nongovernment schools in 3 Australian states, {{which at the time}} of the study had 3 different <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> duties for teachers. Teachers completed the 8 -part Teacher Reporting Questionnaire (TRQ). Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with (a) teachers’ legislation knowledge and (b) teachers’ policy knowledge. Teachers with higher levels of knowledge had a combination of pre- and in-service training about child sexual abuse and more positive attitudes toward reporting, held administration positions in their school, and had reported child sexual abuse at least once during their teaching career. They were also more likely to work in the state with the strongest <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> duty, which had been in place the longest...|$|R

40|$|Most Australian States and Territories have {{legislation}} compelling {{teachers to}} report suspicions {{that a child}} has been or {{is likely to be}} abused or neglected. However, these 'mandatory reporting' laws have significant differences, so teachers in different States and Territories may have quite different <b>legislative</b> duties to <b>report</b> suspected child abuse and neglect. It is important that teachers have an accurate understanding of what they are and are not required to report under the relevant legislation. Legislators and policymakers should also be aware of the differences between laws in Australian jurisdictions to inform ongoing evaluation of their jurisdiction's legal framework; the current contrast between jurisdictions, and particularly the absence in Western Australia of mandatory reporting legislation, recently prompted the Commonwealth Attorney-General to endorse substantial equality in legislation concerning child protection. The {{purpose of this article is}} first to introduce the broad context of mandatory reporting laws before detailing the <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> obligations of Australian teachers. This synthesis reveals some significant differences in the laws between jurisdictions, thus raising questions for legislators and policymakers. Policy-based reporting obligations, which operate in two States instead of <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> duties, are noted. Questions about future legislative directions are raised, based on current legislative differences, the issue of whether <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> duties are more appropriate and effective in practice than policy-based reporting duties, and the absence of research into teacher knowledge of law and policy and into teacher reporting practice. It is recommended that research be undertaken to help answer these pressing questions...|$|R

40|$|To improve {{detection}} {{of child sexual}} abuse, many jurisdictions have enacted mandatory reporting laws requiring selected persons to report known and suspected cases. In Ireland, the Child First approach previously incorporated only a policy-based approach to reporting. Due to a perceived lack of efficacy, the Children First Bill was drafted in 2012 to shift this policy guidance to a legislative approach. What effects will the new <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> duties have on numbers of reports, and outcomes of reports, of suspected child sexual abuse? This paper will shed light on these important questions by presenting results of analyses of the introduction of <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> obligations in two Australian States. Three questions will be explored: 1. Does introducing reporting legislation result in enhanced {{detection of}} child sexual abuse? 2. Do different reporter groups have different patterns of reporting? 3. What do the patterns of report numbers and outcomes indicate for child protection systems and communities...|$|R
