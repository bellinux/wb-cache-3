50|$|The wet puna is {{composed}} mostly of grasses and shrubs, with sedges and rushes {{in areas with}} poor drainage. Below 4000 m, vegetation in wet areas includes Carex, Juncus, Oreobolus and Scirpus. Above 4000 m, the vegetation in wet areas (called bofedales) includes floating submerged cushion plants. Large cushions are formed by Distichia muscoides, Oxychloe andina, and Plantago rigida. Other genera include Gentiana, Hypsela, Isoetes, <b>Lilaeopsis,</b> Ourisia, and Scirpus. Common trees are Buddleja coriacea and Polylepis spp. Puya raimondii is a giant rosette found here.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lilaeopsis</b> occidentalis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the carrot family known by the common name western grasswort. It is native to the coastline western North America from far southern Alaska to California, where it grows in brackish and salt marshes. This is a perennial herb producing a tuft of thready but stiff and erect grasslike leaves up to about 30 centimeters long from a rhizome network. The minute flowers are located in an umbel on a short stalk. They yield tiny round fruits only 1 or 2 millimeters wide.|$|E
50|$|More than 300 {{species of}} birds, 200 species of {{butterflies}} and 20 species of bats use this corridor as they migrate between South, Central and North America, including the imperiled yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus). More than 80 species of mammals, including jaguar (Panthera onca), coatimundi (Nasua narica), bats, beaver (Castor canadensis frontador), mountain lion, and many rodents; more than 65 species of reptiles and amphibians, including Sonoran tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium stebbinsi) and western barking frog (Eleutherodactylus augusti). Remaining native fish species include the Gila chub (Gila intermedia) which is proposed for federal listing as endangered, and the longfin dace, desert sucker, roundtail chub, Sonora sucker, and speckled dace. The flora includes Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), Goodding willow (Salix gracilistyla), velvet mesquite, sacaton, and the Federally endangered Huachuca water umbel (<b>Lilaeopsis</b> schaffneriana spp. recurva).|$|E

40|$|AbstrAct The Huachuca water umbel (HWU, <b>Lilaeopsis</b> schaffneriana ssp. recurva) is {{a federally}} {{endangered}} aquatic perennial plant endemic to southeastern Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico. The species was listed because of threats {{posed by the}} degradation and loss of wetlands throughout its limited range. Although the species is easily grown in a greenhouse, information regarding specific requirements that allow long-term persistence of HWU in natural habitats is lacking, and few efforts to reintroduce this species have been attempted. Using greenhouse-propagated material, we introduced 128 individual HWU plugs into four spring-fed wetland sites near Elgin, Arizona. The sites represent a range of habitat condi-tions. After two years, overall survival of transplanted plugs was 60 % and the area occupied had increased by 845 %. This study documented the response of transplanted HWU to periodic drying, disturbance due to scouring and trampling, and sediment deposition. We also examined the number of viable seeds incorporated into a seed bank at the study location in the first season after transplanting. This case study offers a model for watershedwide reintroduction efforts of endangered plants. It also illustrates the importance of low-level disturbance {{and the necessity of}} long-term monitoring and maintenance of competing plant species in establishing viable species reintroductions. Key words: endangered species, Huachuca water umbel (<b>Lilaeopsis</b> schaffneriana ssp. recurva), plant introduction, wetland restoration The Huachuca water umbel (HWU, <b>lilaeopsis</b> schaffneriana ssp. recurva) is a rare, herbaceous semiaquatic to fully aquatic perennial plant in the Apiaceae family, endemic to southeastern Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico. It inhabits marshes, rivers, streams, and springs, gener-ally in perennial, shallow, and slow-flowing waters. Thought to require perennial water, gentle stream gra-dients, and mild winters, HWU is usually observed in water 5 – 15 cm deep with muddy or silty substrates that include some organic conten...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} {{oligohaline}} and mesohaline tidal marshes along {{the upper reaches}} of eight tidal rivers in the Great Bay Estuary of New Hampshire was conducted to document the occurrence of eastern grasswort, <b>Lilaeopsis</b> chinensis, a state-listed, rare species. Historical sites were visited to assess the presence, absence, or significant population changes of this rare coastal species. We re-located four of five historically documented element occurrences, noted the plant 2 ̆ 7 s potential expansion on several rivers and a decline at three other sites, and identified a new occurrence on a river system with no prior documented accounts. The results suggest that overall, L. chinensis has been relatively stable for the last 60 years, although the loss of plants at three of the sites suggests it is threatened by continued development (dams and tidal restrictions) and associated impacts to water quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{vegetation}} of montane lagoons of the New England Tablelands Bioregion, New South Wales {{is examined}} using flexible UPGMA analysis of frequency scores on all vascular plant taxa, charophytes and one liverworts. Seven communities are described: 1. Hydrocotyle tripartita – Isotoma fluviatilis – Ranunculus inundatus – <b>Lilaeopsis</b> polyantha herbfield; 2.

40|$|Previous {{molecular}} systematic {{investigations into}} the higher-level relationships of Apiaceae subfamily Apioideae have revealed a strongly supported clade recognised as tribe Oenantheae Dumort. These plants may have clusters of fibrous or tuberous-thickened roots, corky-thickened fruits, and other adaptations for existence in wet or aquatic habitats. In some species, the leaves may be finely dissected or linear-septate and much reduced. We have initiated collaborative studies to produce a comprehensive estimate of phylogeny of the tribe, but such investigations are thwarted because information on {{the composition of the}} tribe is lacking. Herein, tribe Oenantheae is circumscribed to include the following genera: Afrocarum, Berula, Bifora (pro parte), Cicuta, Cryptotaenia (pro parte), Cynosciadium, Daucosma, Helosciadium, <b>Lilaeopsis,</b> Limnosciadium, Neogoezia, Oenanthe, Oxypolis, Perideridia, Ptilimnium, Sium and Trepocarpus. Relationships inferred from phylogenetic analyses of nuclear rDNA ITS sequences from 64 accessions representing all 17 genera reveal that four genera are not monophyletic. Bifora and Cryptotaenia have members that fall outside of the tribe; Berula and Sium each comprise two or more lineages within Oenantheae. The St Helena endemics, Sium bracteatum and S. burchellii, ally with African Berula erecta; this clade is sister to the African endemic species Sium repandum and Afrocarum imbricatum, and this entire group is allied closely with north temperate Berula erecta. Nomenclatural changes are in order, but must await further study. Representatives of eight genera native to North America comprise a monophyletic group, and results from relative rate tests suggest that this lineage is evolving much faster than any other major clade recognised within the tribe...|$|E
