Application of Information Technology in Agriculture; 17. Farmers’ Welfare: Special Attention Needed 18. Upliftment of Agricultural Labourers; 19. Promoting Non-Agricultural Activities in Rural Areas; 20. Karnataka Agriculture Mission – 2007. The State’s approach to agricultural development should now have a new orientation to make the cost-risk-return structure of agriculture remunerative to farmers, a majority of them being small farmers cultivating dry lands. Also, the implementation of various policy measures and programmes.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of food production capacity {{is particularly important}} in small- and medium-sized cities, which have greater chances to develop local periurban farming. To date the literature {{has been focused on}} niche sectors of the food market, such as alternative food networks and public procurement for school canteens, but less {{attention has been paid to}} urban food production. We present a method to assess the food production capacity in periurban areas, which we tested on meat production (beef and lamb) in the urban region of Pisa, a medium-sized Italian city. The capacity of periurban <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> production to fulfil urban demand was assessed on the basis of meat supply and demand. We derived meat demand from statistical data, whereas we calculated meat supply on the basis of three estimates (i. e. potential, current, actual meat supply) taking into account both statistical and on-farm survey data. In particular, the potential meat supply was estimated from statistical data on slaughtered livestock, the current meat supply was estimated from meat production data of on-farm surveys, while the actual meat supply was estimated from the amount of meat sold by farmers on the local market from onfarm surveys. For the urban region of Pisa, we estimated that the potential meat supply met is equal to 16 % of the beef demand and 62 % of the lamb demand. This data could change, if the on-farm data is taken into account in the current supply, as was the case with lamb, which decreased to 37 %, whereas beef remained almost unchanged (14 %). The actual supply was 70 % and 10 % of the current supply for beef and lamb respectively. We identified some gaps between the three estimates, particularly for lamb production, suggesting that it may have some constraints in terms of production and commercialisation. Our results can contribute to assess local food systems and their drivers at the farm level. Furthermore these results also highlight the need for an agronomical approach to food systems based on the analysis of farm activities located in periurban areas in order to quantify the food supply that is actually produced for the local market. Food planning policies, as well as studies at the local level, could take advantage from this method...|$|R

40|$|During {{interviews}} {{carried out}} in 2013, stakeholders from livestock production and NGOs estimated that knowledge and interest {{of the general public}} about modes of production were very limited. So, in 2014, we conducted a survey among baccalaureate (A‐level) students to assess their knowledge, perception and concern for livestock. Thirty‐two master students from AGROCAMPUS‐Ouest (FR) had 1, 083 baccalaureate students fill a questionnaire with 49 questions, divided into five themes: who are you? What do you know about farming? What image do you have of livestock? What do you eat?

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is {{the leading}} cause of {{bacterial}} gastro-enteritis in the developed world. It is thought to infect 2 – 3 million people a year in the US alone, at a cost to the economy in excess of US $ 4 billion. C. jejuni is a widespread zoonotic pathogen that is carried by animals <b>farmed</b> <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> and poultry. A connection with contaminated food is recognized, but C. jejuni is also commonly found in wild animals and water sources. Phylogenetic studies have suggested that genotypes pathogenic to humans bear greatest resemblance to non-livestock isolates. Moreover, seasonal variation in campylobacteriosis bears the hallmarks of water-borne disease, and certain outbreaks have been attributed to contamination of drinking water. As a result, the relative importance of these reservoirs to human disease is controversial. We use multilocus sequence typing to genotype 1, 231 cases of C. jejuni isolated from patients in Lancashire, England. By modeling the DNA sequence evolution and zoonotic transmission of C. jejuni between host species and the environment, we assign human cases probabilistically to source populations. Our novel population genetics approach reveals that the vast majority (97 %) of sporadic disease can be attributed to animals <b>farmed</b> <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> and poultry. Chicken and cattle are the principal sources of C. jejuni pathogenic to humans, whereas wild animal and environmental sources are responsible for just 3 % of disease. Our results imply that the primary transmission route is through the food chain, and suggest that incidenc...|$|R

40|$|Amongst {{possible}} {{economic incentives}} to encourage reduced nitrate contamination of water, this paper emphasizes a nitrogen tax {{as a possible}} solution. This finding is based on models estimated from panel data <b>for</b> 100 intensive <b>livestock</b> <b>farms.</b> <b>For</b> each <b>farm</b> a threshold is established (nitrogen units which can be spread per hectare without damage) above which there is an excess of nitrogen. The 100 farms can consequently be classified into two subsamples. The demand for nitrogen is derived for each sub-sample using the dual approach. Both categories are pooled together and a tobit model is estimated. This is used to derive total nitogen demand if all farms were under the threshold.
