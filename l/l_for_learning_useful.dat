Thus DDFA features are inherently discriminative from the start {{even though they are}} trained without knowledge of the ultimate classification problem. Interestingly, DDFA also continues to add new features indefinitely (so it does not depend on a hidden layer size), is not based on minimizing error, and is inherently divergent instead of convergent, thereby providing a unique direction of research <b>for</b> unsupervised feature <b>learning.</b> In this paper the quality of its learned features is demonstrated on the MNIST dataset, where its performance confirms that indeed DDFA is a viable technique <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> <b>useful</b> features.

In planning, once state {{features are}} provided, domainindependent algorithms such as approximate value iteration can learn weighted combinations of those features that often perform well as heuristic estimates of state value (e. g., distance to the goal). Successful applications in real-world domains often require features crafted by human experts.

We evaluate the method with hypothesis spaces defined by both relational and propositional feature languages, using nine probabilistic planning domains.

40|$|In recent years, deep discriminative {{models have}} {{achieved}} extraordinary performance on supervised learning tasks, significantly outperforming their generative counterparts. However, their success {{relies on the}} presence of a large amount of labeled data. How can one use the same discriminative models <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> <b>useful</b> features in the absence of labels? We address this question in this paper, by jointly modeling the distribution of data and latent features in a manner that explicitly assigns zero probability to unobserved data. Rather than maximizing the marginal probability of observed data, we maximize the joint probability of the data and the latent features using a two step EM-like procedure. To prevent the model from overfitting to our initial selection of latent features, we use adversarial regularization. Depending on the task, we allow the latent features to be one-hot or real-valued vectors and define a suitable prior on the features. For instance, one-hot features correspond to class labels and are directly used for the unsupervised and semi-supervised classification task, whereas real-valued feature vectors are fed as input to simple classifiers for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks. The proposed model, which we dub discriminative encoder (or DisCoder), is flexible in the type of latent features that it can capture. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging tasks. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Mining, 201...|$|R
30|$|In {{striving for}} a better {{understanding}} of motivation <b>for</b> <b>L</b> 2 <b>learning,</b> one widely used framework is Deci and Ryan’s (1985) self-determination theory (SDT). The underlying premise of SDT is that learners who possess intrinsic motivation perform an activity simply for pleasure and innate satisfaction, whereas those who are extrinsically motivated behave in a particular way in order to receive some rewards or to avoid punishment (Dörnyei 2001; Noels 2009). Rather than a dichotomy, there exist varying degrees of self-determination along a continuum depending {{on the extent to which}} regulation is internalized. Extrinsic motivation ranges from external regulation—with the lowest level of self-determination—to introjected regulation, identified regulation, and integrated regulation (Deci and Ryan 2000). Scholarly work more than a decade ago established the validity of the SDT motivational framework <b>for</b> <b>L</b> 2 <b>learning</b> (Noels et al. 1999; 2001; Noels et al. 2000). Since then, the utility and significance of self-determined motivation has not diminished (see Boo et al. 2015; Dörnyei and Ushioda 2013). However, despite the importance of SDT <b>for</b> <b>L</b> 2 <b>learning,</b> relatively few studies have connected self-determined motivation to L 2 listening research, indicating that further research may be needed (Vandergrift 2005, 2007).|$|R

The methodological approach {{of this research is}} qualitative, with semi-structured interviews of six teachers in Norwegian. The informants were selected from a combination of a strategic and snowball sampling, working on three different schools that participates or have participated in the project Assessment <b>for</b> <b>learning.</b> The research argues that the informants to a large extent see working with assessment <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> <b>useful.</b> However the experiences with the investment project itself varies.

The aim of the investment project seems to a large extent to be achieved, as the four principles for formative assessment, embodied in the regulation of the Educational Act, have been implemented. The most visible tendencies in the practice of assessment are: the feedback includes advices for further development, they have reduced the use of grades, they use more time on assessment before and during the process, they use the assessment information to adjust the teaching to involve more students to a larger extent, and the students participates in the assessment process to a larger extent than before...|$|R

Multisite campaigns have in several cases proved highly successful in decoding preÈwhite dwarf light curves. Three previous attempts to untangle the pulsation spectrum of the coolest GW Virginis star, PG 0122 + 200, confirmed the existence of multiple g-modes but left the fundamental period spacing and therefore the star's mass and luminosity in doubt. We present an analysis based on new observations of PG 0122 + 200 obtained during a Whole Earth Telescope (WET) campaign conducted {{in the fall of}} 1996. Although our coverage was, because of bad weather, far poorer than in previous WET campaigns, we confirm the previous result that PG 0122 + 200 rotates once in 1. 6 ± 0. 1 days. The most likely period spacing supported by the data implies a mass of 0. 69 ± 0. 03 Mʘ.

Concerns have been raised about this assumption, however, and questions have been advanced as to whether content-based language classrooms, in their emphasis on subject matter content, actually provide students with conditions claimed theoretically to be necessary <b>for</b> <b>L</b> 2 <b>learning,</b> namely, (1) access to L 2 input, modified toward comprehensibility and illustrative of relationships of L 2 form and meaning; (2) access to feedback focused on L 2 form and on relationships of L 2 form and meaning; and (3) student production of modified output. ^ This dissertation was designed, therefore, to seek evidence for these conditions through a study of three classrooms that followed a sheltered model of content instruction. Subjects for the study were three teachers and fifty-one L 2 English students from Biology, Physical Science and American History classrooms in a high school in the U. S.
