25|$|Newton's third law {{of action}} and {{reaction}} states that if the string exerts an inward centripetal force on the ball, the ball will exert an equal but outward reaction upon the string, shown in the free body diagram of the string (<b>lower</b> <b>panel)</b> as the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from any}} {{acceleration}} that might {{occur in the}} direction of the path, the <b>lower</b> <b>panel</b> of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are two forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball mg, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward normal force exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface man. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the net force on the ball resulting from vector addition of the normal force and the force of gravity. The resultant or net force on the ball found by vector addition of the normal force exerted by the road and vertical force due to gravity must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.|$|E
500|$|The {{transition}} between the top left, perhaps where the artist began, {{and the standard}} pattern, is somewhat awkward, leaving a rather bald spot (for an interlace pattern) {{to the left of}} the first curving yellow vertical. [...] The change in pattern pushes the halfway point of the upper panel rather off-centre to the right, whereas in the <b>lower</b> <b>panel</b> it falls slightly to the left of dead centre. [...] These vagaries in the design suggest that it was done freehand, without marking-out the pattern using compasses for example. [...] The lowest horizontal raised line is not straight, being higher at the left, probably because of an error in the marking or drilling of the holes in the cover board through which the ends of the cord run. [...] The simple twist or chain border in yellow between the two raised frames resembles an element in an initial in the Durham Gospel Book Fragment, an important earlier manuscript from Lindisfarne.|$|E

500|$|The two {{panels of}} {{interlace}} {{use the same}} design, of what David H. Wright describes as the [...] "alternating pair thin-line type" [...] which he calls [...] "perhaps the most sophisticated of Insular interlace types". [...] The panels are symmetrical about a vertical axis, except for the left end of the upper panel, which is different. Whereas the other ends of the pattern finish in a flat line parallel with the vertical framing line, part of a shape like an incomplete D, the top left finishes in two ellipses pointing into the corners. [...] The lines forming the interlace patterns are coloured in the dark blue/black and the bright yellow, but differently. [...] In the <b>lower</b> <b>panel</b> the yellow colours the left half of the design, but the upper panel begins at the (deviant) left in the dark colour, then switches to yellow once the pattern changes to that used {{for the rest of}} the panels. [...] It continues in yellow until the central point, then changes to the dark colour for the right hand side of the design.|$|E
2500|$|Figure 4 {{illustrates}} the procedure. Comparing the top panel (α = 4) with the <b>lower</b> <b>panel</b> (α=0.5) shows lower values for α [...] increase {{the rate of}} response, but increase overshoot. The case α=2 (center panel) is the maximally flat design that shows no peaking in the Bode gain vs. frequency plot. That design has {{the rule of thumb}} built-in safety margin to deal with non-ideal realities like multiple poles (or zeros), nonlinearity (signal amplitude dependence) and manufacturing variations, any of which can lead to too much overshoot. The adjustment of the pole separation (that is, settingα) is the subject of frequency compensation, and one such method is pole splitting.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958 the Roadmaster {{could only}} be ordered as the well {{equipped}} Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling. A new [...] "drawer pull" [...] grille was used, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For {{the first time since}} 1948 there were no distinguishing VentiPorts on the front fenders. On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large rear fender bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed rear fender <b>lower</b> <b>panel.</b> Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000.|$|E

2500|$|The Sky is {{a wooden}} aircraft, using the {{traditional}} spruce for stressed members and birch ply elsewhere. [...] Its wing has a constant chord inner section {{over the first}} 30% of span, then tapers on both edges to a rounded tip. [...] The 20% increase in span over the Gull IV was achieved with two extra rib bays in the inner part and a 2 in (51mm) increase in rib separation outboard. [...] The Sky was designed to meet semi-aerobatic requirements which together with an aspect ratio of 18.7, which was high for the time, required the single box spars, 6 in (152mm) wide at their greatest, to be massive. Their weight is 25% of that of the whole aircraft. [...] The wing ahead of this spar, positioned at 30% chord, forms a plywood covered torsion box. [...] Behind it, the wing is fabric covered. Ailerons, divided to allow for wing flexure, fill the tapered trailing edges. Air brakes are mounted on the spars as aerodynamically balanced pairs above and below wing; the <b>lower</b> <b>panel</b> open into the airstream and lever the upper ones against it. [...] There were no flaps.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the sides}} of the Templo Mayor, archeologists have {{excavated}} a number of palatial rooms and conjoining structures. One of the best preserved and most important is the Palace (or House) of the Eagle Warriors. This area dates back to the fourth stage of the temple, around 1469. It was excavated in 1981 and 1982 by José Francisco Hinojosa. It is a large L-shaped room with staircases decorated with sculptures of eagle heads. [...] To enter this main room, one had to pass through an entrance guarded by two large sculpted representations of these warriors. The Eagle Warriors were a privileged class who were dedicated to the god Huitzilopochtli, and dressed to look like eagles. Adjoining this palace is the temple for these warriors—also known as the Red Temple. This temple shows clear Teotihuacan influence in its paintings (mostly in red) and the design of its altar. Almost all the interior walls of the House of the Eagles are decorated with beautiful paintings and contain long benches, which are also painted. These benches are composed of two panels. The upper one is a frieze with undulating serpents in bas-relief. The <b>lower</b> <b>panel</b> shows processions of armed warriors converging on a zacatapayolli, a grass ball into which the Mexica stuck bloody lancets during the ritual of autosacrifice. This palace specifically imitates much of the style of the Burnt Palace, located in the ruins of Tula.|$|E
2500|$|A {{lower body}} graced the 1957 Roadmaster {{with an even}} more {{panoramic}} windshield equipped with reverse slanted pillars. A red-filled Sweepspear lined the bodysides and a chromed rear fender <b>lower</b> <b>panel</b> filled the area between the wheelhouse and the bumper end, continuing to offer [...] "Dagmar bumpers" [...] at the front. A new centered fuel filler {{was found in the}} rear bumper, the ends of which the single or optional dual exhaust passed through. Roadmaster script was found within the deck and grille emblems. Two door models had a trio of chevrons on the rear quarters but the four door models had a Roadmaster emblem nestled within the Sweepspear dip. Interiors featured a padded dashboard and were broadcloth and nylon in 4-doors, nylon in 2-doors and leather in convertibles. There was a new 364-cubic-inch engine, developing 300 horsepower. A new ball-joint suspension system improved handling. Evidently the 4-door Riviera hardtop proved so popular on its introduction the previous year that the pillared sedan was dropped entirely from the model lineup. Also, new was a mid-year production ( [...] March 1957) Roadmaster designated as Model 75 which was distinguished by standard power seats and windows, carpeted lower doors, a one piece rear window (instead of a three piece which were a steadfast design feature found only on the smaller Jr model lines of the Special and Century), Deluxe hubcaps and a Series 75 script found on the rear quarter [...] body panel of the R.M. Coupes and the rear door panels on the R.M. 4-door sedans, thus replacing the standard 3 chevrons found in the same location on the standard full model year Roadmaster model lines. [...] Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales plunged to about 33,000. However, this [...] "sales plunge" [...] was not an isolated occurrence found only at GM but was one shared by all manufacturers to one extent or another due to a capital market recession which effected the overall economy starting in late 1956 and extending into 1958.|$|E
