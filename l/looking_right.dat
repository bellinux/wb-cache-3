500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jonathan Dakss Stone explained the album cover's concept, stating [...] "I wanted the flag to truly represent people of all colors. I wanted the color black {{because it is the}} absence of color. I wanted the color white because it is the combination of all colors. And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, <b>looking</b> <b>right</b> at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she had. I thought I could do better." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is <b>looking</b> <b>right</b> at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E

2500|$|Kitchener {{was worried}} that, {{although}} his moustache was bleached white by the sun, {{his blond hair}} refused to turn grey, {{making it harder for}} Egyptians to take him seriously. His appearance added to his mystique: his long legs made him appear taller, whilst a cast in his eye made people feel he was <b>looking</b> <b>right</b> through them. Kitchener, at 6'2", towered over most of his contemporaries. Sir Evelyn Baring, the de facto British ruler of Egypt, thought Kitchener “the most able (soldier) I have come across in my time”. In 1890, a War Office evaluation of Kitchener concluded: [...] "A good brigadier, very ambitious, not popular, but has of late greatly improved in tact and manner...a fine gallant soldier and good linguist and very successful in dealing with Orientals" [...]|$|E
