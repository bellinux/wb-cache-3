5000|$|Men's {{clothing}} was {{the symbol of}} beauty at the time. This attire includes a shirt, tëlinat which were long briefs, a scarf and tirqe. There were differences among the clothing of adults, based on their economical standing. In the men clothing framework, the groom's attire was the most symbolic one. The costume is built upon the symbolic meaning of starting a new phase of life. Men of Podgur used to wear white semi-spherical plis. Along with it {{there was also a}} scarf made of white fabric which consisted of a few horizontal shokë of different colors. This scarf was circled around plis and covered a part of their head and ears. Scarfs were worn by men of older age, around their forties. Men's shirts were called [...] "chestnut shirts" [...] because they were made of horizontal shokë of chestnut color. [...] "Chestnut shirts" [...] are rarely seen today, except in mountain regions. Blazers were the items worn over shirts. The part among the sleeves, the collar and arms contained of a black stripe. The vest or xhamadani made of soutane was wide sleeved and reached the waist in length and had no collar. It was buttoned up with a clasp. The vest was double-breasted, and it was of black color. In cold weather, they used to wear a type of blazer called mitani and was made of soutane material. It was randomly worn over the vest or xhamadani. It had long sleeves, but no collar. The black strap covered the parts along the sleeves, around the neck and along the elbows. Mitani had an opening from the armpits to the elbows, and these openings were used to hold mitani freely. On the left part, a small pocket was sewn where men used to keep their cigars. Mitani was also worn by youngsters, but it was simpler than the mitani of men. Among the traditional clothing of Podgur's men, xhurdia which is a type of clothing worn by young boys is mostly known and symbolizes pride. It was made of soutane and tailors were usually the ones who made it. It had long and tight sleeves, open-chested, waist-length, and had a loose part at the back. Besides xhurdia there is also japanxhija which was a clothing of shepherds. However, it was also worn by others in cases of bad weather or long journeys. During nighttime, it was also used as a type of cover. It was made of white soutane along with black stripes, and it was also sleeveless and foot-length whereas its width depended on the length, taking form into a cone-shaped model. Along the belt the red shokë was worn which was older than the colorful shokë. Its length had to be long enough to be wrapped around the waist 5 times. Tëlinat or the long briefs were made of linen, from which their name originates. Later on these long briefs were also made of fabric using a loom. The edges were embroidered and were 20 cm wide. During summer time men used to wear tëlina along with a shirt which was called the shirt of tire. Shokë was tied around the waist, making the shirt resemble a kilt. Tirqe were made of soutane, which varied in quality based on the amount of cord it contained. Tirqe of high quality contained 20 threads of cord. Whereas, the one ones with lower quality had 2-3 threads of cord. The economical status determined which ones they wore. Nevertheless, traditionally white tirqe with black cords were worn in Podgur. Black tirqe were seldom worn by young boys but they were considered infamous because they were worn during the night in order not to attract attention. The socks that they wore were made of sheep wool and were from the toe gore to the heel and sometimes knee -length. Some people used to wear a type of short socks called meste over the previous ones. They were made of the wool and skin of bull, whereas the moccasins were made of sheep skin. After The Second World War, moccasins were made up of threads of different ties and cotton. Instead of opinga they were called yrnek. Men used to wear a lot of accessories at the time, such as rings, qystek të sahatit or otherwise known as pocket watches, etc. Weapons may also be considered as a part of men's accessory, and the revolver was the most common. Simplicity is what characterizes the attire of old men. Their most important item of {{clothing was}} Goxhufi, which was type of a vest and it was made of <b>lamb</b> <b>skin.</b> It had a sleeveless design and sometimes was knee length. They were reversible according to the climate.|$|E

40|$|Tan sheep (Ovis aries), a Chinese {{indigenous}} breed, {{has special}} curly fleece after birth, especially at one month old. However, this unique phenotype disappears gradually {{with age and}} the underlying reasons of trait evolvement are still unknown. In this study, skin transcriptome data was used to study this issue. In total 51, 215 transcripts including described transcripts and transfrags were identified. Pathway analysis of the top 100 most highly expressed transcripts, which included TCHH and keratin gene family members, such as KRT 25, KRT 5, KRT 71, KRT 14 and others, showed pathways known to be relevant to hair/fleece development and function. Six hundred differentially expressed (DE) transcripts were detected at two different physiological ages (one-month-old with curly fleece and 48 -month-old without curly fleece) and were categorized into three major functional groups: cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. The top six functional categories included cell, cell part, cellular process, binding, intracellular, metabolic process. The detected differentially expressed genes were particularly involved in signal, signal peptide, disulfide bond, glycoprotein and secreted terms, respectively. Further splicing isoform analysis showed that the metallothionein 3 isoform was up-regulated in Tan <b>lamb</b> <b>skin,</b> indicating {{that it may be}} related to the conformation of curly fleece in Chinese Tan lamb.

Consequently, there is a genuine need for innovative therapies designed specifically for pediatric patients with cardiac rhythm disorders. We propose that a conductive biological alternative consisting of a collagen-based matrix containing autologously-derived cells could better adapt to growth, {{reduce the need for}} recurrent surgeries, and greatly {{improve the quality of life}} for these patients. In the present study, we describe a procedure for incorporating primary skeletal myoblast cell cultures within a hydrogel matrix to fashion a surgically-implantable tissue construct that will serve as an electrical conduit between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. Ultimately, we anticipate using this type of engineered tissue to restore atrioventricular electrical conduction in children with complete heart block. In view of that, we isolate myoblasts from the skeletal muscles of neonatal Lewis rats and plate them onto laminin-coated tissue culture dishes using a modified version of established protocols [2, 3].

40|$|The leading {{biochemical}} process during ripening of cheese in a <b>lamb</b> <b>skin</b> sack is lipolysis. In order {{to evaluate the}} influence of free fatty acids (FFA) liberated during lipolysis, on the cheese in a sack flavour and aroma, the relationship between sensory properties (odour, taste and total sensory score) and FFA content throughout ripening was determined. Additionally, differentiation of cheeses in various ripening stages was performed by analysis of specific profile of cheese volatile compounds using electronic nose. The obtained results demonstrated that the content of certain FFA is responsible for specific flavour and aroma in various ripening stages, which directly influence the consumers’ sensory scores of the cheese. The concentration of fatty acids C 14 : 0, C 14 : 1, C 17 : 0, C 18 : 0, C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 23 : 0 (P< 0. 05), as well as C 16 : 0, C 18 : 3 n- 3, C 23 : 0 (P< 0. 01) in 45 days matured cheese resulted in significantly positive correlation with cheese odour. Concentrations of fatty acids C 8 : 0, C 17 : 0, C 18 : 0 C 18 : 1 n- 9 t, C 18 : 1 n- 9 c (P< 0. 05), C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0, C 16 : 1, C 18 : 3 n- 3, C 21 : 0, C 23 : 0 (P< 0. 01), C 12 : 0, and C 22 : 0 (P< 0. 001) correlated significantly with the cheese taste. As {{a consequence of the}} ripening time and the ripening conditions, C 4 : 0, C 6 : 0 and C 8 : 0 fatty acids were accumulated and contributed to the lower sensory scores of the 60 days matured cheese. Long-chain unsaturated FFAs ttC 18 : 2, C 20 : 2 and C 22 : 6 n- 3, also negatively correlated with the sensory properties of cheese in a sack, probably as precursors for synthesis of shorter acids and alcohols. Electronic nose analysis showed very well differentiation of cheeses in various ripening stages and these results are mostly in accordance with the results of consumers’ sensory assessment and physicochemical analyses. Well matured cheese was not well accepted by consumers due to the extensive lipolysis reactions in cheese during ripening. In terms of sensory quality electronic nose could be of a great help to cheesemakers in satisfying consumers requirements for optimal flavour and aroma properties of cheese by estimating ending of ripening time and lipolysis reactions...|$|E

40|$|Internationally about 400000 tons of Chrome {{tanning agents}} are used annually. The {{efficiency}} of {{the present state of}} the art tanning technology would suggest that about 60000 tons of chrome tanning agents remain unutilised during the chrome tanning and might be discharged into the environment. Apart from environmental problems, this costs the industry ninety million dollars worth of valuable chrome tanning agents annually. The research was aimed at minimising the environmental impact of chrome tanning by the improvement of the {{efficiency of the}} classical system through the addition of auxiliary chemicals during chrome tanning, changing the present technology and by modifying the chrome tanning agent itself. Two different chemicals were synthesised. These were included in a detail study with six other commercial auxiliary chemicals to improve the classical system. Here the possibilities of improving the availability of carboxylic groups for better efficiency of chrome tanning were explored. A considerable improvement, about 90 - 93 % for hides and 95 - 96 % for lamb skins was obtained with these two synthesised chemicals. A novel chrome terming technique for tanning of lamb skins was developed where conventional acid-salt pickling was completely eliminated and tanning conducted after deliming at pH 7 to 8. 5. This novel technique also did not require basification and masking agents for the completion of chrome tanning and saved considerable amount of money for the tanner. This new approach of tanning gave higher exhaustion of chrome to the extent of 96 - 97 % with improved physical properties and yield of leather. The mechanism of the new tanning system was also postulated. Seventy percent of sodium sulphate, one of the pollutants of chrome tanning, was removed from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate by crystallisation technique. Attempts were made to separate various species of chrome complexes with HPLC, Gel filtration (Saphadex G 25) and Ion exchange chromatography (SP Saphadex C 25) and finally six species of chrome complexes were separated from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor with ion exchange columns (Dowex 50 W x 8 and Dowex IX 8 - 50). It was interesting to find that about 20 % of the commercial basic chrome sulphate were anionic and nonionic complexes. In an attempt to understand their reactivity, separated species of complexes were studied for their ageing and tanning characteristics. This showed {{that as long as the}} pH of the liquor was kept constant, there was no significant change in these complexes due to ageing. Tanning affinity of each of these complexes was studied on pickled lamb skins at three different temperatures, namely 20, 30 and 40 °C. In general, anionic complex had no reactivity and the noniontc species was less reactive at normal tanning pH between 3. 0 and 4. 2. Similar tanning trials with cationic complexes showed that the affinity of these complexes with skin collagen increased progressively with the cationic charge of the complexes up to (Cr) 4 +, and then remained constant for complexes with higher charges than (Cr) 4 +. The reactivity of the combined cationic complexes was studied against standard commercial chrome control on similar pickled and degreased lamb skins. It was found that this combined cationic fraction tanned leather rapidly and more efficiently. The exhaustion of chrome, established through the analysis of chrome in the exhaust chrome liquor with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was 95. 11 % against 72. 25 % for the control. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines. A polyamide resin was synlhcsised. Initially 0. 75 g to 1. 25 g resin/mole of Cr 2 O 3 was used to modify the 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor. The ageing characteristics of these complexes were also studied over a six month period. It was clear that the polyamide formed a stable complex with basic chrome sulphate and the ageing did not alter their characteristics significantly. Ion exchange separation (Dowex 50 W x 8) of the chrome-polyamide complex showed that this complex had an ionic distribution closer to phthalate masked basic chrome sulphate. Tanning trials with chrome-polyamide complex on pickled lamb skins and cow hides at low pH like the conventional chrome tanning showed slightly better chrome exhaustion for <b>lamb</b> <b>skin</b> but no significant improvement for side leather. But when lamb skins were tanned according to the newly developed chrome tanning process, a significant improvement in chrome tanning was obtained. The exhaustion of chrome was more than 99 % and leather stood boil within two hours, shortening the chrome tanning process considerably. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines The novel process without pickling was tried successfully in the industry. The principle of this no-pickle novel chrome tanning system was extended to the pretanned lamb skins where chrome tanning was successfully carried out at high pH after degreasing without readjusting the pH of the tanning bath with acid to 3. 0 - 3. 5 and tanning completed without basification...|$|E

A Herlitz type JEB was identified in German Black Headed Mutton (BHM) sheep and affected lambs were reproduced in a breeding trial. Affected <b>lambs</b> showed <b>skin</b> and mucous membranes blistering and all affected lambs died {{within the first}} weeks of life. The pedigree data were consistent with a monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance. Immunofluorescence showed a reduced expression of laminin 5 protein which consists of 3 subunits encoded by the genes LAMA 3, LAMB 3 and LAMC 2. We screened these genes for polymorphisms. Linkage and genome-wide association analyses identified LAMC 2 as the most likely candidate for HJEB. A two base pair deletion within exon 18 of the LAMC 2 gene (FM 872310 :c. 2746 delCA) causes a frameshift mutation resulting in a premature stop codon (p. A 928 *) 13 triplets downstream of this mutation and in addition, introduces an alternative splicing of exon 18 LAMC 2. This deletion showed a perfect co-segregation with HJEB in all 740 analysed BHM sheep. Identification of the LAMC 2 deletion means an animal model for HJEB is now available to develop therapeuti...|$|R
5000|$|In textual studies, a {{palimpsest}} (...) is {{a manuscript}} page, either from a scroll or a book, {{from which the}} text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document. Pergamene (now known as parchment) was made of baby <b>lamb</b> or kid <b>skin</b> (best made in ancient Pergamon) and was expensive and not readily available, so {{in the interest of}} economy a pergamene often was re-used by scraping the previous writing. In colloquial usage, the term palimpsest is also used in architecture, archaeology, and geomorphology to denote an object made or worked upon for one purpose and later reused for another, for example a monumental brass the reverse blank side of which has been re-engraved.|$|R
5000|$|The chanter {{often has}} {{five to eight}} finger holes, and is {{sometimes}} curved at the end. There {{are two types of}} cimpoi, one with a single drone and one with two. The bag (...) is made of a whole <b>lamb</b> or goat <b>skin</b> and, depending on the region, is made either with the fur in or out. It is sometimes covered with embroidered cloth. The bagpipe can be found in most of Romania apart from the central, northern and eastern parts of Transylvania, but at present (the early 21st century) is only played by a few elderly people. It is on the road to extinction, and there are only two makers left who know {{to make it in the}} traditional way.|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{evaluated the}} effect of adding macaúba (Acrocomia aculeata) cake replacing corn on body measurements and carcass characteristics of Santa Inês lambs. Twenty four 5 -month-old uncastrated male lambs were tested using a randomized blocks design. Lambs were distributed into four experimental groups, receiving diets with 0, 100, 200 and 300 g/kg of macaúba cake. After 60 days in feedlot, measurements of body length, thoracic perimeter, height at the anterior and rump height were taken. The <b>lambs</b> were slaughtered, <b>skinned</b> and eviscerated. Carcass were weighed hot and chilled at 2 ºC during 24 h. Cooling losses, hot carcass weight, cold carcass weight, hot carcass yield, cold carcass yield, half carcass weight, fat thickness, final weight, slaughter weight, empty body weight, thorax depth, croup width, perimeter of the croup, carcass length, internal carcass length, hindlimb length, hindlimb width and hindlimb conformation score were evaluated. Only hindlimb width was inversely correlated to adding macaúba cake in the diet. Macaúba cake can be included in diets for lamb in feedlot up to 300 g/kg without affecting body measurements in vivo or carcass characteristics...|$|R
50|$|Emma enters, {{carrying}} her riding crop. She asks Wesley {{why he is}} wearing their father’s clothes. He tells her that as he put them on {{he could feel his}} own essence slipping out of him, and his father’s essence coming into him. Wesley asks her how she got out of jail and she tells him that she made sexual overtures at the guard. She then pulls out a wad of cash and tells him that she’s taking their mother’s car and going into crime. As she leaves, Ella wakes up, mistakes Wesley for Weston, and tells him to go after Emma because she’s too young to leave on her own. Weston tells Ella to let Emma go and then there is a bright flash and a loud explosion from outside. Emerson, a small well dressed thug, enters giggling about the explosion. His partner, Slater, enters after him, playing with the <b>skinned</b> <b>lamb</b> carcass. Since Ella is still under the impression that Wesley is Weston, Emerson and Slater also mistake Wesley for Weston. Wesley tries to tell them that Weston is his father. They tell him that they have blown up the car, with Emma in the car. The men tell Wesley, who they are still calling Weston, that he is to pass on the warning to his father and they leave.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{the main purpose}} to compile and {{highlight}} the first data obtained from experimental studies on docμmented reconstructions of gilded composites performed within a research project on gilding materials and techniques in Portugal (www. gilt-teller. pt) funded by FCT. Two water gilding recipes were appropriately chosen from the treatises written by the Portuguese Filipe Nunes (1615) and José Lopes Baptista de Almada (1749) as being representative for Baroque époque. Based on these recipes, the production of raw materials - “gesso grosso”, “gesso fino”, bole, animal glue (from <b>lamb</b> and goat <b>skins)</b> - was made as faithful as possible. Their application was then performed in laboratory following the indications given by these authors or by treatises of previous époques (e. g. the Bolognese treatise for thawing leather), on plane and curved wooden supports (pine and oak species) using three types of leaf: gold (Au/Ag/Cu) of 22 and 23. 75 karat respectively and silver. After the completion of gilding, the samples’ surfaces were divided into areas and on each different finishing layers (wax, animal glue size) and decorations (punching, “esgrafitado”, “estofado”) were applied. An analytical campaign using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on surfaces and cross sections, X-ray diffraction (XRD), microcomputerized tomography (microCT) and colorimetry (CIEL*a*b*) was undertaken in order to characterize the gilded composites and to assess the faithfulness of the reproductions in the laboratory. Correlations between the information given by the recipes and the composition and stratigraphical patterns of the reconstructions can be established. Furthermore, the study aims to highlight the difficulties encountered in analyzing real samples and comparing the results with those from reproductions as the number and types of layered materials are not always reproducible. A critical approach is needed and criteria for faithful reproduction of ancient recipes are suggested...|$|R
