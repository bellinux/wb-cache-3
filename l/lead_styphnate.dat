Today, reproduction percussion firearms are popular for recreational shooters and percussion caps are still available (though some modern muzzleloaders use shotshell primers instead of caps).

50|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s-1970s. Lead levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Lead (from lead azide or <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate</b> used in firearms) gradually accumulates at firearms training grounds, contaminating the local environment and exposing range employees to a risk of lead poisoning.|$|E
50|$|At {{a purely}} {{technical}} level, a sufficiently large detonator would initiate high explosives {{without the need}} for a booster charge. However, there are very good reasons why this method is never used. Firstly, there is a major safety issue, i.e. detonators are (like all primary explosives) much more sensitive to shock, heat, and friction than an explosive booster. Therefore, minimising the amount of primary explosive that users must store or carry greatly reduces the likelihood of serious accidents. An additional economic reason for using explosive booster charges is that chemical compounds used in detonators (e.g. <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate)</b> are comparatively expensive to produce and encapsulate when compared to the manufacturing costs of explosive boosters.|$|E
5000|$|Civilian {{ammunition}} manufacturers {{began offering}} non-corrosive primers in the 1920s, but most military ammunition {{continued to use}} corrosive priming mixtures of established reliability. [...] The various proprietary priming formulations used by different manufacturers produced some significantly different ignition properties until the United States issued military specifications for non-corrosive primers for 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge production. The PA-101 primers developed at Picatinny Arsenal used about 50% <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate</b> with lesser amounts of barium nitrate, antimony trisulfide, powdered aluminum and tetrazene. [...] Most United States manufacturers adopted the PA-101 military standard for their civilian production of Boxer primers.

50|$|First {{used as a}} priming {{composition}} in small copper caps beginning in the 1820s, mercury fulminate quickly replaced flints {{as a means to}} ignite black powder charges in muzzle-loading firearms. Later, during the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, mercury fulminate or potassium chlorate became widely used in primers for self-contained rifle and pistol ammunition. Mercury fulminate has the distinct advantage over potassium chlorate of being non-corrosive, but it is known to weaken with time, by decomposing into its constituent elements. The reduced mercury which results forms amalgams with cartridge brass, weakening it, as well. Today, mercury fulminate has been replaced in primers by more efficient chemical substances. These are non-corrosive, less toxic and more stable over time; they include lead azide, <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate</b> and tetrazene derivatives. In addition, none of these compounds require mercury for manufacture, supplies of which can be unreliable in wartime.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{explosives}} {{are used}} in small quantities to generate a detonation wave when subjected to a flame, heat, impact, electric spark, or friction. Detonation of the primary explosive initiates the secondary booster or main-charge explosive or propellant. Long-term use of lead azide and <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate</b> as primary explosives has resulted in lead contamination at artillery and firing ranges and become a major health hazard and environmental problem for both military and civilian personnel. Devices using lead primary explosives are manufactured {{by the tens of}} millions every year in the United States from primers for bullets to detonators for mining. Although substantial synthetic efforts have long been focused on the search for greener primary explosives, this unresolved problem has become a “holy grail” of energetic materials research.

40|$|Periodic first-principles {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed to {{study the effects of}} electric field on the geometric and electronic structures and decomposition mechanism of crystalline lead azide (alpha-Pb(N- 3) (2)). The results show that the influence of external electric field on the crystal structure is anisotropic owing to the different crystal packing along three crystallographic directions. The applied field causes a little change in unit cell volume, and the crystal symmetry remains unchanged, indicating that lead azide does not undergo a phase transition at an applied field smaller than 8. 017 V/nm. The electric field effects on the ionic Pb-N bonds are stronger than those on the covalent N-N bonds because more effective charges reside on the atoms in the former. Moreover, the applied field across the crystal develops instabilities. The Franz-Keldysh effect yields larger influence on the band gap than the structural change induced by applied field.

40|$|The {{sensitive}} explosives used in initiating devices like primers and detonators {{are called}} primary explosives. Successful detonations of secondary explosives are accomplished by suitable sources of initiation energy that is transmitted {{directly from the}} primaries or through secondary explosive boosters. Reliable initiating mechanisms are available in numerous forms of primers and detonators depending upon {{the nature of the}} secondary explosives. The technology of initiation devices used for military and civilian purposes continues to expand owing to variations in initiating method, chemical composition, quantity, sensitivity, explosive performance, and other necessary built-in mechanisms. Although the most widely used primaries contain toxic lead azide and <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate,</b> mixtures of thermally unstable primaries, like diazodinitrophenol and tetracene, or poisonous agents, like antimony sulfide and barium nitrate, are also used. Novel environmentally friendly primary explosives are expanded here to include cat[FeII(NT) 3 (H 2 O) 3], cat 2 [FeII(NT) 4 (H 2 O) 2], cat 3 [FeII(NT) 5 (H 2 O) ], and cat 4 [FeII(NT) 6] with cat = cation and NT− = 5 -nitrotetrazolato-N 2.

40|$|Thursday’s {{attacks on}} London’s tube network {{and on a}} {{double-decker}} bus in Hackney bear the hallmarks of a botched operation. As more information emerges, the authorities in London have confirmed that {{at least three of}} the devices isolated on Thursday were of a similar size to those detonated by Islamic extremists during the 7 / 7 attack on London earlier this month. The fourth device appears to have been slightly smaller. These devices consist of three main components. The first is a battery powered timing power unit or TPU which initiates the detonation sequence electrically. In recent times, mobile phones have been adapted by terrorists to function as TPUs. When activated, the TPU heats a metal filament within the second component - the detonator. Detonators contain a small amount of highly sensitive and volatile high explosives such as <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate</b> or mercury fulminate. When triggered by the TPU, the detonator generates a small explosion which provides the shock wave necessary to ignite the third component of the bomb – the bulk charge. The bulk charge normally consists of a plastic explosive. The types of plastic explosive favoured by contemporary terrorist and resistance groups are sometimes of commercial origin but more often of military specification such as semtex, C 4, P 4, HDX or RDX. All of these explosives are nitrogen-based and contain nitro-glycerine or nitrocellulose. There is some suggestion that the bulk charge in the London attacks may have been home-made, or improvised in a terrorist bomb-making facility.

In 1992, we embarked on an effort to develop a lead-free double base propellant to replace that of a foreign sole source. At the time there were availability concerns. In 1995, the department developed a strategic proposal to include {{a wider range of}} products. Efforts included such efforts as removing lead sheathing from linear explosives and replacing lead azide and <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate</b> compounds. This paper will discuss efforts specifically related to developing non-leaded double base propellant for use in various Propellant Actuated Devices (PADs) for aircrew escape systems. The propellants can replace their leaded counterparts, mitigating lead handling, processing, or toxic exposure to the environment and personnel. This work eliminates the use of leaded compounds, replacing them with a more environmentally benign metal-organic salt. Historically double-base propellants have held an advantage over other families of energetic materials through their relative insensitivity of the burning rate to changes in temperature and pressure. This desirable ballistic effect has been obtained {{with the use of a}} lead-organic salt alone or in a physical mixture with a copper-organic salt, or more recently with a lead-copper complex. These ballistic modifiers are typically added to the double-base 'paste' prior to gelatinization on heated calendars or one type or another. The effect of constant burning rate over a pressure range is called a 'plateau' while an even more beneficial effect of decreasing burning rate with increasing pressure is termed a 'mesa. ' The latter effect results in very low temperature sensitivity of the propellant burning rate. Propellants with such effects are ideal tactical rocket motor propellants. The use of lead compounds poses a concern for the environment and personnel safety due to the metal's toxic nature when introduced into the atmosphere by propellant manufacturing, rocket firings, and disposal. Two separate programs are underway at Indian Head to replace the leaded ballistic modifiers in NOSIH-AA- 2 and KU propellants.

40|$|Many {{energetic}} {{systems can}} be activated via mechanical means. Percussion primers in small caliber ammunition and stab detonators used in medium caliber ammunition are just two examples. Current medium caliber (20 - 60 mm) munitions are detonated {{through the use of}} impact sensitive stab detonators. Stab detonators are very sensitive and must be small, as to meet weight and size limitations. A mix of energetic powders, sensitive to mechanical stimulus, is typically used to ignite such devices. Stab detonators are mechanically activated by forcing a firing pin through the closure disc of the device and into the stab initiating mix. Rapid heating caused by mechanically driven compression and friction of the mixture results in its ignition. The rapid decomposition of these materials generates a pressure/temperature pulse that is sufficient to initiate a transfer charge, which has enough output energy to detonate the main charge. This general type of ignition mix is used in a large variety of primers, igniters, and detonators. [1] Common primer mixes, such as NOL- 130, are made up of <b>lead</b> <b>styphnate</b> (basic) 40 %, lead azide (dextrinated) 20 %, barium nitrate 20 %, antimony sulfide 15 %, and tetrazene 5 %. [1] These materials pose acute and chronic toxicity hazards during mixing of the composition and later in the item life cycle after the item has been field functioned. There is an established need to replace these mixes on toxicity, health, and environmental hazard grounds. This effort attempts to demonstrate that environmentally acceptable energetic solgel coated flash metal multilayer nanocomposites can be used to replace current impact initiated devices (IIDs), which have hazardous and toxic components. Successful completion of this project will result in IIDs that include innocuous compounds, have sufficient output energy for initiation, meet current military specifications, are small, cost competitive, and perform as well as or better than current devices. We expect flash metal multilayer and sol-gel to be generic technologies applicable {{to a wide range of}} devices, especially in small caliber ammunition and sub-munitions. We will replace the NOL- 130 mixture with a nanocomposite that consists of a mechanically robust energetic multilayer foil that has been coated with a sol-gel energetic material. The exothermic reactions are activated in this nanocomposite are the transformation of the multilayer material to its respective intermetallic alloy and the thermite reaction, which is characterized by very high temperatures, a small pressure pulse, and hot particle ejection. The proposed materials and their reaction products consist of, but are not limited to aluminum, nickel, iron, aluminum oxide, titanium, iron oxide and boron.
