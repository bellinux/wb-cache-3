He passed on the business to his son, Ranchod Lal, who ran a one-man operation. Eventually, Ranchod Lal's sons, Ramchandra and Lakshman, inherited the business and they were instrumental in giving a new direction to the company. The duo imparted a new vision to the venture and infused a spirit of calculated risk-taking into the firm. As a result, by the 1970s, the Vadilal Company had already evolved into a modern corporate entity.|$|E

The domestic service has been supplemented by an international service, boasting three major global offices in Beijing, Washington, and Nairobi, and more than 70 additional international bureaus. The quality of CCTV’s journalism depends on both the region in which it’s produced, and the subject matter’s sensitivity in Beijing. On one hand, CCTV produces sophisticated long-form reports on complex international issues such as climate change; at the same time, its reporting on the Chinese Communist Party echoes the party line. CCTV’s biggest impact may be in regions where China is directing its international investments. The Nairobi operations complement extensive investments in African infrastructure, {{many of them in}} communications; China is also pursuing critical investment in Latin America and Southeast Asia...|$|R

500|$|The {{production}} base for special effects was Century 21 Studios in Slough, Berkshire, {{which had been}} prepared for filming on the last Supermarionation series, The Secret Service. Supervising director Derek Meddings oversaw the shooting of more than 200 effects shots, including the destruction of EUROSEC Headquarters {{at the end of}} the film. A six-foot (1.8m) Phoenix scale model, which emulated the design of the NASA multi-stage Saturn V rocket, had to be rebuilt after unexpectedly igniting and nearly injuring a technician. For authenticity, the effects staff mounted the shots of the Phoenix lift-off outdoors in a section of the Century 21 car park so as to film against a genuine sky backdrop. Archer and Hearn describe the sequence as [...] "one of the most spectacular" [...] of its kind produced by Century 21. Sylvia Anderson, who considers it indistinguishable from a Cape Kennedy launch, comments that she is [...] "still impressed by the magic of the effects. Technology has come a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>since</b> the early Seventies, but Derek's effects have endured." ...|$|E

[...] Unterberger concludes his review by commenting, [...] "The power of the track is greatly enhanced by McCartney's sympathetic high harmonies on the bridge, and its exoticism confirmed by George Harrison's twanging sitar riffs". A reviewer for Rolling Stone magazine noted [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] and [...] "Think for Yourself" [...] as documents of the Beatles' increasing awareness and creativity in the studio. Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media considers the song {{to be one of the}} most self-evident Lennon pieces on Rubber Soul to exemplify his maturity as a songwriter, and praises the composition as [...] "an economical and ambiguous story-song highlighted by Harrison's first dabbling with the Indian sitar".|$|E

Irish radio station Spin South West complimented the performance, [...] "Little Mix are killing it , not many pop stars could do this!" [...] Alicia Adejobi of Entertainment Wise praised the version, writing, [...] "Little Mix are not just an ordinary girl band, they can sing live, perform an acapella and even beat-box." [...] Little Mix performed the single live on the ninth season of The X Factor on 11 November 2012. The group performed the song backed by a troupe of dancers and wore matching black trousers, gold and blue tops with military jackets with ammunition belts. Little Mix's mentor during their time on The X Factor, Tulisa Contostavlos, praised the performance: [...] "You're professional, you're all on point and confident now." [...] Spin South West said that the performance manifested why Little Mix won the competition in 2011. Emily Sheridan of the Daily Mail positively reviewed the performance as well, writing, [...] "The group have come a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>since</b> [...]" [...] The group performed [...] "DNA" [...] on 13 November 2012 for BBC's Live Lounge.

500|$|Other Enterprise {{crew members}} include the ship's first officer William Riker, played by {{director}} Jonathan Frakes. Frakes {{said he did}} not have much difficulty directing and acting at the same time, having done so on the television series. Brent Spiner portrays the android Data; rumors before the film's release suggested that since Data's skin had been largely removed {{at the end of the}} story, it would allow another actor to assume the role. LeVar Burton plays Geordi La Forge, the ship's chief engineer. La Forge is a blind character, and for the television series and previous film had worn a special visor to see. Burton lobbied for many years to have his character's visor replaced so that people could see his eyes, since the [...] "air filter" [...] he wore prevented the audience from seeing his eyes and limited his acting ability. Moore finally agreed, giving the character ocular implants that were never explained in the film, beyond showing they were artificial. Gates McFadden plays Beverly Crusher, the ship's doctor. McFadden considered Star Trek women finally on par with the men: [...] "We've come a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>since</b> Majel Barrett was stuck in the sick bay as Nurse Chapel in the [...] and made to dye her hair blond." [...] Crusher was instrumental in helping Picard set the auto-destruct sequence, to prevent the Borg from completely assimilating the Enterprise and Earth. Ship's counselor Deanna Troi is portrayed by Marina Sirtis. The actress missed working on the television show, and was acutely aware that expectations and stakes for First Contact were high: [...] "we were scared that people thought we couldn't cut it without the original cast", she said. Other Starfleet members included former Enterprise chief of security, and commander of the USS Defiant, Worf (Michael Dorn). The Defiant is badly damaged in the battle with the Borg but is left salvageable. An early screenplay draft called for the Defiant to be destroyed, but Deep Space Nine executive producer Ira Steven Behr objected to the destruction of his show's ship and so the idea was dropped. Neal McDonough plays Hawk, the Enterprise helmsman who aids in the defense of the ship until he is assimilated and killed. McDonough was cavalier about his role as an expendable [...] "redshirt", saying that since one of the characters in the deflector dish battle had to die, [...] "that would be me".|$|E

They are ligand-gated ion channels with binding sites for acetylcholine as well as other agonists. When agonists bind to a receptor it stabilizes the open state of the ion channel allowing influx of cations.|$|E

Subaltern people have long been relatively powerless in presenting themselves in the literary world. They have not been better represented, rather socially and politically misrepresented. Georg Gugelberger has noted that critical theory and research is being created on the margins between literary theory and anthroplogy and that in its exploration of literature, it is involved in the “construction of differences that are the necessary cultural dimensions of empire- differences which make it possible to distinguish the colonized from the colonizer”(4). Gayatri Spivak calls this kind of Western writing as the “othering discourse”, a mistaken belief called “error-as- truth ” syndrome. Gugelberger also points out that the educational system needs {{to be aware of the}} hegemonic fabrication of such literatures. John Beverley suggests that the best way to approach the subaltern is through testimonial literature. Gugelberger considers Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apartpublished in 1959, as the originating point of testimonies. According to him the writing of the novel set up the nailing of the canonical literature as a “misrepresentation of African reality”(5) by creators of literature from the “centre”. Achebe’s work is considered a “corrective efffort”(5). Testimonial narrative has come a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> ever <b>since</b> and it does not write to the past but with the future.
