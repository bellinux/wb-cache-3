50|$|During the oil crisis, between 1975 and 1979, up to 14 supertankers used Gelting Bay as an anchorage.These vessels {{were laid}} {{up for a}} period of time because they had no orders or few freight rates. Some tankers like the Wilhelmine Essberger were even laid up at the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft {{shipyard}} in Kiel immediately after being launched.Gelting Bay is particularly well suited as an anchorage for <b>laid-up</b> <b>ships</b> due to its geographic location and shallow limestone seabed (marked by a lighthouse); it also its a sufficient water depth for ships of 140 to 300 metres in length. Resupply to the ships was easily carried out from the nearby port of Gelting. During the oil crisis, these <b>laid-up</b> <b>ships</b> became a tourist attraction, which brought additional income to the restaurants and hotels of the region..|$|R
2500|$|The Admiralty Board {{considered}} Victory too old, and in {{too great}} a disrepair, to be restored as a first-rate ship of the line. In November 1807 she was relegated to second-rate, with the removal of two 32-pounder cannons and replacement of her middle deck 24-pounders with 18-pounders obtained for other <b>laid-up</b> <b>ships.</b> She was recommissioned as a troopship between December 1810 and April 1811. In 1812 she was relocated {{to the mouth of}} Portsmouth Harbour off Gosport, for service as a floating depot and, from 1813 to 1817, as a prison ship.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} awareness and {{concern about the}} protection of the marine environment. The pollution risk posed by <b>laid-up</b> <b>ships,</b> wrecks and abandoned or disused offshore installations is an aspect that should be given due consideration by coastal states and key industry players. There are many complex issues to be associated with these potentially polluting elements. Ideally, these issues which encompass both legal and technical aspects should be carefully considered and addressed. This would be crucial in ensuring that the marine environment is well protected from elements that can eventually either slowly or catastrophically result in significant damage to the marine environment...|$|R
40|$|The freight markets {{went into}} the {{doldrums}} again in 1981 after having withstood the impact of industrial recession astonishingly well into {{the early months of}} the year thanks to expanding coal traffic and long port delays for bulkers. Oil imports of the main consuming areas as well as the raw material intake of the steel industries shrank considerably, while movements of other goods were still expanding. On the other hand, the world merchant fleet started to grow again at an accelerated pace. Transport capacities were, as a consequence, less employed; <b>laid-up</b> <b>shipping</b> increased rapidly, and freight-rate levels declined sharply in most market sectors. These developments are analysed in detail in the annual review of maritime transport by Dr Hans Böhme, of the Kiel Institute of World Economy, and published, as 'Weltseeverkehr: Vor einem neuen Tonnageüberschuß?' in the Institute's bi-annual, Die Weltwirtschaft. The author summarizes the review below. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} {{merchant marine}} formed {{the backbone of}} the bridge of ships across the Pacific. From just six ships under charter when the war began, this total peaked at 255. According to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), 85 percent of the dry cargo requirements during the Korean War were met through commercial vessels — only five percent were shipped by air. More than $475 million, or 75 percent of the MSTS operating budget for calendar year 1952, was paid directly to commercial shipping interests.In addition to the ships assigned directly to MSTS, 130 <b>laid-up</b> Victory <b>ships</b> in the NDRF were broken out by the Maritime Administration and assigned under time-charters to private shipping firms for charter to MSTS.|$|R
25|$|On 1 November 1931, after {{a number}} of delays, Oldenburg was renamed SuomenJoutsen (Swan of Finland) after Finska Svan, a Swedish 16th century warship that took part in the naval action of 7July1565 between Sweden and Denmark. After launching, SuomenJoutsen broke her {{moorings}} in the strong breeze and damaged two ships, gunboat Karjala and Osmo, a <b>laid-up</b> full rigged <b>ship</b> built in 1869, before she was brought under control. On 4 November 1931, she left the shipyard for Helsinki, under tow and escorted by minelayer M-1.|$|R
50|$|During the Korean War {{there were}} few severe sealift {{problems}} other than the need to re-mobilize forces following post-World War II demobilization. About 700 ships were activated from the NDRF for services to the Far East. In addition, a worldwide tonnage shortfall between 1951 and 1953 required the reactivation of over 600 ships to lift coal to Northern Europe and grain to India during {{the first years of}} the Cold War.

2500|$|In 1965 Home Lines took {{delivery}} {{of their first}} purpose-built ship, Oceanic, which replaced the ageing Italia. Although marketed as [...] "the largest ship ever designed for year round cruises", the ship had in fact been originally designed as a two-class liner/cruise ship before Home Lines abandoned transatlantic crossings, and adapted to full-time cruising during construction. The Oceanic entered service on 1965 as Caribbean Luxury Cruise during 1965 till about March 1965 then to the New York—Bahamas cruise route, and the Homeric was transferred to cruising on the Caribbean. The Homeric suffered a major fire in the galleys and restaurants in 1973, {{and had to be}} withdrawn from service and scrapped. As a replacement Home Lines purchased the second Hanseatic from German Atlantic Line (Hamburg Atlantic Line after a name change), renaming her Doric. At the same time Home Lines had also considered purchasing the Bergensfjord from Norwegian America Line, but the deal was not realised. In 1976 the company made a bid to purchase the <b>laid-up</b> Italian Line <b>ships</b> Michelangelo and Raffaello, but the offer was turned down by the Italian Line.|$|R
