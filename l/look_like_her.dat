500|$|On New Caprica, Kara [...] "Starbuck" [...] Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) {{is placed}} in an {{elaborate}} prison cell made to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> old apartment on Caprica by Leoben Conoy (Callum Keith Rennie), who is attempting to force her {{to fall in love}} with him. Starbuck kills him several times, though Leoben always downloads into another body. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) is in a Cylon detention facility, where his right eye was forcibly removed. He is released when his wife Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) performs sexual favors for the Cylon Brother Cavil (Dean Stockwell). Tigh returns to Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco) and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), who have been leading a resistance movement against the Cylons, having detonated a bomb in a Cylon docking facility as Tigh is released. Now free, Tigh resorts to escalating their efforts, by planning suicide bombings against the Cylons and any human collaborators.|$|E
500|$|Chopra found Mary Kom a {{very special}} and {{personal}} film due to the inspiring theme. She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her,</b> she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} and makeup {{departments}} {{are also important}} assets to production. Dean has an out-of-body experience in [...] "In My Time of Dying", and some scenes feature him looking at his own body in a hospital bed. To forgo the use of visual effects, the special effects department sculpted a full gelatin face from Ackles, and applied it to a body double. To depict a woman burning {{to death in the}} episode [...] "Simon Said", the actress was sealed inside a full body silicone designed to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her,</b> and was doused with fire accelerant. She was required to breathe through a straw, as well as don underwear soaked in ice-cold fire-retardant gel. Prior to [...] "Heart", Kripke had not wanted to include werewolves in the series, as he felt that the budget would only allow for [...] "a guy with fur glued to his face". As he prefers to have monsters be able to walk among humans, production made the transformation subtle—the character's eyes change, and her canine teeth and fingernails grow. However, writer Sera Gamble believes that they [...] "dropped the ball" [...] in the design, feeling that the creature looked too similar to a vampire.|$|E

500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who {{do well in school}} are said to be [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> doing". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Lepore was {{featured}} on drag performer Sharon Needles' single, [...] "I Wish I Were Amanda Lepore", and she guest {{starred in the}} music video for the track, depicting Needles as a fan obsessed with getting plastic surgery to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Zimmer's {{score for}} Tony Scott's 1995 film Crimson Tide won a Grammy Award {{for the main}} theme, which makes heavy use of synthesizers in place of {{traditional}} orchestral instruments. For The Thin Red Line (1998), Zimmer said that the director Terrence Malick wanted the music before he started filming, so he recorded {{six and a half}} hours of music. [...] Zimmer's next project was The Prince of Egypt (1998), which was produced by DreamWorks Animation. He introduced Ofra Haza, an Israeli Yemenite singer, to the directors, and they thought she was so beautiful that they designed one of the characters in the film to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Precisely--if you WILL have it. Does it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> leaving him?" [...] Mrs. Wix enquired.

6000|$|Well, we will gladly {{teach you}} Greek, if you learn thereby {{to read the}} history of Nausicaa of old, and what manner of maiden she was, and what was her education. You will admire her, doubtless. But do not let your admiration limit itself to drawing a meagre half- mediaevalised design of her--as she never looked. Copy in your own person; {{and even if you}} do not descend as low--or rise as high--as washing the {{household}} clothes, at least learn to play at ball; and sing, in the open air and sunshine, not in theatres and concert-rooms by gaslight; and take decent care of your own health; and dress not like a [...] "Parisienne"--nor, of course, like Nausicaa of old, for that is to ask too much: --but somewhat more like an average Highland lassie; and try to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her,</b> and be like her, of whom Wordsworth sang: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She used to {{play the}} piano. So did I, once. But I never let her know after I'd heard her play the first time. And she thought her playing was wonderful, the dear, fond girl! You know the sort, the {{mechanical}} one-two-three tum-tum-tum school-girl stuff. And now I'll tell you something funnier. Her playing WAS wonderful to me. The gates of heaven opened to me when she played. I can see myself now, worn out and dog-tired after the long day, lying on the mats of the palace veranda and gazing upon her at the piano, myself in a perfect idiocy of bliss. Why, this idea she had of her fine playing was the one flaw in her deliciousness of perfection, and I loved her for it. It kind of brought her within my human reach. Why, when she played her one-two-three, tum-tum-tum, I was in the seventh heaven of bliss. My weariness fell from me. I loved her, and my love for her was clean as flame, clean as my love for God. And do you know, into my fond lover's fancy continually intruded the thought that God in most ways must <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Joscelind Bernardstone came of a {{military}} race, and had been brought up in camps,--by which I don't mean {{she was one of}} those objectionable young women who are known as garrison hacks. She was in the flower of her freshness, and had been kept in the tent, receiving, as an only daughter, the most [...] "particular" [...] education from the excellent Lady Emily (General Bernardstone married a daughter of Lord Clandufly), who looks like a pink-faced rabbit, and is (after Joscelind) one of the nicest women I know. When I met them in a country-house, a few weeks after the marriage was [...] "arranged," [...] as they say here, Joscelind won my affections by saying to me, with her timid directness (the speech made me feel sixty years old), that she must thank me for having been so kind to Mr. Tester. You saw her at Doubleton, and you will remember that though she has no regular beauty, many a prettier woman would be very glad to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> She is as fresh as a new-laid egg, as light as a feather, as strong as a mail-phaeton. She is perfectly mild, yet she is clever enough to be sharp if she would. I don't know that clever women are necessarily thought ill-natured, but it is usually taken for granted that amiable women are very limited. Lady Tester is a refutation of the theory, which must have been invented by a vixenish woman who was not clever. She has an adoration for her husband, which absorbs her without in the least making her silly, unless indeed it is silly to be modest, as in this brutal world I sometimes believe. Her modesty is so great that being unhappy has hitherto presented itself to her as a form of egotism,--that egotism which she has too much delicacy to cultivate. She is by no means sure that if being married to her beautiful baronet is not the ideal state she dreamed it, the weak point of the affair is not simply in her own presumption. It does n't express her condition, at present, to say that she is unhappy or disappointed, or that she has a sense of injury. All this is latent; meanwhile, what is obvious, is that she is bewildered,--she simply does n't understand; and her perplexity, to me, is unspeakably touching. She looks about her for some explanation, some light. She fixes her eyes on mine sometimes, and on those of other people, with a kind of searching dumbness, as if there were some chance that I--that they--may explain, may tell her what it is that has happened to her. I can explain very well, but not to her,--only to you! ...|$|E
