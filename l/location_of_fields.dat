We focus here on the case of discrete R-symmetries which are intrinsically connected to the Lorentz group in extra dimensions and the appearance of N-extended supersymmetry. In that sense, discrete R-symmetries can be understood as "fractionally" extended supersymmetry. These symmetries reveal insight about the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>fields</b> in extra dimensions (in particular the Higgs boson). Applications can be found in the solution of the μ-problem, suppression of proton decay and the structure of the soft terms of broken supersymmetry.

40|$|Analysis of {{detailed}} agricultural parcel and farm location data in central Belgium {{is used to}} reveal landscape structure and to identify the processes {{that are responsible for}} this structure. Agricultural land use patterns are deter-mined, at least partly, by the relative <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>fields</b> to farms. In particular, grassland is located closer to farms than other land uses. General-purpose land cover maps (CORINE and PELCOM) are compared to raster maps generated from the detailed parcel data. Both the CORINE and PELCOM strongly overestimate arable land use in the study area, and neither is able to correctly represent minor land use classes. The farm location-land use relationship as well as land use quantities and other spatial metrics are found {{to be sensitive to the}} format, source and resolution of the spatial data for the study area. This suggests that the use of PELCOM is not appropriate when landscape scale processes affect the composition and spatial patterns of land use. In this case, it is always better to aggregate fine resolution spatial data. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated {{soil erosion}} {{is one of}} the major {{constraints}} to agricultural production in many parts of the Tanzanian highlands. Although several soil and water conservation technologies have been developed and promoted, the adoption of many recommended measures is minimal and soil erosion continues to be a problem. This research was conducted in order to determine the social and economic factors that influence adoption of soil and water conservation (SWC) measures in the West Usambara highlands, Tanzania. For this research a household survey, group discussions and transect walks were undertaken. A total of 104 households were interviewed and several fields were visited during the transect walks. Data was analysed with the use of cross-tabulation, cluster analysis, factor analysis and chi-squared methods. The results obtained indicate that involvement in off-farm activities, insecure land tenure, <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>fields</b> and a lack of short-term benefits from SWC are among the major factors that negatively influence adoption of SWC measures. Membership in farmer groups, level of education, contacts with extension agents and SWC programmes were found to be positively influencing the adoption of SWC measures. Recommendations to facilitate adoption of different SWC measures include: integration of social and economic factors into SWC plans; the creation of more awareness among farmers of soil-erosion effects and long-term benefits of SWC; the development of flexible SWC measures to cater for different farm patterns and a participatory approach to SWC at catchment level rather than at individual farmers' fields...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study has}} focused on the {{processes}} of soil degradation and chemical element concentration in tea-growing regions of Rwanda, Africa. Soil degradation accelerated by erosion is caused not only by topography but also by human activities. This soil degradation involves both the physical loss and reduction in the amount of topsoil associated with nutrient decline. Soil samples were collected from eleven tropical zones in Rwanda and from variable depth within each collecting site. Of these, Samples from three locations in each zone were analyzed in the laboratory, with the result that the pH of all soil samples is shown to be less than 5 (pH< 5) with a general average of 4. 4. The elements such as iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) are present in high concentration levels. In contrast calcium (Ca) and sodium (Na) are present at low-level concentrations and carbon (C) was found in minimal concentrations. In addition, elements derived from fertilizers, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) which is also from minerals such as feldspar, are also present in low-level concentrations. The results indicate that the soil in certain Rwandan tea plantations is acidic and that this level of pH may help explain, in addition to natural factors, the deficiency of some elements such as Ca, Mg, P and N. The use of chemical fertilizers, land use system and the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>fields</b> relative to household plots are also considered to help explain why tea plantation soils are typically degraded...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{water use}} in rice {{cultivation}} {{is a prerequisite}} for sustaining food security for the rice consuming population of India. Novel rice production practices, including water-saving techniques, modifications in transplanting, spacing, weeding and nutrient management, have been developed and shown to be effective on farm, but adoption of these techniques by farmers has remained restricted. Potential constraints include technical difficulties with new practices, and labour and gender issues which differ between farms. On the basis of a rapid survey of 100 rice-based farms, four farm types were identified based on their socio-economic and biophysical characteristics. Detailed farm surveys were conducted on three representative farms of each farm type to evaluate land use patterns, use of inputs such as water, labour, nutrient, capital and machinery, income from crop and animal production and off-farm activities. Opportunities exist for one or more new rice cultivation techniques to be adopted in all the four farm types. For all farm types, however, the opportunities for use of water-saving irrigation were the least promising. In general, adoption of water-saving irrigation will not improve farmers' livelihoods despite its importance in reducing water scarcity problems at regional scale. At farm scale, the potential for adoption of water-saving irrigation depends on the season, <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>fields</b> and the irrigation source. Changes in government policies such as rules and regulations, pricing, institution building and infrastructure development, as well as training and education of farmers are needed to improve the adoption of modified methods for rice cultivation.

40|$|Strategic spatial {{patterning}} of crop {{species and}} cultivars could make agricultural landscapes {{less vulnerable to}} plant disease epidemics, but experimentation to explore effective disease-suppressive landscape designs is problematic. Here, we present a realistic, multiscale, spatiotemporal, integrodifference equation model of potato late blight epidemics to determine the relationship between spatial heterogeneity and disease spread, and determine the effectiveness of mixing resistant and susceptible cultivars at different spatial scales {{under the influence of}} weather. The model framework comprised a landscape generator, a potato late blight model that includes host and pathogen life cycles and fungicide management at the field scale, and an atmospheric dispersion model that calculates spore dispersal at the landscape scale. Landscapes consisted of one or two distinct potato-growing regions (6. 4 -by- 6. 4 -km) embedded within a nonhost matrix. The characteristics of fields and growing regions and the separation distance between two growing regions were investigated for their effects on disease incidence, measured as the proportion of fields with = 1 % severity, after inoculation of a single potato grid cell with a low initial level of disease. The most effective spatial strategies for suppressing disease spread in a region were those that reduced the acreage of potato or increased the proportion of a resistant potato cultivar. Clustering potato cultivation in some parts of a region, either by planting in large fields or clustering small fields, enhanced the spread within such a cluster while it delayed spread from one cluster to another; however, the net effect of clustering was an increase in disease at the landscape scale. The planting of mixtures of a resistant and susceptible cultivar was a consistently effective option for creating potato-growing regions that suppressed disease spread. It was more effective to mix susceptible and resistant cultivars within fields than plant some fields entirely with a susceptible cultivar and other fields with a resistant cultivar, at the same ratio of susceptible to resistant potato plants at the landscape level. Separation distances of at least 16 km were needed to completely prevent epidemic spread from one potato-growing region to another. Effects of spatial placement of resistant and susceptible potato cultivars depended strongly on meteorological conditions, indicating that landscape connectivity for the spread of plant disease depends on the particular coincidence between direction of spread, <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>fields,</b> distance between the fields, and survival of the spores depending on the weather. Therefore, in the simulation of (airborne) pathogen invasions, {{it is important to consider}} the large variability of atmospheric dispersion condition...|$|E
