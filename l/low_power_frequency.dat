40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityThis thesis {{investigates the}} design of high data rate and {{low-power}} wireless-links for RF applications of Wireless Private Area Network (WPAN) /Body Area Network (BAN). The primary goal is to identify suitable architectures and circuits, optimization algorithms and implementations of high energy efficient wireless-links. Three key enabling technologies are investigated in this work: high energy efficient circuit design, implementation algorithms and integrated circuit fabrication. Opportunities for convergence in these three areas are considered, and low power radio architectures are presented as a principal means to exploit this anticipated convergence. In the first part, a wireless biotelemetry system operates in vivo, which requires low power consumption for long-lasting operation, high output power for long transferable distance, and high throughput for incorporating many recording electrodes and transmitting raw brain signals. An implantable 2. 4 -GHz on-off keying (OOK) transmitter with high throughput and high energy efficiency for wireless biotelemetry systems has been designed in a 0. 18 -µm CMOS process. To balance power consumption and output power, a complementary voltage-controlled oscillator for the proposed transmitter is employed. Power consumption of the transmitter is reduced by switching the oscillator on and off to generate an OOK modulated signal. The transient delay for the transmitter is derived and applied to implement a high throughput transmitter. Rat skin-mimic emulating the implant environment such as electrical properties of the skin is {{used to measure the}} proposed transmitter in vitro. To transmit 136 Mb/s of OOK data, the transmitter consumes 3 mW of dc power and generates an output power of 14 dBm. The transmitter achieves energy efficiency of 22 pJ/bit with an associated bit error rate of 1. 7 × 10 - 3 without using an error correction scheme. In the second part, the <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesis is the most important building block to implement a low power radio because {{it is one of the}} most power hungry circuits on the transceiver. This thesis presents a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and a time-amplifier in order to generate the <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesis. A power-minimized LC VCO with switched biasing and triode-region MOSFETs has been designed using a 0. 18 -µm CMOS process. The design strategy for an LC VCO suggested an inductance selection scheme to accommodate the trade-off between power consumption and phase noise. The Figure-Of-Merit with the normalized area of the proposed VCO is - 198. 2 dB, which is the lowest among the latest state-of-the-art sub- 1 mW VCOs. A high resolution time-amplifier has been simulated based on a 0. 18 -µm CMOS process. Based on the proposed low power VCO and the proposed high resolution time-amplifier with the variable delay buffer, the <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesis can be implemented near future.

BACKGROUNDThe efficacy of sodium chloride and mineralocortoid {{in the treatment of}} neurally mediated cardiac syncope is attributed to intravascular volume expansion; however, their modulation of autonomic nervous system activity has not been evaluated. METHODSHeart rate variability analysis was performed on 12 adolescents with a history of syncope or presyncope (mean age 15. 2 ± 0. 7 years) during tilt table testing. Subjects were upright 80 ° for 30 min or until syncope. After normal saline administration, the patient was returned upright for 30 min. Heart rate variability analysis data were analyzed by an autoregression model (Burg method). RESULTSAll subjects reproducibly developed syncope during control tilt table testing; median time to syncope was 9. 4 ± 2. 1 min. After normal saline infusion, none of the subjects developed syncope after 30 min upright.

40|$|Frequency {{multiplication}} (FM) {{can be used}} {{to design}} <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizers. This is achieved by running the VCO at a much reduced frequency, while employing a power efficient frequency multiplier, and also thereby eliminating the first few dividers. Quadrature signals can be generated by frequency- multiplying low frequency I/Q signals, however this also multiplies the quadrature error of these signals. Another way is generating additional edges from the low-frequency oscillator (LFO) and develop a quadrature FM. This makes the I-Q precision heavily dependent on process mismatches in the ring oscillator. In this paper we examine the use of fewer edges from LFO and a single stage polyphase filter to generate approximate quadrature signals, which is then followed by an injection-locked quadrature VCO to generate high- precision I/Q signals. Simulation comparisons with the existing approach shows that the proposed method offers very good phase accuracy of 0. 5 deg with only a modest increase in power dissipation for 2. 4 GHz IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard using UMC 0. 13 mum RFCMOS technology...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a huge rise in {{interest}} in the design of energy efficient wireless sensor networks (WSN) and body area networks (BAN) with the advent of many new applications over the last few decades. The number of sensor nodes in these applications has also increased tremendously in the order of few hundreds in recent years. A typical sensor node in a WSN consists of circuits like RF transceivers, micro-controllers or DSP, ADCs, sensors, and power supply circuits. The RF transmitter and receiver circuits mainly the frequency synthesizers(synthesis of RF carrier and local oscillator signals in transceivers) consume a significant percentage of its total power due to its high frequency of operation. A charge-pump phase locked loop (CP-PLL) is the most commonly used frequency synthesizer architecture in these applications. The growing demands of WSN applications, such as low power consumption larger number of sensor nodes, single chip solution, and longer duration operation presents several design challenges for these transmitter and frequency synthesizer circuits in these applications and a few are listed below, <b>Low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer and transmitter designs with better spectral performance is essential for an energy efficient operation of these applications. 	The spurious tones in the frequency synthesizer output will mix the interference signals from nearby sensor nodes and from other interference sources present nearby,to degrade the wireless transmitter and receiver performance[1]. With the increased density of sensor nodes (more number of in-band interference sources) and degraded performance of analog circuits in the nano-meter CMOS process technologies, the spur reduction techniques are essential to improve the performance of frequency synthesizers in these applications. A single chip solution of sensor nodes with its analog and digital circuits integrated on the same die is preferred for its low power, low cost, and reduced size implementation. However, the parasitic interactions between these analog and digital sub-systems integrated on a common substrate, degrade the spectral performance of frequency synthesizers in these implementations[2]. Therefore, techniques to improve the mixed signal integration performance of these circuits are in great demand. In this thesis, we present a custom designed energy efficient 2. 4 GHz BFSK/ASK transmitter architecture using a <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer design technique taking advantage of the CMOS technology scaling benefits. Furthermore, a few design guidelinesandsolutionstoimprovethespectralperformanceoffrequency synthesizer circuits and in-turn the performance of transmitters are also presented. The target application being short distance, low power, and battery operated wireless communication applications. The contributions in this thesis are, Spectral performance improvement techniques The CP mismatch current is a dominant source of reference spurs in the nano-meter CMOS PLL implementations due to its worsened channel length modulation effect [3]. In this work, we present a CP mismatch current calibration technique using an adaptive body bias tuning of its PMOS transistors. Chip prototype of 2. 4 GHzCP-PLLwith the proposed CP calibration technique was fabricated in UMC 0. 13 µm CMOS process. Measurements show a CP mismatch current of less than 0. 3 µA(0. 55 %) using the proposed calibration technique over the VCO control voltage range 0. 3 to 1 V. The closed loop PLL measurements using the proposed technique exhibited a 9 dB reduction in the reference spur levels across the PLL output frequency range 2. 4 - 2. 5 GHz. The parasitic interactions between analog and digital circuits through the common substrate severely affects the performance of CP-PLLs. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the effect of periodic switching noise generated from the digital buffers on the performance of charge-pump PLLs. The sensitivity of PLL performance metrics such as output spur level, phase noise, and output jitter are monitored against the variations in the properties of a noise injector digital signal. Measurements from a 500 MHz CP-PLL shows that the pulsed noise injection with the duty cycle of noise injector signal reduced from 50 % to 20 %, resulted in a 12. 53 dB reduction in its output spur level and a 107 ps reduction in its Pk-Pk deterministic period jitter performance.

The proposed frequency multiply by 3 digital edge combiner design having a very few logic gates, demonstrated a significant reduction in the power consumption of frequency synthesizer circuits, with an acceptable spectral performance suitable for these relaxed performance applications. A few design guidelines and techniques to further improve its spectral performance are also discussed and validated through simulations. Chip prototypes of 2. 4 GHz CP-PLLs with and without digital frequency multiplier circuits are fabricated in UMC 0. 13 µm CMOS process. The 2. 4 GHz CP-PLL using the proposed digital frequency multiplication technique (10. 7 mW) consumed a much reduced power compared to a conventional implementation(20. 3 mW).

The present study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} extremely <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> electromagnetic fields (EMF) on the production of melatonin and the subsequent sleep structure in rats. Methods: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a 1000 milligauss (mG) magnetic field for 1 month.

Previous work suggested the feasibility of a system using a 50 watt transmitter and a phaselock receiver with a lock range of 300 cps and signal bandwidths between 5 and 100 cps. To substantiate former work in which recommendations were based on test results using an unmodulated carrier, a similar system was designed with provisions for frequency modulation. Dictated by the frequency stability of the entire system, the lock range was increased to 775 cps. Much of this thesis is devoted to the design and analysis of the phaselock detector and to the testing of the receiving system. Some pertinent properties of the receiver have been theoretically predicted and tested under simulated field operating conditions. In order to test the system under actual field conditions the 50 watt transmitter and the phaselock receiver were placed at Uranium City and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, respectively. It was observed that sufficient signal to lock the system could e received for {{only a small portion of}} the total propagation time. This fact tentatively has been attributed to the effect which Doppler frequency shifts may have on a phaselock system with a relatively large lock range.

40|$|First, a {{frequency}} synthesizer for IEEE 802. 15. 4 / ZigBee transceiver applications that employs dynamic True Single Phase Clocking (TSPC) circuits in its frequency dividers is presented {{and through the}} analysis and measurement results of this synthesizer, the need for low power circuit techniques in frequency dividers is discussed. Next, Differential Cascode Voltage-Switch-Logic (DCVSL) based delay cells are explored for implementing radio-frequency (RF) frequency dividers of <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizers. DCVSL ip- ops offer small input and clock capacitance which makes the power consumption of these circuits and their driving stages, very low. We perform a delay analysis of DCVSL circuits and propose a closed-form delay model that predicts the speed of DCVSL circuits with 8 percent worst case accuracy. The proposed delay model also demonstrates that DCVSL circuits suffer from a large low-to-high propagation delay (PLH) which limits their speed and results in asymmetrical output waveforms. Our proposed enhanced DCVSL, which we call DCVSL-R, solves this delay bottleneck, reducing PLH and achieving faster operation. We implement two ring-oscillator-based voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) in 0. 13 mu m technology with DCVSL and DCVSL-R delay cells. In measurements, for the same oscillation frequency (2. 4 GHz) and same phase noise (- 113 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz), DCVSL-R VCO consumes 30 percent less power than the DCVSL VCO. We also use the proposed DCVSL-R circuit to implement the 2. 4 GHz dual-modulus prescaler of a <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer in 0. 18 mu m technology. In measurements, the synthesizer exhibits - 135 dBc/Hz phase noise at 10 MHz offset and 58 mu m settling time with 8. 3 mW power consumption, only 1. 07 mWof which is consumed by the dual modulus prescaler and the buffer that drives it. When compared to other dual modulus prescalers with similar division ratios and operating frequencies in literature, DCVSL-R dual modulus prescaler demonstrates the lowest power consumption. An all digital phase locked loop (ADPLL) that operates {{for a wide range}} of frequencies to serve as a multi-protocol compatible PLL for microprocessor and serial link applications, is presented. The proposed ADPLL is truly digital and is implemented in a standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology without any analog/RF or non-scalable components. It addresses the challenges that come along with continuous wide range of operation such as stability and phase frequency detection for a large frequency error range. A proposed multi-bit bidirectional smart shifter serves as the digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) control and tunes the DCO frequency by turning on/off inverter units in a large row/column matrix that constitute the ring oscillator. The smart shifter block is completely digital, consisting of standard cell logic gates, and is capable of tracking the row/column unit availability of the DCO and shifting multiple bits per single update cycle. This enables fast frequency acquisition times without necessitating dual loop fi lter or gear shifting mechanisms. The proposed ADPLL loop architecture does not employ costly, cumbersome DACs or binary to thermometer converters and minimizes loop filter and DCO control complexity. The wide range ADPLL is implemented in 90 nm digital CMOS technology and has a 9 -bit TDC, the output of which is processed by a 10 -bit digital loop filter and a 5 -bit smart shifter. In measurements, the synthesizer achieves 2. 5 GHz- 7. 3 GHz operation while consuming 10 mW/GHz power, with an active area of 0. 23 mm 2...|$|E

The combined integrated phase noise is below - 34 dBc, and measured transceiver Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is better than 2. 5 dB in both the 2. 4 and 5 GHz bands. A <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer targeting Frequency Shift Keying applications such as ZigBee and BlueTooth is presented. The synthesizer use open-loop direct modulation of the carrier, but unlike conventional implementations, the proposed synthesizer is open both when transmitting and receiving data. This allows the use of a small area on-chip loop filter without violating noise or spurious requirements. To handle the frequency drift normally associated with open-loop implementations, a low-leakage charge-pump is proposed. The synthesizer is implemented using a 0. 18 μm CMOS process. Total power consumption is 9 mW and the circuit area including the VCO inductors and on-chip loopfilter is 0. 32 mm 2. Measured leakage current is less than 2 fA. A small area amplitude detector circuit is proposed. The wide-band operation and small input capacitance make the circuit suitable for embedding in an RF system on-chip, allowing measurement of on-chip signal levels and automatic calibration. Finally an oscillator topology reducing the phase noise in voltage controlled oscillators is suggested. By using on-chip decoupling and an amplitude control circuit to adjust oscillator bias, the impact of current source noise is eliminated. The theoretical phase noise is reduced 3. 9 dB compared to a conventional LC oscillator using the same bias current. QC 2010081...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} {{wireless sensor network}} (WSN) is receiving great attention due to the interest in healthcare. Traditional battery-powered devices suffer from large size, weight and secondary replacement surgery after the battery life-time which is often not desired, especially for an implantable application. Thus an energy harvesting method needs to be investigated. In addition to energy harvesting, the sensor network needs to be low power to extend the wireless power transfer distance and meet the regulation on RF power exposed to human tissue (specific absorption ratio). Also, miniature sensor integration is another challenge {{since most of the}} commercial sensors have rigid form or have a bulky size. The objective of this thesis is to provide solutions to the aforementioned challenges. ^ The focus of this presentation is on integration of technologies for implantable wireless sensor network. Firstly, a low power IC for the radio, which consumes most of the power, is fabricated using CMOS technology. This transceiver harvests energy from 915 MHz RF radiation power signal. Also, the powering signal provides reference clock to the IC for <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesis. A simple receiver is implemented on chip for multi-node access. Then wireless powering techniques were studied to improve the current work. Wireless power transfer (WPT) link distance for implantable devices in prosthetic arm application (targeted muscle reinnervation) is less than 10 cm. At this distance, wireless power transfer using magnetic resonance coupling (MRC) can be much more effective in power transfer efficiency. By focusing on this point, a design technique using band pass filter theory allows transferring power selectively to a specific target device. Selective WPT enables multi-node access without having to use any further techniques, greatly simplifying the system. A low power SoC is designed to comply with the proposed WPT technique, also dedicated for glucose detection using 180 nm CMOS technology. The IC is composed of a low power transmitter based on injection locked ring oscillator. The wireless sensor IC receives power wirelessly from MRC through 27 MHz (ISM band) and transmits in 405 MHz (MICS band). Since our glucose sensor is an amperometric sensor, the IC detects current from the biosensor and mirrors it to an internal ring oscillator, which presents the glucose level in frequency (I-F conversion). Frequency variation due to temperature can be calibrated out through an internal reference clock. Total power consumption of the system is around 20 µW. To complete the system, a glucose sensor is designed and fabricated with graphene petals on carbon fiber. Efforts were focused on flexible, robust and sensitive glucose sensor based on multilayered graphene petals (GP) on thin carbon fiber (CF) tow. GP/CF electrode was decorated with the mixture of Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs), polyaniline (PANI), glucose oxidase (GOx), and nafion. PtNP are electrodeposited onto the graphene for its catalytic behavior toward hydrogen peroxide, which is generated in the process of glucose oxidase (GOx) oxidizing glucose, acting as an electron-transfer promoter. The GOx/PANI/PtNP/GP/CF biosensor showed highly flexible characteristics with good sensitivity and it showed more than 90 % of its sensitivity after 4 weeks in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{improvement}} in efficiency of direct digital frequency synthesis (DDFS) systems is demanded for <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesis in wireless communications. Concurrently {{a reduction in}} cost is important for disposable, low resolution frequency synthesis in biomedical instrumentation systems. To meet both these needs a new ROM-less architecture is presented here that uses {{less than half the}} circuit area of previous state of the art systems and improves the efficiency by operating at up to a tenth of the power consumption. The main contribution presented in this thesis is a novel, efficient method of interpolation for DDFS that uses the nonlinear response of the CMOS differential switch already present in the high speed current steering DAC. The nonlinear response provides a smooth transition between the conventional, quantised DAC output. This interpolation may be performed with the conventionally discarded phase bits leading to highly compact and efficient DDFS architectures for application in instrumentation and communications systems. DDFS systems typically consist of a large overflowing accumulator to generate the phase, a ROM lookup table to convert the phase to amplitude and a DAC to perform the digital to analogue conversion. Approximations are often used {{to reduce the size of}} the ROM, however the most efficient DDFS systems remove the ROM completely and calculate the phase to amplitude conversion directly or store the conversion in a non-linear DAC. State of the art, high speed CMOS DACs consisting of thermometer decoded arrays of current steering cells are often used to reduce non-ideal effects that cause unwanted transients leading to a degradation in spectral purity (SFDR). A novel ROM-less technique is introduced here that uses the non-linear response of a current cell consisting of an ideal current source and differential current switch to interpolate between the output levels of a non-linear DAC. Using this technique two architectures are developed. A compact architecture using only four or six current cells suitable for instrumentation applications and a thermometer decoded architecture using 64 current cells for communications applications that require better spectral purity. The compact architecture is 100 % efficient as all the bias current is used to form the output. The only additional component is a small linear phase DAC. One compact system with a nonlinear DAC of four current cells achieved an SFDR of - 40 dBc up to output frequencies of 1 MHz for dielectrophoresis consumed only 5 μ W/MHz and a second compact system with a six cell nonlinear DAC for electrical impedance spectroscopy, achieved an SFDR of - 48 dBc for output frequencies up to 1 MHz and consumed only 8 μ W/MHz. As an extension to improve the SFDR a segmented system with 64 current cells was developed. The larger number of current cells required the use of a modified thermometer decoder that had the added benefit of improving the spectral purity by linearising the response of each cell. The total active area was 0. 6 mm 2, less than half of state of the art ROM-less DDFS systems that include a DAC. Although measurement results of the 64 cell system were disappointing, simulations suggest that these problems may be solved in a future chip that should be able to achieve - 70 dBc SFDR at 100 MHz. Despite the loss in performance from simulation to measurement, the measured 64 cell system still meets the spectral purity requirements of UMTS and Bluetooth, - 60 dBc SFDR. </p...|$|E
