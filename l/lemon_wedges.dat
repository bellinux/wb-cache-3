2500|$|Acidity is a {{dominant}} player in any {{food and wine}} pairing due to the pronounced and complex ways that it can heighten the perception of flavors. In wine tasting, acidity is perceived by a mouth watering response by the salivary glands. This mouth watering can also serve to stimulate the appetite. In wine there are three main acids that have their own associated flavors-malic (green apples), lactic (milky) and tartaric (bitter). In dishes that are fatty, oily, rich or salty, acidity in wine can [...] "cut" [...] (or standout and contrast) through the heaviness and be a refreshing change of pace on the palate. In cooking, acidity is often used in similar fashions such as a <b>lemon</b> <b>wedges</b> with a briny seafood dish such as oysters. The acidity of the lemon juices can make the oysters seem less briny. A wine that is less tart than the dish it is served with will taste thin and weak. A wine that comes across as [...] "too tart" [...] on its own may seem softer when paired with an acidic and tart dish. The complementing [...] "tartness" [...] {{of the food and}} wine cancels each other out and allows the other components (fruit of the wine, other flavors of the food) to be more noticeable.|$|E

50|$|The Friday night fish fry, often {{battered}} and fried perch or walleye, is traditional throughout Wisconsin, while in northeast Wisconsin along Lake Michigan, the Door County fish boil holds sway. The supper club is another common phenomenon of Wisconsin culinary heritage {{and often a}} destination for fish frys, which usually feature a portion of aforementioned fish, along with various sides: a fried food such as french fries and onion rings are common, along with condiments of tartar sauce and cole slaw (especially crimson slaw, a variety of cole slaw that incorporates Wisconsin's cranberries) and garnishes of parsley and <b>lemon</b> <b>wedges.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of Frey's syndrome are redness and sweating {{on the cheek}} area adjacent to the ear (see focal hyperhidrosis).

Baltimore restaurants serve crab cakes with a <b>lemon</b> <b>wedge</b> and saltine crackers; other restaurants serve condiments {{such as a}} remoulade, tartar sauce, mustard, cocktail sauce or ketchup.

Crab cakes vary in size, from no bigger than a small cookie to as large as a hamburger.|$|R
5000|$|Bistecca alla fiorentina, or 'beefsteak Florentine style', {{consists}} of a T-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of cattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil, applied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and very large, [...] "Bistecca" [...] are often shared between two or more persons, and traditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with <b>lemon</b> <b>wedges,</b> if not accompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.|$|E
5000|$|The drink is {{traditionally}} served over ice {{in a tall}} glass, such as a highball, flared pint or hurricane glass. The two critical ingredients, vodka and tomato juice, are relatively simple; however, the drink almost never consists of these two ingredients alone. Among the more common additions to the juice base are salt or celery salt (either mixed in or as a salted rim), cracked pepper, hot sauce (such as Tabasco), citrus juices (especially lemon or lime), Worcestershire sauce, celery seed, horseradish, clam juice or olive brine, brown sugar or molasses and bitters. Some {{or all of these}} ingredients can come pre-mixed with the tomato juice as a single [...] "Bloody Mary mix" [...] to which the vodka is added, or the drink may be hand-constructed by the bartender from raw ingredients according to the patron's preference. A common garnish is a celery stalk when served in a tall glass; other common garnishes include olives, cheese cubes, a dill pickle spear, <b>lemon</b> <b>wedges,</b> dried sausage, and shrimp (as the taste of the drink is often reminiscent of shrimp cocktail sauce).|$|E

500|$|Variations on the {{preparation}} and {{presentation of the}} angels on horseback vary considerably. In Feng Shui Food, it is prepared by rolling a shucked oyster in bacon and skewering it with a cocktail stick, fried and served with a squeeze of lime. Joanna Pruess's book Seduced by Bacon includes a recipe for [...] "Angels and Devils", with the suggestion that [...] "a little hot red pepper sauce can transform them from heavenly to hellishly hot tasting, or somewhere inbetween." [...] Myles Bader, author of The Wizard of Food's Encyclopedia of Kitchen & Cooking Secrets, suggests serving angels on horseback on toast with a <b>lemon</b> <b>wedge</b> or hollandaise sauce. An Italian variant replaces bacon with prosciutto.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Tea {{has several}} types of {{essential}} elements. Potassium, magnesium and phosphorus are some examples of these elements. Tea is widely used drink in Turkey, also some people puts a <b>lemon</b> <b>wedge</b> to tea for different taste. In this study potassium, magnesium and phosphorus contents after the hot water brewing of black and green tea were determined by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Furthermore, how the lemon addition to teas affects the concentrations of the potassium, magnesium and phosphorus amount are investigated. From the results, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus concentrations are found as 3003. 3, 597. 1, 1167. 2 ppm in black tea and 3718. 0, 3830. 5, 376. 4 ppm in green tea, respectively. After lemon addition potassium, magnesium and phosphorus concentrations are changed to 14930, 830. 4, 1113. 5 ppm in black tea and 15460. 0, 909. 5, 1152. 5 ppm in green tea, respectively. It is seen that lemon addition affects some essential elements in black and green Turkish teas. Keywords—Hot water brewing, ICP-OES, lemon, te...|$|R

5000|$|Rose Kennedy (also {{commonly}} known as a [...] "VSS," [...] "The Michele," [...] "The White Girl," [...] or [...] "vodka soda splash") is a cocktail popular in the mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. It consists of varying amounts of vodka and club soda with a splash of cranberry juice for color and taste. The juice sweetens the taste and takes the edge off the alcohol. The cocktail, typically garnished with a <b>lemon</b> or lime <b>wedge,</b> {{is based on the}} Cape Cod and named after Rose Kennedy, the matriarch of the Kennedy Family of Cape Cod and the mother of President John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Hewitt {{released}} {{a series of}} photographs that were displayed within pristine, tilted maple box-frames, that brings into focus the morphing of images in a studio into object-like artworks shown in a gallery. In Untided (Perception), 2013, the block of maple that rests atop a stack of three books, the only identifiable one being an influential collection of James Baldwin's essays, matches the work's wooden frame (which acts more like a cradle than like a traditional picture frame). A particularly placed <b>lemon</b> with a <b>wedge</b> removed nods to Dutch vanitas paintings, yet the effect achieved is perhaps one of another art-historical moment, an ethos of Mannerism-evidenced in the work's defiance of how a photograph should act. Also in repose nearby was an untitled work comprising two free-floating walls leaning against the gallery architecture. Sculpturally akin to a clunky John McCracken or a slightly tipsy column by Anne Truitt, these ersatz Minimalist objects are in fact made of drywall and wood and were modeled on the texture {{and size of the}} gallery walls. They assert a content-free physicality that surprisingly harmonized {{with the rest of the}} exhibition's pictorial and physical material. Hewitt's strength in melding content, execution, and presentation was obvious throughout the exhibition; uniting her keen sense of image making with efforts to draw attention to the constructed spaces that surround us, this exhibition pointed in a generative new direction.|$|R
