The under surface of the forewing is orange red, at the margins and particularly at the apex yellowish, and has a black median spot and a submarginal row of black spots, which are larger posteriorly. The under surface of the hindwing is yellow, slightly orange in the middle, the reddish median spot has a <b>light</b> <b>centre,</b> a reddish diffuse spot is placed {{at the base of}} the wing and in addition there is a row of small reddish submarginal spots; the inner margin is greenish. The female has above yellowish white ground colour, broader dark distal margins on both wings and light submarginal spots. The ground colour of the underside of the forewing is impure white, of the hindwing yellowish.|$|E

40|$|The eclipsing nova-like cataclysmic {{variable}} star V 348 Pup exhibits a persistent luminosity modulation with a period 6 per cent longer than its 2. 44 -h orbital period (Porb). This {{has been interpreted}} as a `positive superhump' resulting from a slowly precessing non-axisymmetric accretion disc gravitationally interacting with the secondary. We find a clear modulation of mid-eclipse times on the superhump period, which agrees well with the predictions of a simple precessing eccentric disc model. Our modelling shows that the disc <b>light</b> <b>centre</b> is {{on the far side}} of the disc from the donor star when the superhump reaches maximum light. This phasing suggests a link between superhumps in V 348 Pup and late superhumps in SU UMa systems. Modelling of the full light curve and maximum entropy eclipse mapping both show that the disc emission is concentrated closer to the white dwarf at superhump maximum than at superhump minimum. We detect additional signals consistent with the beat periods between the implied disc precession period and both 1 2 Porb and 1 3 Porb...|$|E

50|$|Inverse SORS is {{a useful}} sub-variant of SORS that {{improves}} certain measurements such as analysis of tissue in vivo.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{preparation}} of different styrene-based polymer films containing small amounts of TPE and the evaluation of their photoluminescent behaviour is reported.

Conversely, TPE fluorescence significantly weakens to a faint signal when good solvents or viscous but not glassy polymer matrices are used.
