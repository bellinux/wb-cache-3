Planned <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> cover such traditional teaching-learning methods as lectures, tutorials, projects and assignments. The application and explosion of new technologies is also discussed. Modern computer, video and internet technology is playing an increasing role in medical education, particularly in bringing rural and remote participants into closer contact with their city counterparts. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are examined.

40|$|Abstract – First-year {{engineering}} curricula are {{vitally important}} {{in improving the}} quantity and quality of engineering graduates. Many innovative approaches to first-year engineering curriculum development have been created and implemented over the past twenty years. Often, innovative approaches incorporate one or more engineering projects as <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> for first-year students. Further, problem-based and project-based pedagogical theories have offered the framework for many innovative <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> for engineering students in all four years of engineering curricula. As Texas A&M University improves its first-year engineering curricula, faculty members are re-examining the nature of the project-based <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> both to improve the <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> and to develop specifications for future project-based <b>learning</b> <b>experiences.</b> This paper presents the rationale behind the five specifications and offers experiences in developing and implementing the design projects for the prototype first-year engineering curricula. The paper also describes the assessment and evaluation plan as well as assessment data that has been analyzed to date. Index Terms ⎯ first-year curriculum, design, integratio...|$|R

They referenced recent work on the aesthetic qualities of <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> by Patrick Parrish and others, which describe aesthetic <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> as those that involve learners in the right level of challenge and heightened engagement. Aesthetic <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> are memorable and often transformative, leaving learners with enhanced confidence and capabilities—the very definition of exceptional. By attending to the situational qualities of aesthetic <b>learning</b> <b>experiences,</b> presenters are more likely to create exceptional presentations that establish relevance and engagement—and, therefore, have a better chance at achieving specific learning objectives and outcomes. To do this, the authors identified the most viewed presentations on the TED website as the sample for their study.
