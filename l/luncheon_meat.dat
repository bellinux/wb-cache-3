500|$|On May 24, 1989, Yankovic started {{recording}} the second parody for the album, [...] "Spam". The song, {{a play on}} R.E.M.'s hit [...] "Stand", is an ode to the canned <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> Spam. Yankovic noted that it was [...] "fun to pick [...] and figure out some of those almost subliminal parts — parts that would fade in and out, little bell sounds, things you don't really hear on first listening." [...] On May 25, 1989, Yankovic recorded [...] "Isle Thing", a parody of [...] "Wild Thing" [...] by Tone Lōc, {{about a woman who}} introduces the narrator to the television show Gilligan's Island. Notably, the song is Yankovic's first rap parody; an earlier rap, [...] "Twister", is a Beastie Boys style spoof, but not a direct parody. Another Tone Lōc hit, [...] "Funky Cold Medina", is referenced in the lyrics: [...] "Ginger and Mary Ann coulda used some funky cold medina". The final parody, [...] "She Drives Like Crazy" [...] — recorded the same day as [...] "Isle Thing" [...] — is a spoof of Fine Young Cannibals' 1988 single [...] "She Drives Me Crazy". Lyrically, the song is about a man who fears his girlfriend's crazy driving habits.|$|E

2500|$|Hormel Foods Corporation, {{the maker}} of SPAM <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat,</b> does not object to the Internet {{use of the term}} [...] "spamming". However, they did ask that the {{capitalized}} word [...] "Spam" [...] be reserved to refer to their product and trademark. By and large, this request is obeyed in forums that discuss spam. In Hormel Foods v. SpamArrest, Hormel attempted to assert its trademark rights against SpamArrest, a software company, from using the mark [...] "spam", since Hormel owns the trademark. In a dilution claim, Hormel argued that SpamArrest's use of the term [...] "spam" [...] had endangered and damaged [...] "substantial goodwill and good reputation" [...] in connection with its trademarked lunch meat and related products. Hormel also asserted that SpamArrest's name so closely resembles its <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> that the public might become confused, or might think that Hormel endorses SpamArrest's products.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s the name [...] "Spam" [...] became a genericized trademark, used to {{describe}} any canned meat product containing pork, such as pork <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat.</b> With expansion in communications technology, it {{became the subject of}} urban legends about mystery meat and other appearances in pop culture. Most notable was a Monty Python sketch which led to its name being borrowed for unsolicited electronic messages, especially spam email.|$|E
2500|$|Hormel {{also made}} two {{attempts}} that were dismissed in 2005 to revoke the marks [...] "SPAMBUSTER" [...] and Spam Cube. Hormel's corporate attorney Melanie J.

50|$|The {{fact that}} a food is {{contaminated}} with pathogens (harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or protozoa) may, or may not, render it adulterated. Generally, for ready-to-eat foods, the presence of pathogens will render the food adulterated. For example, the presence of Salmonella on fresh fruits or vegetables or in ready-to-eat meat or poultry products (such as <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats)</b> will render those products adulterated.|$|R

2500|$|Electronic {{spamming}} {{is the use}} {{of electronic}} messaging systems to send an unsolicited message (spam), especially advertising, as well as sending messages repeatedly on the same site. While the most widely recognized form of spam is email spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in blogs, wiki spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam, [...] junk fax transmissions, social spam, spam mobile apps, television advertising and file sharing spam. It is named after Spam, a <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat,</b> by way of a Monty Python sketch about a restaurant that has spam in every dish and where patrons annoyingly shout spam over and over again.|$|E
2500|$|The term spam {{is derived}} from the 1970 Spam sketch of the BBC {{television}} comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus. [...] The sketch is set in a cafe where nearly every item on the menu includes Spam canned <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat.</b> As the waitress recites the Spam-filled menu, a chorus of Viking patrons drowns out all conversations with a song repeating [...] "Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam… Spammity Spam! Wonderful Spam!", hence spamming the dialogue. The excessive amount of Spam mentioned references the preponderance of it and other imported canned meat products in the United Kingdom after World War II, as the country struggled to rebuild its agricultural base. Spam captured a large slice of the British market within the lower classes, and became a byword among British children of the 1960s for low-grade fodder due to its commonality, monotonous taste and low price, leading to the humour of the Python sketch.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Although {{fluoride}} is {{an important}} trace element {{in the prevention of}} dental caries, it has a narrow range between beneficial and toxic effects. Excessive fluoride intake for example can cause dental fluorosis in infants and children whose teeth are still developing. The primary source of this unwanted fluoride has been reported to be from the ingestion of non-dietary sources of fluoride particularly fluoridated toothpaste. Another potential and largely unrecognized source of unwanted fluoride can result from ingestion of foods made with mechanically separated chicken. Mechanical separation of chicken is a manufacturing process that results in bone particles in the final product, which potentially contributes minerals including calcium and fluoride. Mechanically separated chicken (MSC) is an ingredient in infant foods, toddler foods, canned <b>meats,</b> and <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats.</b> The present study examined the fluoride content of foods made with MSC {{to determine the extent to}} which they could contribute to the total fluoride intake of infants and children. The calcium content of these foods was also measured to determine if a positive relationship existed between calcium and fluoride concentrations in foods containing MSC because of the likelihood that fluoride and calcium in MSC originate from the bones. The fluoride and calcium concentrations of the same brands of foods made with mechanically separated turkey (MST) were also measured. In addition, both the fluoride and calcium content of chicken bones themselves was measured. The fluoride content of each blended sample was determined in duplicate with a fluoride combination electrode following perchloric acid facilitated diffusion of hydrogen fluoride. The calcium content of each blended sample was determined in duplicate by atomic absorption spectrophotometry after samples were wet ashed with nitric acid. Chicken sticks made with MSC had the highest fluoride concentrations followed by infant foods, <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats,</b> and canned meats. A serving of chicken sticks containing the highest fluoride concentration would provide nearly the recommended daily intake for fluoride and nearly 1 / 2 of the upper limit of safety for a one year old child. Foods made with MSC contained considerably more fluoride than the same brands made with MST. Calcium concentration was significantly correlated with fluoride concentration in infant foods, chicken sticks, canned <b>meats,</b> and <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats</b> which is consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanical separation process was the source of the extra fluoride found in foods examined. High fluoride content of chicken bones found in this study supports this possibility. The major conclusion of the present study is that foods made with MSC but not those made with MST contain high concentrations of fluoride which can contribute significantly to the total fluoride intake of infants and children. Variety in foods selected, so as to limit use of foods made with MSC, and moderation in amount of MSC foods ingested would greatly reduce the risk of excess fluoride intake (fluorosis) in infants and young children...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to gain a better}} understanding of the mechanism by which sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, and sodium nitrite supplement the action of heat in preserving canned cured meat products. Heated spores of putrefactive anaerobe 3679 h were less tolerant of all three curing agents in the outgrowth medium than were unheated spores. When the curing agents were added to the heating menstruum, but not to the outgrowth medium, sodium chloride and sodium nitrate tended to protect the spores against heat injury, but sodium nitrite did not. When the spores were both heated and cultured in the presence of the curing agents: (i) nitrate and salt increased the apparent heat resistance at low concentrations (0. 5 to 1 %) but decreased it at concentrations of 2 to 4 %; (ii) nitrite was markedly inhibitory, especially at pH 6. 0. At the normal pH of canned <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats</b> (approximately 6. 0), nitrite appears to be the chief preservative agent against spoilage by putrefactive anaerobes...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examined {{factors related}} to listeriosis prevention in pregnant women, {{with the aim of}} improving messages designed for pregnant women. Pregnant women are twenty times more likely than other adults to become infected by Listeria monocytogenes. Listeriosis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or illness in the newborn. Current FDA guidelines for pregnant women advise avoiding foods that pose high risk of L monocytogenes contamination: hot dogs or <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats</b> without reheating, soft cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, refrigerated pâtés, refrigerated smoked seafood, and unpasteurized milk. These were updated in 2003 as our understanding of L. monocytogenes contamination in foods has changed. Previous research found that pregnant women were unaware of the guidelines, defensive when made aware, and consuming high-risk foods. The impact of changing guidelines has not been examined. A sequential explanatory mixed methods study was conducted. First, data collected in the second Infant Feeding Practices Study was analyzed to determine whether demographic and health-related factors were related to awareness of L. monocytogenes and the consumption of high-risk foods.

40|$|Critical to the {{understanding}} of foodborne illness outbreaks is the identification of both the contaminated food item and the responsible pathogen, allowing traceback to the original source of contamination and subsequent intervention. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) maintains a database of foodborne illness outbreaks categorized by food vehicle, compiled from sources including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state health departments, and scientific journals. Between 1990 and 2003, the foods most commonly linked to outbreaks with identified vehicles were seafood (n = 899), produce (n = 554), poultry (n = 476), beef (n = 438), and eggs (n = 329). Multi-ingredient foods, including pizza and sandwiches, were linked to 812 outbreaks. Overall, 27 % (1229 / 4486) of the outbreaks were attributed to meats, including beef, poultry, pork, and <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats,</b> while 66 % (2954 / 4486) of outbreaks were linked to other food items. Seven percent (303 / 4486) were linked to multiple food vehicles.

5000|$|Medical {{nutrition}} therapy: {{based on}} a diet with the correct energy intake and balance of proteins {{that will be used}} in synthesis processes and not as a source of calories. A total of 35 kcal/kg body weight/day is normally recommended. This diet should also comply with two more requirements: the first is to not consume more than 1 g of protein/kg body weight/ day, as a greater amount could increase the degree of proteinuria and cause a negative nitrogen balance. Patients are usually recommended lean cuts of meat, fish, and poultry. The second guideline requires that the amount of water ingested is not greater than the level of diuresis. In order to facilitate this the consumption of salt must also be controlled, as this contributes to water retention. It is advisable to restrict the ingestion of sodium to 1 or 2 g/day, which means that salt cannot be used in cooking and salty foods should also be avoided. Foods high in sodium include seasoning blends (garlic salt, Adobo, season salt, etc.) canned soups, canned vegetables containing salt, <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats</b> including turkey, ham, bologna, and salami, prepared foods, fast foods, soy sauce, ketchup, and salad dressings. On food labels, compare milligrams of sodium to calories per serving. Sodium should be {{less than or equal to}} calories per serving.|$|R
