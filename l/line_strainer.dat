50|$|The {{electrode}} lines, which {{look like}} a 110 kV-powerlines with 2 conductors, use similar, but smaller pylons as the main line. In opposite to the main <b>line,</b> all <b>strainers</b> are free-standing lattice towers with a single crossbar, while the suspension towers of the electrode line are usually concrete poles with a single crossbar made of steel. Only suspension towers of extraordinary height are built as lattice towers.|$|R
