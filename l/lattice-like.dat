25|$|Lichen planus (LP) is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by itchy reddish-purple polygon-shaped skin lesions on the lower back, wrists, and ankles. It may also present with a burning sensation in the mouth, and a <b>lattice-like</b> network of white lines near sites of erosion (Wickham striae). The cause is unknown, but it {{is thought to be}} the result of an autoimmune process with an unknown initial trigger. There is no cure, but many different medications and procedures have been used in efforts to control the symptoms.|$|E
500|$|The {{horizontal}} rhizomes, {{which are}} about 1millimeter across, may curve upward. They are not branched, but as new plants can form at root tips, a tightly packed cluster of stems may {{give the appearance}} of branching. The rhizomes are covered in dark brown, narrowly triangular scales, from [...] long and from 0.2 to 0.4millimeters across, with untoothed edges. They are strongly clathrate (bearing a <b>lattice-like</b> pattern).|$|E
500|$|Pseudocolus fusiformis, Clathrus bicolumnatus, and C.ruber have {{similarities}} to Clathrus columnatus. The lattice stinkhorn, C.ruber, has a larger, more globular, <b>lattice-like</b> receptacle. The [...] "stinky squid", P.fusiformis, has arms that are attached at the bases, and free at the top. It grows on rotting logs and chip-mulched soil, {{in contrast to}} C.columnatus, which grows on sandy soil. C.bicolumnatus has a smaller stature (up to 9cm tall), and only has two columns.|$|E
500|$|Its {{rhizomes}} (underground stems) {{are short}} and {{parallel to the}} ground, or sometimes curving upwards, so the fronds spring up in a cluster. The rhizome is about [...] in diameter, covered with narrowly triangular scales that are dark reddish to brown and strongly clathrate (bearing a <b>lattice-like</b> pattern). The scales are [...] long and 0.2 to 0.4millimeters wide, with untoothed or shallowly toothed edges. The stipe (the part of the stem below the leaf blade) is upright, [...] long, occasionally as much as [...] It lacks wings, and is reddish- to purplish-brown and shiny. It is one-third to three-quarter times {{the length of the}} blade. Small brown scales {{at the base of the}} stipe diminish to hairs as one moves towards the tip of the leaf.|$|E
2500|$|Fronds {{of a large}} {{specimen}} measured [...] long. The rhizome is presumably {{covered in}} clathrate scales (bearing a <b>lattice-like</b> pattern), as do the other Aspleniums, including its parent species. The stipe (the portion of the stem below the leaf blade) is green in color, except at the very base, where it is brown.|$|E
2500|$|The {{roots are}} thin and wiry {{and do not}} proliferate to form new plants. The rhizome is short and erect, about [...] in diameter. It has {{variously}} been described as sometimes branching or unbranched. It bears stiff filamentous, linear, or lance-shaped scales, which are blackish in color and obscurely clathrate (bearing a <b>lattice-like</b> pattern) or entirely black. The scales are [...] long and [...] wide, with untoothed, often brown, margins and long, drawn-out tips.|$|E
2500|$|The fronds of A.×gravesii, {{which are}} [...] long, are closely spaced along an upward-curving, densely scale-covered rhizome [...] in length. The scales {{are long and}} narrow, about [...] long and 0.5millimeters wide at the base, coming to a pointed tip. They are dark reddish-brown in color and {{strongly}} clathrate (bearing a <b>lattice-like</b> pattern). The stipe (the part of the stem below the leaf blade) is typically [...] long, shiny and purplish-brown, sometimes becoming green near {{the base of the}} leaf blade. It is rounded below and flat or grooved above.|$|E
2500|$|Crossword grids such {{as those}} {{appearing}} in most North American newspapers and magazines feature solid areas of white squares. Every letter is checked (i.e. is part of both an [...] "across" [...] word and a [...] "down" [...] word) and usually each answer must contain at least three letters. In such puzzles shaded squares are typically limited to about one-sixth of the total. Crossword grids elsewhere, such as in Britain, South Africa, India and Australia, have a <b>lattice-like</b> structure, with {{a higher percentage of}} shaded squares (around 25%), leaving about half the letters in an answer unchecked. For example, if the top row has an answer running all the way across, there will often be no across answers in the second row.|$|E
2500|$|It {{does not}} spread and form new plants via the roots. The rhizome, from [...] in diameter, bears a few {{narrowly}} triangular to linear scales, black to dark brown {{in color and}} strongly clathrate (bearing a <b>lattice-like</b> pattern). The scales are [...] long and [...] wide, with untoothed margins. The stipe (the part of the stem below the leaf blade) is [...] long, and comprises one-quarter to one-third {{of the length of}} the blade. It lacks wings, and is a shiny reddish-brown throughout its length. Towards the base, it has a few threadlike scales similar in color to those of the rhizome. Starch granules are stored in tissue {{at the base of the}} stipe and, to a lesser extent, in the rhizome, giving the bases an enlarged appearance and a firm texture. The stipe bases are long-lived and may survive the disintegration of the rest of the stipe and the blade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{roots of}} A.pinnatifidum are not proliferous, so {{it appears as}} {{clusters}} of leaves springing from a single rhizome. The leaves are closely spaced on the rhizome, which is frequently branched. The rhizome is about [...] in diameter, covered with narrowly triangular scales which are dark reddish-brown or blackish in color, and strongly clathrate (bearing a <b>lattice-like</b> pattern). The scales are [...] long and 0.3 to 0.5millimeters wide, with untoothed edges. The stipe (the part of the stem below the leaf blade) is shiny and dark reddish brown at the base. The color fades to green in the upper one-third to one-half of the stipe. It is covered in narrowly triangular, dark reddish-brown scales at the base, which diminish into hairs in {{the upper part of}} the stipe. It may show narrow wings from the base of the leaf to near the base of the stipe. The stipe is [...] long, and may be from one-tenth to one and one-half times the length of the blade.|$|E

50|$|Linear and matrix smart {{polymers}} exist with {{a variety}} of properties depending on reactive functional groups and side chains. These groups might be responsive to pH, temperature, ionic strength, electric or magnetic fields, and light. Some polymers are reversibly cross-linked by noncovalent bonds that can break and reform depending on external conditions. Nanotechnology has been fundamental in the development of certain nanoparticle polymers such as dendrimers and fullerenes, that have been applied for drug delivery. Traditional drug encapsulation has been done using lactic acid polymers. More recent developments have seen the formation of <b>lattice-like</b> matrices that hold the drug of interest integrated or entrapped between the polymer strands.|$|E
