25|$|Lumpsuckers {{are found}} in {{temperate}} northern waters. They live on the seafloor, and are temporary residents of rocky pools in late winter and early spring when they spawn. The body of the <b>lumpsucker</b> is scaleless and covered with small lumps. They have a large sucking disc on their underside which they use to cling to surfaces. They are normally a blue to slate-grey colour, and are effectively camouflaged to look like stones. They are portly, nearly spherical, poor swimmers, reaching lengths up to 50cm. After the female <b>lumpsucker</b> lays eggs, the male takes over, clamping itself to a rock where it guards the eggs. When they hatch, lumpsuckers look like tiny tadpoles. They remain in shallow water and rock pools, hiding amongst seaweed and rocks, until they grow up.|$|E
25|$|Some rock pool fish {{which are}} {{temporary}} residents include the long-spined sea scorpion, the pipefish worm, the rock goby {{and the common}} <b>lumpsucker.</b> However some other rock pool fish are territorial in nature, and will stay with the same pool for extended periods. Examples are the common blenny and its near relative the butterfish.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{peculiarities of}} <b>Lumpsuckers</b> neural system is that they lack Mauthner cell neurons in their hindbrain, while these cells are present in {{virtually}} all other teleost fish. Nevertheless, the <b>lumpsuckers</b> do have a C-startle response, which is apparently mediated by other hindbrain cells.|$|R

5000|$|Gobies, remoras and <b>lumpsuckers</b> have suckers {{which are}} {{modified}} fins. These fishes use their suckers to substrata or to bigger fishes. In gobies the disc-shaped sucker is formed from fused pelvic fins. Amphidromous gobies particularly use their suckers for climbing through waterfalls during their developmental migrations. In remoras the sucker is a modified dorsal fin. In <b>lumpsuckers</b> the sucker is formed from modified pelvic fins, located ventrally, {{and behind the}} pectoral fins.|$|R
2500|$|Cod {{and related}} species are plagued by parasites. For example, the cod worm, Lernaeocera branchialis, starts {{life as a}} copepod, a small free-swimming {{crustacean}} larva. The first host used by cod worm is a flatfish or <b>lumpsucker,</b> which they capture with grasping hooks {{at the front of}} their body. They penetrate the <b>lumpsucker</b> with a thin [...] which they use to suck its blood. The nourished cod worms then mate on the <b>lumpsucker.</b> The female worm, with her now fertilized eggs, then finds a cod, or a cod-like fish such as a haddock or whiting. There the worm clings to the gills while it metamorphoses into a plump, sinusoidal, wormlike body, with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear. The front part of the worms body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host's heart. There, firmly rooted in the cod's circulatory system, the front part of the parasite develops like the branches of a tree, reaching into the main artery. In this way, the worm extracts nutrients from the cod's blood, remaining safely tucked beneath the cod's gill cover until it releases a new generation of offspring into the water.|$|E
2500|$|Fish {{species of}} the gulf include Atlantic salmon, {{viviparous}} eelpout, gobies, belica, loach, European chub, minnow, silver bream, common dace, ruffe, Crucian carp, stickleback, European smelt, common rudd, brown trout, tench, pipefish, burbot, perch, gudgeon, <b>lumpsucker,</b> roach, lamprey, vendace, garfish, common whitefish, common bream, [...] zander, orfe, pike, spined loach, sprat, Baltic herring, sabre carp, common bleak, European eel and Atlantic cod. Commercial fishing is carried out in spring and autumn. Gray seal and ringed seal are met in the gulf, but the latter is very rare.|$|E

40|$|Smooth <b>lumpsuckers</b> {{were found}} to be widely {{distributed}} throughout the Aleutian Basin. A total of 148 smooth <b>lumpsuckers</b> collected in the summer months, 9 to 36 cm in total length, were divided into two groups according to length: a small-size group ranging from 9 - 16 cm and a large-size group ranging from 17 - 36 cm. Those fish which attained a length of at least 17 cm seemed to have approached the coast in the following year for spawning. They fed mainly on medusae and ctenophores, and occasionally on pelagic polychaetes and crustacea...|$|R

50|$|<b>Lumpsuckers</b> or {{lumpfish}} {{are mostly}} small scorpaeniform marine fish {{of the family}} Cyclopteridae. They {{are found in the}} cold waters of the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific oceans. The greatest number of species are found in the North Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Mauthner cells first {{appear in}} {{lampreys}} (being absent in hagfish and lancelets), and {{are present in}} virtually all teleost fish, {{as well as in}} amphibians (including postmetamorphic frogs and toads). Some fish, such as <b>lumpsuckers,</b> seem to have lost the Mauthner cells however.|$|R
50|$|Biological control {{methods to}} manage parasites {{are already being}} used, such as cleaner fish (e.g. <b>lumpsuckers</b> and wrasse) to control sea lice populations in salmon farming.

50|$|Immediately {{across the}} street, below Emma Schmitz Memorial Overlook, is a rocky beach that is {{accessible}} during low tide. The tidepools here {{are rich in}} limpets, <b>lumpsuckers,</b> blennies, chitons, nudibranches, sea stars, sea slugs, sea cucumbers, hermit crabs {{and an array of}} other tidepool dwellers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lumpsuckers</b> are {{a poorly}} studied group, with little known of their {{behaviour}} and biology. At least some species {{are known to}} travel great distances in order to spawn in shallow, intertidal waters (from December to June in the smooth lumpsucker); this may well be true of all species. Males are also known to guard the brood of spherical eggs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lumpsuckers</b> {{are named}} {{appropriately}} enough; their portly bodies are nearly spherical with generally drab coloration and lithic patterns. The [...] "sucker" [...] part {{refers to the}} fish's modified pelvic fins, which have evolved into adhesive discs (located ventrally, behind the pectoral fins); the fish use these discs {{to adhere to the}} substrate. Many species have bony, wart-like tubercles adorning the head and body; these are important taxonomic features of the family.|$|R

25|$|The most {{distinctive}} aspects of goby morphology are the fused pelvic fins that form a disc-shaped sucker. This sucker is functionally {{analogous to the}} dorsal fin sucker possessed by the remoras or the pelvic fin sucker of the <b>lumpsuckers,</b> but is anatomically distinct; these similarities {{are the product of}} convergent evolution. Gobies can often be seen using the sucker to adhere to rocks and corals, and in aquariums they will stick to glass walls of the tank, as well.|$|R
50|$|As their {{appearance}} might suggest, <b>lumpsuckers</b> are poor swimmers. Most species are benthic; that is, they {{spend most of}} their time on or near the bottom. The fish are found on rocky or muddy substrates, where their coloration allows for effective camouflage. Members of the family are found primarily on the continental shelf or slope, at depths down to 1700 m. Some of the deeper-living species are however pelagic, remaining some distance above the ocean floor.|$|R

5000|$|The cornish <b>lumpsucker</b> survives by {{consisting}} {{on a diet}} {{of mostly}} detritus material, meaning that it lives off the dead organic matter of its environment.|$|E
50|$|The simple, rounded fins {{are small}} with the {{exception}} of the broad, fan-like pectorals, which actually extend ventrally. The first of the two dorsal fins is spinous, with 4-8 spines; in some species, this fin is completely overgrown with skin and therefore not visible. While the lateral line in <b>lumpsuckers</b> is otherwise reduced or absent, it is well developed in the head; some species even have tubular, whisker-like external projections of the opercular canal, which is a part of the cranial lateral line system.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} 48 hours {{exposure}} to mechanically and chemically dispersed oil on juvenile <b>lumpsuckers,</b> {{as well as}} the use of gill EROD activity and bile PAH metabolites as potential biomarkers were assessed in this study. This was done by measuring the gill EROD activity, bile PAH metabolites, plasma osmolality, plasma chloride concentration, and gill Na+/K+ATPase activity. The mechanical and chemical dispersion did not differ significantly in terms of gill EROD induction, PAHs metabolisation, plasma osmolality and chloride concentration, and gill Na+/K+ATPase activity. The oil exposure and metabolisation of PAHs were confirmed by the presence of PAH metabolites in the bile. Thus, this study can recommend the use of juvenile <b>lumpsucker’s</b> bile metabolites as a biomarker in detecting oil exposure. The gill EROD activity showed a lack of response upon exposure to oil. Further investigation is recommended to be able to determine the suitability of its use as a biomarker. A significant relationship was seen between crude oil concentration and plasma osmolality and plasma chloride concentration, i. e. as the oil concentration increases, the plasma osmolality and plasma chloride concentration also increases. The mechanistic link between oil exposure and gill Na+/K+ ATPase activity was not clear, thus warrants further investigation. This study has shown that the acute exposure to crude oil was not fatal to the fish but caused impairment on hypo-osmoregulation mechanism...|$|R
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, <b>lumpsuckers,</b> and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|R
