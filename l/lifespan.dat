5|$|Sperm {{competition}} and chemicals introduced to females through mating {{have a negative}} effect on females and their <b>lifespan.</b> In males, production of the spermatophore, sperm, and secondary chemicals reduces their <b>lifespan.</b> As the number of copulations increase, the rate of mortality also increases in both sexes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} several {{challenges}} {{when it comes}} to therapeutic use of stem cells and their ability to replenish organs and tissues. First, different cells may have different <b>lifespans</b> even though they are originated from the same stem cells (See T-cells and erythrocytes), meaning that aging can occur differently in cells that have longer <b>lifespans</b> as opposed to the ones with shorter <b>lifespans.</b> Also, continual effort to replace the somatic cells may cause exhaustion of stem cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{theories of}} aging {{are useful for}} gaining insights into the complex mechanisms underlying senescence. Classical theories argue that high levels of extrinsic mortality should select {{for the evolution of}} shorter <b>lifespans</b> and earlier peak fertility. Non-classical theories, in contrast, posit that an increase in extrinsic mortality could select for the evolution of longer <b>lifespans.</b> Although numerous studies support the classical paradigm, recent data challenge classical predictions, finding that high extrinsic mortality can select for the evolution of longer <b>lifespans.</b> To further elucidate the role of extrinsic mortality in the evolution of aging, we implemented a stochastic, agent-based, computational model. We used a simulated annealing optimization approach to predict which model parameters predispose populations to evolve longer or shorter <b>lifespans</b> in response to increased levels of predation. We report that longer <b>lifespans</b> evolved in the presence of rising predation if the cost of mating is relatively high and if energy is available in excess. Conversely, we found that dramatically shorter <b>lifespans</b> evolved when mating costs were relatively low and food was relatively scarce. We also analyzed the effects of increased predation on various parameters related to density dependence and energy allocation. Longer and shorter <b>lifespans</b> were accompanied by increased and decreased investments of energy into somatic maintenance, respectively. Similarly, earlier and later maturation ages were accompanied by increased and decreased energetic investments into early fecundity, respectively. Higher predation significantly decreased the total population size, enlarged the shared resourc...|$|R
50|$|One {{major factor}} that affects wild guppies' {{senescence}} patterns is {{the mortality rate}} caused by predation. Guppies from high-predation environments suffer high extrinsic mortality rate {{because they are more}} likely to be killed by predators. Female guppies from high-predation habitats experience a significant increase in mortality at 6 months of age, while those from low-predation habitats do not suffer increased mortality until 16 months. However, guppies from high-predation environments were found to have longer <b>lifespans</b> because their reproductive <b>lifespans</b> are longer. No significant difference is seen in postreproductive <b>lifespans.</b>|$|R

5|$|The maximum <b>lifespan</b> of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been {{recorded}} living over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) and the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can live so long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer <b>lifespan</b> than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter <b>lifespan</b> than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer <b>lifespan</b> than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E

50|$|Robert Fogel {{published}} {{a study of}} <b>lifespans</b> and nutrition from about a century before Malthus to the 19th century that examined European birth and death records, military and other records of height and weight that found significant stunted height and low body weight indicative of chronic hunger and malnutrition. He also found short <b>lifespans</b> that he attributed to chronic malnourishment which left people susceptible to disease. <b>Lifespans,</b> height and weight began to steadily increase in the UK and France after 1750.

5|$|Domesticated rats have {{a longer}} <b>lifespan</b> than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are {{protected}} from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average <b>lifespan</b> is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a <b>lifespan</b> of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats.

5|$|Estimates of <b>lifespans</b> {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild <b>lifespans</b> are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} {{depart from the}} findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the mean age of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca <b>lifespans</b> are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|R

40|$|Most {{accounts}} {{of human life}} history propose that women have short reproductive spans relative to their adult <b>lifespans,</b> while men not only remain fertile but carry on reproducing until late life. Here we argue that studies have overlooked evidence for variation in male reproductive ageing across human populations. We apply a Bayesian approach to census data from Agta hunter-gatherers and Gambian farmers to show that long post-reproductive <b>lifespans</b> characterise not only women but also males in some traditional human populations. We calculate three indices of reproductive ageing in men (oldest age at reproduction, male late-life reproduction, and post-reproductive representation) and identify a continuum of male reproductive longevity across eight traditional societies ranging from !Kung, Hadza and Agta hunter-gatherers exhibiting low levels of polygyny, early age at last reproduction and long post-reproductive <b>lifespans,</b> to male Gambian agriculturalists and Turkana pastoralists showing higher levels of polygyny, late-life reproduction and shorter post-reproductive <b>lifespans.</b> We conclude that the uniquely human detachment between rates of somatic senescence and reproductive decline, {{and the existence of}} post-reproductive <b>lifespans,</b> are features of both male and female life histories, and therefore not exclusive consequences of menopause...|$|R

The age of a mammoth can be roughly {{determined}} by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section. However, ring-counting does not account for a mammoth's early years; early growth is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male mammoth was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten).|$|E
