We propose a partial zero-forcing precoding strategy based on a shared-private rate splitting scheme at the transmitter, in which each transmitter communicates part of its message to the other transmitter, and subsequently partially pre-subtracts the interfering signal using a zero-forcing precoder. We prove an outer bound and show that the proposed strategy is asymptotically sum-capacity achieving in a very weak interference regime, where both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the interferenceto-noise ratio (INR) go to infinity while their ratio in <b>dB</b> <b>scale</b> is kept fixed. In this case, every cooperation bit results in one-bit gain in sum capacity. We also consider a different asymptotic regime where the transmit power constraints and the channel gains are fixed while the noise powers go down to zero.
