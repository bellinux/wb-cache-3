The asynchronous one-direction evacuation, synchronous one-direction evacuation and oppo-site evacuation methods are frequently used in double-hole tunnel evacuation. This paper establishes three-dimensional numerical model by using the finite element analysis software MIDAS/GTS v 2. 01 and mainly studies the mutual influ-ences of tunnels in the asynchronous one-direction evacuation and synchronous one-direction evacuation. The following conclusions are concluded based on computing. The preliminary conclusion is that the influential distance between the evacuation section of two tunnels is 3 D (D is the tunnel diameter) in the parallel tunnel asynchronous evacuation, namely when the <b>lagging</b> <b>distance</b> is more than 3 D, the lagging evacuation tunnel will not affect the advance evacuation tunnel section. The asynchronous evacuation of the vertical distribution tunnel is divided into the up tunnel first evacuation and down tunnel first evacuation. For up tunnel first evacuation, the influence range of the <b>lagging</b> <b>distance</b> is 5 D. For down tunnel first evacuation, the influence range of the <b>lagging</b> <b>distance</b> is 1 D. For up tunnel first evacuation on the slope, the influence range of the <b>lagging</b> <b>distance</b> is 5 D.

Evaluation of these semivariogram models and the estimation accuracy of SK methods was by Coefficient of Determination (R²), Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency (E), and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD).

Different construction sequences have significant effects on the stress re-distribution of the ground, resulting in different magnitude of ground deformations, magnitudes and distributions of lining thrusts. In all the construction sequences analysed in this research, stress paths show that substantial yielding of soil happens at the invert due to high lateral stress at the invert, which caused the collapse of the Heathrow Express Tunnel. Moreover, the length of the unsupported span (LU) is an important parameter in tunnelling in a way that significantly different ground surface settlements and lining thrusts are resulted. The behaviour of the single tunnel construction is investigated three-dimensionally and compared with the results of 2 D analyses. Results show that ground surface settlement profiles can be estimated reasonably well using the method of nodal force reduction. In additions, the amount of nodal force reduction required for matching 3 D analysis results is related to LU and the initial Ko conditions. Nevertheless, the distribution of lining thrust resulting from 2 D and 3 D analyses are very different. Construction of two parallel tunnels has been modelled three-dimensionally. Load redistribution mechanism of parallel tunnels depends on the <b>lagged</b> <b>distance</b> of the tunnel (LT). For small LT (LT = 0), the loadings associated with twin tunnel construction are shared by the ground in the vicinity of both tunnels and the shotcrete lining. Stress paths show that the longer the LT, the more is the load attracted to the leading tunnel, resulting in different proportions of load sharing. Due to different load redistribution mechanisms, the bending moment in lining varies with LT. For the leading tunnel, the bending moment in the lining increases with LT, especially at the invert regions. On the other hand, it is seen that the maximum bending moment of the lagging tunnel decreases with LT. Furthermore, the resulting maximum ground settlement and the offset of the settlement trough varies with the LT. The maximum ground surface settlement shows a slightly decreasing trend because increasing amount of loading associated with the excavation of a neighbor parallel tunnel is transferred to the nearby lining of the leading tunnel with larger LT. As a result, {{at the end of the}} construction, the ground settlement trough is shifted towards the lagging tunnel. The offset increases with the <b>lagged</b> <b>distance</b> of the tunnel. Moreover, simple superposition of the single tunnel solutions is an inappropriate way to estimate the solution of the twin tunnel settlement profile, which underestimates the results from a twin tunnel analyses. On the contrary, LT does not seem to have significant effect on the excess pore water pressure at equilibrium...|$|R

The range in water levels fluctuations will be decreased (damped) and delayed compared to the range and time observed for the adjacent tide. The primary controls on the damping and <b>lag</b> are the <b>distance</b> from the coast, and the hydraulic conductivity of the geological materials.|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} in predation risk can ameliorate {{impacts on}} prey populations, particularly for prey of generalists. Spatially heterogeneous risk implies {{the existence of}} refugia, and the spatial scale of those refugia and their persistence over time affect whether prey can avoid predation by aggregating therein. Our objective was to quantify the magnitude, spatial scale, and temporal persistence of heterogeneity in risk of predation by white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), an abundant generalist predator of gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) and songbirds. We used track plates to measure white-footed mouse activity at. 170 trees in each of three forest plots in upstate New York during summers of 2003 – 2005. We quantified the mean and coefficient of variation of track activity among trees by fitting the beta-binomial distribution to data from each plot and study period. We measured temporal persistence by disattenuated autocorrelation, and spatial scale by fitting exponential variograms. Mice were much less abundant in 2005 {{than the other two}} years, leading to lower overall track activity but higher coefficient of variation among trees. Mouse track activity at individual trees was positively autocorrelated between monthly study periods in 2003 and 2004, and even between the two years, whereas temporal autocorrelation in 2005 was much weaker. Track activity showed positive spatial autocorrelation over <b>lag</b> <b>distances</b> from; 30 to. 1000 m. These findings indicate that mouse activity, and hence risk to their prey, varies substantially in space at spatial and temporal scales that appear responsive to mouse population dynamics. The spatial scale and temporal persistence of that variation imply that prey may benefit from returning to, or failing to disperse from, refugia...|$|R
