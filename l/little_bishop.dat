On his arrival he crept up to his dressing-room with somewhat of a palpitating heart; he had overstayed his alloted time by three days, and was not without much fear of penalties. Nothing, however, could be more affectionately cordial than the greeting he received; the girls came out and kissed him in a manner that was quite soothing to his spirit; and Mrs. Proudie, [...] "albeit, unused to the melting mood," [...] squeezed him in her arms and almost in words called him her dear, darling, good, pet, <b>little</b> <b>bishop.</b> All this was a very pleasant surprise.|$|E

60|$|So Thomas {{was sent}} for and offered the post, after its {{difficulties}} and drawbacks had been fairly but diplomatically explained to him. He {{did not hesitate}} a minute, or at any rate five minutes; he took it at once, feeling that his call had come; also {{that it was the}} very thing for which he had been seeking. Up in that secluded spot in Portuguese Territory he would, he reflected, be entirely on his own, a sort of <b>little</b> <b>bishop</b> with no one to interfere with him, and able to have his own way about everything, which in more civilised regions he found he could not do. Here a set of older gentlemen, who were always appealing to their experience of natives, continually put a spoke into his wheel, bringing his boldest plans to naught. There it would be different. He would fashion his own wheel and grind the witch-doctor with his following to dust beneath its iron rim. He said that he would go at once, and what is more, he promised a donation of 1,000 pounds towards the rebuilding of the church and other burnt-out edifices.|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} at this time nobody saw clearly the working of his mind,--not even his wife, who studied it very closely, who gave him credit for all his high qualities, and who had {{gradually}} learned to acknowledge to herself that she must distrust his judgment in many things. She knew that he was good and yet weak, that he was afflicted by false pride and supported by true pride, that his intellect was still very bright, yet so dismally obscured on many sides as almost to justify people in saying that he was mad. She knew that he was almost a saint, and yet almost a castaway through vanity and hatred of those above him. But she did not know that he knew all this of himself also. She did not comprehend that he should be hourly telling himself that people were calling him mad and were so calling him with truth. It did not occur to her that he could see her insight into him. She doubted as {{to the way in which}} he had got the cheque,--never imagining, however, that he had wilfully stolen it;--thinking that his mind had been so much astray as to admit of his finding it and using it without wilful guilt,--thinking also, alas, that a man who could so act was hardly fit for such duties as those which were entrusted to him. But she did not dream that this was precisely his own idea of his own state and of his own position;--that he was always inquiring of himself whether he was not mad; whether, if mad, he was not bound to lay down his office; that he was ever taxing himself with improper hostility to the bishop,--never forgetting for a moment his wrath against the bishop and the bishop's wife, still comforting himself with his triumph over the bishop and the bishop's wife,--but, for all that, accusing himself of a heavy sin and proposing to himself to go to the palace and there humbly to relinquish his clerical authority. Such a course of action he was proposing to himself, but not with any realized idea that he would so act. He was as a man who walks along a river's bank thinking of suicide, calculating how best he might kill himself,--whether the river does not offer an opportunity too good to be neglected, telling himself that for many reasons he had better do so, suggesting to himself that the water is pleasant and cool, and that his ears would soon be deaf to the harsh noises of the world,--but yet knowing, or thinking that he knows, that he never will kill himself. So it was with Mr. Crawley. Though his imagination pictured to himself the whole scene,--how he would humble himself to the ground as he acknowledged his unfitness, how he would endure the small-voiced triumph of the <b>little</b> <b>bishop,</b> how, from the abjectness of his own humility, even from the ground on which he would be crouching, he would rebuke the loud-mouthed triumph of the bishop's wife; though there was no touch wanting to the picture which he thus drew,--he did not really propose to himself to commit this professional suicide. His wife, too, had considered whether it might be in truth becoming that he should give up his clerical duties, at any rate for a while; but she had never thought that the idea was present to his mind also.|$|E

Under the guise of taking the two boys out to the country to a lodge to go fishing, Rayber finally confronts Tarwater and tells him that he must change and must leave the crazy, superstitious Christian upbringing that his great uncle corrupted him with. Tarwater, however, is not so easily convinced. While at the lodge, he meets up again with the [...] "Voice" [...] (the devil) who tells Tarwater to forsake his great uncle's command to baptize <b>little</b> <b>Bishop</b> and instead, drown the boy. One evening, Tarwater takes Bishop out on a boat {{to the middle of the}} lake, with Rayber's reluctant blessing. Rayber cannot see them on the lake but can still hear the voices faintly. Tarwater ends up drowning Bishop while at the same time baptizing the boy, thereby fulfilling both destinies simultaneously. Rayber realizes what has happened and faints, not out of fear for his son's life, but because he feels nothing at his son's death.|$|E

50|$|Having heard <b>Little</b> Rock <b>Bishop</b> Edward Fitzgerald's {{call for}} more Roman Catholic clergy in Arkansas, Strub visited the state and wrote Bishop Fitzgerald obtaining {{permission}} to found St. Joseph Colony in Conway. The Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad granted the mission several hundred thousand acres of land from Marche and Atkins. In January 1879, Strub moved the mission to Morrilton, since the location was more central. In 1880, Strub wrote Der Leitstern (The Guiding Star), a German-language pamphlet that encouraged immigrants to settle in the colony. By 1889, ninety-five Catholic families had settled near Morrilton. A drought in the mid-1880s stymied immigration, but the mission persisted. However, the Holy Ghost Fathers's novitiate moved to Pittsburgh in 1884, and the school and church in Morrilton were destroyed by a tornado in 1892. Strub died on January 27, 1890 while {{on a visit to}} Pittsburgh.|$|R
