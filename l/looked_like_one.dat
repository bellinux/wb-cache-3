5|$|In 'The Clearing of the Woodlands', Hoskins {{argues that}} before the 15th century England must have <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>one</b> great forest, {{but most of the}} woods were cleared for arable or pasture in the 12th and 13th centuries. Under Henry II perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>one</b> could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E

500|$|In 1848, Aqil {{assisted}} {{an expedition}} headed by US Navy captain William Francis Lynch to the Dead Sea, and became {{known in the}} United States and Europe through the publication of Lynch's book that year. Vivid descriptions of Aqil by Lynch are quoted at length {{in the works of}} Finn. Lynch's first encounter with Aqil was in the divan of Said Bey, the Ottoman kaimakam of Acre, and is recorded as follows:But what especially attracted my attention was a magnificent savage enveloped in a scarlet cloth pelisse richly embroidered with gold. He was the handsomest, and I soon thought also the most graceful being I had ever seen. His complexion was of a rich mellow indescribable olive tint, and his hair a glossy black; his teeth were regular and of the whitest ivory, and the glance of his eye was keen at times, but generally soft and lustrous. With the tarboosh upon his head which he seemed to wear uneasily, he reclined, rather than sat upon {{the opposite side of the}} divân, while his hand played in unconscious familiarity with the hilt of his yataghan. He <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>one</b> who would be 'Steel amid the din of arms, and wax when with the fair.' ...|$|E
500|$|Melina Newman of HitFix {{thought that}} it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>one</b> of Carey's lowest-production budgets for a music video to date, but {{explained}} {{that it was not}} necessarily [...] "a bad thing", and that Carey looked [...] "adorable" [...] in a nurses outfit. She likened the use of a red and white color scheme for the video to a Target commercial. Anna Pickard commented that Carey and Minaj looked [...] "grumpier" [...] than what dolls usually do because [...] "their men are low-down dirty dogs who should henceforth get up out of Mimi and Nikki's faces". She compared the use of a red and white palette to Kylie Minogue's music video for [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head", Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] and Lady Gaga's [...] "Bad Romance", and that it appeared to be a [...] "go-to device for directors who want their pop video to pop visually, without the need for too much pesky plot to worry about". Chris Ryan thought that Minaj outshined Carey in the video. In a review of Minaj's ten best videos in December 2014, Rolling Stone ranked the video for [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] at number eight, and wrote that Carey and Minaj had [...] "great on-camera chemistry".|$|E

2500|$|Designed {{and named}} by Teague to look either [...] "cute or {{controversial}} - depending on one's viewpoint ... for many, it seemed {{perfect for the}} free-thinking early 1970s." [...] American Motors executives apparently felt confident enough to not worry that the Gremlin name might have negative connotations. Time magazine noted two definitions for gremlin: [...] "Defined by Webster's as 'a small gnome held {{to be responsible for}} malfunction of equipment.' American Motors' definition: 'a pal to its friends and an ogre to its enemies.'" [...] The car's cartoon-inspired mascot was marketed for product differentiation and was intended to be memorable to consumers. The Gremlin's unorthodox hatchback design was also needed to make the car stand out in the competitive marketplace, and according to Teague: [...] "Nobody would have paid it any attention if it had <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>one</b> of the Big Three" [...] automobiles.|$|E
