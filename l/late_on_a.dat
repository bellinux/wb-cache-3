This time Julio Jones ran the ball 56-yards for a touchdown to extend the Alabama lead to 27–3. Shelley scored Alabama's final points in the fourth on a 28-yard field goal with State scoring their lone touchdown <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 27-yard Chad Bumphis touchdown reception from Tyler Russell.

5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only Arthur Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was thus deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He had never opened at Test level, but had once batted at No. 3 when used as a nightwatchman {{after the fall of}} the first wicket <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> day's play. He was unable to make an impact—Bedser removed him for one, caught by Evans at chest height off the inside edge from a ball that reared from the pitch. It was a difficult catch as Evans was standing up to the stumps and he had little time to react to the ball's change of direction. O'Reilly criticised the use of Johnson as an opener, as vice-captain Lindsay Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach. Johnson's dismissal brought Bradman in to face the new ball. The Australian captain thus had to face Bedser, who had already dismissed him three times in the Tests with a new ball, and Pollard, who had troubled him in the match against Lancashire. Pollard then trapped Bradman lbw with an off cutter that struck the Australian captain on the back foot for seven to leave Australia in trouble at 13/2. This provoked a strong cheer from the crowd in support of Pollard, the Lancashire local. Australia were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming for leg stump to stifle the scoring. He was partnered by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Middlesbrough {{were drawn}} {{at home to}} non-league Barrow in the third-round of the FA Cup. Middlesbrough went into the game without a win in eight league games. They named a strong line-up while giving Josh Walker his first Boro start as he lined up in the centre of midfield. The game saw Middlesbrough {{dominate}} in chances, but poor finishing meant they only won 2–1, with both of the home side's goals coming from Afonso Alves – his first goals for over two months – and both assisted by Stewart Downing. Middlesbrough's failures in front of goal meant they got a late scare as Barrow pulled a goal back after more bad defending at a set piece, but they failed {{to take a chance}} to level the game <b>late</b> <b>on.</b> <b>A</b> sour moment of the game saw Jérémie Aliadière injured and ruled out for two months.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{was called}} into the England team for their first ever meeting with Wales. The match was played at the Kennington Oval on 18 January 1879 in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious {{snowfall}} both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each. The poor attendance (reports range from 85 to 300) was also attributed to the weather. Some sources suggest that William Clegg turned up 20 minutes late for the game. Clegg, a solicitor, was working <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> case (the trial of Charles Peace, the Banner Cross murderer) {{and was unable to}} leave Sheffield for London on the Friday night. The next morning, the southbound train with Clegg on it, was delayed by heavy snow. The match started without Clegg and England played with ten men until he arrived. Despite this, England won the match by two goals to one, with Herbert Whitfeld and Thomas Sorby scoring for England.|$|E
25|$|Argentina {{collected}} {{a maximum of}} six points from their opening two games after beating Greece 4–0 in Foxboro before coming from behind to overcome the feisty Nigerians 2–1 on the same field four days later, yet still only finished third. The game against Greece had been won in style thanks mainly to a hat-trick from Gabriel Batistuta, {{yet it was the}} other goal in the game – from Diego Maradona – that hit the headlines. Nigeria had been very impressive on their World Cup debut, and despite the narrow loss to Argentina, had emerged as group winners following victories against Bulgaria and Greece, the latter in which Nigeria doubled its lead <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> goal from Daniel Amokachi – a goal that would allow Nigeria to top its group. Maradona only played with Argentina during their first two games, both in Foxborough (playing Greece and Nigeria); he was thrown out of the tournament after testing positive for ephedrine.|$|E

25|$|After {{both teams}} failed to score on their {{respective}} opening possessions, the Hoosiers scored on their next drive on a 90-yard touchdown run from Coleman, giving Indiana their first lead at 20–14. The Buckeyes retook {{the lead on}} a 54-yard punt return by Jalin Marshall, making the score 21–20 Ohio State. The Buckeyes' first drive of the fourth quarter ended with a touchdown pass from Barrett to Marshall, and gave the Buckeyes a 28–20 advantage. Following a Tyvis Powell interception, the Buckeyes took a two-possession lead late {{in the fourth quarter}} on another touchdown pass from Barrett to Marshall. Another touchdown on a connection between Barrett and Marshall sealed the game for the Buckeyes, who took a 42–20 lead. Indiana scored <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 52-yard touchdown run by Coleman, making the final score 42–27. Following the game, Jalin Marshall was named the Big Ten Freshman of the Week with his four touchdown receptions. With the victory, Ohio State clinched their third straight division championship, securing a place in the Big Ten Championship Game and improved their overall record again Indiana to 70–12–5 (71–12–5 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

As Wales had been defeated 9–0 in their previous international against Scotland, England were confident of victory and selected an inexperienced eleven, including five débutantes. The match was played at the Kennington Oval in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious snowfall both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each. The poor attendance (reports range from 85 to 300) was also attributed to the weather. Some sources suggest that William Clegg turned up 20 minutes late for the game.

[...] Klingman said that not everyone could make the entire session, so a variety of musicians, particularly guitarists and bassists, needed to be used. The performers, including Rundgren himself, only rehearsed the songs a few times before committing the performance to tape, in order to sound spontaneous, and some of the banter between takes appears on the finished album.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal hosted Everton at Highbury on {{the opening}} weekend of the season. Campbell was sent off in the 25th minute, for a {{professional}} foul on Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen. Arsenal, despite their man disadvantage, went two goals up after 58 minutes, before Tomasz Radzinski scored for the visitors <b>late</b> <b>on.</b> <b>A</b> trip to the Riverside Stadium to face Middlesbrough a week after ended in a 4–0 win; the first three goals, scored by Henry, Gilberto Silva and Sylvain Wiltord all came in the first half. Three days later, Campbell and Henry each scored as Aston Villa were beaten by two goals. Arsenal continued their perfect start to the season, with an away win against Manchester City on 31 August 2003. As Campbell was suspended, Martin Keown came into {{the first team to}} partner Touré. Although Arsenal conceded first – a [...] "comical" [...] own goal by Lauren – and played [...] "the worst 45 minutes that any of their fans could remember" [...] according to journalist Matt Dickinson, Wiltord equalised in the second half, before Fredrik Ljungberg had taken advantage of a Seaman error to score the winning goal. After four matches, Arsenal stood in first position, three points clear of Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} morning, English tail-ender Dick Pollard {{came to the}} crease and pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Australian opener Sid Barnes, who was {{standing}} at short leg. Barnes stood closer than most in this positionalmost {{on the edge of}} the cut stripand was unable to evade the ball. He [...] "dropped like a fallen tree", and had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. England eventually reached 363 after Johnson had sent down 38 overs and conceded 77 runs without success. With Barnes injured and Brown dropped, Arthur Morris was the only opener available, so Johnson was deployed as his makeshift partner. He had never opened at Test level, but had once batted at No. 3 when used as a nightwatchman after the fall of the first wicket <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> day’s play. Journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O’Reilly criticised the use of Johnson as an opener, as vice-captain Lindsay Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach, traits that were typical of an opener. Johnson made only one, exposing Bradman to the new ball. Although Australia struggled, they eventually avoided the follow on and ended on 221.|$|E
500|$|McConnell {{immediately}} launched ads accusing Bevin {{of taking}} taxpayer bailouts, citing his acceptance of state grants to rebuild Bevin Brothers. Bevin responded with ads accusing McConnell of voting for higher taxes, government bailouts, {{increases in the}} debt ceiling, and confirmation of liberal judicial nominees. McConnell's next ad featured Bevin telling an audience [...] "I have no tax delinquency problem, nor have I ever," [...] then claimed his businesses had failed to pay taxes eight times and Bevin was <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tax payment on his $1.2 million vacation home in Greenwood, Maine, in 2007. PolitiFact.com rated the ad [...] "Mostly False", saying that Bevin Brothers incurred the delinquent taxes in 2008 and {{the second quarter of}} 2009, when the extent of Bevin's involvement with the company was [...] "unclear". Regarding the vacation home, PolitiFact noted that Bevin's escrow company changed in 2007, and the new company failed to pay the property taxes on the home from escrow on time. Town records show that the taxes were paid by February 2009, and Bevin had paid them on-time every year before and after 2007. McConnell's third ad in as many weeks targeted Bevin for falsely claiming on his LinkedIn page that he attended a seminar affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The three-year program, which Bevin attended from 2006 to 2008, was actually sponsored by the MIT Enterprise Forum, which is technically unaffiliated with MIT. The discrepancy was first reported by The Hill in March 2013, and was clarified on his LinkedIn page at that time.|$|E
