500|$|Before {{the music}} begins, Lee appears with blond hair, a baby-blue blouse {{and a long}} white skirt and emerges from the kitchen holding a fresh-from-the-oven frozen pizza, in a TV commercial. She {{presents}} the pizza to her family and, as the camera zooms in for a close-up, the brand name on the pizza box is visible and it is called Lies. [...] "There is nothing better than a good lie," [...] <b>Lee</b> <b>says</b> cheerily, through a smile. Scenes of Lee in her hotel room follow as she removes her makeup. Those scenes are followed by Lee with [...] "luxurious auburn tresses and dangling diamond earrings" [...] as she plays a glamorous spokesmodel who violently scribbles and scratches out her picture in magazines after the photo shoot has finished. She also portrays a motorcycle girl in a commercial who drinks a soft drink called [...] "Lies" [...] that affords its drinker the opportunity to [...] "Be somebody." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Lee asks Michael {{about his}} latest {{experience}} with the [...] "green reality". At a police carnival at an amusement park, Emma (Daniela Bobadilla), Rex's girlfriend, asks if she and Rex can bungee jump. As they are walking to the ride, Michael bumps into someone who claims {{that it was his}} fault. At the ride, Michael goes first, but the person in charge of the ride seems concerned about something; Michael passes out and wakes up in the [...] "red reality" [...] (where Hannah is alive, but Rex is dead), as if the [...] "green reality" [...] were a dream. In the [...] "red reality", Dr. <b>Lee</b> <b>says</b> it is progress, that Michael is trying to tell himself that his son is dead and that he {{is on the verge of}} a breakthrough. Shortly after getting into his car, Michael suddenly sees the man who he bumped into at the amusement park. Michael sees the mystery man several more times throughout the episode and it becomes more clear the man is only a hallucination.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{with the}} success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a {{character}} with whom teens could identify. In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider (see also The Spider's Web and The Spider Returns) as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of {{whether or not this is}} true. Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with [...] "boy", <b>Lee</b> <b>says</b> he chose [...] "Spider-Man" [...] because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name [...] "Spider-Boy" [...] would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes. At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections. Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue, #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962). In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be cancelled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man. While this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that [...] "The Spiderman ... will appear every month in Amazing." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jacqui Cheng of Ars Technica {{wrote that}} Apple's claims of what Siri could do were [...] "bold", {{and the early}} demos [...] "even bolder". Cheng wrote that [...] "Though Siri shows real potential, these kinds of high {{expectations}} {{are bound to be}} disappointed", adding that [...] "Apple makes clear that the product is still in beta—an appropriate label, in our opinion". While praising its ability to [...] "decipher our casual language" [...] and deliver [...] "very specific and accurate result", sometimes even providing additional information, Cheng noted and criticized its restrictions, particularly when the language moved away from [...] "stiffer commands" [...] into more human interactions. One example included the phrase [...] "Send a text to Jason, Clint, Sam, and <b>Lee</b> <b>saying</b> we're having dinner at Silver Cloud", which Siri interpreted as sending a message to Jason only, containing the text [...] "Clint Sam and <b>Lee</b> <b>saying</b> we're having dinner at Silver Cloud". She also noted a lack of proper editability, as saying [...] "Edit message to say: we're at Silver Cloud and you should come find us", generated [...] "Clint Sam and <b>Lee</b> <b>saying</b> we're having dinner at Silver Cloud to say we're at Silver Cloud and you should come find us".|$|R

Modern historian Joseph <b>Lee</b> <b>says</b> [...] "at least 800,000", and R. F. Foster estimates that [...] "at least 775,000 died, mostly through disease, including cholera in the latter stages of the holocaust". He further notes that [...] "a recent sophisticated computation estimates excess deaths from 1846 to 1851 as between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000... after a careful critique of this, other statisticians arrive at a figure of 1,000,000." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of Lee's {{earliest}} {{contributions to}} animation based on Marvel properties was narrating the 1980s Incredible Hulk animated series, always beginning his narration with a self-introduction {{and ending with}} [...] "This is Stan <b>Lee</b> <b>saying,</b> Excelsior!" [...] <b>Lee</b> had previously narrated the [...] "Seven Little Superheroes" [...] episode of Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, which the Hulk series was paired with for broadcast.|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, Los Alamos National Laboratory {{scientist}} Wen Ho Lee {{was fired}} from his job, arrested, and held without trial for 278 days while his handling of sensitive nuclear information was investigated. Freeh accused him of downloading a [...] "portable, personal trove" [...] of US nuclear secrets. But ultimately Lee pleaded guilty to {{just one of the}} fifty-nine counts brought against him, after which he was freed from jail. At Lee's sentencing hearing, District Judge James A. Parker scolded the US government for its treatment of <b>Lee,</b> <b>saying</b> that the top decision makers in the case [...] "have embarrassed this entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of it" [...] and that they had been [...] "led astray" [...] by US government officials. Parker apologized to <b>Lee,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Dr. <b>Lee,</b> you were terribly wronged by being held in pretrial custody in demeaning and unnecessarily punitive conditions. I am truly sorry." ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Lee</b> <b>says</b> that {{although}} the underlying philosophy has remained the same, he continues to [...] "refine and improve" [...] the methods. He recounts in one newspaper report that the techniques have evolved from breathing methods to meditation to its current emphasis on the brain. An early English-language book by Lee, Dahn Meditation, {{which was published in}} 1997, focuses primarily on Ki development through Lee's [...] "practical and modern" [...] version of traditional Korean Dahn Hak techniques and does not mention any exercises specific to brain development. The book describes stretching exercises ("do-in"), meditation for energy sensitivity ("ji gam"), energy dance ("dahn mu"), and energy building exercises ("haeng gong").|$|E

Don't use violence, we need help." [...] One of the activists shows the camera a waterproofed booklet allegedly taken from the Israeli commandos listing the names, with photos, of several key people among the passengers. <b>Lee</b> <b>says</b> the video was smuggled off the ship in her underwear due to the Israeli confiscation of all photographic and film material.|$|E

During that year, {{ten years after}} the annexation, Lee said that [...] "nger and resentment that colored the early days of annexation" [...] never {{dissipated}} and that most Kingwood residents [...] "have settled in as Houstonians, but who still opposed annexation." [...] Lee said that while residents sometimes complain about high rates for sewer and water services and obvious inadequacies in the fire and EMS services, those residents believe that Kingwood [...] "has greatly suffered from being a part of the city." [...] <b>Lee</b> <b>says</b> that most residents [...] "will never come to terms with Houston's hostile takeover." [...] Lee said that [...] "Services have deteriorated, and the community has lost its identity as a suburban haven as most people had feared" [...] and [...] "Many residents believe the community has not maintained its identity as the Livable Forest" ...|$|E
