2500|$|The {{tour manager}} was Freddie Brown, the rugged ex-Northamptonshire and England captain. He {{had led the}} 1950-51 touring side, which had been {{dismissed}} as the weakest ever sent to Australia, and his refusal to accept defeat {{in the face of}} great odds had won him admiration from the Australian public. He had played his last Test in 1953 when England regained The Ashes after 19 years, when he was the only man in the team to have toured with Douglas Jardine in 1932-33 when England had last beaten Australia. Brown had a more robust and combative style than May and wanted to complain officially about what the English party perceived as the throwing actions of the Australian bowlers, which might have resulted in a Bodyline type crisis. May refused, and Brown's unofficial complaints were rebuffed by Sir Donald Bradman. Fred Trueman thought [...] "he was a snob, bad-mannered, ignorant and a bigot" [...] Brown did not like Trueman either and threatened to send the Yorkshire fast bowler home, but May smoothed things over. The assistant-manager was Desmond Eagar, the captain of Hampshire in 1946-57, who built up the attacking team that would win the County Championship in 1961 and was a noted cricket historian. Like Brown, George Duckworth had toured with Jardine, and was now the scorer, baggage-master and general factotum. The physiotherapist or masseur was Desmond Montague, an experienced professional who would have a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> on the tour.|$|E
