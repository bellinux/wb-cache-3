Significantly, the number of fossil wood specimens in western Liaoning is very high, {{and most of them are}} silicified. Anatomically, the majority of fossil wood specimens from western Liaoning contain well-preserved secondary xylem, and four genera, including Lioxylon Zhang, Wang, Saiki, Li et Zheng, Sahnioxylon Bose et Sah, Sciadopitys-like wood and Sinocycadoxylon Zhang, Yang, Fu, Zheng et Wang, were reported with distinct piths.

40|$|Scalesia (Compositae), a genus {{endemic to}} the Galapagos Islands, {{consists}} of 12 shrubby species {{distributed in the}} lowland dry zone and three tree species found in the mid-elevation moist zone. They are completely allopatric in distribution. All the species have herbaceous traits: fast growth, soft wood, <b>large</b> <b>pith</b> {{at the center of}} trunk, and flowering within 1 yr after germination (in greenhouse). The tree species Scalesia pedunculata Hook. f. is shade-intolerant and heliophilous, and predominates as a monoculture in the moist zone of the four larger high-elevation islands. In ecological succession, it functions as pioneer, successor, and climax canopy plant. Even at climax or maturity of this monodominant forest, the canopy is not accompanied by young generations beneath owing to its shade-intolerance. The canopy population of postmature forest dies back nearly synchronously. A new generation then develops to build new forest. The progression from germination to maturity, and further to senescence and die back, is a self-cyclic succession, without change of dominant species. Over much of its range, S. pedunculata is endangered by the effects of past agricultural exploitation or heavy browsing by free-ranging goats, pigs, and donkeys; however, the population {{on the north side of}} Isla Santa Cruz has been preserved in good condition in the Galapagos National Park...|$|R
50|$|Calamopityaceae is {{the largest}} family in Pteriodspermatophyta. This family is {{composed}} of gymnosperms, and because of their stem structure discovered through fossil rocks, they {{are considered to be}} in this division. However, nothing is known of their reproductive organs, but they are classified as seed plants based on their similarities to the Lyginopteridaceae and Medullasaceae families within Pteriodspermatophyta. Calamopityaceae resemble Lyginopteridaceae and Medullasaceae in the monoxylic wood structures in their stem; this structure suggests the stem (diameter less than 1.5 cm) was narrow during the Calamopityaceae plant lifetime. Only some petiole tissue has been found; it is classified to be of the Kalymma genus and suggests the plant had large fronds. To identify a genus within this family, this petiole structure and monoxylic wood must be present, as well as a much larger cortex than vascular cylinder. No fossil evidence has been found to describe on their seed and pollen (reproductive) organs, and therefore the species within this family show more variance than other families.Gymnosperms, including those that are extinct, can be classified by their wood: monoxylic vs pycnoxylic. Monoxylic wood is soft and spongy and has a <b>large</b> <b>pith</b> and cortex. Pycnoxylic wood, which is more dense with less pith and cortex, is more commercially used. The three genera of Calamopityaceae, Calamopitys, Stenomyelon, and Diichnia, show monoxylic wood stem patterns, and this is considered to be an essential classification of the family Calamopityaceae (hence why Bilignea, Eristophyton, Endoxylon, and Shenoxylon were removed from this family).|$|R

Saraswathy et al.

60|$|I went on Sunday, by invitation, {{to see a}} {{collection}} of shells and fish made by a gentleman of Amboyna. The fishes are perhaps unrivalled for variety and beauty by those of any one spot on the earth. The celebrated Dutch ichthyologist, Dr. Blecker, has given a catalogue of seven hundred and eighty species found at Amboyna, a number almost equal to those of all the seas and rivers of Europe. A large proportion of them are of the most brilliant colours, being marked with bands and spots of the purest yellows, reds, and blues; while their forms present all that strange and endless variety so characteristic of {{the inhabitants of the}} ocean. The shells are also very numerous, and comprise a number of the finest species in the world. The Mactras and Ostreas in particular struck me by the variety and beauty of their colours. Shells have long been an object of traffic in Amboyna; many of the natives get their living by collecting and cleaning them, and almost every visitor takes away a small collection. The result {{is that many of the}} commoner-sorts have lost all value in the eyes of the amateur, numbers of the handsome but very common cones, cowries, and olives sold in the streets of London for a penny each, being natives of the distant isle of Amboyna, where they cannot be bought so cheaply. The fishes in the collection were all well preserved in clear spirit in hundreds of glass jars, and the shells were arranged in <b>large</b> shallow <b>pith</b> boxes lined with paper, every specimen being fastened down with thread.

30|$|This study {{examined}} wood properties of plantation-grown trees and among-family variations of wood properties in 10 open-pollinated families of P. jezoensis grown at a progeny test site in Hokkaido, Japan. Wood property values, including DMOElog, MOE, and MOR {{were in the}} range of those reported in P. jezoensis from natural forests or other Picea species. Higher F values in wood properties than those in growth traits indicate that the genetic contribution to wood properties may be greater than those to growth traits. In addition, significant differences among families were found from the 1 st– 25 th annual ring from the pith in AD, MOE, and MOR, although as annual ring numbers increased F values decreased. These results suggested that genetic factors play a <b>larger</b> role from <b>pith</b> to bark for these properties. Phenotypic correlation coefficients between the 11 th– 15 th annual ring from pith and tree mean value were > 0.9. In addition, the highest F values in AD and MOE were recognized at the 11 th– 15 th annual ring from pith. These results indicated that selection at this age may be ideal for these properties. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that wood properties of P. jezoensis could be improved by tree breeding programs that emphasize on wood quality.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Objective: To {{evaluate}} the pharmacognostic characters of Madhuca indica J. F. Gmel leaf and stem an important traditional medicinal plant. Method: In the present investigation, pharmacognostic parameters like macroscopic and microscopic and powder characters of leaf and stem were studied. Preliminary phytochemical and physiochemical analyses were done by using reported methods. Fluorescent {{behavior of the}} leaf and stem powder were also tested. Results: The macroscopic study showed that the leaf was simple and ovate with sinuate margin, acuminate at apex, decurrent at base and surface glabrous and venation was pinnate. The microscopic study of leaf revealed the presence of dorsiventral type of cellular arrangement, unicellular trichomes, prismatic crystals and anomocytic stomata; while the microscopic study of stem revealed the presence of vascular bundles in zig zag form, <b>large</b> central collenchymatous <b>pith.</b> Pith cells were polygonal in shape with minor angular thickenings. Physiochemical analysis of leaf showed total ash, water soluble ash and acid insoluble ash as 4. 6, 0. 83 and 0. 5 %w/w respectively while in stem it was 5. 37, 1. 5 and 1. 0 %w/w respectively. In both parts maximum extractive value was in methanol. Phytochemical analysis revealed maximum amount of flavonoids in leaf and tannins in stem. Conclusions: Various pharmacognostical characters observed in this study will help in identification and standardization of M. indica; will also help in quality control and formulation development...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of an industrially used two-stage heat-treatment method on the mechanical properties of full construction timber. Bending tests of full-size Norway spruce posts demonstrated changes due to heat treatment, such as {{a decrease in the}} density and bending strength, as well as an increase in the modulus of elasticity (MOE). The variability in bending strength and MOE appeared to be higher for treated posts and as a result the 5 % values decreased, especially for the bending strength. The MOE was dependent on density for both treated and untreated posts, but this was not so for the bending strength. There appeared to be a relationship between the bending strength and the MOE, although it was rather weak, especially for treated posts. It was difficult to correlate the occurrence of natural defects in treated Norway spruce posts with an effect on the mechanical properties. Only a combination of several defects, such as <b>large</b> knots, enclosed <b>pith</b> and a deviating slope of grain, appeared to decrease the bending strength and MOE of treated posts, at least more than for untreated posts. The effect of a three year period of outdoor exposure on the strength properties of heat-treated terrace planking was limited.

40|$|International audienceThe {{third of}} three whole-plant cordaitaleans we reconstructed {{from a single}} Early Permian {{locality}} in northern China is Shanxioxylon taiyuanense. The name {{is based on the}} stem S. taiyuanense B. Tian & S. -J. Wang emend. S. -J. Wang & J. Hilton, which has a <b>large</b> septate <b>pith</b> and endarch cauline bundles that generate mesarch leaf traces that dichotomize at the pith margin. The comparatively small, elongate leaves with few veins and thickened margins are assigned to Cordaites taiyuanensis S. -J. Wang & B. Tian emend. S. -J. Wang and J. Hilton, which is here nomenclaturally typified after a previous invalid publication. Fertile axes are diamond shaped in transverse section, bearing in a tetrastichous arrangement numerous bracts and secondary shoots that consist of basal leaflike sterile scales and apically concentrated fertile scales. Male cones of Cordaitanthus ximinensis S. -J. Wang & B. Tian consist of 20 - 30 sterile scales and an unknown number of fertile scales that produce pollen assignable to Florinites. Female cones of Cordaitanthus xishanensis S. -J. Wang & B. Tian consist of 30 - 35 sterile scales and 5 - 10 fertile scales that bear ovules of Cardiocarpus taiyuanensis J. Hilton, S. -J. Wang,& B. Tian, the smallest species described in this ovule genus. The correlation of these constituent organ species into a whole-plant species received little assistance from organic connection, which was confined to only one equivocal physical attachment between the pollen cone C. xishanensis and the ovule Cardiocarpus taiyuanensis. The presence of sclerenchyma strands allows histological correlation between the leaf species Cordaites taiyuanensis and the sterile scales of both the pollen cone and the ovulate cone. Positive association among the constituent organ species within the deposits also offers limited support for this reconstruction, as the individual organ species, other than leaves, are insufficiently frequent to allow statistical analysis. Thus, the reconstruction of S. taiyuanense relies partly on previous successes-specifically, better-supported reconstructions of two conceptual whole-plant cordaitaleans co-occurring at the locality, Shanxioxylon sinense and Cordaixylon tianii-and partly on the characteristically poor preservation of the components of S. taiyuanense, which are assumed to have been transported into the depositional environment from a drier environment of growth. The three whole-plant cordaitaleans are compared for the rigor of their respective reconstructions, and nomenclatural consistency is achieved by describing the leaves of S. sinense as a new organ species, Cordaites sinensis R.

40|$|Strong daily {{temperature}} variations, seasonal {{soil water}} availability and high air evaporative demands play {{an essential role}} in adaptive responses of tropical high elevation mountain plants. Giant rosettes are a perfect example of successful adaptations to these conditions, representing an important life-form of high elevation tropical mountains in the Andes, Hawaii and Africa, a well-known case of convergent evolution. Adaptive radiation resulted in a substantially large number of giant rosette species in the ‘paramos’, a local name given for tropical alpine Andean vegetation. Plant functional responses: plant water relations, gas exchange characteristics and freezing resistance in giant rosettes are described in order to understand their responses to extreme environmental conditions characteristic of high elevation tropical habitats. Giant rosettes have a <b>large</b> capacitance (water-storage <b>pith)</b> and strong stomatal control to cope with periods of water deficit, resulting in the maintenance of high leaf water potentials on a daily and seasonal basis. Maximum net CO 2 assimilation rates are variable among species (3 – 10 μmol m− 2 s− 1), all showing photosynthetic decreases from wet to dry seasons. Giant rosettes rely on permanent supercooling of the leaves together with insulating structures protecting stems and apical buds to cope with freezing damage. Even though the general aspect and plant morphology of giant rosettes is similar across all high elevation tropical regions, responses to similar selective pressures resulted in different physiological characteristics in freezing resistance mechanisms, e. g. tolerance versus avoidance, and thermal balance of the rosette. Giant rosette responses under changing global environments are also discussed. The emphasis in the description of physiological and morphological characteristics will be on South American giant rosettes due to the large number of studies and the large number of species occurring in this region. 181 - 202 frada@ula. v...|$|R

We compared cell wall chemical composition and 24 - and 96 -h in vitro degradabilities in separated pith and rind tissues of lower stem internodes from six maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines. Across genotypes, rind tissues had higher total cell wall and ether-linked ferulate concentrations (69 %, and 53 % higher, respectively), were less degradable, and the increased degradation between incubation times was <b>larger</b> than in <b>pith</b> tissues. Genotypes exhibited genetic variation for glucose, xylose and hydroxinnamate ester concentrations and for most measures of cell wall degradability. However, none of genotypes had extreme values for these cell wall traits in both tissues, indicating that regulation of cell wall characteristics may be tissue-independent. Cross-linking of lignin to arabinoxylan through ferulate ethers explained a portion of cell wall degradability variation in both tissues (R 2 = 0. 55 and 0. 24 of pith and rind cell wall 24 -h degradability, respectively), and in conjunction with Klason lignin concentration appeared {{to be one of}} the major determinants of cell wall degradability. p-Coumarate ester and glucose concentrations were the overall best predictors of pith cell wall degradability, and arabinose concentration was a good indicator of rapid rind cell wall degradability, suggesting the potential usefulness of these cell wall traits in breeding programs to improve cell wall digestibility. However, the majority of rind cell wall degradability variation (R 2 = 0. 65 and 0. 73 of 24 - and 96 -h degradabilities, respectively) was not explained by the cell wall traits evaluated.

40|$|Chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is {{a forest}} species {{widespread}} in Mediterranean area and chestnut wood is considered as valuable for several uses due to good mechanical properties, natural duration and its design. But, unfortunately, the ring shake defect very often occurs in chestnut wood after trees felling, leading to qualitative degradation and causing problems to chestnut’s wood utilization. Ring shake {{is a phenomenon}} with unknown causes and of a great concern among people that deal with chestnut wood allover the Europe. This work included a research of ring shake occurrence in chestnut coppice forests and chestnut trees from orchards, {{as well as on}} chestnut logs at woodcutting areas and log storage yards in order to detect possible relations with morphological or growth characteristics with ring shake occurrence. Basic mechanical and physical properties of ring-shaken chestnut logs were determined. Afterwards, comparisons between wooden areas at different distance from ring shake, of the same log and between ring-shaken and non ring-shaken logs were made. Finally, three ringshaken and three non ring-shaken logs were transformed to lumber in order to calculate the qualitative and quantitative performance. Relationships between age, log’s diameter and ring width with ring shake were established. Ring shakes presence was frequent at logs with some stem or cross section abnormalities such as forking, double-pith, <b>large</b> knots, burls, <b>pith</b> eccentricity and elongated cross sections (ellipsoid-oval). The ring shake defect mainly occurred on logs from the older trees with large diameters (at base or breast height) coming from orchards. On logs coming from a coppice forest (origin of Halkidiki, Greece), where young chestnut trees were cut without reaching large diameter, ring shake didn’t occur on logs from trees cut after one rotation and rarely occurred on logs from trees cut after two rotations (9. 5 %). The presence of a wider ring followed by narrower rings or the width differentiation along the same ring of a cross section, consist an area that ring shake is possible to be developed. Differentiations between wooden areas from ring-shaken logs were determined for some mechanical and physical properties (areas close or at a distance from ring shakes, juvenile, mature wood. Mature wood from the ring shakes area had lower axial compression and hardness strength compared with mature wood away from ring shakes. Wood from ring shakes area had lower tangential swelling and, precisely, at the shakes position, wood had higher coefficient of anisotropy than the surrounding wood. The juvenile wood’s density from the ring-shaken logs was higher compared to mature wood, as well as proportional limit and hardness strength. From comparisons between ring-shaken and non ring-shaken logs properties, the following results came up: Mature wood from any area (independently of shake’s presence) of ring-shaken logs had lower modulus of rapture, proportional limit, modulus of elasticity under static bending, axial compression, toughness and hardness strength compared with mature wood from non ring-shaken logs. Moreover, lower radial swelling was determined for ring-shaken logs. The juvenile wood’s density from the ring-shaken logs was higher compared either to mature or to juvenile wood from non ring-shaken logs. Juvenile wood from ring-shaken logs had higher modulus of elasticity under shearing compared to juvenile wood from non ring-shaken logs. A prognostic statistical model based on logistic regression, and using age and diameter as estimators, was built giving an efficiency of success up to 80 %. This model could be useful into selecting trees for cutting process by finding the proper age/diameter for the selected trees {{in order to reduce the}} possibility of ring shake occurrence. Ring shakes rarely occur on juvenile or overmature wood. They usually occur on adult wood from logs of tree’s base and the proportion of timber affected by ring shake defect can be relatively estimated only after 20 - 30 days after trees felling. This proportion is expected to be increased during drying process. All above factors cause many difficulties to chestnut wood manufacture. From a test sawing of logs that took place in this research, significant qualitative and quantitative degradation was determined for ring-shaken logs. Specifically, lumber performance from ring shaken logs was found degraded to 28 %- 29 % compared with 55 %- 64 % from non ring-shaken logs. ...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{experimental}} study into the permeability and compressibility properties of bagasse pulp pads. Three experimental rigs were custom-built for this project. The experimental work is complemented by modelling work. Both the steady-state and dynamic behaviour of pulp pads are evaluated {{in the experimental}} and modelling components of this project. Bagasse, the fibrous residue that remains after sugar is extracted from sugarcane, is normally burnt in Australia to generate steam and electricity for the sugar factory. A study into bagasse pulp was motivated {{by the possibility of}} making highly value-added pulp products from bagasse for the financial benefit of sugarcane millers and growers. The bagasse pulp and paper industry is a multibillion dollar industry (1). Bagasse pulp could replace eucalypt pulp which is more widely used in the local production of paper products. An opportunity exists for replacing the large quantity of mainly generic paper products imported to Australia. This includes 949, 000 tonnes of generic photocopier papers (2). The use of bagasse pulp for paper manufacture is the main application area of interest for this study. Bagasse contains a large quantity of short parenchyma cells called ‘pith’. Around 30 % of the shortest fibres are removed from bagasse prior to pulping. Despite the ‘depithing’ operations in conventional bagasse pulp mills, a <b>large</b> amount of <b>pith</b> remains in the pulp. Amongst Australian paper producers there is a perception that the high quantity of short fibres in bagasse pulp leads to poor filtration behaviour at the wet-end of a paper machine. Bagasse pulp’s poor filtration behaviour reduces paper production rates and consequently revenue when compared to paper production using locally made eucalypt pulp. Pulp filtration can be characterised by two interacting factors; permeability and compressibility. Surprisingly, there has previously been very little rigorous investigation into neither bagasse pulp permeability nor compressibility. Only freeness testing of bagasse pulp has been published in the open literature. As a result, this study has focussed on a detailed investigation of the filtration properties of bagasse pulp pads. As part of this investigation, this study investigated three options for improving the permeability and compressibility properties of Australian bagasse pulp pads. Two options for further pre-treating depithed bagasse prior to pulping were considered. Firstly, bagasse was fractionated based on size. Two bagasse fractions were produced, ‘coarse’ and ‘medium’ bagasse fractions. Secondly, bagasse was collected after being processed on two types of juice extraction technology, i. e. from a sugar mill and from a sugar diffuser. Finally one method of post-treating the bagasse pulp was investigated. The effects of chemical additives, which are known to improve freeness, were also assessed for their effect on pulp pad permeability and compressibility. Pre-treated Australian bagasse pulp samples were compared with several benchmark pulp samples. A sample of commonly used kraft Eucalyptus globulus pulp was obtained. A sample of depithed Argentinean bagasse, which is used for commercial paper production, was also obtained. A sample of Australian bagasse which was depithed as per typical factory operations was also produced for benchmarking purposes. The steady-state pulp pad permeability and compressibility parameters were determined experimentally using two purpose-built experimental rigs. In reality, steady-state conditions do not exist on a paper machine. The permeability changes as the sheet compresses over time. Hence, a dynamic model was developed which uses the experimentally determined steady-state permeability and compressibility parameters as inputs. The filtration model was developed with a view to designing pulp processing equipment that is suitable specifically for bagasse pulp. The predicted results of the dynamic model were compared to experimental data. The effectiveness of a polymeric and microparticle chemical additives for improving the retention of short fibres and increasing the drainage rate of a bagasse pulp slurry was determined in a third purpose-built rig; a modified Dynamic Drainage Jar (DDJ). These chemical additives were then used in the making of a pulp pad, and their effect on the steady-state and dynamic permeability and compressibility of bagasse pulp pads was determined. The most important finding from this investigation was that Australian bagasse pulp was produced with higher permeability than eucalypt pulp, despite a higher overall content of short fibres. It is thought this research outcome could enable Australian paper producers to switch from eucalypt pulp to bagasse pulp without sacrificing paper machine productivity. It is thought that two factors contributed to the high permeability of the bagasse pulp pad. Firstly, thicker cell walls of the bagasse pulp fibres resulted in high fibre stiffness. Secondly, the bagasse pulp had a large proportion of fibres longer than 1. 3 mm. These attributes helped to reinforce the pulp pad matrix. The steady-state permeability and compressibility parameters for the eucalypt pulp were consistent with those found by previous workers. It was also found that Australian pulp derived from the ‘coarse’ bagasse fraction had higher steady-state permeability than the ‘medium’ fraction. However, {{there was no difference between}} bagasse pulp originating from a diffuser or a mill. The bagasse pre-treatment options investigated in this study were not found to affect the steady-state compressibility parameters of a pulp pad. The dynamic filtration model was found to give predictions that were in good agreement with experimental data for pads made from samples of pretreated bagasse pulp, provided at least some pith was removed prior to pulping. Applying vacuum to a pulp slurry in the modified DDJ dramatically reduced the drainage time. At any level of vacuum, bagasse pulp benefitted from chemical additives as quantified by reduced drainage time and increased retention of short fibres. Using the modified DDJ, it was observed that under specific conditions, a benchmark depithed bagasse pulp drained more rapidly than the ‘coarse’ bagasse pulp. In steady-state permeability and compressibility experiments, the addition of chemical additives improved the pad permeability and compressibility of a benchmark bagasse pulp with a high quantity of short fibres. Importantly, this effect was not observed for the ‘coarse’ bagasse pulp. However, dynamic filtration experiments showed that there was also a small observable improvement in filtration for the ‘medium’ bagasse pulp. The mechanism of bagasse pulp pad consolidation appears to be by fibre realignment. Chemical additives assist to lubricate the consolidation process. This study was complemented by pulp physical and chemical property testing and a microscopy study. In addition to its high pulp pad permeability, ‘coarse’ bagasse pulp often (but not always) had superior physical properties than a benchmark depithed bagasse pulp...|$|R
