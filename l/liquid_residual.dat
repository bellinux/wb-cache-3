The present work has as objective to analyze, with a social focus, the {{administration of the}} residual liquids of the State Refinery of Emeralds, Ecuador. The analysis demonstrated that the main social contradictions identified in the administration of the liquid residuals are: between the condition of public company of the refinery and their irrational behavior with regard to the conservation of the environment; between the knowledge and execution of the environmental legislation; among the importance of the company for the Ecuadorian economy and their inefficient economic acting.

However, during fish deterioration, some compound is released or formed due to microbial and biochemical process. Identification of released compound during fish spoilage is a crucial step in understanding the degree of spoilage. This study characterizes the physicochemical changes of metabolites biofluids from <b>liquid</b> <b>residual</b> of tuna fish (Euthynnus affinis) during refrigerated storage condition. Tuna fish were kept in ice at 0 °C and stored in cold room (~ 4 °C) for seven days in order to study the changes in fish freshness and loss of quality through the storage period. <b>Liquid</b> <b>residual</b> of fish was collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days of storage. LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out to determine the possible dominant compound which was later identified as creatine and phenylalanine. Quantification of creatine and phenylalanine using HPLC with UV detector found that creatine and phenylalanine increased significantly up to day 4 and day 5 upon storage time for creatine and phenylalanine, respectively (p< 0. 05).

The depolymerisation reactions were carried out in ethylene glycol and ethylene glycol/water mixtures at near-critical conditions of the two solvents. With ethylene glycol alone the highest resin removal of 92. 1 % was achieved at 400 °C. The addition of water to ethylene glycol led to higher resin removals compared to ethylene glycol alone.

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{process is}} reported for preparing a state-of-the-art Fe-ferrierite catalyst for N 2 O decomposition under industrial tail-gas conditions. In the synthesis procedure we evaluate the very demanding constraints for scale-up; i. e. large reactor volumes are typically needed, long processing times and considerable amounts of waste water is generated. The proposed synthesis minimizes {{the amount of}} water used, and therefore the amount produced waste water is minimal; in this approach there is no <b>liquid</b> <b>residual</b> water stream that would need intensive processing. This has remarkable benefits in terms of process design, since the volume of equipment is reduced and the energy-intensive filtration is eliminated. This route exemplifies the concept of process intensification, with the ambition to re-engineer an existing process to make the industrial catalyst manufacture more sustainable. The so-obtained catalyst is active, selective and very stable under tail gas conditions containing H 2 O, NO and O 2, together with N 2 O; keeping a high conversion during 70 h time on stream at 700 K, with a decay of 0. 01 %/h, while the standard reference catalyst decays at 0. 06 %/h; hence it deactivates six times slower, with ~ 5 % absolute points of higher conversion.

The {{theory and}} use of double-piston cells and {{conventional}} dilatometry for the determina-tion of the melting and liquid thermal expansion characteristics of metals and alloys have been evaluated and are reviewed in detail. The technique has been successfully applied to aluminium alloys with a boron nitride cell, and to cast iron and nickel alloys with an alumina cell. The technique has permitted the density {{as a function of}} temperature to be determined through the so-called `mushy ' zone and into the liquid state. Partial success has been obtained with a machi-nable glass-ceramic cell. For successful operation of the technique a number of criteria have to be satisfied, and these are described. On heating, the melting behaviour is followed only over the temperature range above that at which the dendritic network has no strength. On cooling from a fully molten condition, once the temperature has dropped below this dendrite collapse point, the force typically applied to the cell to avoid leakage is then insufficient to continue to deform the developing crystalline network.

This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of an alternative cost-effective technique, Shandon PapSpin (PS) LBC in diagnosis of oral and oropharyngeal dysplasia and malignancy. Materials and Methods. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of Shandon PS LBC with that of scalpel biopsy in 69 patients. Transepithelial cytology specimens were obtained using a cervical Cytobrush. The cytology specimens were graded and scored using a novel oral cytologic grading and scoring system respectively. Results: Histological diagnosis of dysplasia or invasive squamous cell carcinoma was made in 51 of the 69 cases. Histology confirmed the cytological diagnosis of dysplasia or malignancy in 49 of the 51 cases. There were two false negative and no false positive cases. The sensitivity was 96 % and the specificity 100 %. The cytologic grade correlated positively with histologic grade. The best cut off value for distinguishing reactive/mildly dysplastic lesions from high 9 grade/invasive squamous cell carcinoma was determined as a cytologic score of 3, representing a sensitivity of 95 % and a specificity of 96 %. Conclusion: The Shandon PS LBC in association with transepithelial brush biopsy technique (TBBT) is a highly sensitive, specific and economical screening test in detection of oral and oropharyngeal dysplasia and malignancy. The proposed oral cytologic grading system correlates well with histology. The novel oral cytologic scoring system shows promise as a simple, reliable and reproducible scoring system.

Some of the monosaccharides are valuable compounds used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. They can be separated from biomass hydrolysates e. g. by chromatographic methods. In this thesis, chromatographic separation of valuable compounds using ion exchange resins was studied on an industrial scale. Of special interest were rare monosaccharides in biomass hydrolysates. A novel chromatographic separation process was developed for fucose, starting from pre-processed spent sulfite liquor. The core of the process consists of three chromatographic separations with different types of ion exchange resins. Chromatographic separation of galactose was tested with three biomass hydrolysates; lactose, gum arabic and hemicellulose hydrolysates. It was demonstrated that also galactose can be separated from complex carbohydrate mixtures. A recovery process for arabinose from citrus pectin <b>liquid</b> <b>residual</b> and for mannose from wood pulp hydrolysate were also developed and experimentally verified. In addition to monosaccharides, chromatographic separation of glycinebetaine from vinasse was examined with a hydrogen form weak acid cation exchange resin. The separation involves untypical peak formation depending, for example, on the pH and the cation composition. The retention mechanism was found to be hydrogen bonding between glycinebetaine and the resin. In the experimental part, all four resin types - strong acid cation, strong base anion, weak acid cation and weak base anion exchange resins - were used. In addition, adsorption equilibria data of seven monosaccharides and sucrose were measured with the resins in sodium and sulfate forms because such data have been lacking.

40|$|Abstract: The Peloso {{complex is}} a 1000 m thick gabbroic body {{composed}} of two main layered zones (ZA and ZB) that {{are made up of}} cyclic macrolayers of olivine gabbro, leucogabbronorite and anorthosite cumulates, and a third zone of unlayered quartz-gabbro (ZC) which may represent a <b>residual</b> <b>liquid.</b> Within a representative macrolayer, cryptic evolution of minerals can not be neglegted, showing that the crystallizing magma batch had a limited volume and was renewed between the formation of two successive macrolayers. The comparison between calculated parental magma density and densities of successive cumulates shows that the <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> was probably extracted by compositional convection at the crystallization front, or by intercumulus compositional convection within the cumulate pile. The calculated convective velocity {{at the bottom of the}} layer decreased from 30 cm/year to 10 cm/year when the leucogabbronorite crystalized. The minimum value also gives the order for the crystallization velocity of a macrolayer and a time scale for the reservoir activity. The <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> corresponding to the anorthositic top of a macrolayer is denser than the parent liquid. A strongly unstable density gradient therefore existed with the underlying gabbronoritic <b>residual</b> <b>liquid,</b> and the liquid extraction was prior controlled by the intercumulus convection. Liquids moving through the cumulate, may have induced adcumulus growth of plagioclase and resorption of mafic phases, leading to anorthosite formation at the top of the macrolayer.

40|$|International audienceThe {{electrical}} conductivity of a magma {{in the course}} of crystallization was experimentally investigated in the temperature range of 1350 – 1018 °C. Large samples of basaltic composition with a homogeneous crystal content were synthesized in a gas mixing furnace at 1 atm pressure. The samples were analyzed by electron microprobe. The relative proportions of the phases as a function of temperature were determined. Depending on temperature, the phase assemblies included quenched silicate liquid, ±plagioclase, ±pyroxene, ±Fe-Ti oxides. The crystal content varied from 0 to 80 wt %. In response to partial crystallization, the <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> changed composition from basalt, to andesite, to dacite liquid. The {{electrical conductivity}} of the partially crystallized basaltic samples was measured. In addition, above liquidus conductivity measurements were conducted on compositions matching the <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> at different temperature. These supplemental electrical measurements allowed us to discriminate the effect of crystal content from the effect of changing liquid composition associated with partial crystallization. Combining with the modified Archie's law a set of constraints describing the conductivity of the <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> versus chemical composition and temperature, we propose an equation to calculate changes in conductivity associated with partial magma crystallization. We showed how the composition of the <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> is critical on the electrical behavior of crystal-liquid system. The model overcomes the previous difficulties in finding a robust model for describing the electrical behavior of crystal-liquid systems. The effect of liquid composition on the electrical conductivity is related to diffusion mechanisms and transport properties in molten silicate.

A model for bulk fluid displacement in 200 m channels was developed and validated using data from an air-water flow visualization study performed on glass microchannel test sections with a hydraulic diameter of 203 m. High-speed video recording was used to observe displacement samples at two separate channel locations for both the displacement of gas by liquid and liquid by gas, and for driving pressure gradients ranging from 19 to 450 kPa m- 1. Interface velocities, void fractions, and film thicknesses were determined using image analysis software {{for each of the}} 63 sample videos obtained.

These models were used to evaluate the impact of <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> films on system mass transfer during the adsorption process. It was determined that for a TSA methane purification system to be effective, it is necessary to purge liquid from the adsorbent channel. This intermediate purge phase will benefit the mass transfer performance of the adsorption system by removing significant amounts of <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> from the channel and by causing the onset of rivulet flow in the channel. The existence of the remaining dry wall area, which is characteristic of the rivulet flow regime, improves system mass transfer performance in the presence of <b>residual</b> <b>liquid.</b> The commercial viability of microchannel TSA gas separation systems depends strongly on the ability to mitigate the presence and effects of <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> in the adsorbent channels. While the use of liquid heat transfer fluids in the microchannel structure provides rapid heating and cooling of the adsorbent mass, the management of <b>residual</b> <b>liquid</b> remains a significant hurdle. In addition, such systems will require reliable prevention of interaction between the adsorbent and the liquid heat transfer fluid, whether through the development and fabrication of highly selective polymer matrix materials or the use of non-interacting large-molecule liquid heat transfer fluids. If these hurdles can be successfully addressed, microchannel TSA systems may have the potential to become a competitive technology in large-scale gas separation.
