40|$|A {{theoretical}} study {{indicating that}} vortex rings at moderate Reynolds numbers are unstable to azimuthal bending waves is presented. Only {{the case of}} a thin vortex ring with a core of constant vorticity in an inviscid flow is examined. The disturbance flow and the mean flow of the vortex ring are derived as asymptotic solutions near the core; the stability analysis is developed completely for a certain class of bending waves that are unstable on a <b>line</b> <b>filament</b> in the presence of strain. The vortex ring is found to be always unstable for at least two wavenumbers for which waves on a <b>line</b> <b>filament</b> of the same vorticity distribution would not rotate.

40|$|We report VIMOS {{integral}} field spectroscopy of the N 159 F nebula surrounding LMC X- 1. Our observations {{reveal a}} rich, extended system of emission <b>line</b> <b>filaments</b> <b>lining</b> {{the boundary of}} a large conical cavity identified in Spitzer mid-IR imaging. We find that X-ray photoionization cannot be solely responsible for the observed ionization structure of N 159 F. We propose that the extended filamentary emission is produced primarily by ionization from a shock driven by a presently unobserved jet from LMC X- 1. We infer a shock velocity of v_s ~ 90 km/s and conclude that the jet responsible for the bow shock is presently undetected because it has switched off, rather than {{because it has a}} low surface brightness. This interpretation is consistent with the present soft X-ray spectral state of LMC X- 1 and suggests the jet is intermittent. Comment: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

40|$|We {{present results}} {{based on the}} {{systematic}} analysis of currently available Chandra archive data on the brightest galaxy in the Draco constellation NGC 6338, in order to investigate {{the properties of the}} X-ray cavities. In the central 6 kpc, at least a two and possibly three, X-ray cavities are evident. All these cavities are roughly of ellipsoidal shapes and show a decrement in the surface brightness of several tens of percent. In addition to these cavities, a set of X-ray bright filaments are also noticed which are spatially coincident with the Hα filaments over an extent of 15 kpc. The Hα emission <b>line</b> <b>filaments</b> are perpendicular to the X- ray cavities. Spectroscopic analysis of the hot gas in the filaments and cavities reveal that the X-ray filaments are cooler than the gas contained in the cavities. The emission line ratios and the extended, asymmetric nature of the Hα emission <b>line</b> <b>filaments</b> seen in this system require a harder ionizing source than that produced by star formation and/or young, massive stars. Radio emission maps derived from the analysis of 1. 4 GHz VLA FIRST survey data failed to show any association of these X-ray cavities with radio jets, however, the cavities are filled by radio emission. The total power of the cavities is 17 × 1042 erg s- 1 and the ratio of the radio luminosity to cavity power is 10 - 4, implying that most of the jet power is mechanical.

40|$|The Hasimoto planar vortex {{filament}} {{is one of}} {{the rare}} exact solutions to the classical local induction approximation (LIA). This solution persists in the absence of friction or other disturbances, and it maintains its form over time. As such, the dynamics of such a filament have not been extended to more complicated physical situations. We consider the planar vortex filament under the quantum LIA, which accounts for mutual friction and the velocity of a normal fluid impinging on the filament. We show that, for most interesting situations, a filament which is planar in the absence of mutual friction at zero temperature will gradually deform owing to friction effects and the normal fluid flow corresponding to warmer temperatures. The influence of friction is to induce torsion, so the filaments bend as they rotate. Furthermore, the flow of a normal fluid along the vortex filament length will result in a growth in space of the initial planar perturbations of a <b>line</b> <b>filament.</b> For warmer temperatures, these effects increase in magnitude, since the growth in space scales with the mutual friction coefficient. A number of nice qualitative results are analytical in nature, and these results are verified numerically for physically interesting cases...|$|E
40|$|We derive the pre-shock {{density and}} scale length {{along the line}} of sight for the collisionless shock from a deep HST image that {{resolves}} the H alpha filament in SN 1006 and updated model calculations. The very deep ACS high-resolution image of the Balmer <b>line</b> <b>filament</b> in the northwest (NW) quadrant shows that 0. 25 < n_ 0 < le$ 0. 4 cm- 3 and that the scale {{along the line of}} sight is about 2 x 10 ^{ 18 } cm, while bright features within the filament correspond to ripples with radii of curvature less than 1 / 10 that size. The derived densities are within the broad range of earlier density estimates, and they agree well with the ionization time scale derived from the Chandra X-ray spectrum of a region just behind the optical filament. This provides a test for widely used models of the X-ray emission from SNR shocks. The scale and amplitude of the ripples are consistent with expectations for a shock propagating though interstellar gas with ~ 20 % density fluctuations on parsec scales as expected from studies of interstellar turbulence. One bulge in the filament corresponds to a knot of ejecta overtaking the blast wave, however. The interaction results from the rapid deceleration of the blast wave as it encounters an interstellar cloud. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Ap...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} model was developed which predicts the dynamic response {{of a single}} mooring line and a buoy of forty feet diameter to sinusoidal waves, wind and current in all deep waters. All forces and reactions {{were considered to be}} in one plane. The basic equations for the mooring line motion were obtained by considering a small element of the line in terms of the conservation of momentum and mass and the continuity of the <b>line</b> <b>filament.</b> The resulting partial differential equations were numerically integrated by first a transformation followed by application of the method of characteristics. A non-linear stress-strain diagram was used. The boundary conditions were that no motion occurred at the anchor except rotations and the motion of {{the upper end of the}} line was the same as the motion of the attachment point of the buoy. The buoy was considered to be a rigid body and accelerations were determined from Newton's second law of motion. Recurrence formulas determined displacements and velocities. A comparison with some prototype information was made. Transfer functions between wave spectra and line tension spectra were available for a mooring in 13, 000 feet of water near Bermuda.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Previous explant {{retrieval}} {{studies have}} shown ruptures occurring on the remeshing line and the guide line of two types of warp-knitted grafts. The aim of our study was to characterize the mechanisms these ruptures. Materials and methods: We performed an in vitro study of the mechanical and chemical characteristics of virgin prostheses. We studied 2 virgin polyester warp-knitted grafts models: the Cooley Double Velour and the Microvel Double Velour constructed by Meadox (USA), using the following techniques: characterization and de-knitting of the textile structure, circumferential tensile strength, filament dynamometry, critical dissolution time of the filaments and scanning electron microscopy. Results: Both prostheses were constructed {{in the same way}} but the texturized yarns of the Cooley graft included twice as many filaments (54) than the Microvel (27). There was more adsorbed tension in the Cooley structure than in the Microvel. The circumferential tensile strength test demonstrated that the Cooley graft always ruptured on the remeshing line and the Microvel graft always ruptured at the interface between the remeshing line and the standard <b>line.</b> <b>Filament</b> dynamometry demonstrated a heterogeneous behavior of the filaments inside the yarns, mainly at the remeshing line of the Cooley graft (27. 1 cN/tex± 11. 5 % versus 26. 1 cN/tex± 2. 2 % for the guide line and 28 cN/tex± 6. 7 % for the standard knit). Critical dissolution time of the filaments was significantly lower for the Microvel grafts (2. 5 sec versus 17. 2 sec for the Cooley). Conclusions: Rupture of knitted polyester prostheses are probably an underestimated phenomenon. They may occur at specific areas of the graft.

Realization of this potential requires development of new optical sources/switches based on key Sandia photonic device technologies: vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and photoconductive semiconductor switch (PCSS) devices. The key to increasing the switching capacity of PCSS devices to 5 kV/ 5 kA and higher is to distribute the current in multiple parallel <b>line</b> <b>filaments</b> triggered by an array of high-brightness line-shaped illuminators.

We have demonstrated multiple-line filament triggering using VCSEL arrays to approximate line generation. These arrays of uncoupled circular-aperture VCSELs have fill factors ranging from 2 % to 30 %. Using these arrays, we have developed {{a better understanding of the}} illumination requirements for stable triggering of multiple-filament PCSS devices. Photoconductive semiconductor switch (PCSS) devices offer advantages of high voltage operation (multi-kV), optical isolation, triggering with laser pulses that cannot occur accidentally in nature, low cost, high speed, small size, and radiation hardness. PCSS devices are candidates for an assortment of potential applications that require multi-kA switching of current. The key to increasing the switching capacity of PCSS devices to 5 kV/ 5 kA and higher is to distribute the current in multiple parallel <b>line</b> <b>filaments</b> triggered by an array of high-brightness line-shaped illuminators. Commercial mechanically-stacked edge-emitting lasers have been demonstrated to trigger multiple filaments, but they are difficult to scale and manufacture with the required uniformity. As a promising alternative to multiple discrete edge-emitting lasers, a single wafer of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) can be lithographically patterned to achieve the desired layout of parallel line-shaped emitters, in which adjacent lasers utilize identical semiconductor material and thereby achieve a degree of intrinsic optical uniformity. Under this LDRD project, we have fabricated arrays of uncoupled circular-aperture VCSELs to approximate a line-shaped illumination pattern, achieving optical fill factors ranging from 2 % to 30 %. We have applied these VCSEL arrays to demonstrate single and dual parallel line-filament triggering of PCSS devices. Moreover, we have developed a better understanding of the illumination requirements for stable triggering of multiple-filament PCSS devices using VCSEL arrays. We have found that reliable triggering of multiple filaments requires matching of the turn-on time of adjacent VCSEL line-shaped-arrays to within approximately 1 ns. Additionally, we discovered that reliable triggering of PCSS devices at low voltages requires more optical power than we obtained with our first generation of VCSEL arrays.

The efficiency of the printing process can be improved by optimizing motion paths of the printing nozzle. In this paper, a 3 D printing path optimizer based on Christofides algorithm is proposed. Experiment results show that the proposed optimizer can significantly reduce the length of motion paths compared to a nearest neighbor-based optimizer using in consumer 3 D printers.

40|$|We present Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) {{integral}} field spectroscopic {{observations of}} the host galaxy (PGC 043234) {{of one of the}} closest (z = 0. 0206, D similar or equal to 90 Mpc) and best-studied tidal disruption events (TDEs), ASASSN- 14 li. The MUSE integral field data reveal asymmetric and filamentary structures that extend up to greater than or similar to 10 kpc from the post-starburst host galaxy of ASASSN- 14 li. The structures are traced only through the strong nebular [O III] lambda 5007, [N II] lambda 6584, and H alpha emission lines. The total off-nuclear [O III] lambda 5007 luminosity is 4. 7 x 10 (39) erg s(- 1), and the ionized H mass is similar to 10 (4) (500 /n(e)) M-circle dot. Based on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram, the nebular emission can be driven by either AGN photoionization or shock excitation, with AGN photoionization favored given the narrow intrinsic line widths. The emission line ratios and spatial distribution strongly resemble ionization nebulae around fading AGNs such as IC 2497 (Hanny's Voorwerp) and ionization "cones" around Seyfert 2 nuclei. The morphology of the emission <b>line</b> <b>filaments</b> strongly suggest that PGC 043234 is a recent merger, which likely triggered a strong starburst and AGN activity leading to the post-starburst spectral signatures and the extended nebular emission line features we see today. We briefly discuss the implications of these observations {{in the context of the}} strongly enhanced TDE rates observed in post-starburst galaxies and their connection to enhanced theoretical TDE rates produced by supermassive black hole binaries...|$|R
