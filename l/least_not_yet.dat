5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet,</b> that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
25|$|The X-Men {{watch from}} the Blackbird for Nightcrawler to {{teleport}} at the last minute. The comet and asteroid collide, but Nightcrawler rematerializes out in space. The team attempts to retrieve him with the Blackbird's grappler arms before he burns up entering the atmosphere. They miss, and Nightcrawler disintegrates. The X-Men mourn their fallen teammate, and Kitty cries over how badly she had treated him earlier. But then coughing {{from one of the}} storage lockers reveals that Nightcrawler has just managed to teleport himself into the plane before the atmospheric compression totally burned up his suit. While the X-Men give Kitty open credit for her efforts, Wolverine insists that Kitty is {{not a member of the}} X-Men—at <b>least,</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet.</b>|$|E
25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet).</b> We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E

Johnson later wrote on his Twitter that the information about him writing a treatment for Episode IX is old, and he's not involved with the writing of that film. When asked about Episode VIII in an August 2014 interview, Johnson said [...] "it's boring to talk about, because the only thing I can really say is, I'm just happy.

40|$|Looming crisis, public {{discontent with}} privatization, and {{widening}} inequalities are factors which have historically set the electorate {{in favour of}} social democratic welfare policies. Today,however, these concerns rather appear to support new right-wing populist countermovements, even in the traditionally progressive Nordic countries. This article asks why thereis not more explicit support of progressive policies, {{despite the presence of}} socio-economicfactors which would normally favour such a policy shift, at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> just <b>yet.</b> In response to this query, the article first analyses the comparisons between the present crisis and the crisisof the 1930 s with regard to alleged political inertia. It then reinterprets the contemporarypolitical consequences of crisis by revisiting three classical social theorists who took pains atanalysing the political responses to the economic crisis of the 1930 s: Karl Popper, Gunnar Myrdal, and Karl Polanyi. On the basis of this revisitation of these three classics, the articleargues that the combined eff ects of distrust in politics and the persistence of admittedly rolled-back welfare systems mutes the progressive reform potential of the present crisis...|$|R
