5|$|The 2015 Il <b>Lombardia</b> (also {{known as}} the Giro di <b>Lombardia</b> or the Tour of Lombardy) was a one-day cycling classic that took place around Lake Como in Lombardy in {{northern}} Italy on 4 October 2015. It was the 109th edition of the Il <b>Lombardia</b> one-day cycling race and was the final cycling monument of the 2015 season, {{as well as being}} the final race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The race was organised by RCS Sport, who also organise the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, <b>Lombardia</b> was {{converted}} into a depot ship for submarines; this work lasted until 1908. By {{the outbreak of the}} Italo-Turkish War in September 1911, she was still serving in this capacity, under the command of Prince Luigi Amedeo, then the Inspector of Torpedo Boats. <b>Lombardia</b> remained in the Adriatic Sea during the war and as a result she did not see action in the conflict. She served in this capacity through World War I until 4 July 1920, when she was sold for scrap and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lombardia</b> {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} her career. She was initially assigned as a scout for the main Italian fleet before a stint abroad in South America, where an outbreak of yellow fever killed half of her crew. Another period in the main fleet followed in the late 1890s, and in 1901, the ship was deployed to the China station. In late 1903, she cruised off Italian Somaliland, and in 1906 she was converted to a depot ship for submarines. She served in this role for the remainder of her career, including during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112 and World War I in 1915-18. <b>Lombardia</b> was eventually sold for scrap in July 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Regioni class {{served in a}} variety of roles {{throughout}} their careers. Their first decade in service was marked by frequent deployments abroad, interspersed between stints in the main Italian fleet, where they served as scouts for the battleships. In 1895, Etruria and much of the main fleet visited Germany for the opening ceremonies for the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. <b>Lombardia</b> was stationed in South America in 1896, when an outbreak of yellow fever killed half of her crew while she was in Rio de Janeiro. In 1897, Umbria and Liguria were assigned to the Cruiser Squadron of the main fleet. <b>Lombardia</b> was deployed to China in 1901, where she replaced Elba, and to Italian Somaliland in 1903. There, she briefly skirmished with Somali rebels.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} their careers, including scouts for the main fleet, colonial cruisers, and representatives of Italy at major foreign events. Elba observed the Russo-Japanese War, including the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in 1904, where she picked up Russian survivors. <b>Lombardia</b> was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 1906. Elba and Liguria were equipped with observation balloons in 19071908. In 1910, Umbria was sold to Haiti and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she quickly sank under the care of her inexperienced crew. The remaining ships, except for <b>Lombardia,</b> took part in the Italo-Turkish War in 191112, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops, bombarded Ottoman ports, and instituted a blockade in the Red Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Circuito de Getxo, the Châteauroux Classic, Vattenfall Cyclassics, the GP Ouest-France, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, Paris–Tours, the Giro del Piemonte, and the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 15th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Clásica de San Sebastián, the Dutch Food Valley Classic, the Châteauroux Classic, the GP Ouest-France, the Schaal Sels-Merksem, the Grote Prijs Jef Scherens, the Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen, Omloop van het Houtland, Binche–Tournai–Binche, the Nationale Sluitingsprijs, and the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 11th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Clásica de San Sebastián, the GP Ouest-France, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, the Coppa Sabatini, the Giro dell'Emilia, the GP Bruno Beghelli, the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> the Chrono des Nations, and the Japan Cup, but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 17th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Tour du Doubs, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, Paris–Brussels, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, the Grand Prix de Wallonie, the Grand Prix d'Isbergues, Binche–Tournai–Binche, Paris–Bourges, Paris–Tours, the Giro del Piemonte, the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> and the Japan Cup, but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 11th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|Astana raced a light {{schedule}} in the fall, with {{the pinnacle of}} their season having come at the Tour de France. The team sent squads to the Clásica de San Sebastián, Vattenfall Cyclassics, the GP Ouest-France, the Giro dell'Emilia, the GP Beghelli, the Giro del Piemonte, and the Giro di <b>Lombardia.</b> Their best results from this crop of races came from Alexander Vinokourov, who finished seventh in Lombardy and fifth in the Giro dell'Emilia.|$|E
5|$|In the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> Astana's final {{race of the}} season, {{they were}} more {{successful}} {{than they had been}} most of the season, attaining a fourth podium finish in a one-day race on the year. While Damiano Cunego had broken away from the field with 15 kilometers left to race to win the event, Brajkovič won a sprint over 's Rigoberto Urán for second, and reacted as though he won the race. Chris Horner was also highly placed in the event, finishing seventh.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} had good showings from Nocentini at the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal (ninth place), Mondory at the Grand Prix de la Somme (second place), Montaguti at the Gran Premio Industria e Commercio di Prato (third place), Bouet at the Tour de Vendée (third place), and Roche at the Giro del Piemonte (fifth place). Roche also took the team's best placing at the fall monument, the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> {{but was a}} {{relatively}} distant 16th on the day.|$|E
5|$|The two best-known Italians {{taking part}} in the race were Luigi Ganna and Giovanni Gerbi. Gerbi was the more {{successful}} of the two, having won the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> the Milano–Torino, and several other one-day races. Ganna had won Milan–San Remo earlier the same year – notably the first Italian winner of the race. The peloton also featured two Tour de France winners, Louis Trousselier and Lucien Petit-Breton, as well as two future Giro d'Italia winners: Carlo Galetti and Carlo Oriani.|$|E
5|$|Vincenzo Nibali {{was also}} {{cited as a}} {{potential}} winner of the race, following a difficult season. He had struggled during the Tour de France and was subsequently {{thrown out of the}} Vuelta for holding on to a team car. He had therefore made Il <b>Lombardia</b> a significant target. Nibali had performed strongly in the other late-season Italian classics, while his team had shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano–Torino. Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: he was riding the Tour of Almaty instead.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{was present}} in Korea during the Russo-Japanese War, which took place {{primarily}} in neighboring Manchuria. She witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in February 1904 and rescued Russian survivors along with British and French cruisers. In 1905, Umbria represented Italy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. <b>Lombardia</b> was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 190608. Etruria visited the United States twice for major events, the Jamestown Exposition in 1907 and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909. Elba and Liguria were modified to operate an observation balloon to assist in spotting naval mines, which could be more easily seen from the air. In December 1910, Umbria was sold to the Haitian Navy and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she sank shortly after the transfer due to her new crew's inexperience.|$|E
5|$|Micheletto won {{the opening}} {{stage of the}} race to give Atala-Dunlop the first lead in the race. Despite two {{consecutive}} stage wins by Legnano riders, Atala-Dunlop still retained the lead going into the fourth stage. The fourth leg was held in rainy conditions that caused some rivers to overflow on the course and riders to take the wrong roads for extensive distances; {{this led to the}} cancellation of the stage and addition of a ninth leg that drew some of its route from the Giro di <b>Lombardia.</b> An Atala-Dunlop rider won the fifth stage, but the team lost the lead to Peugeot for one stage. Following the stage, Atala-Dunlop regained the lead and held that to the race's finish in Bergamo.|$|E
5|$|After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until {{crashing}} {{in central}} France; {{he returned home}} to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes {{on the right side}} of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless {{too small to be}} of real use, and she remained in service for only two years. Puglia was the only ship of the class to {{take an active role in}} the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship could open fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had been thoroughly compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister <b>Lombardia</b> in July. That month, Puglia became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. Liguria was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold Puglia in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of holding}} a bicycle race around Italy was first {{suggested}} in a telegram sent by Tullo Margagni, editor of La Gazzetta dello Sport, to the paper's owner Emilio Costamagna and cycling editor Armando Cougnet. La Gazzettas rival, Corriere della Sera {{was planning to}} hold a bicycle race of its own, flushed {{with the success of}} its automobile race. Morgagni decided to try and hold the race before Corriere della Sera could hold theirs, and following La Gazzettas success in creating the Giro di <b>Lombardia</b> and Milan–San Remo, Costamagna decided to back the idea. The inaugural Giro d'Italia bicycle race was announced on 7 August 1908 in the first page of that day's edition of La Gazzetta, to be held in May 1909. The idea of the race was influenced by the success of the French magazine L'Autos organization of the Tour de France.|$|E
5|$|The race's {{fourth stage}} saw very rainy {{conditions}} throughout, which caused the roads to turn muddy and streams nearby the roads to overflow. The thirty riders that began the stage took the wrong turn onto Sabina rode for over , {{once they had}} reached Civita Castellana, before realizing their errors. This, when combined with the weather and road conditions, caused the riders to protest to the race jury and get the stage cancelled. The riders then road a train to Rome {{for the start of}} the next stage. At the finish in Rome there were over 20,000 paying spectators waiting to see the finish of the stage. When news broke of the stage's cancelling, the spectators grew angry and the organizers refunded their tickets they had purchased to view the race. The route of the added ninth stage came from the route of the Giro di <b>Lombardia,</b> despite the initial protest of the Italian Velocopie Union. The prize money for the stage was split among the fourteen riders that noticed the mistake.|$|E
