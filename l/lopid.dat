50|$|Gemfibrozil is {{the generic}} name for an oral drug used to lower lipid levels. It {{belongs to a}} group of drugs known as fibrates. It is most {{commonly}} sold as the brand name, <b>Lopid.</b> Other brand names include Jezil and Gen-Fibro.|$|E
50|$|During postmarketing surveillance, 52 {{deaths were}} {{reported}} in patients using cerivastatin, mainly from rhabdomyolysis and its resultant renal failure. Risks were higher in patients using fibrates, mainly gemfibrozil (<b>Lopid),</b> and in patients using the highest (0.8 mg/day) dose of cerivastatin. Bayer A.G. added a contraindication for the concomitant use of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil to the package 18 months after the drug interaction was found. The frequency of deadly cases of rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin was 16 to 80 times higher than with other statins. Another 385 nonfatal cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. This put the risk of this (rare) complication at 5-10 {{times that of the}} other statins. Cerivastatin also induced myopathy in a dose-dependent manner when administered as monotherapy, but that was revealed only after Bayer was sued and unpublished company documents were opened.|$|E

[...] Its skull is {{in the shape of}} a pear and its widest portion of the skull can be found in the posterior end of its zygomatic arch. While the molars do not undergo strong crenulation, the nasal bones extend and stop where the premaxilla stops. Its dentition continues with the cingulum being quite large and very well-developed and sitting between the <b>lopids</b> of the lower molars. The backside of the skull where the paroccipital processes are located are longer in comparison to the rest of the skull.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Introduction: Hyperlipidemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and common risk factors of cardiovascular diseases especially Atherosclerosis and consequently CHD. Unalike age and gender, hyperlipidemia is a factor which can be controlled by altering the life style, nutritional habits and medical-medicinal interventions. Although serum level of cholesterol is always noticed in hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, too, in addition to causing complications such as pancreatitis, has been known as one of the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. Fibrates, after non-drug interventions, are the most used therapeutic category for treating hypertriglyceridemia. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of gemfibrozil and <b>lopid</b> on the serum level of triglyceride and total cholesterol. Method: The study was a cross-over study carried out on 53 hypertriglyceridemic patients (TG > 200 mg/dl). At first basal triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were determined in all patients. Then Patients were randomly received either <b>lopid</b> or gemfibrozil with a dose of 300 mg BD (before breakfast and dinner) for one month and after re-maesuring the total serum triglyceride and cholesterol, their drug was changed to the other and treatment continued for another one month. During the treatment period patients were observed for the adverse effects and serum levels of cholesterol and triglyceride were determined at the end of the treatment again. Data were analyzed by using repeated measure tests and through SPSS 11 software. Results: Mean basal triglycride and cholesterol levels were respectively 342. 30 ? 73. 67 mg/dl and 206. 25 ? 37. 79 mg/dl. While both drugs caused significant reduction in serum level of triglyceride (P 0. 05). There was no significant difference between the two drugs in regard to their effects on serum levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: Considering the same efficacy, gemfibrozil can be used instead of <b>lopid</b> in hyperlipedemic patients. Keywords: Gemfibrozil, <b>Lopid,</b> Hyperlipidemi...|$|E
40|$|A 53 G>A {{polymorphism}} {{identified in}} the 5 ' untranslated region (5 'UTR) of the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1) gene alters a putative shear stress responsive element (SSRE). PECAM- 1 was shown to be responsive to shear stress and transient transfection of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) with two luciferase reporter constructs driven by the PECAM- 1 promoter and 5 'UTR showed a response of the 53 G allele, not the 53 A allele, to shear stress. Association between the 53 G>A, and the previously published L 125 V polymorphism, and coronary atherosclerosis was examined in two angiographic studies. The frequencies of the rare alleles of the 53 G>A and L 125 V polymorphisms were 0. 01 and 0. 49, respectively, in the <b>Lopid</b> Coronary Angiography Trial (LOCAT) study and 0. 02 and 0. 49, respectively, in the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) study. Compared with 53 G homozygotes, carriers of the 53 A allele showed less focal progression of disease in the LOCAT study and a similar trend in the diffuse progression of disease in the REGRESS study, whereas no association between L 125 V and coronary atherosclerosis was observed in either study. These data demonstrate that the PECAM- 1 gene is responsive to shear stress in vitro and that decreased PECAM- 1 gene expression in 53 A carriers may influence reduced progression of vessel stenosis in patients with coronary artery diseas...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the lubricant magnesium stearate (MgSt) on the powder and tablet properties of chitin-Mg silicate coprecipitate was examined and compared with lubricated Avicel (R) 200 and Avicel-Mg silicate coprecipitate. Crushing strength and disintegration time studies were conducted in order to evaluate tablet properties at different compression pressures. Lubrication of chitin-Mg silicate powder with MgSt was evaluated using a high speed rotary tablet press. The compactability and disintegration time of chitin-Mg silicate are unaffected by the possible deleterious action of up to 2 % (w/w) MgSt. The deleterious effect of MgSt on Avicel (R) 200 compaction {{was found to be}} minimized when magnesium silicate was coprecipitated onto Avicel (R) 200. Lubrication of chitin-Mg silicate with MgSt does not enhance particle agglomeration, whereas the opposite is the case for Avicel (R) 200; the foregoing was ascertained by measurements of the fixed bulk density, constant powder porosity using Kawakita analysis and by the absence of variation in particle size distribution in the presence of up to 5 % (w/w) MgSt. In the case of chitin-Mg silicate tablets the ejection force was greatly reduced at a compression speed of 150, 000 tablet/h at a MgSt concentration of 0. 5 % (w/w). The physical properties and drug dissolution profile of ibuprofen tablets were found to be unaffected when chitin-Mg silicate was lubricated up to 5 % (w/w) with MgSt. Optimal drug dissolution was attained for gemfibrozil tablets using 3 % (w/w) MgSt when compared to a reference (<b>Lopid</b> tablets) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{participatory}} epidemiological (PE) {{study was}} conducted with livestock keepers in Moroto and Kotidodistricts, Karamoja Region, Uganda, between October and December 2013 to determine the management options and relative importance of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) amongst transhumant zebu cattle. Data collection involved 24 focus group discussions (each comprising 8 – 12 people) in 24 settlement areas (manyattas), key informant interviews (30), direct observation, a review of surveillance data, clinical examination, and laboratory confirmation of cases of TBDs. Methods used in group discussions includedsemi-structured interviews, simple ranking, pairwise ranking, matrix scoring, proportional piling andparticipatory mapping. The results of pairwise comparison showed the Ngakarimojong-named diseases, lokit (East Coast fever, ECF), <b>lopid</b> (anaplasmosis), loukoi (contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, CBPP), lokou (heartwater) and lokulam (babesiosis), were considered the most important cattle diseases in Moroto in that order, while ECF, anaplasmosis, trypanosomosis (ediit), CBPP and nonspecific diarrhoea (loleo) were most important in Kotido. Strong agreement between informant groups (Kendall’s coeffi-cient of concordance W = 0. 568 and 0. 682; p < 0. 001) in pairwise ranking indicated that the diseases werea common problem in selected districts. East Coast fever had the highest median score for incidence (18 %[range: 2, 33]) in Moroto, followed by anaplasmosis (17. 5 % [8, 32]) and CBPP (9 % [1, 21]). Most animalsthat suffered from ECF, anaplasmosis, heartwater and babesiosis died, as the respective median scoresfor case fatality rates (CFR) were 89. 5 % (42, 100), 82. 8 % (63, 100), 66. 7 % (20, 100) and 85. 7 % (0, 100). In Kotido, diseases with high incidence scores were ECF (21 % [6, 32]), anaplasmosis (17 % [10, 33]) andtrypanosomosis (8 % [2, 18]). The CFRs for ECF and anaplasmosis were 81. 7 % (44, 100) and 70. 7 % (48, 100),respectively. Matrix scoring revealed that disease indicators showed strong agreement (W = 0. 382 – 0. 659,p < 0. 05 –p < 0. 001) between informant groups. Inadequate knowledge, poor veterinary services and lim-ited availability of drugs were the main constraints that hindered the control of TBDs. Hand picking ofticks was done by all pastoralists while hand spraying with acaricides was irregular, often determined byavailability of drug supplies and money. It was concluded that TBDs, particularly ECF and anaplasmosiswere important diseases in this pastoral region. Results from this study may assist in the design of feasible control strategies.
