40|$|Abstract Introduction Diffuse lung infiltrates are {{a common}} finding in {{patients}} with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and causes range from infectious processes to malignancies or interstitial <b>lung</b> diseases. Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> is a rare pulmonary disorder rarely reported in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Secondary pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> is associated with conditions involving functional impairment or reduced numbers of alveolar macrophages. It {{can be caused by}} hematologic malignancies, inhalation of toxic dust, fumes or gases, infectious or pharmacologic immunosuppression, or lysinuric protein intolerance. Case presentation A 42 -year-old African American man infected with human immunodeficiency virus was admitted with chronic respiratory symptoms and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces, for which he required bilateral chest tubes. Initial laboratory investigations did not reveal any contributory conditions. Histological examination of a lung biopsy taken during video-assisted thoracoscopy showed pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> concurrent with cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. After ganciclovir treatment, our patient showed radiologic and clinical improvement. Conclusion The differential diagnosis for patients with immunosuppression and lung infiltrates requires extensive investigations. As pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> is rare, the diagnosis can be easily missed. Our case highlights the importance of invasive investigations and histology in the management of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and pulmonary disease who do not respond to empiric therapy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{pulmonary}} disease characterized by excessive alveolar accumulation of surfactant due to defective alveolar clearance by macrophages. There {{are only a few}} published case reports of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> occurring in association with solid cancers. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previously reported cases of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> associated with breast cancer. Case presentation. A 48 -year-old Asian woman, a nonsmoker, presented to our institution with a right breast mass. Biopsy examination of the lesion revealed scirrhous carcinoma. A chest computed tomography scan for metastases showed abnormal shadows in both upper lung fields. As a result of flexible fiberscopic bronchoscopy, this patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis.</b> This case was categorized as autoimmune pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> due to the positive anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor antibody. Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> decreased gradually after mastectomy.

40|$|SummaryPulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> can be {{secondary}} to inhaled dust exposure, malignancy, and chronic pulmonary infections. However, pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> {{secondary to}} extrapulmonary aspergillosis {{has never been}} reported. We report herein a case of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> secondary to invasive rhinocerebral aspergillosis. Neither immune modulators nor whole lung lavage was applied during the treatment course. The severe respiratory distress subsided, hypoxia resolved, and radiological infiltrates improved following the successful treatment of invasive rhinocerebral aspergillosis alone...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: For the {{diagnosis}} of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens it is normally necessary to make an ultrastructural examination. However, this {{is thought to be}} impractical for bronchoalveolar lavage specimens that have been routinely fixed in ethanol. In the present study, bronchoalveolar lavage cytology smears on slide glasses were examined directly ultrastructurally to make a diagnosis of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis.</b> METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage smears from three pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> patients were stained with Papanicolaou and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for identification of amorphous globular structures. Subsequently, they were refixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut and examined ultrastructurally. RESULTS: Papanicolaou stained specimens from pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> patients contained scattered amorphous or granular globules, 20 - 50 microns in diameter, which were PAS positive. Ultrastructural examination of the globules revealed multilamellated structures, characteristic of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis,</b> in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: In general, it is thought that the morphological diagnosis of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens requires both cytological and ultrastructural examination. However, the amorphous globules evident on cytology smears proved to contain multilamellated structures so that they can themselves be used as diagnostic evidence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} that requires treatment by whole-lung lavage. We report a case of severe pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> and discuss a safe and effective strategy for the anaesthetic management of patients undergoing this complex procedure. Case presentation A 34 -year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with severe pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis.</b> He developed severe respiratory failure and subsequently underwent serial whole-lung lavage. Our anaesthetic technique included the use of pre-oxygenation, complete lung separation with a left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube, one-lung ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure, appropriate ventilatory monitoring, cautious use of positional manoeuvres and single-lumen endotracheal tube exchange for short-term postoperative ventilation. Conclusion Patients with pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> may present with severe respiratory failure and require urgent whole-lung lavage. We have described a safe and effective strategy for anaesthesia for whole-lung lavage. We recommend our anaesthetic technique for patients undergoing this complex and uncommon procedure. </p...|$|R
40|$|Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lungs exhibiting {{a variety}} of nonmalignant {{disorders}} were studied by immunoperoxidase staining using antibodies specific for surfactant apoprotein, IgG, IgM, IgA, albumin, fibrinogen, and lysozyme. Normal Type II pneumocytes showed staining for surfactant apoprotein in the perinuclear region only.

The intra-alveolar material in pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> stained intensely for surfactant apoprotein, indicating that the accumulated proteinaceous material contained pulmonary surfactant.

40|$|Abstract Background Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> {{is a rare}} lung disorder, {{which was}} first {{reported}} as idiopathic condition in 1958. The prevalence of acquired pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> has been estimated to be 0. 37 per 100, 000 population. The cause of this condition is not entirely clear. We present <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> in a case recently treated for pulmonary Pneumocystis carinii infection. Case presentation A 25 -year-old Caucasian female presented with shortness of breath during management of acute pancreatitis. She had a heart-transplant six years ago, a distal pancreatectomy secondary to pancreatitis two years ago, chronic renal failure secondary to Prograft taken for six years to suppress transplant rejection, and a more recent history of Pneumocystis carinii infection treated in the preceding 21 days with augmented doses of Bactrim (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole). She had bilateral pleural effusions with radiological and clinical features suspicious for interstitial lung disease. Cytopathologic evaluation of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) showed hyaline alveolar casts admixed with amorphous debris and scant chronic inflammatory cells, consistent with <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis.</b> GMS and PAS stains were negative for P. carinii. Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) test for P. carinii performed on the BAL specimen in our Microbiology Lab had been repeatedly negative. Conclusion Cytopathological findings in bronchoalveolar lavage, with clinical differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, were diagnostic. Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> after recent treatment for P. carinii infection suggests a relationship of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> with P. carinii infection in the immunocompromised patient. </p...|$|R

40|$|To the Editor: Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> is a {{rare disease}} in which surfactant lipids and proteins accumulate in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and alveoli, resulting in respiratory insufficiency and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. 1 Granulocyte 9 ̆ 6 macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies occur in these patients 2 and may mediate the pathogenesis of this disease, {{but they are also}} present in healthy persons and in immune globulin prepared from plasma obtained from healthy persons. Since GM-CSF is required for surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages in mice, we hypothesized that high levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies (i. e., levels sufficient to eliminate endogenous GM-CSF priming of myeloid cells) could cause idiopathic pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> by impairing surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. 3 We previously found that high levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies are specifically associated with idiopathic pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> 4 and can be isolated in pure form from these patients. 5 We administered highly purified GM-CSF autoantibodies derived from a patient with idiopathic pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> to healthy nonhuman primates (Macaca fascicularis). These autoantibodies were administered intravenously, and serum levels of 40 5 g per milliliter or more were maintained for 10 months.
