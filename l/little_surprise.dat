The majority of European rapeseed oil production {{is used to}} produce biodiesel, or used directly as fuel in diesel cars which may require modification to heat the oil to reduce its higher viscosity. The suitability of the fuel should come as <b>little</b> <b>surprise,</b> as Rudolf Diesel originally designed his engine to run on peanut oil.|$|E
25|$|Oulton Park has a vast {{catchment}} area which includes Liverpool, Manchester, Chester and Crewe {{so it is}} <b>little</b> <b>surprise</b> that the second meeting and last of 1953 on 3 October, attracted a crowd of 40,000. It was a joint motorcycle and car event, the Wirral 100 Motor Club joining the Mid-Cheshire Car Club in organising it. The car side {{of the day was}} confined to three Formula III races and a final which was won by Glaswegian Ninian Sanderson from Ken Tyrrell.|$|E
25|$|Although Pat Davies is {{counted as}} Sale's first international, having been picked {{to play for}} England in 1927, it was G.A.M. Isherwood who was Sale's first {{representative}} in an international Test match, when he played in all three tests of the 1910 British tour to South Africa at scrum-half. The club has consistently provided international players and, during the 1930s, had {{one of its most}} dominant periods, fielding players of the calibre of Hal Sever (England), Claude Davey and Wilf Wooller (Wales) and Ken Fyfe (Scotland). It came as <b>little</b> <b>surprise</b> when they took out the 1936 Middlesex Sevens.|$|E

25|$|The {{next game}} {{was a rather}} quieter affair, as Heath beat Ladywood Conservatives, who had progressed through the {{qualifying}} competition to {{the first round of}} the Birmingham Cup, by seven goals to nil without unduly exerting themselves. In the Alliance, the rearranged visit to Lincoln City produced a one-all draw, Heath's goal scored by Wheldon from a left-wing cross. When Devey appeared in front of the Football Association to answer his charge of misconduct, the Council found no cause for inquiry, expressed regret for wasting his time, and paid his expenses. This would come as <b>little</b> <b>surprise</b> to the Independent, who blamed Caesar Jenkyns for starting the trouble by injuring Bob Brown early in the game.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} {{successive}} tour, white South Africa {{was forced to}} put on a brave front in acclaiming sporting triumph where there was none. A full-strength Sri Lankan team was some way off international competitiveness so it was <b>little</b> <b>surprise</b> that a makeshift rebel outfit was utterly humiliated, failing to win a single tour match. Now captained by Peter Kirsten of Western Province, South Africa comfortably won all four ‘ODIs’ and both ‘Tests’. Lawrence Seeff, who replaced the injured Barry Richards, and Graeme Pollock made 188 and 197 respectively in the second ‘Test’ but protested that the matches could not be classed as international cricket. SACU, trying to protect the ‘unofficial international’ brand it had created, fined them for the admission.|$|E
25|$|The design {{came from}} Pininfarina. The design team at Pininfarina {{consisted}} of Ian Cameron, Guido Campoli, Diego Ottina and Emanuele Nicosia. With <b>little</b> <b>surprise,</b> they {{were led by}} design chief Leonardo Fioravanti, the designer of many contemporary Ferraris. The design was originated by Nicosia, but the guidance of Fioravanti was equally important. Being a trained aerodynamist, Fioravanti applied his know-how to set the aerodynamics layout of the car. This meant the large side intakes were not only a statement of style but actually functional – they drew clean air to cool the side radiators and then went upward and left the car through the ventilation holes located at the engine lid and the tail. As a result, the Testarossa did not need a rear spoiler like Lamborghini's Countach yet produced zero lift at its rear axle. The aerodynamic drag coefficient of 0.36 was also significantly better than the Lamborghini's 0.42.|$|E

500|$|Caragiale showed <b>little</b> <b>surprise</b> at the news. In an {{interview}} with poet Alexandru Antemireanu, he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms: [...] "They did well not to sentence the kid. Is he the guilty party? No! Caion is merely a victim. Say I were a juror: why would I be setting an example by punishing this unreasonable and irresponsible kid, {{for those who are}} more mature and better placed, and who employ the same means as he did?" [...] The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.|$|E

500|$|On 2 June the French liner Jamaique {{reported}} a small boat, flying the British flag and steaming southwards, near the Bissagos Islands [...] south of Dakar. Although {{this was at}} first assumed to be Girl Pat, the next reported [...] sighting, on 9 June, was more than [...] to the west, {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic. Captain Jones of the Lorraine Cross, an American ship, cabled Lloyds' agents in Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana) with an account of a small ship flying a distress signal off the South American coast, [...] north-east of Cayenne. There were apparently four men on board. The boat's name and markings had been painted out, but she claimed to be the [...] "Margaret Harold" [...] bound for Trinidad from London. Jones thought the crew's behaviour suspicious, and when he asked to see the ship's papers, the ship lowered the distress signal and sped away. Jones said the vessel was [...] "undoubtedly a British fisherman", and thought it was Girl Pat. In Grimsby, a Marstrand spokesman expressed <b>little</b> <b>surprise</b> at this new location, and confirmed that the ship had sufficient speed to have crossed the ocean in the time since her last confirmed sighting. A check with Lloyd's indicated that there was no registered ship named Margaret Harold.|$|E

500|$|In the Song period (and {{once during}} the earlier Tang period), the {{odometer}} device was {{combined with the}} south-pointing chariot device, which was probably first invented by the ancient Chinese mechanical engineer Ma Jun (200–265). The south-pointing chariot was a wheeled vehicle that may, in some cases, have incorporated complex differential gears. (These are used now in nearly all modern automobiles to apply equal amounts of torque to wheels rotating at different speeds while turning.) The differential gears {{could have been used}} to keep a mechanically operated pointer aiming in a fixed direction, to the south, compensating for whatever turns the chariot made. Other arrangements of gears could also have been used for the same purpose. The device used mechanical dead reckoning, rather than the magnetism of a compass, in order to navigate and find one's directional bearings. Yan Su ( [...] ; c. 961–1040), the Divisional Director in the Ministry of Works, recreated a south-pointing chariot device in 1027, and his specifications for creating the device were provided in the Song Shi. This is of <b>little</b> <b>surprise,</b> as Yan was somewhat of a polymath like Shen Kuo and Su Song, improving the design of the clepsydra clock, writing on mathematical harmonics, theory about tides, etc. The Song Shi text records that it was the engineer Wu Deren who combined the south-pointing chariot and odometer in the year 1107: ...|$|E

[...] His position was renamed as Minister of Education, Training and Youth in 2001, and his responsibilities for post-secondary institutions were transferred to Diane McGifford, the Minister of Advanced Education and Training.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2017, the English Wikipedia {{community}} {{decided that}} the Daily Mail was [...] "generally unreliable" [...] {{to use as a}} reference in Wikipedia.

[...] With the recent political instability, these transgressions have increased in frequency and severity along with the illegal logging, and now threaten the existence of critically endangered lemurs and other species.

2500|$|Davis' {{handling}} of the education portfolio made him a high-profile minister, and there was <b>little</b> <b>surprise</b> {{when he entered the}} leadership contest to succeed Robarts in 1971. [...] He was quickly dubbed as the frontrunner, though his awkward speaking style and image as an [...] "establishment" [...] candidate hindered his campaign. [...] He defeated rival candidate Allan Lawrence by only 44 votes on the final ballot, after receiving support from third-place candidate Darcy McKeough. [...] Shortly after the convention, Davis invited Lawrence's campaign team to join his inner circle of advisors. [...] This group became known as the Big Blue Machine, and remained the dominant organizational force in the Progressive Conservative Party until the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Alleyne {{had played}} one Minor Counties Championship match in England in 1979, for Lincolnshire against Norfolk, and in 1980 {{he began to}} play county cricket for Worcestershire, where he {{remained}} for three seasons. He had a fine 1980, capturing 64 first-class wickets at 25.06 and 31 List A wickets at 18.12, as well as scoring {{what was to be}} his only first-class half-century [...] 72 against Lancashire in the only first-class match ever played at Stourport-on-Severn. It was thus <b>little</b> <b>surprise</b> when he was awarded his county cap in 1981, in which year he took a career-best 8-43 against Middlesex. However, in general he failed to reach the same standards as in 1980, and he left the county after the 1982 season.|$|E
