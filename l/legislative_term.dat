5|$|The state {{constitution}} has provided since 1777 {{for the election}} of a lieutenant governor, who is also ex officio president of the state senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the lieutenant governor would become acting governor {{until the end of the}} yearly <b>legislative</b> <b>term,</b> the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate performs all the duties of the lieutenant governor until the vacancy is filled either at the next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president pro tempore acts as governor, with the office of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Should the presidency pro tempore be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the speaker of the assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket as the governor, since 1954 with a single joint vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.|$|E

25|$|On 30 August, the Italian President Giorgio Napolitano {{announced}} {{he had not}} selected Berlusconi {{as one of the}} new four lifetime senators, which are granted the privileges of being a lawmaker for life with some protected legal immunity, meaning they can continue working in politics even after being convicted guilty for criminal offences that otherwise would lead to ban from serving one of the public offices.

25|$|The age {{required}} {{to have the right}} to vote had been reduced from 18 to 16 prior to the election in an electoral law reform enacted in 2007, which also had reduced the age {{required to}} stand in the election from 19 to 18, had introduced easier access to postal balloting and had lengthened the <b>legislative</b> <b>term</b> from four to five years. Another change was that different list names in the different states were no longer possible; the BZÖ had stood under a different name in Carinthia than in the rest of Austria in 2006. Turnout was initially expected to increase from the all-time low of 78.5% in 2006; more than 80% were expected to participate in the election according to early estimates, but it expectations changed to a decrease of turnout as the election day came closer. Postal balloting was expected to make up 7%–8% of the total vote; due to postal votes, the final result of the election would not be known until a week after the elections (on 6 October 2008). Postal ballots had to be sent to electoral commission together with a signed piece of paper stating the time and place when the vote had taken place; at a spot check in Salzburg, 20% of postal ballots were invalid because they lacked the signature or time and place. 9.27% of the voters (586,759 of 6,332,931 voters) had requested postal ballots, which meant that postal ballots could decisively change the election outcome.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evolution}} of the European integration process, together with the {{evolution of}} EP's role as co-legislator have produced {{an increase in the}} number of the trilogue meetings [...] During 2009-2014 <b>legislative</b> <b>term,</b> when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force and the co-decision procedure became ordinary legislative procedure - establishing the role of the EP and the Council of the EU as co-legislators - 85% of legislative acts were approved in first reading, 13% were approved in second reading while only 2% were included in the conciliation procedure.

2500|$|On 28 September 2000, a euro {{referendum}} {{was held}} in Denmark resulting in a 53.2% vote against the government's proposal to abrogate the euro opt-out. [...] Since 2007, the Danish government has discussed holding another referendum on euro adoption. [...] However, the uncertainty, {{both in terms of}} the stability of the euro and the establishment of new political structures at the EU level, resulting first from eruption of the Financial Crisis and then subsequently from the related European government-debt crisis, led the government to postpone the referendum to a date after the end of its <b>legislative</b> <b>term.</b> When a new government came to power in September 2011, they outlined in their government manifest, that a euro referendum would not be held during its four-year term, due to a continued prevalence of this uncertainty. As part of the European elections in 2014, it was argued collectively by the group of pro-European Danish parties (Venstre, Konservative, Social Democrats and Radikale Venstre), that an upcoming euro referendum would not be in sight until the [...] "development dust had settled" [...] from creation of multiple European debt crisis response initiatives (including the establishment of Banking Union, and the Commission's - still in pipeline - proposal package for creating a strengthened genuine EMU). When a new Venstre-led government came to power in June 2015, their government manifest did not include plans for holding a euro referendum within their four-year <b>legislative</b> <b>term.</b> Opinion polls, which had generally favoured euro adoption from 2002 to 2010, showed a rapid decline in support {{during the height of the}} EU debt crisis, reaching a low in May 2012 with 26% in favor towards 67% against while 7% were in doubt.|$|E
2500|$|Berlusconi, due {{to being}} over 70 years of age, {{will not be}} placed direct in prison, but can instead decide if he want to serve his one-year jail term either by a house arrest {{at one of his}} private residences or by doing {{community}} service. As the gross prison term exceeds two years, the Severino law prompts the Italian senate to vote if Berlusconi shall be forced to resign his current senate seat immediately, or alternatively allowing the court imposed ban on holding public office only to take effect {{by the end of his}} current <b>legislative</b> <b>term.</b> The pending senate vote, combined with anger over Berlusconi's conviction – a poll indicated 42% of the public believe he has been unfairly persecuted by the magistrates – present a serious political challenge for the fragile ruling coalition. On 3 August, Berlusconi suggested that unless a [...] "solution" [...] to his predicament could be found, Italy was at [...] "risk of a civil war". The following day, thousands of supporters gathered in front of his house in protest of the ruling.|$|E

25|$|Party group {{switching}} in the European Parliament is {{the phenomenon}} where parliamentarians individually or collectively switch from one party {{group to the}} other. The phenomenon of EP party group switching is a well-known contributor to the volatility of the EP party system and highlights the fluidity that characterizes the composition of European parliamentary groups. On average 9% of all MEPs switch during <b>legislative</b> <b>terms.</b> Party group switching is a phenomenon that gained force especially in the legislatures during the 1990s, up {{to a maximum of}} 18% for the 1989-1994 term, with strong prevalence among representatives from France and Italy, though by no means limited to those two countries. There is a clear tendency of party group switches from the ideological extremes, both left and right, toward the center. Most switching takes place at the outset of <b>legislative</b> <b>terms,</b> with another peak around the half-term moment, when responsibilities rotate within the EP hierarchy.|$|R
