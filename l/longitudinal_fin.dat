Obviously, for a tall building or mast, the relative wind could come from any direction. For this reason, helical projections that look like large screw threads are sometimes placed at the top, which effectively create asymmetric three-dimensional flow, thereby discouraging the alternate shedding of vortices; this is also found in some car antennas. Another countermeasure with tall buildings is using variation in the diameter with height, such as tapering - that prevents the entire building being driven at the same frequency.|$|E

40|$|Increasing power {{dissipation}} and chip densities in the rapidly evolving electronics cooling industry are causing an ever increasing {{need for the}} tools and methods necessary for electronic systems design and optimisation. Modern electronic systems {{have the capacity to}} produce significant amounts of heat which, if not removed efficiently, could lead to component failure. The most common technique of heat removal is by making use of a heat spreader, or so¬-called heat sink. These devices are excellent heat conductors with a large surface area to volume ratio, and cooled through either natural or forced convection. Despite the advantages of these devices, there are serious consequences involved in the application of heat sinks. The required size of a heat sink may limit the miniaturisation of a product, while inadequate design, {{due to a lack of}} understanding of the flow physics, may lead to premature component failure. It is therefore crucial that an optimal heat sink design is achieved for every particular application. In the past, both heat sink design and optimisation have occurred mostly through experimental characterisation of heat sinks, which was not always particularly successful or accurate. Recent rapid developments in computer technology have led to the availability of various computational fluid dynamics or CFD software packages, with the capability of solving the discretized form of the conservation equations for• mass, momentum, and energy to provide a solution of the flow and heat fields in the domain of interest. This method of using the fundamental flow physics is currently the most complete way to determine the solution to the heat sink design and optimisation problem. It does unfortunately have the drawback of being computationally expensive and excessively time consuming, with commercial software prices being financially restrictive to the average designer. The electronics cooling community has subsequently identified the need for so-called "compact models" to assist in the design of electronic enclosures. Compact models use available empirical relations to solve the flow field around a typical heat sink. Current models require significantly less computational power and time compared to CFD analysis, but have the drawback of reduced accuracy over a wide range of heat sink geometries and Reynolds numbers. This is one of the reasons that compact modelling of heat sinks remain an international research topic today. This study has focused on the CFD modelling of a variety of forced flow <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fin</b> heat sinks with tip clearance. Tip clearance allows the flow to bypass the heat sink and downgrade its thermal performance. The flow bypass phenomenon, general flow behaviour, and pressure loss characteristics were investigated in detail. Thermal modelling of the heat sinks was left for future study. The flow information provided by the CFD analysis was combined with data available from literature to develop an improved compact flow model for use in a variety of practical <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fin</b> heat sinks. The new compact model leads to a 4. 6 % improvement in accuracy compared to another leading compact model in the industry, and also provides more localised flow information than was previously available from compact modelling. <p The study therefore contributed significantly towards the general understanding and prediction of forced flow behaviour in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fin</b> heat sinks with tip bypass, using both CFD analysis and the compact modelling approach. The new improved compact model may now be extended and incorporated together with the relevant flow details from the CFD analysis in a total package, solving for the flow and heat fields of forced flow <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fin</b> heat sinks. The study therefore assists in the global effort of making the confident and accurate use of compact modelling in modem electronic systems design and optimisation a practical reality.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe cascade algorithm {{that is used}} for extended surface analysis depends on a new parameterization called the thermal transmission matrix to represent a single fin. This thermal transmission matrix, which is intended to replace the more familiar fin efficiency as a design and analysis parameterization, is a linear transformation that maps conditions of heat flow and temperature at the fin tip to heat flow and temperature conditions at the fin base. The cascade algorithm was derived by resorting to an analogy between a fin and the electrical transmission line. The cascade algorithm permits a fin to be subdivided into many subfins each having a thermal transmission matrix and then the individual transmission matrices {{for each of the}} subfins can be used, via a simple matrix product to form an overall equivalent thermal transmission matrix for the entire fin.

The overall height and width of the duct (flaw passage) were held constant at 40 mm and 228. 6 mm, respectively. The working fluid was air, and tests were conducted for Reynolds numbers ranging from 2000 to 50, 000. The equivalent diameter, defined as four times the flow area divided by the wetted perimeter, was taken as the characteristic dimension. In all, seven different fin configurations and the rectangular duct configuration with no fins were investigated. The heat transfer tests showed that the Petukhov-Popov equation is applicable for the rectangular duct configuration with no fins and that the Dittus-Boelter equation is applicable for the configurations with no clearance. The Dittus-Boelter equation is also applicable for fin configurations with clearance if the clearance-to-spacing ratio is small or the spacing-to-fin height ratio is large. Lower values of the Nusselt number were obtained for the fin configuration that did not satisfy the above conditions.

In this article, experimental investigations are conducted to identify thermal performance of latent heat storage (LHS) unit in connection with solar collector during charging cycles. LHS unit is comprised of novel geometrical configuration based shell and tubes with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins</b> heat exchanger, paraffin as thermal storage material and water as heat transfer fluid (HTF). In order to overcome the effect of low thermal conductivity of paraffin, the effective surface area and overall thermal conductivity for heat transfer is significantly improved by employing <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins.</b> Moreover, the vertical orientation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins</b> supports natural convection, which can assure rapid charging of paraffin in LHS unit. In experimental tests, {{the focus is on}} probing the heat transfer mechanism and temperature distribution in entire LHS unit, the influence of inlet temperature and volume flow rate of HTF on phase transition rate and mean power.

Moreover, the influences of operating conditions such as inlet temperature and volume flow rate of heat transfer fluid (HTF) on thermal behaviour of LHS unit are experimentally studied. The transient temperature profiles and photographic characterisation of liquid-solid transition of paraffin in LHS unit provide {{a good understanding of}} temperature distribution and dominant mode of heat transfer. It is noticed that during discharging cycles, natural convection has an insignificant impact on thermal performance of LHS unit. However, due to inclusion of extended <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins,</b> conduction is the dominant mode of heat transfer. It is noticed that due to development of solidified paraffin around tubes and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins,</b> the overall thermal resistance is increased and thus, discharging rate is affected. However, by regulating inlet temperature or volume flow rate of HTF, the influence of overall thermal resistance is minimised. Mean discharge power is enhanced by 36. 05 % as the inlet temperature is reduced from 15 oC to 5 oC. Likewise, the mean discharge power is improved by 49. 75 % as the volume flow rate is increased from 1. 5 l/min to 3 l/min.

Effects of pin geometry and tube thermal conductivity (for copper, brass and bronze giving a mean range of 400, 120 and 80 W/m K {{over the range}} of temperature of interest) were investigated. All tests were performed at near atmospheric pressure with downward flowing vapour at low velocity. Heat-transfer enhancement {{was found to be}} approximately twice the corresponding active surface area of the tubes, i. e. the surface area of the parts of the tube and pin surface not covered by condensate retained by surface tension. For ethylene glycol, the best performing pin-fin tube gave a heat-transfer enhancement of 5. 8, about 24 % higher than the ‘equivalent’ two-dimensional integral-fin tube (i. e. with the same finroot diameter, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fin</b> spacing and thickness and fin height). For R- 113, the best enhancement was 5. 9, about 10 % higher than the equivalent integral-fin tube. For both fluids tested, vapour-side, heat-transfer enhancement was found to increase with decreasing circumferential pin spacing and increasing pin height. Circumferential pin thickness had little effect on heat-transfer enhancement. Effects of tube thermal conductivity were found to be more significant for ethylene glycol than R- 113. Retention angle measurements were made under static conditions (without condensation) and were found to be larger than for equivalent integral-fin tubes. An expression for condensate retention angle on pin-fin tubes was proposed and found to agree with the measured retention angles to ± 15 %.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with factors affecting the thermal design of a compact recuperative type crossflowing heat exchanger for the primary heater of a Stirling engine. The exchanger is constructed of small diameter metal tubes ({{in the range of}} 3. 0 mm to 6. 0 mm) and close spacings are maintained between the tubes (i. e. in the range of 0. 30 mm to 1. 80 mm). These small slender tubes are usually arranged in single or double rows and are mounted around the combustion chamber. The exchanger is used to heat hydrogen or helium which act as a working fluid for the Stirling cycle. A survey of the published literature indicated that the available data does not include results for the tube Geometries of interest in this study. Consequently the heat transfers and hydraulic resistances were measured experimentally for a single row of small diameter, closelyspaced tubes situated in a crossflowing fluid stream. The Reynolds numbers (bc,. s ed on the mainstream fluid velocity and the tube diameter) ranged between 300 and 6500. Where possible the accuracy of the experimental procedure was checked by comparing the present results where possible with those obtained by previous workers. Several arrangements of both bare tubes and tubes fitted with extended surfaces were studied, The results were analysed and discussed, and where appropriate compared with those published in the open technical literature. In most comparative cases excellent agreement was experienced and any departure, could be explained. For the bare tube arrangements the influences of flow blockage ratio, mainstream turbulence intensity and surface roughness on the average heat transfer performance were investigated. A comparison of the heat transfers and pressure drops characteristics of the different tube arrangements led to proposals for an optimal exchanger geometry. The validity of the empirical corrections suggested by previous workers to account for the influence of flow blockage on average heat transfers was examinod. An alternative modified empirical expression was then proposed for the particularly high flow blockage situations (D/ 1 I> 0. 85). It was found that at those high flow blockages the overall average heat transfers were independent of the mainstream turbulence intensity. However preliminary tests suggested that an increase in the tube surface roughness increases the average tube heat transfers. Since the proposed heat exchanger operates at the higheet possible mean metal temperatures, it is likely that 'hot spots' occurring due to variations in local heat transfers can lead to premature failure. Consequently a detailed study of the local heat transfer distributions is presented for various Geometrical conditions. The influences of blockage ratio and mainstream Reynolds numbers are examined and the results are analysed, and discussed, and where possible compared with other published data. The accuracy of experimental procedure employed in these tests was checked by comparing the results for a single cylinder ease with those reported by other investigators. The influence of fitting a single <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fin</b> to the rear of tubes on both the heat transfer and pumping power was studied. The tube diameter- in these tests was kept constant, at 6. 0 mm, but the angle of inclination of this <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fin</b> was varied incrementally so that an optimal angle for maximum performance is recommended. In a similar manner, transverse finned tubes with two different fin spacings were also investigated. The heat transfers and pressure losses obtained for the different finned tube arrangements were compared {{with each other and with}} those obtained for the bare tube geometries so that an optimal tube configuration was proposed. The data presented in this thesis were generalized, where possible, so that the results should be useful for future work. They should thus contribute to an understanding of the basic phenomena associated with modern compact heat exchangers. Recommendations for further work are also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the energy absorption characteristics of plastically deformed inclined struts under impact loading. This information is needed to provide a usable method by which designers and analysts of shipping casks for radioactive or fissile materials can determine the energy absorption capabilities of external longitudinal fins on cylindrical casks under specified impact conditions. A survey of technical literature related to experimental determination of the dynamic plastic behavior of struts revealed no information directly applicable to the immediate problem, especially in the impact velocity ranges desired, and an experimental program was conducted to obtain the needed data. Mild-steel struts with rectangular cross sections were impacted by free-falling weights dropped from known heights. These struts or fin specimens were inclined at five different angles to simulate different angles of impact that fins on a shipping cask could experience under certain accident conditions. The resisting force of the deforming strut was measured and recorded as a function of time by using load cells instrumented with resistance strain gage bridges, signal conditioning equipment, an oscilloscope, and a Polaroid camera. The acceleration of the impacting weight was measured and recorded as a function of time during the latter portion of the testing program by using an accelerometer attached to the drop hammer, appropriate signal conditioning equipment, the oscilloscope, and the camera. A digital computer program was prepared to numerically integrate the force-time and acceleration-time data recorded during the tests to obtain deformation-time data. The force-displacement relationships were then integrated to obtain values of absorbed energy with respect to deformation or time. The results for various fin specimen geometries and impact angles are presented graphically, and these curves may be used to compute the energy absorption capacity of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fin</b> on a shipping cask as a function of its geometry and the percentage of deformation it is expected to experience as well as the peak force to which the fin would be subjected during the impact resulting from a 30 -foot free drop onto an essentially unyielding horizontal surface...|$|E
40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. March 28, 2013 The search for solutions to the important differential equations arising in extended surface heat transfer continues unabated. Extended surfaces, {{in the form of}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins</b> are considered. First we consider the steady state problem and then the transient heat transfer models. Here, thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficient are assumed to be functions of temperature. Thermal conductivity is considered to be given by the power law in one case and by the linear function of temperature in the other; whereas heat transfer coefficient is only given by the power law. Explicit analytical expressions for the temperature profile, fin efficiency and heat flux for steady state problems are derived using the one-dimensional Differential Transform Method (1 D DTM). The obtained results from 1 D DTM are compared with the exact solutions to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. The results reveal that the 1 D DTM can achieve suitable results in predicting the solutions of these problems. The effects of some physical parameters such as the thermo-geometric fin parameter and thermal conductivity gradient, on temperature distribution are illustrated and explained. Also, we apply the two-dimensional Differential Transform Method (2 D DTM) to models describing transient heat transfer in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins.</b> Furthermore, conservation laws for transient heat conduction equations are derived using the direct method and the multiplier method, and finally we find Lie point symmetries associated with the conserved vectors...|$|R
40|$|A finite-volume {{numerical}} model is constructed {{and applied to}} evaluate the time-dependent heat-transfer characteristics of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins</b> with a rectangular profile. To facilitate comparisons with analytical solutions, the problem is taken to be one-dimensional with constant thermal properties. Two base boundary conditions are considered: (1) a step change and (2) a periodic change in temperature. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the effects of grid size, time step, fin parameter, Fourier number, amplitude and frequency of base-temperature oscillation on the fin temperature distribution, heat-transfer rate and efficiency. The study shows an excellent agreement between the numerical and analytical results and investigates {{the importance of the}} initial transient effects. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented for fully developed laminar convective heat transfer in a pipe provided with internal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>fins,</b> and with uniform outside wall temperature. The fins {{are arranged in}} two groups of different heights. The governing equations have been solved numerically to obtain the velocity and temperature distributions. The results obtained for different pipe-fins geometries show that the fin heights affect greatly flow and heat transfer characteristics. Reducing the height of one fin group decreases the friction coefficient significantly. At the same time Nusselt number decreases inappreciably so that such reduction is justified. Thus, the use of different fin heights in internally finned pipes enables the enhancement of heat transfer at reasonably low friction coefficient. Springe...|$|R
