Since the element is light, cheap and has high efficient contact area, {{it can be used}} in a <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> to expand the application filed of the meter. At first, the flow characteristics of the flute type element are verified by computational fluid dynamics. Next, {{we developed}} a prototype <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> with the new laminar element. With the flow meter, the hydraulic diameter of the element is compensated from the steady characteristics experiments. Then, the unsteady flow characteristics of the flow meter are obtained using the unsteady flow generator we have developed.

40|$|Recently, {{unsteady}} flow rate measurement of gases {{is very important}} in the various industrial fields. However, {{there is no way to}} calibrate and to examine the {{unsteady flow}} rate of gases experimentally. As a result, there is no test bench for the unsteady flow rate measurement of gases. In this paper, we developed a new type of unsteady flow generator for gases. Especially, we realized to generate the unsteady flow of gases continuously. Then, we verified experimentally the generated unsteady flow rate using a <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> that has quick response up to 50 [Hz]. Moreover, we investigated the heat transfer in the generator.

The primary flow element may consist of a single long capillary tube, a bundle of such tubes, or a long porous plug; such low flows create small pressure differentials but longer flow elements create higher, more easily measured differentials.

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} misfire detection. In the case of a misfire, unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, misfire in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). Misfire detection constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. Misfires tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective ignition plugs, leaking secondary insulation, damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of misfire, not connected with the spark generation circuit. Misfire may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If misfire occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of misfire detection have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect misfire. In this paper, misfire was induced on purpose with a misfire generator. The sensors and the misfire trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a misfire detection method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a misfire. The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the differentiated sensors’ signals give the criteria for misfire detection. The misfire can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the differentiated signals. The differentiated signals of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for misfire detection in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed misfire detection method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.

Primary human endothelial cells were stimulated with increasing dosages of aqueous cigarette smoke extract (CSEaq). CSEaq reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The main mediator of cellular adaption to oxidative stress, nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (NRF 2) and its target genes heme oxygenase (decycling) 1 (HMOX 1) or NAD(P) H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO 1) were strongly increased by CSEaq in a dose-dependent manner. High <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> induced elongation of endothelial cells in the direction of flow, activated the AKT/eNOS pathway, increased eNOS expression, phosphorylation and NO release. These increases were inhibited by CSEaq. Pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM 1), vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM 1), selectin E (SELE) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL 2 /MCP- 1) were increased by CSEaq. Low <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> induced VCAM 1 and SELE compared to high <b>laminar</b> <b>flow.</b> High <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> improved endothelial wound healing.

[...] Before NASA's research in the 1970s and 1980s the aircraft design community understood from application attempts in the WW II era that <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> wing designs were not practical using common manufacturing tolerances and surface imperfections. That belief changed after new manufacturing methods were developed with composite materials (e.g., graphite fiber) and machined metal methods were introduced. NASA's research in the 1980s revealed the practicality and usefulness of <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> wing designs and opened the way for <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> applications on modern practical aircraft surfaces, from subsonic general aviation aircraft to transonic large transport aircraft, to supersonic designs.|$|R

Existing research into the aerodynamic problems of subsonic and supersonic <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> control is first reviewed to provide a prospective for subsequent discussions of recent studies to evaluate the potential performance benefits of the application of <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> control to supersonic transports. A flight research program to provide a realistic assessment of the technical feasibility is then described...|$|R
