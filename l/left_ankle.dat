30|$|In our study, female {{patients}} were more affected. An epidemiological {{study from the}} United States [13] found that more sprains occurred {{between the ages of}} 10 and 19  years, while the mean affected age was higher in our study. The same study found that, among males, those between 15 and 24  years old were most commonly affected; among females, those > 30  years old were most affected. Hosea and colleagues [14] found in their prospective study that grade 1 injuries were more prevalent among females, but the difference between the sexes was not statistically significant for grade 2 and 3 injuries. Both ankles were equally affected in the TG group, while <b>left</b> <b>ankles</b> {{were more likely to be}} affected in the POP group. Many studies have found that limb dominance does not manifest itself in ankle injuries, while one study found that limb dominance does indeed play a role in the injury mechanism [15].|$|R

5|$|Freese {{emerged as}} a {{potential}} starter when an injury seemed likely to put Cardinals starting third baseman Troy Glaus {{on the disabled list}} {{at the beginning of the}} 2009 season. Freese made his MLB debut on Opening Day of the 2009 season, coming off the bench and hitting a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the Cardinals' home opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Freese was expected to be the team's starting third baseman, but was quickly passed over by Brian Barden and Joe Thurston. He was optioned to Triple-A Memphis on April 20, 2009 to make room for newly acquired reliever Blaine Boyer. He later had surgery to repair a <b>left</b> <b>ankle</b> injury that hampered him during spring training. He missed two months of the season.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{identification}} of novel rehabilitative impairments that are {{risk factors for}} mobility limitations may improve their prevention and treatment among older adults. We tested the hypothesis that impaired rhythmic interlimb ankle and shoulder coordination are risk factors for subsequent mobility limitations among older adults. METHODS: We conducted a 1 -year prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older adults (N = 99) aged 67 years and older {{who did not have}} mobility limitations (Short Physical Performance Battery score 3 ̆e 9) at baseline. Participants performed antiphase coordination of the right and <b>left</b> <b>ankles</b> or shoulders while paced by an auditory metronome. Using multivariable logistic regression, we determined odds ratios (ORs) for mobility limitations at 1 -year follow-up as a function of coordination variability and asymmetry. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, Mini-Mental State Examination score, number of chronic conditions, and baseline Short Physical Performance Battery score, ORs were significant for developing mobility limitations based on a 1 SD difference in the variability of ankle (OR = 1. 88; 95...|$|R

He began training with the first team during the 2001–02 season and was first named on the bench for Chesterfield's 1–0 victory over Reading at the Madejski Stadium on 1 December 2001. He made his debut in a Football League Trophy match against Port Vale on 22 November 2002, where he came on as a substitute in the 77th minute, and scored in the penalty shoot-out that was eventually lost 4–3. His Football League debut came on 13 September 2003 after coming on as a substitute for the injured Mark DeBolla in the 79th minute of a 1–0 defeat to Notts County. He went on to make further appearances that month against Brighton & Hove Albion and Brentford, where he played on the left wing. He was offered a two-year professional contract with Chesterfield in March 2004, effective from 2004–05. His first league start for Chesterfield came in a 1–0 defeat to Hull City on 10 October. He underwent laparoscopic surgery on his knee to repair cartilage damage in February 2005, which was expected to rule him out for six weeks. He made his return on 18 March after coming on as a 60th-minute substitute for Carlos Logan in a 2–2 draw with Brentford.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{foot and}} ankle in {{rheumatoid}} arthritis undergo highly destructive synovitis with loss of muscle strength. ObjectiveTo evaluate the muscle strength of ankles {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis based on isokinetic dynamometry parameters. Materials and methodsThirty patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis involving the ankle(s) and 30 healthy subjects (control group) matched for age, gender, race, body mass index and lower limb dominance were studied. Dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion and eversion were evaluated in all subjects on an isokinetic Cybex Norm dynamometer. The variables were compared between the rheumatoid arthritis and control groups and between the right and <b>left</b> <b>ankles,</b> and the dorsiflexor/plantar flexor and invertor/evertor muscle strength ratio was determined. ResultsPatients with rheumatoid arthritis performed statistically worse in the isokinetic dynamometry test for all ankle movements. The muscle strength ratio between dorsiflexors and plantar flexors was different in the two groups. No significant differences were observed in the invertor and evertor ratios. In the two groups the plantar flexor musculature was statistically stronger than dorsiflexors. ConclusionWe conclude that patients with rheumatoid arthritis perform worse in isokinetic dynamometry regarding all ankle movements than control subjects, with similar isokinetic test results being observed for {{the right and left}} side in both groups, with few exceptions. Isokinetic evaluation posed no additional risk such as important pain or inflammatory activity to patients with rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
