50|$|At {{the end of}} 2004, 19.1% of ICBC's {{portfolio}} {{consisted of}} non-performing loans. In order to clean up ICBC's balance sheet and prepare it for overseas listing, the Chinese government orchestrated a series of capital injections, asset transfers, and government-subsidised bad <b>loan</b> <b>disposals</b> that eventually cost more than US$162 billion. This included an approval for a cash injection of US$15 billion (financed from China's massive foreign exchange reserves) on 28 April 2005. The Beijing-based state company, China Huarong Asset Management, helped ICBC dispose of its bad loans. As the 2005 annual report records, just under 5% of loans are classified as non-performing, {{in comparison with the}} majority of western banks who have lower NPL ratios (US commercial banks around 1%).|$|R
40|$|Organised {{crime is}} a field {{vulnerable}} to mythical numbers, i. e. exaggerated estimates lacking empirical support, but acquiring acceptance through repetition. The figures on mafia proceeds in Italy are a striking example of this problem. This study proposes an estimation of mafia proceeds in Italy from nine criminal activities (sexual exploitation of women, illicit firearms trafficking, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, the illicit cigarette trade, illicit gambling, illicit waste <b>disposal,</b> <b>loan</b> sharking, and extortion racketeering) by region and type of mafia (Cosa Nostra, Camorra, ‘Ndrangheta, Apulian mafias, and other mafias). The results estimate yearly mafia proceeds at approximately € 10. 7 bn (0. 7 % of the Italian GDP), discussing {{the impact on the}} regional and national economies and the differences among the types of mafias as to their geographical sources of revenues...|$|R

Transcrime, Progetto PON Sicurezza 2007 – 2013. View all notes The study estimated the revenues from nine criminal activities: sexual exploitation of women, illicit firearms trafficking, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, the illicit cigarette trade, illicit gambling, illicit waste <b>disposal,</b> <b>loan</b> sharking and extortion racketeering. For this special issue, each estimation was revised and updated. Five of the following articles (Mancuso on sexual exploitation, Giommoni on drugs, Calderoni on illicit cigarettes, Lisciandra on extortion racketeering and Scaglione on loan sharking) focus on criminal activities for which the literature provided some previous attempts of estimation. The article by Calderoni, Favarin, Garofalo and Sarno presents exploratory estimations for counterfeiting, illicit waste trafficking, illegal gaming machines and illicit firearm trade. These estimations are exploratory {{because of the lack of}} previous experiences in the literature. The last article by Calderoni explores a possible methodology to attribute a share of the criminal revenues to the Italian mafias...|$|R
