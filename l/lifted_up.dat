5|$|The event {{opened with}} a tag team match between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) and the team of Alex Shelley and Michael Shane, who were {{accompanied}} by Traci. The duration of the bout was 11 minutes and 47 seconds. At one point, Storm <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> Shane, so Harris could dive off the top rope and bash {{him in the chest}} with his forearm. Later, Storm was thrown out of the ring but held on to the top rope. He attempted to pull himself back in, however, Shelley dropkicked him from inside the ring, knocking him to the outside. AMW won the match after Storm pinned Shelley following a kick to the chin.|$|E

5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Cage {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Samoa Joe. The added stipulation to this bout was if Joe lost, he {{would be forced to}} retire from professional wrestling forever. Frank Trigg provided commentary for this match. The match was primarily technical, with each combatant switching through various holds and submission maneuvers. One such submission was the Figure-Four Leglock, which Angle applied to Joe. Angle was forced to release the hold when Joe grabbed the bottom rope. Joe then applied a Boston Crab, before switching to an STF, which Angle countered into an Ankle Lock. Following the hold being broken, Angle performed his signature Olympic Slam maneuver on Joe for a near-fall. Later, Joe applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission on Angle, which was forced to be released when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. The match finally came to a conclusion when Joe <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> Angle and slammed him to the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then covered for the pinfall at 17 minutes and 45 seconds to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The stylized {{treatment}} {{of her hair}} could represent a ceremonial wig. She wears a single broad necklace, composed of squares that are structured with horizontal and vertical lines, possibly depicting beads, four to each square. This necklace is virtually identical to the necklace of the god found at Ur, except that the latter's necklace has three lines to a square. Around both wrists she wears bracelets which appear composed of three rings. Both hands are symmetrically <b>lifted</b> <b>up,</b> palms turned towards the viewer and detailed with visible life-, head- and heart lines, holding two rod-and-ring symbols of which only {{the one in the}} left hand is well preserved. Two wings with clearly defined, stylized feathers in three registers extend down from above her shoulders. The feathers in the top register are shown as overlapping scales (coverts), the lower two registers have long, staggered flight feathers that appear drawn with a ruler and end in a convex trailing edge. The feathers have smooth surfaces; no barbs were drawn. The wings are similar but not entirely symmetrical, differing both in the number of the flight feathers and in the details of the coloring scheme.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{turbines}} {{usually have}} a small onboard crane for hoisting maintenance tools and minor components. However, large heavy components like generator, gearbox, blades and so on are rarely replaced and a heavy lift external crane is needed in those cases.

25|$|The lateral {{approach}} is also commonly used for hip replacement. The approach requires {{elevation of the}} hip abductors (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) to access the joint. The abductors may be <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> by osteotomy of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley), or may be divided at their tendinous portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using sutures. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which is often very difficult to treat.|$|E
25|$|The Reformation {{abolished}} in all Protestant countries those processions {{associated with}} the doctrine of transubstantiation (Corpus Christi); the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the 28th Article of Religion of the Church of England was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, <b>lifted</b> <b>up,</b> or worshiped. It also abolished those {{associated with the}} cult of the Blessed Virgin and the saints. The stern simplicity of Calvinism, indeed, would not tolerate religious processions of any kind, and from the Reformed Churches they vanished altogether. The more conservative temper of the Anglican and Lutheran communions, however, suffered the retention of such processions as did not conflict with the reformed doctrines, though even in these Churches they met with opposition and tended after a while to fall into disuse.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{say there}} were two {{possible}} ways of erecting the stauros, which {{would probably have been}} not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice.|$|E

25|$|A more {{authentic}} tradition represents Lysias as having spoken his own Olympiacus at the Olympic festival of 388 BC, to which Dionysius I of Syracuse {{had sent a}} magnificent embassy. Tents embroidered with gold were pitched within the sacred enclosure; and the wealth of Dionysius was vividly shown {{by the number of}} chariots which he had entered. Lysias <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his voice to denounce Dionysius as, next to Artaxerxes, the worst enemy of Hellas, and to impress upon the assembled Greeks that one of their foremost duties was to deliver Sicily from a hateful oppression. The latest work of Lysias which we can date (a fragment of a speech For Pherenicus) belongs to 381 or 380 BC. He probably died in or soon after 380 BC.|$|E

A voice proclaimed that all flesh is grass, its goodness like a flower of the field, which withers and fades; but God's word will stand forever. The herald of good tidings should go to the mountain and announce to the cities of Judah that God will come as a Mighty One to rule, as a shepherd that feeds the flock, gathers the lambs, carries them, and gently leads them.|$|E
25|$|NSB first {{considered}} a stone bridge, {{but found that}} the bedrock on the Hafslund side was not stable enough. They therefore opted for a steel truss bridge situated on upstream of the original bridge. The bridge was designed by Hans Tønnesen. It received a deck which supported a single track, but the foundations were built to support double track. The plans were approved in December 1929. Work on the foundations started immediately and by November 1930 the first bridge elements were being installed. These were designed by Erik Ruuds Mekaniske Verksted. The main truss {{had to be put}} together on side and then <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> from the waterfalls, and event that took place on 17 March 1931. The bridge was finished in 1 May 1931 and the first train ran across it on 9 May. The new railway bridge cost 716,000 kroner.|$|E

50|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} a priest whose hands were {{deformed}} should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> {{his hands to}} say the priestly blessing, and Rabbi Judah said that a priest whose hands were discolored should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, because it would cause the congregation {{to look at him}} during this blessing when they should not. A Baraita stated that deformities on the face, hands, or feet were disqualifying for saying the priestly blessing. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said that a Kohen with spotted hands should not say the blessing. A Baraita taught that one whose hands were curved inwards or bent sideways should not say the blessing. And Rav Huna said that a man whose eyes ran should not say the blessing. But the Gemara noted that such a Kohen in Rav Huna's neighborhood used to say the priestly blessing and apparently even Rav Huna did not object, because the townspeople had become accustomed to the Kohen. And the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that a man whose eyes ran should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, but he was permitted to do so if the townspeople were accustomed to him. Rabbi Johanan said that a man blind in one eye should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands. But the Gemara noted that there was one in Rabbi Johanan's neighborhood who used to <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, as the townspeople were accustomed to him. And the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that a man blind in one eye should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, but if the townspeople were accustomed to him, he was permitted. Rabbi Judah said that a man whose hands were discolored should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, but the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that if most of the men of the town follow the same hand-discoloring occupation, it was permitted.|$|R
