50|$|However, {{the risks}} of <b>private</b> <b>businesses</b> do {{differ from those of}} traded securities. Therefore, a {{portfolio}} of traded assets that best hedges the risk of typical <b>private</b> <b>businesses</b> will enjoy excess demand from <b>private</b> <b>business</b> owners. This will cause the price of the assets in this portfolio to be bid up relative to the price predicted by the CAPM ,causing a lower expected return in relation to systematic risk. Conversely, securities with risks highly correlated to {{the risks of}} <b>private</b> <b>businesses</b> will have high equilibrium risk premiums, causing a higher expected return in relation to systematic risk; or positive alphas. This has been confirmed by empirical tests by Heaton and Lucas (2000). Thus, <b>private</b> <b>businesses</b> can only be imperfectly hedged using traded securities and therefore still cause deviations from the CAPM.|$|R

40|$|Using surveys {{on family}} assets and debts in Canada, we {{document}} a significant {{decline in the}} <b>private</b> <b>business</b> equity share of total assets and net worth between 1984 and 1999 for households and entrepreneurs. We propose an explanation based on recent financial developments that allow financial intermediaries to better screen and monitor <b>private</b> <b>business</b> borrowers. We also study an incentive model of financial intermediation. The model relies on three key factors: risk aversion, moral hazard, and monitoring. We show that as monitoring costs decrease due to financial developments, entrepreneurs will commit less of their own wealth to <b>private</b> <b>business,</b> and the debt ratio of <b>private</b> <b>business</b> increases. ...|$|R

50|$|Abstract (public) processes: This {{represents}} {{the interactions between}} a <b>private</b> <b>business</b> process and another process or participant. Only those activities that communicate outside the <b>private</b> <b>business</b> process {{are included in the}} abstract process. All other “internal” activities of the <b>private</b> <b>business</b> process are not shown in the abstract process. Thus, the abstract process shows to the outside world the sequence of messages that are required to interact with that business process. Abstract processes are contained within a Pool and can be modeled separately or within a larger BPMN Diagram to show the Message Flow between the abstract process activities and other entities. If the abstract process is in the same Diagram as its corresponding <b>private</b> <b>business</b> process, then the activities that are common to both processes can be associated.|$|R
