How much must his horizon be cabined, cribbed, confined by the frost and snow, the gloom and poverty, of the bare land around him! He lives in a dark cold world of scrubby vegetation and scant animal life: a world where human existence is necessarily preserved only by ceaseless labour and at severe odds; a world out of which all the noblest and most beautiful living creatures have been ruthlessly pressed; a world where nothing great has been or can be; a world doomed by its mere physical conditions to eternal poverty, discomfort, and squalor. For green fields he has snow and reindeer moss: for singing birds and flowers, the ptarmigan and the tundra.

60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>by</b> {{pointing}} out that, {{in the more}} modern conceptions of logic, it is recognised {{that there are no}} identically similar objective experiences; the disposition is to conceive all real objective being as individual and unique. This is not a singular eccentric idea of mine; it is one for which ample support {{is to be found in}} the writings of absolutely respectable contemporaries, who are quite untainted by association with fiction. It is now understood that conceivably only in the subjective world, and in theory and the imagination, do we deal with identically similar units, and with absolutely commensurable quantities. In the real world it is reasonable to suppose we deal at most with practically similar units and practically commensurable quantities. But there is a strong bias, a sort of labour-saving bias in the normal human mind to ignore this, and not only to speak but to think of a thousand bricks or a thousand sheep or a thousand sociologists as though they were all absolutely true to sample. If it is brought before a thinker for a moment that in any special case this is not so, he slips back to the old attitude as soon as his attention is withdrawn. This source of error has, for instance, caught nearly the whole race of chemists, with one or two distinguished exceptions, and atoms and ions and so forth of the same species are tacitly assumed to be similar one to another. Be it noted that, so far as the practical results of chemistry and physics go, it scarcely matters which assumption we adopt. For purposes of inquiry and discussion the incorrect one is infinitely more convenient.|$|E
60|$|It will {{perhaps be}} {{sufficient}} if I confine myself, {{in the details}} of my argument, to functions of a public nature: since, if I am successful as to those, it probably will be readily granted that women should be admissible to all other occupations to which it is at all material whether they are admitted or not. And here <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> <b>by</b> marking out one function, broadly distinguished from all others, their right to which is entirely independent of any question which can be raised concerning their faculties. I mean the suffrage, both parliamentary and municipal. The right to share in the choice of those who are to exercise a public trust, is altogether a distinct thing from that of competing for the trust itself. If no one could vote for a member of parliament who was not fit to be a candidate, the government would be a narrow oligarchy indeed. To have a voice in choosing those by whom one is to be governed, is a means of self-protection due to every one, though he were to remain for ever excluded from the function of governing: and that women are considered fit to have such a choice, may be presumed from the fact, that the law already gives it to women in the most important of all cases to themselves: for the choice of the man who is to govern a woman to the end of life, is always supposed to be voluntarily made by herself. In the case of election to public trusts, it is the business of constitutional law to surround the right of suffrage with all needful securities and limitations; but whatever securities are sufficient {{in the case of the}} male sex, no others need be required in the case of women. Under whatever conditions, and within whatever limits, men are admitted to the suffrage, there is not a shadow of justification for not admitting women under the same. The majority of the women of any class are not likely to differ in political opinion from the majority of the men of the same class, unless the question be one in which the interests of women, as such, are in some way involved; and if they are so, women require the suffrage, as their guarantee of just and equal consideration. This ought to be obvious even to those who coincide in no other of the doctrines for which I contend. Even if every woman were a wife, and if every wife ought to be a slave, all the more would these slaves stand in need of legal protection: and we know what legal protection the slaves have, where the laws are made by their masters.|$|E

A large majority of New Zealanders trace their ancestry to European countries, especially Britain, and we like to think we know and understand them. But Europe is changing fast, and the mass migration from there to New Zealand occurred several generations ago. If we don’t take care to nurture the relationship, we will end up being out of touch with the new developments. While the logic of our geography leads us to focus a lot of attention on the Asia Pacific region and the Americas, our ties to and interests in Europe are just too important to let go.

Although each of the authors offer different perspectives on the role that the criminal justice system has to play in the process of desistance from crime, they all identify the importance of a valueoriented analysis to effective offender rehabilitation. Their focus is on promoting desistance at all points of the justice process; from how the legal system can promote therapeutic outcomes through to the provision of post-release support services and the need for community engagement. By approaching the tasks of both rehabilitation and reintegration from a values perspective, {{they have been able to}} identify a range of novel and innovative approaches that have the potential to make a real difference. Even more encouragingly, these draw on resources that may already be available to correctional psychologists and yet are often underutilized. In addition, the confidence, and indeed the optimism, expressed in these articles provides a refreshing counter to suggestions that contemporary correctional practice has become pre-occupied with the need to “manage” offenders and for professionals to focus on fulfilling their administrative obligations (see Hardy, 2014) ...|$|R
40|$|The issue {{concerning}} {{the existence of}} wormhole states in locally supersymmetric minisuperspace models with matter is addressed. Wormhole states are apparently absent in models obtained from the more general theory of N= 1 supergravity with supermatter. A Hartle-Hawking type solution can be found, even though some terms (which are scalar field dependent) cannot be determined in a satisfactory way. A possible cause is investigated here. As far as the wormhole situation is concerned, we argue here {{that the type of}} Lagrange multipliers and fermionic derivative ordering one uses may make a difference. A proposal is made for supersymmetric quantum wormholes to also be invested with a Hilbert space structure, associated with a maximal analytical extension of the corresponding minisuperspace. Mistery stories seem to be a must in Britain. One just has to remember famous characters such as Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple and celebrated authors like Sir. A. C.

A quantum theory of gravity constitutes one of the foremost aspirations in theoretical physics [1]. The inclusion of supersymmetry could allow important achievements as well. Firstly, supersymmetry is an attractive concept with appealing possibilities in particle physics. The introduction of local supersymmetry and subsquently of supergravity provide an elegant gauge theory between bosons and fermions to which many hope nature has reserved a rightful place [2]. In fact, N= 1 supergravity is a (Dirac) square root of gravity [3]: physical states in the quantum theory must satisfy the supersymmetry constraint...|$|R

5000|$|Dear Dr. Lee and Dr. Levine:Thank you {{for your}} letter noting {{concerns}} about Arizona State University’s recent reorganization in our colleges of Education. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> first <b>by</b> clarifying some erroneous information noted in your letter. Absolutely no graduate degree programs in education are being discontinued or disestablished {{as a result of}} this reorganization. Over the past three years of massive budget cuts in Arizona, we have been steadfast in our commitment to protect faculty lines and academic programs. This reorganization, like others we have undertaken, is an administration reorganization that reaps significant budget saving and also has the effect of reorganizing faculty into intellectual clusters that can continue to build on existing strengths and also forge new and important directions.I am sharing with you a recent article published in Change that outlines what we have continued to try to accomplish through such reorganization at Arizona State University without compromising quality.On a related note, as you may know, many of our doctoral programs are highly ranked. These rankings are based on the quality of the degree program and not the organizational umbrella under which the programs find themselves. We value the quality of research and educational vision that the majority of our faculties in education provide. We believe that this quality will continue to improve as our faculties from across the university coalesce around significant educational issues to be addressed in the decades ahead. As you know, change can be very difficult. In the multiple reorganizations we have already put in place, faculty come to understand that there can be many wonderful new opportunities for them to explore with new colleagues and new programs. At the very core of much of these reorganizations has been an increased interdisciplinary synergy, with new programmatic opportunities for our students that would not have emerged in the traditional structures that were in place.I am sorry you were misinformed.Sincerely,Elizabeth D.

40|$|In {{discussing}} the fundamental sources of unpredictability, I shall concentrate on those indeterminacies that are definitely required <b>by</b> theory. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> therefore <b>begin</b> <b>by</b> eliminating from consideration supposed indeterminacies stemming from doubts {{that some people}} may entertain about basic principles or from certain kinds of ignorance that I believe to be temporary and likely to be remedied in the relatively near future. I assume the following: 1. Quantum mechanics is correct. The formulation and interpretation of quantum mechanics are still undergoing some necessary evolution, especially {{in order to accommodate}} quantum cosmology in a comfortable way, but the basic character of quantum mechanics has always been the same and we may suppose it will remain unchanged. 2. The elementary particles and their interactions obey a definite dynamical law, discoverable by inquiring complex adaptive systems such as the human scientific enterprise. Although the process of discovery involves a sequence of approximate schemata, there is an endpoint to the process after a finite amount of research. (Of course, it can never be possible to prove that the resulting unified theory is perfect; one can only verify it in the usual way by comparing predictions to available observations.) Humans may already have found this unified quantum field theory in the form of superstring theory, which has, to begin with, no arbitrary parameters. (Of course, spontaneous symmetry breaking may give rise to some parameters and even to a choice of solutions, with probabilities for the various alternatives. I will deal with that possibility further on.) This second assumption is equivalent to stating that there is no necessary fundamental unpredictability stemming from ignorance of the universal dynamical law. 3. The density matrix (in the Schrödinger picture) of the universe near the beginning of its expansion is also knowable. It must in any case be comparatively simple and very far from equilibrium. The second law of thermodynamics and the other associated arrows of time are explained by these properties of the initial density matrix along {{with the fact that the}} universe is still very young—the interval of ten billion years is extremely short compared with the relaxation time from the special initial condition...|$|R
