500|$|When Jon Bentley {{assigned}} {{binary search}} {{as a problem}} in a course for professional programmers, he found that ninety percent failed to provide a correct solution after several hours of working on it, and another study published in 1988 shows that accurate code for it is only found in five out of twenty textbooks. Furthermore, Bentley's own implementation of binary search, published in his 1986 book Programming Pearls, contained an overflow error that remained undetected for over twenty years. [...] The Java programming <b>language</b> <b>library</b> implementation of binary search had the same overflow bug for more than nine years.|$|E

At {{the birth of her}} first child in 1745, no children had been born in the Swedish royal house in over 50 years and she gained initial popularity with her beauty, wit and interest in science and culture. [...] Carl Gustaf Tessin described her as [...] "the wisdom of a god in the image of an angel",. Despite French being her native language, she was tutored in the Swedish by Carl Jesper Benzelius and mastered it well after only two years. She studied Swedish literature and gathered a Swedish <b>language</b> <b>library,</b> she corresponded with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and created a nature scientific collection. Her arrogant and haughty demeanor, however, eventually made her less popular outside of the royal court.|$|E

50|$|Existence {{checking}} or existence detection is {{an important}} aspect of many computer programs. An existence check before reading a file can catch and/or prevent a fatal error, for instance. For that reason, most programming <b>language</b> <b>libraries</b> contain a means of checking whether a file exists.|$|R
40|$|For {{commercial}} development, dynamic {{languages are}} growing in popularity. Consequently, dynamic language developers {{must consider the}} correctness of their code. Deployment of correct or sufficiently correct code {{is critical to the}} success and adoption of that code. However, it is challenging to ensure the correctness of dynamic language code when it is a library. Inputs to dynamic <b>language</b> <b>libraries</b> are often not simple values. They can also be open objects, which permit adding, removing, and iterating over attribute names, and they can be functions that may be called. Furthermore, the result of running library functions on objects is often new objects derived from the input objects. To ensure the correctness of dynamic <b>language</b> <b>libraries,</b> this dissertation uses static analysis. Static analysis is typically used to infer facts about programs 2 Ì† 7 values, but in these dynamic <b>language</b> <b>libraries,</b> values can be objects and functions. These objects may be unknown and thus have an unknown set of attribute names because they are inputs or these objects may be iteratively derived from other objects. Functions may be stored, called, or wrapped in other functions, regardless of if they are known or not. A static analysis for dynamic <b>language</b> <b>libraries</b> must handle these cases. To support static analysis of libraries, this dissertation introduces local heap abstractions suitable for representing parts of memory that library code may affect. These abstractions build upon abstractions for sets that enable representing relations between attribute names of otherwise unknown objects. Furthermore, the local reasoning is utilized to abstract the effect of calling unknown functions. The precision of these abstractions are demonstrated on a range of small, but complex JavaScript-inspired examples. The examples are extracted from libraries such as Traits. js and Google Closure...|$|R
