40|$|Abstract — We {{evaluate}} the QoS {{of a number}} of VoIP endpoints, in terms of mouth-to-ear (M 2 E) delay, clock skew, silence suppression behavior and robustness to packet loss. Our results show that the M 2 E delay depends mainly on the receiving endpoint. Hardware IP phones, when acting as receivers, usually achieve a low average M 2 E delay (45 - 90 ms) under low jitter conditions. Software clients achieve an average M 2 E delay from 65 ms to over 400 ms, depending on the actual implementation. All tested end-points can compensate for clock skew, although some suffer from occasional playout buffer underflow. Only a few of the tested end-points support silence suppression. We find that their silence detectors have a fairly <b>long</b> <b>hangover</b> <b>time</b> (> 1 sec), and they may falsely detect music as silence. All the hardware IP phones we tested support some form of packet loss concealment better than silence substitution. The concealment generally works well for two to three consecutive losses at 20 ms packet intervals, but voice will quickly deteriorate beyond that. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the quality and}} performance {{of a number of}} hardware and software Voice over IP (VoIP) end-points. In particular, we focus on the following aspects: mouth-to-ear (M 2 E) delay, clock skew, silence suppression behavior and robustness to packet loss. Our preliminary results show that mouth-to-ear delay depends mostly on the receiving endpoint, and hardware IP phones, when acting as receivers, usually achieve a low average M 2 E delay (45 - 90 ms) under low jitter conditions. For software VoIP clients (as receivers), their average M 2 E delays range from 65 ms to over 400 ms, depending on the actual software. All the VoIP end-points we tested are able to compensate for clock skew, although some exhibit the symptom of occasional playout buffer underflow. Only a few of the tested end-points support silence suppression. We find that their silence detectors have a fairly <b>long</b> <b>hangover</b> <b>time</b> (> 1 sec), and they may falsely detect music as silence. When packet losses occur, we find that all tested hardware IP phones support some form of packet loss concealment better than silence substitution. The concealment generally works well for up to two consecutive losses at 20 ms packet intervals, but bails out (voice fading quickly) after the third consecutive loss. 1...|$|E
50|$|Rashit {{was formed}} in Istanbul in 1993 by Tolga Ozbey. Tolga was {{inspired}} by The Clash, Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys and Dirty Rotten Imbeciles during his early years. Tolga had numerous involvements in many temporary underground groups during this period. With one of his groups named Sert Itham, he managed to arrange a split demo record with Japanese punk group Argue Damnation but after a <b>long</b> <b>hangover</b> night he could not {{make it to the}} post office next day and the chance was missed. He stated that he still keeps the record as a remembrance.|$|R

In 1995, Syleena {{released}} an album with her legendary father Syl Johnson, This Time Together By Father And Daughter, featuring songs such as [...] "Keep On Loving Me" [...] and [...] "Piece of the Rock". A rare video of an early song [...] "It's On" [...] has appeared on video-sharing website YouTube. Her official debut recording album Love Hangover was released on January 26, 1999. The album featured Johnson singing classic R&B songs such as [...] "Love Hangover" [...] by Diana Ross and [...] "Baby I'm Scared Of You" [...] by Womack & Womack. The album is hard to find, sometimes being sold at an exorbitant price on eBay and Amazon. Both Love <b>Hangover</b> and This <b>Time</b> Together By Father And Daughter, were released on the independent label Twinight Records. Not <b>long</b> after Love <b>Hangover,</b> Syleena Johnson signed a record deal with major record label Jive Records, and began writing the chapters of her life.|$|R
25|$|Conor O'Brien formed Villagers {{after the}} {{break-up}} {{of his previous}} band The Immediate. The very next day, O'Brien wrote the first song after waking up with a <b>hangover.</b> O'Brien's <b>time</b> as a guitarist in Cathy Davey's band was also critical {{to the development of}} his style as he had never before performed alongside anyone outside of The Immediate. Villagers gave their first live performance as a support act with The Chapters at a show in Whelan's in November 2008. At that point the band had previously only rehearsed together on two occasions. They had only seven songs, written by O'Brien and passed on {{to the rest of the}} band to learn.|$|R

40|$|International {{education}} in Australia has sulked {{in the gloom}} {{for the past two}} years. Now, last month’s Knight review of the student visa program has put the light, energy and motion back into the sector. While not all providers are pleased with the outcome, the review’s thoughtful and sweeping recommendations have buoyed universities. Giddy headlines and commentators have acclaimed the government’s endorsement of the review: ‘Knight saves the universities, the universities love Knight!’ Rather than risk a nasty <b>hangover,</b> it’s <b>time</b> to put the champagne on ice. Knight is not a blank cheque. It is not an open-ended invitation for universities to go sprinting after any old student seeking entry to higher education programs in order to benefit from the streamlined visa processing arrangements. The review does not mean that we’ll see a massive shift of load from the private vocational sector to the universities...|$|R
40|$|Fixation {{with home}} {{ownership}} causing {{economic and social}} despair New Zealand’s crippling home affordability rates cannot be fixed by a single solution such as changing immigration policy or urban planning rules, or imposing {{a capital gains tax}} or lending ratios. This {{is one of the key}} findings from the latest New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) report – The home affordability challenge. “There is no one fix to rule them all,” says Shamubeel Eaqub, principal economist at NZIER. “It’s not just Chinese investors, it’s not just a lack of an effective capital gains tax, it’s not just councils’ planning rules, or cheap credit. ” “With that many variables in the mix, the solutions will be complex and perhaps the most effective measures could come from unexpected corners, like rental market reform. ” New Zealand has one of the least renter-friendly regimes in the OECD, so renting is not seen by many as a viable long term housing option. Eaqub says if tenants were offered better security of tenure, and able to treat their rental like their own home, many could be willing to forgo home ownership. The report explains that New Zealand’s obsession with home ownership is one of the key reasons that it took so long for New Zealand’s economy to recover after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. “Our reliance on future capital gains to pay for debt-funded spending caused a <b>long</b> <b>hangover</b> when households realised they needed to pay off the mortgage. ” Eaqub says if New Zealanders are not cured of their housing fixation, the nation’s financial and economic stability will continue to be put at risk every time there is a recession. The fixation with home ownership is also causing social inequity and despair. “People fear being locked out of a traditional route to financial security, as almost 70 percent of New Zealand’s household net wealth is stored in housing. At today’s prices, an average Auckland home will take 50 years to pay off on an average Auckland salary. In the early 1990 s, the average Auckland home took 30 years to pay off. ” Home ownership rates are at their lowest since 1951 – but rather than obsessing about that, it is a trend New Zealanders should embrace. “Economies prosper when people invest in business, not just housing. We need to create level-playing fields for different types of investment, and parity between renting and owning, to support a much needed cultural change around housing. ...|$|R
50|$|Bourbon Crow is {{the outlaw}} country project formed by horror aficionado Wednesday 13. They have {{released}} three full-length album Highway to <b>Hangovers,</b> <b>Long</b> Way to the Bottom and, Off the Wagon on the Rocks. In 2007, an exclusive Texas tour {{in support of}} the debut album had to be cancelled after Wednesday 13 was involved in a car accident returning from rehearsals, leaving him with a broken collar bone and a fractured ankle. In May 2009, the band toured the United States {{in support of the}}ir second release, featuring Wednesday. This touring lineup also included then Wednesday 13 bassist Nate Manor on electric bass with Roman Surman as the electric guitarist. The band cite many country legends such as Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard as their main influences, claiming that Highway to Hangovers is a salute to these musicians. The subject matter of many of the songs on the record is comical, with satirical lyrics about such topics as alcohol, sex and death however Bourbon Crow has never stated the album was a serious attempt at Outlaw Country.|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between total sleep time and the duration and severity of the alcohol hangover. Methods: A survey was conducted among Dutch University students to collect data on their latest alcohol hangover. Data on alcohol consumption, total sleep <b>time,</b> <b>hangover</b> severity, and duration were collected. Alcohol consumption and hangover severity and duration were compared for participants who (a) slept 7 hours. Results: Data from N= 578 students (40. 1 % men and 59. 9 % women) were included in the statistical analyses. Significant correlations were found between total sleep time and alcohol consumption (r= 0. 117, p= 0. 005), hangover severity (r= – 0. 178, p= 0. 0001) and hangover duration (r= 0. 168, p= 0. 0001). In contrast, total alcohol consumption did not correlate significantly with overall hangover severity or duration. Those who slept longer than 7 hours consumed significantly more alcohol (p= 0. 016) and reported extended hangover duration (p= 0. 004). However, they also reported significantly less severe hangovers (p= 0. 001) than students who slept < 7 hours. Conclusion: Reduced total sleep time is associated with more severe alcohol hangovers.   Keywords: alcohol, hangover, duration, severity, total sleep tim...|$|R
40|$|The 2007 {{international}} economic crisis {{may have begun}} in capitalism’s heartland with credit default swops and sub-prime mortages, nevertheless {{some of its most}} dramatic manifestations have been at the edge. In Europe, the peripheral economies of Iceland, Greece and Ireland have manifested crises that have shaken Europe to the core, and generated crisis discourse that may well prove central. Certainly previous talk of crisis seem to have been key to political change processes in the past (Hay, 1996; Mårtenson and Lindhoff, 1998). While there has been some initial analysis of the discursive response to the economic crisis (Hartz, 2010; O’Rourke, 2010) this paper focuses on what some have considered the most conservative of ‘frames’ through which the crisis has been viewed (Thompson, 2009 : 523) : enterprise discourse. Furthermore this work concentrates on enterprise discourse in a post-celtic tiger crisis-ridden Ireland. Ireland is an economy, society and culture at the edge. On the one hand Ireland is {{on the edge of the}} USA /UK model. It is English-speaking, has a common law tradition, an Anglo-American banking model, low corporate tax rates and strong cultural and economic ties with both the USA and the UK. On the other hand, Ireland is also on the edge of mainland Europe with its membership of the Euro, its social Partnership model of labour relations until 2009, its early adoption of European Labour rights, generally pro-European stance and its historic cultural and economic ties to the continent. Enterprise discourse in Ireland is influenced by both USA/UK and European Union (EU) developments. However, Irish enterprise discourse is not merely a ‘local adoption’. For example, during the ‘Celtic Tiger’ period (1987 - 2007), high Irish economic growth rates have coincided with the development of the EU’s enterprise policy, thus giving the impression that Ireland could serve as a model of development. Since the crisis Ireland, numbered among the ‘PIGS’ (Totaro, 2010) or ‘GIPSY’ club (Gros, 2010), has been represented both as a model victim of free-market fundamentalism (Krugman, 2010) and as a model of how public expenditure should be drastically cut (Halligan, 2010; Tett, 2010). Thus an examination of enterprise discourse in Ireland is of concern to more than residents of Ireland. References Gros, D. 2010. Adjustment Difficulties in the GIPSY Club.
