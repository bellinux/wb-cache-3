5|$|Some breeds, {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan {{horse in}} Vermont and Massachusetts, were named as the state horse because of the close {{connection}} between {{the history of the}} breed and the state. Others, including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter, include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive <b>lobbyists</b> <b>for</b> the cause of some state horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries.|$|E

25|$|Republican {{victories}} in the elections of 1946 had brought a much more conservative Congress to Washington, with a determination to curb labor. The Taft-Hartley Act, drafted {{in large part by}} <b>lobbyists</b> <b>for</b> the National Association of Manufacturers, General Electric, Inland Steel and other industrialists, represented a major revision of the Wagner Act that significantly weakened labor's ability to organize and effectively negotiate.|$|E
25|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to win passage of the stalled legislation, the city commissioners held yet another hearing in the waning days of the 52nd Congress. The January 15th hearing was {{cancelled}} when the commissioners were unexpectedly called to Capitol Hill to testify. But PHC representatives noted that <b>lobbyists</b> <b>for</b> real estate syndicates showed up in large numbers for the hearing. The hearing was eventually held on January 23, but there was no new evidence or testimony offered and the stalemate continued.|$|E

However, Patrick vetoed it as he {{previously}} stated that he would only accept one slot parlor. When the 2011 casino legislation was still in debate, an investigative report in The Boston Globe revealed the governor violated his self-imposed policy of not accepting money from or meeting with <b>lobbyists</b> <b>for</b> the gambling industry by accepting more than $6,000 in campaign contributions and meeting with and attending fundraisers hosted by gaming lobbyists.|$|E

25|$|Australia as a {{whole is}} heavily reliant on primary {{industry}} and the main benefits of a FTA between the two countries were seen to be increased access to the large, but heavily subsidised and protected, American market by Australian producers. In particular, the rural and regional-based National Party lobbied hard to have the agreement extend to the export of sugar. The eventual provisions of the agreement did not go as far as had been hoped, and as a result, some <b>lobbyists</b> <b>for</b> the sugar industry, notably independent Bob Katter, urged rejection of the FTA. However, many, such as then Premier of Queensland Peter Beattie, still felt that the agreement was a net gain for Australian agriculture and supported ratification on that basis.|$|E
25|$|Mazzocchi {{became a}} {{national}} staffer in 1965. That year, long-time OCAW president O.A. Knight retired. Secretary-Treasurer Alvin F. Grospiron ran for president, and Mazzocchi strongly backed his candidacy. The election was a bitter one. Knight had allowed the Central Intelligence Agency to use the union as a cover for covert operations, and had accepted {{large sums of money}} from the agency. Because of his support for Gospiron, Mazzocchi was appointed OCAW's Citizenship-Legislative Director in 1965. He used his position to push strongly for health and safety language in union contracts, as well as for state and federal legislation on the issue. In 1969 and 1970, he organized a series of public meetings in which OCAW and other union members testified about the chemicals they were handling and the health problems they were having. Scientists also testified at these public hearings about the danger of these chemicals. The public meetings gained widespread press attention. Mazzocchi also used the hearings to help educate workers on the legislative process, and trained them to act as <b>lobbyists</b> <b>for</b> federal health and safety legislation. The media attention and pressure from union members provided critical support for congressional attempts to pass comprehensive occupational health and safety legislation. In December 1970, Congress enacted and President Richard Nixon signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). Nixon specifically cited Mazzocchi's leadership and grassroots organizing efforts as key in winning passage of the Act.|$|E
