5|$|A North American <b>localization</b> was hinted on Namco Bandai Games' Facebook page by {{a puzzle}} on January 24, 2011. When solved, the puzzle reveals a URL to a {{distorted}} image which was restored on February 2, 2011 and reveals Tales of Graces fs <b>localization</b> for North America. On May 11, 2011, Namco officially announced the North American, EMEA and Asia-Pacific <b>localization</b> of Tales of Graces f. The text was translated by 8-4 while Cup of Tea Productions produced the dubbing. The North American <b>localization</b> {{was released on}} March 13, 2012. The EMEA and Asia-Pacific <b>localization</b> released on August 31, 2012 along with a day one special edition. The game was made available on the North American and European PlayStation Network in March 2013.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the <b>localization,</b> quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The <b>localization</b> team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a <b>localization</b> project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The <b>localization</b> team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E

5|$|The PSP remake's <b>localization</b> {{was similar}} to those done for Persona 3 and 4, with the {{dialogue}} being in tune with modern youth and keeping {{as close to the}} original dialogue as possible except for Japan-specific cultural references. To provide a reference for their work, the <b>localization</b> team played through the original version of Persona. The changes made to character names and appearances were all changed back to how they appeared in the original Japanese release, {{with the exception of a}} couple of lines that had become fan favorites. These were included as a kind of homage to both players and the company's history of game <b>localization.</b> The entire Snow Queen quest was also reinstated.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the gold-standard {{method of}} {{cellular}} <b>localization</b> is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. The sample {{is prepared for}} normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the <b>localization</b> of both ultrastructural details {{as well as the}} protein of interest.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the <b>localization</b> {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in <b>localization,</b> and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the <b>localization</b> team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

5|$|Marcus Lindblom is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} {{known for his}} English <b>localization</b> of the 1995 video game EarthBound. Lindblom spent his youth in the United States, and {{dropped out of college}} to move to Japan with his wife. After four years, he returned to college in the United States and began to work at Nintendo of America's call center. He eventually worked on Japanese-to-English game <b>localization</b> projects such as Wario's Woods and EarthBound. Lindblom worked with a translator and a writer to accurately translate the game for a Western audience. He sought to stay true to Shigesato Itoi's script, but was given latitude to make the script as weird as he wanted, and so added in American cultural allusions. Lindblom considers the <b>localization</b> his highest achievement.|$|E

5|$|The companies' {{first major}} {{projects}} were Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, which each proved successful enough to launch video game franchises. Since then, {{the majority of}} the games produced by the companies have been localized for Western audiences, although the process was not given a high priority at Square until the international success of Final Fantasy VII. A dedicated <b>localization</b> department was consequently created at the company's Tokyo headquarters around 1998. Enix remained without a translation department until its merger with Square in 2003. In recent years, the process of <b>localization</b> has undergone changes, mainly due to difficult experiences with various titles. Most major titles are now developed with <b>localization</b> running in parallel to development, with more simultaneous releases and even occasional titles developed in localized form first in order to appeal to the Western market.|$|E
5|$|The <b>localization</b> of {{the first}} game was {{outsourced}} to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States: because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. The Japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the <b>localization,</b> as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.|$|E
