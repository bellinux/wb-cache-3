5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> involved in the trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow lorises for medicinal purposes. The wife of another law enforcement official from the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia {{is one of the}} most notable sellers of slow loris parts.|$|E

The first police force in the Jordanian state was organised {{after the fall of the}} Ottoman Empire on 11 April 1921. Until 1956 police duties were carried out by the Arab Legion and the Transjordan Frontier Force. After that year the Public Safety Directorate was established. The number of female police officers is increasing. In the 1970s, it was the first Arab country to include females in its police force. Jordan's law enforcement was ranked 37th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East, in terms of police services' performance, by the 2016 World Internal Security and Police Index.|$|E

50|$|Chuck Canterbury, the {{president}} of the Fraternal Order of Police, argued that the equipment received from the federal government had been properly de-militarized, and that it was being used to protect civilians from violent crime. He further stated that the use of the equipment by <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>was</b> necessary to protect civilians, since mass shootings have taken place across the United States, even in small towns. Responding to claims that <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officers <b>were</b> being given tanks, Canterbury argued that the vehicles being used by <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>were</b> not armed, and that they were being used across the United States to protect other officers.|$|R

50|$|In 1948, the Division of <b>Law</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} {{within the}} Department of Conservation. The new division {{consisted of a}} director who was given the authority to appoint a chief coastal warden and chief conservation officer. The conservation officers enforced inland fish and game laws and the coastal wardens enforced marine fisheries laws. In 1953, the Department of Conservation {{changed its name to}} the Department of Natural Resources. The Division of <b>Law</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>was</b> also given the authority to enforce laws relating to marine fisheries, inland fisheries, game, forests, parks, fire, and dogs. In 1964, the <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> responsibilities of the coastal warden service and the conservation officer were combined. The new name of the coastal warden and conservation officer was changed to natural resource officer. In 1975, the Department of Natural Resources was reorganized and became the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs. The Division of <b>Law</b> <b>Enforcement</b> became the only statewide agency with the primary responsibility to prevent violations of the state’s environmental laws. In 1978, the Department of <b>Law</b> <b>Enforcement</b> signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Marine Fisheries Service to enforce federal laws. In 1981, the Division of <b>Law</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>was</b> transferred back to the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Recreation Vehicles.|$|R
25|$|As <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> vested solely {{with the}} states of Germany, each state's police force (or 'Land' police) follows a {{different}} system of law. Accordingly, there is an absence of a federal comprehensive register, compiling and publishing regular, uniform and comprehensive figures on complaints about police ill-treatment. Even though Germany is bound to obligate its many international treaties and conventions, Amnesty International (2002) highlights the authorities failure to protect a range of human rights as guaranteed by international human rights law and standards.|$|E
