40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the special}} {{geometric}} shape and narrow space of exploration tunnel, field geological <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> exploration tunnels has always been staying at manual drafting stage with low efficiency and low level of informatization. This paper studies the existing issues of photographic geological <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> exploration tunnel, including the control method, image acquisition method, geometric correction of original images and the generation of display images, etc. This paper realizes fast acquisition and processing of the image data of geological logging, meeting the accuracy requirement of photographic geological <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> exploration tunnels, filling the vacancy of photographic geological <b>logging</b> technologies <b>in</b> exploration tunnels, improving the efficiency, level of automation and informatization of geological <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> exploration tunnels...|$|R

25|$|The {{elementary}} functions are constructed by composing arithmetic operations, the exponential function (exp), the natural logarithm (log), trigonometric functions (sin, cos), and their inverses. The complexity of an elementary function {{is equivalent to}} that of its inverse, since all {{elementary functions}} are analytic and hence invertible by means of Newton's method. In particular, if either exp or <b>log</b> <b>in</b> the complex domain can be computed with some complexity, then that complexity is attainable for all other elementary functions.|$|E
