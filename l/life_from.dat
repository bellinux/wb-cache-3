5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100.

Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic <b>life</b> <b>from</b> sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E
