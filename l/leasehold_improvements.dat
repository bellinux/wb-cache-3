50|$|In most {{commercial}} real estate leases, a tenant has the obligation to restore the <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> back to a base building condition at the expiry of the lease term.|$|E
5000|$|Does the {{building}} of <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> represent an [...] "accession" [...] to wealth? If it does, is it [...] "clearly realized"? And if it is, when does that realization occur? Four possible answers can be given.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill would}} amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend through taxable years {{beginning}} before 2017: (1) the increase to $500,000 of the expensing allowance for business assets, including computer software; and (2) {{the treatment of}} qualified real property (i.e., <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvement</b> property, restaurant property, and retail improvement property) as depreciable business property.|$|R
50|$|The America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 would {{amend the}} Internal Revenue Code, {{with respect to}} the expensing {{allowance}} for depreciable business property, to make permanent: (1) the increased $500,000 expensing allowance for such property, (2) the increased $2,000,000 threshold amount for such property over which the amount of the expensing allowance is reduced, (3) expensing of computer software, and (4) rules for the expensing of qualified real property (i.e., <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvement,</b> restaurant, and retail improvement property). The bill would allow an inflation adjustment to the dollar amounts of the expensing allowance for taxable years beginning after 2014. The bill would eliminate the exclusion of air conditioning and heating units as property eligible for the expensing allowance.|$|R
50|$|Other {{commentators}} {{noted that}} if “severability” {{were to be}} considered a touchstone for the definition of income, it followed that a number of sales or exchanges of property that did not involve immediate realization through severance would not be taxable. Realizing that the “one size fits all” definition of income in Eisner v. Macomber was too broad, the U.S. Supreme Court reconsidered the idea of severability in Helvering v. Bruun. In this case, the Court addressed {{the question of whether or}} not a lessor recognizes income from the receipt of a <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvement</b> made by a lessee during the lease when the improvement reverts to the lessor at the end of the lease. In ruling that the value of the improvement was taxable, the Court noted that not every gain need be realized in cash to be taxable. There was a clear increase in the taxpayer’s wealth, and this increase did not have to be severed to recognize such increase as income for federal income tax purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Leasehold Improvements: Improvements {{made by the}} lessee. These are {{permanently}} affixed to the property, and revert to the lessor at the termination of the lease. The value of the <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> should be capitalized and depreciated over the lesser of the lease life or the <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> life. If {{the life of the}} leasehold improvement extends past the life of the initial term of the lease and into an option period, normally that option period must be considered part {{of the life of the}} lease. If the lessor gives the lessee a cash allowance for improvements, this is treated as a reduction of rent and amortized over the lease term.|$|E
50|$|In addition, shorter {{lives are}} {{provided}} for certain property, including computers and peripheral equipment, certain high technology equipment, special purpose agricultural structures, and certain other items. MACRS also excluded certain property in regulated industries, {{as well as}} films, video tapes, and sound recordings, and certain other items. Also, <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> to realty are generally treated as real property under MACRS.|$|E

The city of Troy sued the leaseholders and entered in an {{agreement}} with the county to pay the back taxes after the sale of the T-bar lift in April, which started at a minimum bid of $1,900.|$|E

Background Supporting People is a local implemented programme with funding provided via top tier local authorities Formula Grant allocation from April 2011. Supporting People enables vulnerable people to live independently through the provision of housing related support. Each top-tier local authority in England (of which there are 152) is responsible for commissioning any Supporting People services in their area and it is delivered largely by the voluntary and community sector and housing associations. Providers of housing related support are requested to complete a Client Record form every time a client starts to receive their service. Supporting People helps around one million people at any one time, including people who are homeless, with mental health problems, leaving care, at risk of domestic violence, or older with support needs. Data is recorded about clients who use housing-related support services to help understand the impact that it makes. &# 160; There are three separate Supporting People datasets in total. The Client Records dataset records information about the client {{at the point of}} starting housing related support. The Outcomes for Short-term services dataset records information about the client when they leave short-term support services (defined as less than two years in duration). The Outcomes for Long-term services dataset records information about the client who is receiving support services for two or more years in duration and it is collected on a sample basis. The Client Records & Outcomes Office has a dedicated website where anyone can log on as a visitor and use the web reporting facility to analyse data, as well as being able to view publications and articles that have used the Supporting People data. The Dataset The Supporting People Client Records dataset records information about the client at the point that they start using a Supporting People service. Information is collected by the service provider about both the nature of the service that they provide and the client receiving the support. Client information includes economic status, ethnicity, religion, client group, homelessness status, accommodation, National Insurance Number and if they are subject to requirements under an Anti-Social Behaviour Order. Whilst completion of the Client Record Forms is not mandatory, service providers may be required to complete them as part of contractual arrangements with their commissioning Administering Authority. Data was collected across all Administering Authority areas in England from 2003 / 4 to 2010 / 11, providing on average 200, 000 Client Records per year to the Supporting People Client Record and Outcomes Office; and from April 2011 includes information only from participating Administering Authorities that contracted directly with the Centre for Housing Research at the University of St Andrews, e. g. 145, 000 records in 2011 / 12. &# 160; Data derived from Client Records provide information to authorities, locating the routes by which Supporting People services are being accessed and the personal characteristics of service users. This information is essential for monitoring, reviewing and planning services in order to extend and refine the range of support provision {{to meet the needs of}} vulnerable groups and widen access. Each participating Administering Authority receives a complete dataset of Client Record information about their service providers. This enables them to analyse data from individual services. Central funding from the DCLG for the collection of Supporting People data ceased on the 31 st March 2011. From the 1 st April 2011 individual Administering Authorities have responsibility for the collection of data. The Centre for Housing Research continues to collect data from those authorities who wish to record this information with them. The Supporting People Client Records dataset started on the 1 st April 2003. People who started receiving support before this date are not included in the dataset. Data is provided by support providers throughout the year (1 st April to 31 st March) to the Client Record & Outcomes Office. The information is validated and processed and data updates are released on an annual basis (provisionally October). The dataset covers support providers in local authorities in England. A different system is operated in Scotland, which is administered by the Scottish Government, in Wales, which is administered by the Welsh Government, and also in Northern Ireland, which is administered by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Client Records data is based on the number of forms received from service providers and does not necessarily correspond to the total number of clients accessing Supporting People services within any given period. Data is checked and validated by quality assessors. Validation is carried out according to a set list of detectable errors. Error rates are monitored and where problems with the data are detected this is handled accordingly upon publication. Appropriate caution should be used when analysing this information and researchers should consult the Client Records Guidance Manual. For example, the Client Records form allows a client to be classified using one primary group and up to three secondary groups. The primary client group should describe what is identified by the service provider as the predominant need or circumstances of the client. There have been changes to the information recorded in the form over time, including the addition of new questions. In some cases categories within existing questions have been added, amended or removed. The question that has been altered most often is the one about the homeless status of the client. Please note that the Client Record dataset does not record any personal identifiers, such as the client’s name or date of birth. Although National Insurance Number information is collected, it is not available under the existing conditions of data collection agreed by the Department for Work and Pensions. Its purpose is to enable the Client Records and Outcomes Office to perform analysis on patterns of service use over time and across services and geographical areas. A new Client Records form is completed each time a person enters a housing-related support service. Therefore please be aware that someone can access several services or one service several times in any given period. The client records dataset covers people who receive the following support services&# 58; Supported housing Residential care homes (in receipt of SP / housing related support funding) Adult placements Supported lodgings Women’s refuge Foyer Teenage parent accommodation Direct access accommodation Floating support services Outreach services Resettlement services. It does not cover the following support services&# 58; Very sheltered housing Sheltered housing with warden support Alms-house Peripatetic warden services <b>Leasehold</b> scheme Home <b>Improvement</b> Agencies (HIA) Community alarm services. Anonymised data has been deposited at the UK Data Archive for 2003 / 4 to 2010 / 11 data. There is a web reporting facility freely available to all users on the Supporting People project website – this provides access to data from 2003 onwards. Research Usage and Linkage The main use of the Client Records data is to monitor access and effectiveness of Supporting People services and to examine whether the range of support needs in a particular area are being met. It can also be used by Administering Authorities working together to coordinate services regionally. The Department for Communities and Local Government used the data to report nationally on access to Supporting People services and assist in the on-going evidence base to demonstrate the value of housing related support services. And local government continues to use this data for monitoring and planning. A variety of research publications are available on the Client Record and Outcomes website covering different client groups, employment, geographical movement of clients and successful outcomes. The Supporting People Outcomes for Short-term services dataset can be linked to the Supporting People Client Records dataset using unique identifiers and other variables. This analysis at two different points in time can investigate the effectiveness and influence of support on a person’s wellbeing. </div...|$|R

50|$|For {{the sole}} {{proprietor}} {{there are a}} variety of options in obtaining financial support for their business, including loan facilities available from the U.S. Small Business Administration. The loans are not originated by the SBA, but the administration does guarantee loans made by various independent lending institutions. The primary loan facility for small businesses offered by this agency is the 7(a) loan program, designed for general applications. Sole proprietors are able to finance legitimate operating expenses; for example, working capital, furniture, <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> and building renovations.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, the Maplelawn Cafe did {{not survive}} long enough {{to allow it to}} become the {{outstanding}} restaurant it should have been. Instead, several setbacks (including the 1998 ice storm that affected all of Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec), forced the restaurant into bankruptcy. The NCC benefitted greatly from the <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> made to the house by Peter Fallis. The conversion of the property from a residence to a restaurant allowed them to lease it to another restaurant that needed to do very {{little in the way of}} improvements. In the late 1990s a couple of different businessmen took over the lease and created a franchise of The Keg restaurant, to be called the [...] "Keg Manor" [...] in the house.|$|E
50|$|Congress nullified {{the effect}} of section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932 (as {{interpreted}} by the Court in Bruun) by enacting the Revenue Act of 1942, section 115 of which included an amendment of section 22 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The effect of that amendment to the 1939 Code was carried forward in sections 109 and 1019 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (now the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). Section 109 excludes, from a lessor's income, the value of <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> realized on termination of a lease. Section 1019 denies the lessor a step-up in basis for the income so excluded. These provisions overrule the proposition announced in Bruun, that repossession of an asset with an enhanced value from a transaction with another party results in recognition of gross income.|$|E

40|$|In theory, {{the cost}} of {{investments}} in a leasehold should be recovered {{over the life of}} the improvement except where more rapid recovery is allowed for purposes of stimulating the economy 1 or a slower rate of cost recovery is intended to reduce inflationary pressures. While the costs of <b>leasehold</b> <b>improvements</b> are ordinarily recovered by the lessor or the lessee, 2 depending upon who provided the funds for the improvement, a 2009 Tax Court case has focused on another possibility – deducting {{the cost of}} the improvement made by the lessee as additional rent. 3 The critical factor is whether there is a clear showing of intent that the cost of the improvements are to be treated as rent. ...|$|E
