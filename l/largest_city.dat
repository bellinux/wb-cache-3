30|$|The {{location}} also positively moderates {{the relation}} between EO and venture performance. Firms located in the <b>larger</b> <b>city</b> are more innovative, proactive, competitive and autonomous than firms established in regional towns. These are because of high competition in the <b>large</b> <b>city,</b> which encourage firms to innovate {{a new way of}} doing things and technology that helps to produce new products, and to search for new markets. A risk is associated with activities that have good promise to return. As a result, firms in <b>larger</b> <b>cities</b> are more autonomous and risk takers. In general, firms involved with the manufacturing sector and adopting strong EO tend to perform more than their relatives. Besides, firms located in <b>larger</b> <b>cities</b> that adopt EO grow much better than enterprises established in regional towns. More specifically, the performance of ventures in <b>larger</b> <b>cities</b> is better than the ventures in regional towns because of the better practice of EO in <b>larger</b> <b>cities.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{utilize the}} {{distribution}} of PM 2. 5 concentration and population in <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> at the global scale to illustrate the relationship between urbanization and urban air quality.

PM 2. 5 concentration in <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> in North America, Europe, and Latin America showed little fluctuation or a small increasing trend, but those in Africa and India represent a "U" type relationship and in China represent an inverse "U" type relationship. 3) The potential contribution of population to PM 2. 5 concentration was higher in the <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> in China and India, but lower in other <b>large</b> <b>cities.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In this journal, Vining and Kontuly {{recently}} {{posed the}} question "Is out-migration from <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> consistent with agglomeration economy advantages that these cities are commonly said to enjoy". Previous authors who {{have responded to}} this query have supplied an indifference curve analysis that examines the trade-off individuals face between income and urban size (environmental goods). This paper instead provides a general equilibrium model that explicitly incorporates urban agglomeration economies to examine {{the conditions under which}} out-migration and those economies may simultaneously exist. Under the assumption that the elasticity of substitution between the outputs of <b>large</b> and small <b>cities</b> is unity, four cases can be distinguished. Our conclusion is that labor will unambiguously migrate from <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> with an increase in agglomeration economies only if <b>large</b> <b>city</b> goods are income-elastic and <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> are relatively capital-intensive. The more reasonable hypothesis, that out-migration is a result of shrinking productivity advantages of <b>large</b> <b>cities,</b> can also be investigated by means of this general equilibrium framework. ...|$|R
