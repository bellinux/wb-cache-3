50|$|In April 2010, the Mexican {{government}} reportedly {{reached an}} agreement to turn over its highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> to the United States.

Liquid effluents produced in the RPI, as well as effluents of medical applications are stored locally, and later discharged in accordance with national law. Solid radioactive waste and discarded sealed sources are centrally stored in the national intermediate radioactive waste storage.|$|R

MOX fuel is an alternative to <b>low</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU) fuel used in the light water reactors which predominate in nuclear power generation. MOX also provides a means of using excess weapons-grade plutonium (from military sources) to produce electricity.|$|E
25|$|During the Manhattan Project <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> {{was given}} the codename oralloy, a {{shortened}} version of Oak Ridge alloy, after {{the location of the}} plants where the <b>uranium</b> was <b>enriched.</b> The term oralloy is still occasionally used to refer to <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium.</b> There are about 2,000 tonnes (t, Mg) of highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> in the world, produced mostly for nuclear power, nuclear weapons, naval propulsion, and smaller quantities for research reactors.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the status of}} the US DOE program charged with the disposition of excess highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (HEU). Approximately 174 metric tonnes of HEU, with varying assays above 20 percent, has been declared excess from US nuclear weapons. A progress report on the identification and characterization of specific batches of excess HEU is provided, and plans for processing it into commercial nuclear fuel or low-level radioactive waste are described. The resultant quantities of <b>low</b> <b>enriched</b> fuel material expected from processing are given, as well as the estimated schedule for introducing the material into the commercial reactor fuel market. 2 figs., 3 tabs...|$|R
25|$|<b>Enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> is a {{critical}} component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons.

25|$|The {{reactors}} for Units 1, 2, and 6 were {{supplied by}} General Electric, those for Units 3 and 5 by Toshiba, and Unit 4 by Hitachi. All six reactors {{were designed by}} General Electric. Architectural design for General Electric's units was done by Ebasco. All construction was done by Kajima. Since September 2010, Unit 3 has been fueled by a small fraction (6%) of plutonium containing mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, rather than the <b>low</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU) used in the other reactors. Units 1–5 were built with Mark I type (light bulb torus) containment structures. The Mark I containment structure was slightly increased in volume by Japanese engineers. Unit 6 has a Mark II type (over/under) containment structure.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 2009 press interview, IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei said Iran has <b>low</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium,</b> but [...] "that doesn't {{mean that}} they are going {{tomorrow}} to have nuclear weapons, because {{as long as they are}} under IAEA verification, as long as they are not weaponizing, you know." [...] ElBaradei continued that there is a confidence deficit with Iran, but that the concern should not be hyped and that [...] "many other countries are enriching uranium without the world making any fuss about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A gaseous {{diffusion}} plant was built at Capenhurst, near Chester and started production in 1953 producing <b>low</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU). By 1957 it {{was capable of}} annually producing 125kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The capacity was further increased and by 1959 {{it may have been}} producing as much as 1600kg per year. [...] At the end of 1961, having produced between 3.8 and 4.9 tonnes of HEU it was switched over to LEU production for civil use. Additional plutonium production was provided by eight electricity generating Magnox reactors at Calder Hall and Chapelcross which started operating in 1956 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Kerst {{designed}} an aqueous {{homogeneous reactor}} in which <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate, was dissolved in water, and surrounded by a beryllium oxide neutron reflector. It was the first reactor to employ <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> as a fuel, and required most of the world's meager supply at the time. A sufficient quantity of <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals.|$|R

5000|$|According to the OECD Redbook, {{the world}} {{consumed}} [...] of uranium in 2002. Of that, [...] was produced from primary sources, with the balance coming from secondary sources, in particular stockpiles {{of natural and}} <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium,</b> decommissioned nuclear weapons, the reprocessing of natural and <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> and the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails.|$|R
2500|$|In 1980, the {{engineering}} technology division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory published a paper entitled [...] "Conceptual Design Characteristics of a Denatured Molten-Salt Reactor with Once-Through Fueling." [...] In it, the authors [...] "examine the conceptual feasibility of a molten-salt power reactor fueled with denatured uranium-235 (i.e. with low-enriched uranium) and operated {{with a minimum}} of chemical processing." [...] The main priority behind the design characteristics is proliferation resistance. Lessons learned from past projects and research at ORNL were considered. Although the DMSR can theoretically be fueled partially by thorium or plutonium, fueling solely with <b>low</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU) helps maximize proliferation resistance.|$|E
2500|$|In a 19 February 2009, {{report to}} the Board of Governors, IAEA Director General ElBaradei {{reported}} that Iran continued to enrich uranium contrary to {{the decisions of the}} Security Council and had produced over a ton of <b>low</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium.</b> Results of environmental samples taken by the Agency at the FEP and PFEP5 indicated that the plants have been operating at levels declared by Tehran, [...] "within the measurement uncertainties normally associated with enrichment plants of a similar throughput." [...] The Agency was also able to confirm there was no ongoing reprocessing related activities at Iran's Tehran Research Reactor and Xenon Radioisotope Production Facility.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. President Obama {{reportedly}} sent {{a letter}} dated 20 April 2010 to President Lula of Brazil, in which he outlined a proposal of fuel swap. [...] While expressing skepticism that the Iranians would now {{be willing to accept}} such a deal, having provided [...] "no credible explanation" [...] for the previous deal's rejection, President Obama wrote [...] "For us, Iran’s agreement to transfer 1,200kg of Iran’s <b>low</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU) out of the country would build confidence and reduce regional tensions by substantially reducing Iran’s LEU stockpile." [...] Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan received a similar letter. A senior U.S. official told the Washington Post that the letter was a response to Iran's desire to ship out its uranium piecemeal, rather than in a single batch, and that during [...] "multiple conversations" [...] U.S. officials made clear that Iran should also cease 20% enrichment; however, the official stated [...] "there was no president-to-president letter laying out those broader concerns".|$|E
50|$|Pressurised heavy-water {{reactors}} do {{have some}} drawbacks. Heavy water generally costs hundreds of dollars per kilogram, though this is a trade-off against reduced fuel costs. The reduced energy content of natural uranium as compared to <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> necessitates more frequent replacement of fuel; this is normally accomplished by use of an on-power refuelling system. The increased rate of fuel movement through the reactor also results in higher volumes of spent fuel than in LWRs employing <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium.</b> However, since unenriched uranium fuel accumulates a lower density of fission products than <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> fuel, it generates less heat, allowing more compact storage.|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of {{concerns}} that this plutonium would support weapons development, former IAEA Deputy Director-General for Safeguards, Olli Heinonen, proposed a reactor redesign to a reactor using slightly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> fuel rather than natural <b>uranium.</b> Use of <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> fuel combined with extended operations would reduce the reactor's ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium.|$|R
