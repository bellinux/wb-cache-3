500|$|According to {{producer}} Don Hahn, Beaumont's Belle is an [...] "incredibly passive" [...] character, {{the personality}} of whom he likened to those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, as well as American actress and animal rights activist Doris Day, describing them as women who are [...] "capable, but filling a role that women might fill in the 1950s and 1960s.” The filmmakers painstakingly reworked Belle into a more three-dimensional character by providing her with goals and aspirations beyond romance and marriage, while expanding her passive role into that of a more inquisitive heroine. Determined to have Belle resemble [...] "an unusual Disney heroine," [...] Woolverton deliberately molded her into an independent character {{who is not a}} princess, enjoys books and has little interest in marriage, and worked closely with Ashman to create a proactive heroine [...] "who was a thinker and a reader and she wasn’t about what she looked like and she wasn’t a victim." [...] Although Belle being well-read is mentioned in the original fairy tale, it is hardly important to its plot. Thus, Belle's passion for reading was vastly expanded upon, borrowing from both the <b>Little</b> <b>Woman</b> character Jo March and Woolverton's own love of reading to further demonstrate the character's intelligence and open mind. Both Woolverton and O'Hara encouraged the filmmakers to emphasize the intelligent and book-loving aspects of Belle's personality. However, at times the animators struggled to fulfill Woolverton's vision. Originally, Belle was depicted constantly crying throughout her imprisonment; Woolverton resented this, arguing that the character was {{much more likely to be}} either searching for an escape or simply [...] "be intrigued that she was living in an enchanted castle" [...] than crying. [...] "Once everybody realized she wasn’t going to be this typical Disney female, they would go to the extreme ... She became bitchy"; the screenwriter argued that Belle would be [...] "too smart" [...] to act this way. A few years older than The Little Mermaids Ariel, Belles' love of reading makes the character more worldly and mature than her predecessor. Belle is believed by Henn to be [...] "probably" [...] the oldest of Disney's princesses, at 20 years of age.|$|E

(The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some <b>little</b> <b>woman,</b> standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E

2500|$|An early American {{example is}} Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), The term thesis, or {{propaganda}} novel {{is also used}} for the latter novel, because it is [...] "strongly weighted to convert the reader to the author's stand" [...] {{on the subject of}} slavery. There is an apocryphal tale told that when Stowe met Abraham Lincoln in Washington in November 1862, the president greeted her by saying, [...] "So you are the <b>little</b> <b>woman</b> who wrote the book that started this great war." [...] Mark Twain's work Huckleberry Finn (1884) is another early American social protest novel. Much of modern scholarship of Huckleberry Finn has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism. Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim. According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and therefore resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.|$|E

A letter from Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read and its resolutions voted on. At sessions taking place September 8–10, 1852, Susan B.

Ernestine Rose spoke denouncing duties without rights, saying [...] "as a woman has to pay taxes to maintain government, she has a right to participate in the formation and administration of it." [...] Antoinette Brown called for more women to become ministers, claiming that the Bible did not forbid it. Ernestine Rose stood up in response, saying that the Bible should not be used as the authority for settling a dispute, especially as it contained much contradiction regarding women. Elizabeth Oakes Smith called for women to have their own journal so that they could become independent of the male-owned press, saying [...] "We should have a literature of our own, a printing press and a publishing house, and tract writers and distributors, as well as lectures and conventions; and yet I say this to a race of beggars, for women have no pecuniary resources."
