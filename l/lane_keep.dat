5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, <b>lane</b> <b>keep</b> assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} set of {{potential}} function components to assist an automated or semi-automated vehicle in navigating a multi-lane, populated highway. The resulting potential field is constructed as a superposition of disparate functions for lane- keeping, road-staying, speed preference, and vehicle avoidance and passing. The construction of the vehicle avoidance potential is of primary importance, incorporating the structure and protocol of laned highway driving. Particularly, {{the shape and dimensions}} of the potential field behind each obstacle vehicle can appropriately encourage control vehicle slowing and/or passing, depending on the cars' velocities and surrounding traffic. Hard barriers on roadway edges and soft boundaries between navigable <b>lanes</b> <b>keep</b> the vehicle on the highway, with a preference to travel in a lane center...|$|R

The Pre-Collision System retracted the front seatbelts and applies the brakes in certain conditions when it determines that a crash is unavoidable. <b>Lane</b> <b>Keep</b> Assist helped the driver {{stay within the}} lane. The US 2012 model year included Toyota's Vehicle Proximity Notification System (VPNS), which emitted an artificial engine noise to alert pedestrians, the blind, and others of the vehicle's presence due to significant noise reduction typical of a hybrid vehicle traveling at low speeds in all-electric mode.|$|E

25|$|The Adaptive Cruise Control {{function}} senses {{the speed}} and pace of vehicles ahead, and can automatically adjust the speed the car is traveling at accordingly to maintain one of four user selectable gaps. Pre-Collision Braking uses the same cameras to monitor {{the activity of the}} vehicles ahead, and alerts the driver visually and audibly. If the driver fails to act, more alerts will be sounded and the car will actively brake itself. According to the IIHS, the Legacy prevented a collision while traveling at 25mph towards a stopped obstacle. When the car was first released for the 2015 model year, Lane Departure with Sway warning was included in the Eyesight package. This function watched the driver's position within the lane lines, and alerted the driver if they were drifting out of the lane (if a turn signal was used, this alert was not activated), with Sway warning notified the driver if they appeared to be unable to stay centered in the lane, suggesting they may be overly drowsy. For the 2016 model year, a <b>Lane</b> <b>Keep</b> Assist was added, which applied steering torque to prevent the driver from drifting from the lane. This function is active above 40 miles an hour. Also standard on all cars with the Eyesight system are adaptive fog lights aid in turns and cornering and is based on the steering wheel degree.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLane change {{model is}} a hot issue of {{microscopic}} traffic simulation and active safety. Among current studies, most of lane change models based on vehicle kinematics hypothesize that when the vehicle of adjacent lane changes lane, the following vehicle of target <b>lane</b> <b>keeps</b> uniform motion. However, {{this hypothesis does not}} match with the real lane change scenario. In the paper we put forward a lane change model with the consideration of car following behaviour, and focus on kinematic behaviour of the lane-changing vehicle in the process of accelerated lane change. We construct a lane change scenario and derive a reasonable lane change model, and finally testify the model performance by MATLAB simulation. The results show the new lane change model is simple and reasonable, which can fit with the real lane change scenario. In addition, the proposed model can also provide some reference lane change algorithms for Intelligent Vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the success}} of her T. S. Eliot Prize-nominated Over and award-winning {{translation}} of the medieval Pearl, Jane Draycott returns with her fourth collection of poems, The Occupant. With a rhythmic subtlety and metrical poise that have become hallmarks of her verse, Draycott hints at {{the existence of a}} world of dreamlike clarity underneath our own. In the National Gallery a gardener cuts away the flower from a still-life canvas to replant in his own garden; in an abandoned sanatorium a grand piano dreams of the voices and music of days past, ‘rose-spotted paintwork peeling softly, half-moon fanlights rising, sinking’. At the heart of these imagined scenes the long title poem, ‘The Occupant’, draws on scenes proposed but left unwritten in Martinus Nijhoff’s Awater. In the stifling summer air, Draycott’s occupant trawls the streets of an unnamed city whose ‘dead <b>lanes</b> <b>keep</b> their silence’, where ‘the frail expire and pale dogs whimper’, as its police post notices: ‘Missing: Have you seen this wind?...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to provide an {{overview}} of buffer and midpoint access designs for concurrent flow, high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes that are either in operation or under study and recommended the preferred buffer and access designs for these facilities. HOT lanes are dedicated to transit, carpools and vanpools, but also allow solo drivers to use the facility for a toll when surplus capacity is available. With the application of a HOT lane facility, a single occupant vehicle (SOV) can choose to pay {{for the use of the}} surplus capacity in the lanes. Tolls are adjusted to assure that these <b>lanes</b> <b>keep</b> flowing even when the regular lanes are congested. The primary tasks completed for this report include: Research on non-barrier-separated designs, locations and designs for access points, and enforcement measures through a literature review and survey of other state agency HOT and /or HOV lane designs; Evaluation of the various design options including safety, cost, and performance; and • Documentation of the findings and design recommendations for future HOT lane facilities in the state of Washington...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Europe, {{the number}} of road crashes is {{steadily}} decreasing every year. However, the incidence of bicycle crashes is not declining as fast as that of car crashes. In Sweden, cyclists are the most frequently injured road users. Collisions between bicycles and motorized vehicles are of particular concern because the high speed and large mass of motorized vehicles create {{a high risk of}} serious injury to cyclists. In Sweden's urban areas, bicycle <b>lanes</b> <b>keep</b> bicycles separated from motorized vehicles, but on rural roads bicycle lanes are often absent, requiring drivers to interact with cyclists—usually by overtaking them. During this maneuver, drivers regulate speed and lateral position, negotiating with potential oncoming traffic to stay within their comfort zones while approaching and passing cyclists. In this study an instrumented bicycle recorded 145 overtaking maneuvers performed by car and truck drivers on public rural roads in Sweden. The bicycle was equipped with a LIDAR and two cameras to assess how drivers approached and circumvented the bicycle. The collected data allowed us to identify four overtaking phases and quantify the corresponding driver comfort zones. The presence of an oncoming vehicle was the factor that most influenced the maneuver, whereas neither vehicle speed, lane width, shoulder width nor posted speed limit significantly affected the driver comfort zone or the overtaking dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of lane changes {{has been proven}} to be useful for collision avoidance support in road vehicles.

Extended Kalman filters (EKFs) running in parallel and integrated by an IMM-based algorithm provide positioning and maneuver predictions to the user.
