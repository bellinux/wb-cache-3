Gates married in 1871 to Helen Melvina Batcheller, and they had three children, Oliver, Helen, and Samuel. In 1880, he worked for the Northern Pacific Railway where he was responsible for the locating party through the Cascade Range. The next year Gates started working for the Oregon & Pacific Railroad in Corvallis, first as their <b>locater</b> then as superintendent of construction, and in 1886 he was the railroad's superintendent. Gates continued to work for the railroads, and was responsible for the construction of over 2,000 miles of track from 1891 until 1922. He worked for the Union Pacific Railroad as superintendent of construction from 1887 until 1891 when he moved to Hillsboro, Oregon. Gates was also the chief engineer for the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company for a time.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increased}} responsibility for the end-of-life (EOL) treatments of products by the manufacturers, the ease of disassembly has become a key design issue for mass-produced products. As {{an extension of the}} conventional design for disassembly (DFD), this paper presents a computational method for designing assemblies that can be disassembled only in specified sequences. Given an ideal disassembly sequence that maximizes the profit in the absence of geometric constraints, the method simultaneously determines the spatial configurations of components, <b>locaters,</b> and joints, such that disassembly can occur only in the sequence. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is utilized to search for Pareto-optimal designs in terms of the unique realization of the given disassembly sequence, the satisfaction of distance specifications among components, and the efficient use of locators on components. A case study on a simplified laptop computer assembly demonstrates the effectiveness of the metho...|$|R

Even the Mansion House was dismantled, and the Wingdam stage deserted the highway for a shorter cut by Quicksilver City.

40|$|Reactive power compensation, using series {{capacitors}} unit (SCU) in {{high voltage}} power transmission {{is widely used}} to improve {{the efficiency of the}} power transfer between transmission networks. However, such applications affect the design and application of devices such as fault <b>locaters</b> and protection schemes in transmission networks. This seems {{to be one of the}} most difficult tasks for manufactures, operators and maintenance engineers. This paper introduces a new simple fault location algorithm, based on the measurement of instantaneous 3 -phase voltage and current signals, from one end of the transmission line, to estimate the location of a fault in series compensated transmission lines. The new algorithm does not require synchronisation of fault data, which is difficult to achieve from both ends of the transmission line, during the fault. The performance of the new algorithm has been evaluated for different types of faults. Statistical analysis on the results indicates that for most fault applied, the distance to fault can be estimated with high accuracy...|$|R

40|$|In {{machining}} process, fixture {{is used to}} {{keep the}} position and orientation of a workpiece with respect to machine tool frame. However, the workpiece always cannot be at its ideal position because of the setup error and geometric inaccuracy of the locators, clamping force, cutting force, and so on. It is necessary to predict and control the workpiece locating error which will result in machining error of parts. This paper presents a prediction model of a workpiece locating error caused by the setup error and geometric inaccuracy of <b>locaters</b> for the fixtures with one locating surface and two locating pins. Error parameters along {{6 degrees of freedom}} can be calculated by the proposed model and then compensated by either using the “frame transformation” function of a numerical control (NC) system or modifying NC codes in post-processing. In addition, machining error caused by the workpiece locating error can be predicted based on a multi-body system and homogeneous transfer matrix. This is meaningful to fixture design and machining process planning. Finally, a cutting test has shown that the proposed method is practicable and effective...|$|R

He was certainly very good-looking, but not quite as picturesque, mysterious, and thrilling as in the dark! And it was very queer--he certainly did look darker that night! Who was he?

He {{might be one of}} those <b>locaters,</b> from the big towns, who prospect the lands, with a view of settling government warrants on them,--they were always so secret until they had found what they wanted. She did not dare to seek information of her friends, {{for the same reason that}} she had concealed his existence from her mother,--it would provoke awkward questions; and it was evident that he was trusting to her secrecy, too. The thought thrilled her with a new pride, and was some compensation for the loss of her more intangible romance. It would be mighty fine, when he did call openly for his beautiful knife and declared himself, to have them all know that SHE knew about it all along.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the robust reading competitions for ICDAR 2003. With {{the rapid growth}} in research {{over the last few}} years on recognizing text in natural scenes, there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark datasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text images that are beyond the capabilities of current commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust reading problem into three sub-problems, and run competitions for each stage, and also a competition for the best overall system. The sub-problems we chose were text locating, character recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the problem in this way, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in each of the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involved storing detailed results of applying each algorithm to each image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study in depth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The text locating contest was the only one to have any entries. We give a brief description of each entry, and present the results of this contest, showing cases where the leading entries succeed and fail. We also describe an algorithm for combining the outputs of the individual text <b>locaters,</b> and show how the combination scheme improves on any of the individual systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{consequences}} of dislocation for studio arts-practice. I recently found myself in Perth, far from my home of 20 years and with directional vertigo, looking east to my old life and west to the Indian Ocean. In order {{to make sense of}} this move I used the studio to resolve/recollect/ trace my sense of movement, change, loss and vertigo. The multiple departures and arrivals on this journey are articulated as catalysts to studio production. We rarely speak about the spaces between such departures and arrivals and the effects those spaces have on the lived body. The space between in this instance was a road trip from the East to the West Coast of Australia. Traces of those departures and arrivals – (that always being between destinations) while evading the dichotomy of here or there and metaphors of inside and outside informed the studio processes entered into. The studio can be understood in this context as an instrument of phenomenological subjectivity in the world because our embodiment is premised on the mutually constituted agency of the self/other, or self in/of the world. The resultant bodies of work are described not as objects but as artefacts of arts-practice-led-research; as <b>locaters</b> of embodied knowledge; as traces of the performance of making. Through studio practice, an active material conversation occurs between ideas, the accumulated flotsam and jetsam of the studio, bodies and images...|$|R
