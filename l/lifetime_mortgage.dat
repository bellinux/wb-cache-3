50|$|A {{resurgence}} in the equity release {{market has been}} the introduction of interest-only lifetime mortgages. Where an interest-only mortgage has a fixed term, an interest-only <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgage</b> will continue {{for the rest of}} the mortgagors life. These schemes have proved of interest to people who do like the roll-up effect (compounding) of interest on traditional equity release schemes.They have also proved beneficial to people who had an interest-only mortgage with no repayment vehicle and now need to settle the loan. These people can now effectively remortgage onto an interest-only <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgage</b> to maintain continuity.|$|E

50|$|Interest-only <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgage</b> schemes {{are offered}} by two lenders {{currently}} - Stonehaven & more2life.

This market is set to increase as more retirees require finance in retirement.|$|E
50|$|These {{arrangements}} are variously called reverse <b>mortgages,</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgages</b> or equity release mortgages (referring to home equity), {{depending on the}} country. The loans are typically not repaid until the borrowers are deceased, hence the age restriction.|$|R

50|$|The UK equity release {{market is}} now fully regulated. Both <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgages</b> and home {{reversion}} plans now {{fall under the}} remit of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Prior to FCA regulation, many lenders signed up to Equity Release Council (ERC) formerly known as Safe Home Income Plans (SHIP), a voluntary code of conduct that provides a number of guarantees.|$|R
50|$|The UK equity release {{market is}} {{basically}} {{made up of}} two types of equity release plan. The most popular plan is a <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgage</b> - where the homeowner retains ownership of the property but the property is charged with the repayment of a loan or mortgage, which accrues rolled-up interest over {{the period of the}} homeowner's lifetime. To help customers decide whether equity release is right for them, a number of companies provide a free equity release calculator to show a rough estimate of the amount of equity that could be released.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} optimal {{recursive}} refinancing problem where a borrower minimizes his <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgage</b> costs by repeatedly refinancing when rates drop sufficiently. Key factors affecting the optimal decision are {{the cost of}} refinancing {{and the possibility that}} the mortgagor may have to refinance at a premium rate because of his credit. The optimal recursive strategy often results in prepayment being delayed significantly relative to traditional models. Furthermore, mortgage values can exceed par by much more than the cost of refinancing. Applying the recursive model to an extensive sample of mortgage-backed security prices, we find that the implied credit spreads that match these prices closely parallel borrowers' actual spreads at the origination of the mortgage. These results suggest that optimal recursive models may provide a promising alternative to the reduced-form prepayment models widely used in practice. ...|$|E
50|$|Mortgage life {{insurance}} {{is supposed to}} protect the borrower's ability to repay the <b>mortgage</b> for the <b>lifetime</b> of the <b>mortgage.</b> This {{is in contrast to}} Private mortgage insurance, which is meant to protect the lender against the risk of default {{on the part of the}} borrower.|$|R
40|$|In product {{pricing and}} reserving, actuaries are often {{required}} to make predictions of future death rates. In the past, this has been performed by using deterministic improvement scales that give only a single mortality trajectory. However, there is enormous likelihood that future death rates {{will turn out to}} be different from the projected ones, and so a better assessment of longevity risk would be one that consists of both a mean estimate and a measure of uncertainty. Such assessment can be performed using a stochastic mortality model, which is the core of this thesis. The Lee-Carter model is one of the most popular stochastic mortality models. While it does an excellent job in mean forecasting, it has been criticized for providing overly narrow prediction intervals that may have underestimated uncertainty. This thesis mitigates this problem by relaxing the assumption on the distribution of death counts. We found that the generalization from Poisson to negative binomial is equivalent to allowing gamma heterogeneity within each age-period cells. The proposed extension gives not only a better fit, but also a more conservative prediction interval that may reflect better the uncertainty entailed. The proposed extension is then applied to the construction of mortality improvement scales for Canadian insured lives. Given that the insured lives data series are too short for a direct Lee-Carter projection, we build an extra relational model that could borrow strengths from the Canadian population data, which covers a far longer period. The resultant scales consist of explicit measures of uncertainty. The prediction of the tail of a survival distribution requires a special treatment due to the lack of high quality old-age mortality data. We utilize the asymptotic results in modern extreme value theory to extrapolate death probabilities to the advanced ages, and to statistically determine the age at which the life table should be closed. Such technique is further integrated with the Lee-Carter model to produce a stochastic analysis of old-age mortality, and a prediction of the highest attained age for various cohorts. The mortality models we considered are further applied to the valuation of mortality-related financial products. In particular we investigate the no-negative-equity-guarantee that is offered in most fixed-repayment <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgages</b> in Britain. The valuation of such guarantee requires a simultaneous consideration of both longevity and house price inflation risk. We found that house price returns can be well described by an ARMA-EGARCH time-series process. Under an ARMA-EGARCH process, however, the Black-Scholes formula no longer applies. We derive our own pricing formula based on the conditional Esscher transformation. Finally, we propose some possible hedging and capital reserving strategies for managing the risks associated with the guarantee...|$|R

40|$|The latest global {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the need for}} financial services firms to adopt comprehensive risk management techniques to identify, manage and mitigate risks promptly and efficiently. To this end, a key risk management tool is to hold sufficient capital to back the risks a business is running. In recent times, financial services regulators have also initiated a move towards risk-based economic capital approach with different regulations for banks (Basel 2 and 3) and insurance firms (Solvency 2). In this paper, a generic definition of economic capital is proposed using a stochastic approach, which is then used to quantify economic capital for a capital repayment mortgage, a <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgage,</b> a life insurance annuity and a conglomerate operating a range of financial services. The paper highlights economic capital as a risk management tool that unifies capital calculation techniques across all financial services firms and conglomerates, irrespective of their line of operation...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of new risk-based {{regulations}} for financial services firms, specifically Basel 2 for banks and Solvency 2 for insurers, {{there is now a}} heightened focus on the practical implementation of quantitative risk management techniques for firms operating within the financial services industry. In particular, financial services firms are now expected to self assess and quantify the amount of capital that they need, to cover the risks they are running. This self-assessed quantum of capital is commonly termed risk, or economic, capital. Economic capital has the potential to make financial services firms more risk-aware in their capital management, enabling investors and regulators to easily compare financial strength and profitability across business lines and sectors. The first part of the presentation is based on Srinivasan and Tapadar (2008) and Porteous and Tapadar (2005). It focuses on the implementation of economic capital techniques to show how economic capital can be calculated for companies offering different financial products with varying risk profiles. A stochastic approach, using graphical models, is used in conjunction with examples of a capital repayment mortgage, a <b>lifetime</b> <b>mortgage</b> and a life insurance annuity product. This will demonstrate economic capital as a tool that not only meets the needs of all interested parties, but also unifies capital calculation techniques across all financial services firms, irrespective of their line of operation. The second half of the presentation is based on Porteous and Tapadar (2008) which advances the techniques further to quantify the impact of capital structure and capital asset allocation on a firm's economic capital and risk adjusted performance. It is demonstrated that under certain circumstances, gearing up Tier 1 capital with Tier 2 capital can be {{in the interests of the}} firms' Tier 1 capital providers. The technique is again generic and can be applied to any financial services firm...|$|E
