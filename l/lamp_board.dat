Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 37). The project aims at the design {{and the construction of}} a laboratory replica for a commercial numerical over current relay using microcontroller and micro CT. It will acquire, sample and covert into digital form the analog current signals from a power system in real time. Then it simulates the working principles of a conventional electromechanical over current relay in through a numerical (mathematical) model. Appropriate equations and algorithm have been used. When a current in a part of a power system exceeds a pre-set value either due to a fault or a large overload the relay will isolate the part through sending trip signal to a circuit breaker. In the developed laboratory model, the system is assembled by a <b>lamp</b> <b>board</b> and the circuit breaker is simulated by a hardware solid state (MOSFET) switch. The constructed relay has been tested extensively for various values of load current and two different tripping characteristics (Inverse Definite Minimum Time: IDMT and Definite Time Lag: DTL) have been verified. The project is expected to help students acquire skills in digital logic circuits design and implementation, and applying it in a power system for isolating the faulty part. As commercial numerical relay is expensive, so we have developed for lab demonstration a prototype using cheap and off-the-shelf components to show the working procedures of a numerical over current relay in a power system. The project will also help students develop hands-on skill on numerical relay and enrich their knowledge on the working principle of a relay-breaker combination circuit. Md Rayhanul Amin RumiS. M.

In April 2003, Toyota made the Appearance Package, {{along with the}} previously optional fog <b>lamps,</b> running <b>boards,</b> and 16-inch aluminum wheels, standard on the SR5. The Sport Edition also added black running boards and color-keyed trim, replacing the grey cladding and silver-painted grille, door handles and liftgate trim.|$|R

50|$|When {{production}} {{began in}} 1919 an electric starter would be supplied {{for an extra}} £50 though it was standard on Vauxhall's 25 hp car. But Vauxhall did make no separate charge for: electric lighting, a clock, speedometer, spare wheel and tyre, full tool kit and number plates. Customers could choose between a bonnet of plain polished aluminium or have it painted to match {{the rest of the}} car. Advertisements for the OE when introduced in 1922 noted the electric lighting now included six <b>lamps,</b> an instrument <b>board</b> <b>lamp</b> and gauges together with both an electric horn and a bulb horn. By 1927 the advertised equipment was limited to: bucket-shaped front seats adjustable for leg room; wire wheels and Dunlop cord tyres, two spare wheels and tyres; spring gaiters; luggage grid and windscreen wiper (singular).|$|R

50|$|Kronprinz Wilhelm was {{launched}} on 30 March 1901 and started her transatlantic maiden voyage on 17 September 1901 from Bremerhaven via Southampton and Cherbourg to New York. She {{was one of}} the fastest and most luxurious liners on the North Atlantic and stayed on that run until 1914. The ship had a Marconi telegraph, electric central heating and 1,900 electric <b>lamps</b> on <b>board.</b> About 60 electric motors worked bridge cranes, fans, elevators, refrigerators and auxiliary machinery. Kronprinz Wilhelm had a control panel in the map room to close or open the 20 watertight doors. If a door was closed, this was shown by a lamp. This security system alone needed 3.2 km of special cables and 1.2 km of normal cables. At one point in 1907 the ship rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but was still able to complete her voyage.|$|R
50|$|The first {{railway station}} in the centre of Gdynia opened on 1 January 1894. Initially it was a railway station with a small wooden waiting room, several <b>lamps</b> and a <b>board</b> {{with the name of}} the city. In 1920, Gdynia grew as a city and a port, {{resulting}} in a significant increase in passenger traffic. Therefore, in the years 1923-1926, a new, brick and imposing building, designed by Romuald Miller, was built which opened on July 15, 1926. In its interiors was a waiting room, toilets, luggage storage, restaurant, bookstore, money exchange and hairdresser.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to these, certain modern instruments are automated, referring to motorized movement {{of either the}} entire fixture body or the movement of a mirror {{placed in front of}} its outermost lens. These fixtures and the more traditional follow spots add direction and motion to the relevant characteristics of light. Automated fixtures fall into either the [...] "moving head" [...] or [...] "moving mirror/scanner" [...] category. Scanners have a body which contains the <b>lamp,</b> circuit <b>boards,</b> transformer, and effects (color, gobo, iris etc.) devices. A mirror is panned and tilted in the desired position by pan and tilt motors, thereby causing the light beam to move. Moving head fixtures have the effects and lamp assembly inside the head with transformers and other electronics in the base or external ballast. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Scanners are typically faster and less costly than moving head units but have a narrower range of movement. Moving head fixtures have a much larger range of movement as well as a more natural inertial movement but are typically more expensive.|$|R

50|$|The Rother Valley Railway {{opened a}} small {{platform}} at Junction Road in 1900 as an informal private stopping {{place for the}} benefit of the tenant of the adjoining fields who enjoyed shooting rights over the land. The station was situated on the eastern side of a level crossing adjacent to Udiam Farm on the turnpike road from Hawkhurst to Hastings called Junction Road (now part of the B2244 road). The crossing was originally gated but cattle grids were later provided. The existence of the platform was discovered by the Board of Trade in January 1903 during an inspection of the line by Major Pringle who had stopped at the site to examine the new cattle grids. After the inspection, Colonel Stephens, the proprietor of the Rother Valley Railway, wrote to the Board of Trade to obtain permission to open the halt to the public. The station would be unstaffed and trains would only call as required. The Board of Trade indicated its willingness to authorise the halt so long as the railway provided suitable lights for trains calling in the hours of darkness. Despite Stephens' reply that guards would be instructed to aid passengers with a hand <b>lamp,</b> the <b>Board</b> of Trade still insisted on lights.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signalling}} system is normally permissive: {{the driver of}} a train is permitted to proceed into an occupied block section without first obtaining authorisation. Speed is limited to 30 km/h, and if it exceeds 35 km/h the emergency brake is applied. If the board marking {{the entrance to the}} block section is accompanied by a sign marked Nf, non-franchissable (non-passable) the block section is not permissive, and the driver must obtain authorisation from the PAR, [...] "Poste d'Aiguillage et de Régulation" [...] (Signalling and Control Centre), before entering. Once a route is set or the PAR has provided authorisation, a white <b>lamp</b> above the <b>board</b> is lit to inform the driver. The driver acknowledges the authorisation by a button on the control panel. This disables the emergency braking, which would otherwise occur when passing over the ground loop adjacent to the Nf board.|$|R
5000|$|The refit at Wabtec saw {{the trains}} undergo {{corrosion}} correction work, to repair damage {{as a result}} of the trains' steel and aluminium construction, new seating, flooring and interior finish, in addition to improved saloon and emergency lighting. A new larger wheelchair space has also been created at the end of each car, featuring a [...] "call for assistance" [...] device. Other minor modifications include improved door seals, more concise interior signage and removal of the green <b>boarding</b> <b>lamps</b> to facilitate new audio warning equipment for door operation. Some Metrocars also featured air conditioning boxes at their A end to control the conditions within the drivers cab, these were later removed from the units due to OHLE clearance issues if trains were to be placed on wheelskates. Passenger counters were integrated above doors to help Nexus analyse trends in passenger levels. These features were removed from the specification midway through the refurbishment however.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} improbability of landfall {{in the days}} preceding the storm's passage, the West Palm Beach chapter of the American Red Cross began preparing for the storm. Dr. William J. Buck, likely the only doctor between Pahokee and Moore Haven and also president of the Belle Glade town council {{and the founder of}} the town's American Legion post, was skeptical of the Weather Bureau's predictions of the storm missing South Florida. He and his legionnaires warned residents in the Lake Okeechobee region of the approaching cyclone. At South Bay, Frank Schuster made several car trips to save 211 people by transporting them to higher ground. The Seminoles at the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Glades County evacuated to higher ground after observing retreating wildlife. Hours before the storm made landfall, many in the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee either crowded into a house or evacuated to the building they believed was securest, such as the Belle Glade Hotel, the Glades Hotel, and Henry Martin's store in Belle Glade, with the Glades Hotel sheltering 20 people and the Belle Glade Hotel having nearly 150 refugees. About 500 people in Lake Worth were sheltered inside the Gulf Stream Hotel during the storm. In West Palm Beach, food and thousands of candles, kerosene <b>lamps,</b> and <b>boards</b> were sold on September 16. A number of residents boarded up their homes and then secured their ornamental trees and plants. At the building then being used as the Palm Beach County Courthouse, approximately 500 people sought shelter inside. In Jupiter, 20 people sought refuge in a grocery store, while 25 others stayed at a newly constructed elementary school. A number of African Americans took shelter in a school building in West Jupiter.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} devoted to the education of children and {{students with visual impairments and}} other concurrent disabilities in the mainstream education. It is essential to note that I have not included the pupils with mental disabilities into the target group of this thesis, mainly because of the reason, that in case of the mental disability, the way of the education is being changed. The theoretical part is divided into three chapters. The first chapter focuses on the presentation of individual types of disabilities. The second chapter deals with the integration and its legislation, other ways of the education of students with visual impairments and concurrent disabilities and information about teacher assistants. The third chapter contains specifics of the education in particular types of disabilities (visual, auditory and physical disabilities and attention deficit disorders) and specifics of the education in the combination of the visual and other concurrent disabilities. Those impairments were chosen in connection with the practical part of the bachelor thesis. The practical part of the thesis has been defined by research objectives. The main objective is to analyse the education process at the pupils with the visual impairments and other concurrent disabilities in the mainstream education. To achieve this main objective, I chose three sub-goals. The first sub-goal is focused on the organization of lessons for the children with visual impairments and other concurrent disabilities in the mainstream education. With the help of the second research goal, I tried to find out the method of the teacher assistants´ preparation for the educational process and the third sub-goal deals with the motivation, experience and education of the teacher assistants. To meet the objectives of the practical part I chose qualitative methods of the data collection, i. e. structured interviews with open-ended questions, observations and document analysis. Most questions were posed to the teacher assistants in the interviews, then there were interviewed the teachers, especially classroom teachers and teacher of selected subjects. Those subjects were: Czech language, a foreign language, Mathematics and some of the subjects like Geography or History and some of the educational activities. Further there were made observations of the pupils with visual impairments and concurrent disabilities in their classes; they were held in preliminary specified lessons. The last used method was an analysis of the documents, specifically of the individual educational plans for four selected pupils with visual and concurrent disabilities, who are educated at the elementary or secondary mainstream schools. The target group of the bachelor thesis consists of four chosen pupils with visual impairment and other concurrent disabilities, their teachers and the teacher assistants. The research results show that the education of pupils with the visual impairment and other concurrent disabilities is possible at the adaptation of material, labour, pro-social conditions, in respect to a psycho-motoric pace of the pupils and with set rules for their stay in the classroom and in the resting place of the pupils with visual and other concurrent disabilities. As the adapted conditions there are meant modified materials enlarged texts, textbooks or overwriting of original texts and textbooks in the Braille writing. Furthermore, it is also a modification of the working environment of the pupils with visual impairments by using suitably positioned folding benches or benches with folding <b>boards,</b> <b>lamps</b> to illuminate the text and for the pupils with severe visual impairments, placing guide-lines, if they need them for their movement. Conditions must be adapted as well as to other concurrent disabilities that limit the individual even more. These include for example an orthopaedic chair, an adequate height of the working surface, a barrier-free access to school...|$|R
