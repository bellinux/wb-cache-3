5000|$|For {{the first}} coat {{a layer of}} well-haired coarse stuff, about 1 inch thick, is put on with the <b>laying</b> <b>trowel.</b> This is termed [...] "pricking up" [...] in London, and in America [...] "scratch coating". It should be laid on diagonally, each trowelful {{overlapping}} the previous one. When on laths the stuff should be plastic enough to be worked through the spaces between the laths to form a key, yet so firm as not to drop off. The surface while still soft is scratched with a lath to give a key for the next coat. In Scotland {{this part of the}} process is termed [...] "straightening" [...] and in America [...] "browning", and is performed when the first coat is dry, so as to form a straight surface to receive the finishing coat.|$|E
