5|$|In 1994, {{she first}} met Trinny Woodall {{at a party}} hosted by David, Viscount Linley. Though they did not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> other at first, the two women {{proceeded}} to write Ready to Wear, a weekly style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran successfully for seven years. The column promoted affordable high-street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure. Constantine and Woodall also became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com, but the business venture failed, and investors subsequently lost a reputed Â£10 million.|$|E

When she sees Donna Freedman practising the kissing scene with Zeke, Sunny becomes upset. Sunny and Zeke almost share a kiss one night when they are alone.

Karl realises that Sunny and Zeke <b>like</b> <b>each</b> other and he tries to keep them apart. However, they eventually start a relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 1308, Edward's {{marriage}} to Isabella of France proceeded. Edward crossed the English Channel to France in January, leaving Gaveston as his custos regni {{in charge of}} the kingdom in his absence. This arrangement was unusual, and involved unprecedented powers being delegated to Gaveston, backed by a specially engraved Great Seal. Edward probably hoped that the marriage would strengthen his position in Gascony and bring him much needed funds. The final negotiations, however, proved challenging: Edward and Philip IV did not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> other, and the French King drove a hard bargain over the size of Isabella's dower and the details of the administration of Edward's lands in France. As part of the agreement, Edward gave homage to Philip for the Duchy of Aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete the implementation of the 1303 Treaty of Paris.|$|E
5|$|In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru {{appears to}} both Kyo and Iori, asking that {{they form a}} team to {{investigate}} suspicious activities concerning the Orochi seal. During the investigation, the team is ambushed by the fighter Ash Crimson who plans to get their clans' powers, and steal them from Chizuru. In The King of Fighters XI, Kyo and Iori once again form a team with Shingo filling Chizuru's spot to stop Ash. However, the growing presence of the Orochi causes Iori to go berserk, forcing him to harm his teammates. Ash then appears and steals Iori's abilities after defeating him. In King of Fighters XII, Kyo is a playable character, but <b>like</b> <b>each</b> of them, {{he does not have}} a team. Kyo reunites with the original members of the Esaka Team in The King of Fighters XIII. Additionally, an alternative version of himself, with different moves called NESTS Style Kyo, is available as downloadable content.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Henry rebuilt his {{alliance}} with Fulk of Anjou, {{this time by}} marrying Matilda to Fulk's eldest son, Geoffrey. The pair were betrothed in 1127 and married the following year. It is unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping his son-in-law's status deliberately uncertain. Similarly, although Matilda was granted a number of Normandy castles {{as part of her}} dowry, it was not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. Fulk left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine. The marriage proved difficult, as the couple did not particularly <b>like</b> <b>each</b> other and the disputed castles proved a point of contention, resulting in Matilda returning to Normandy later that year. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but in 1131 the couple were reconciled. Much to the pleasure and relief of Henry, Matilda then gave birth to a sequence of two sons, Henry and Geoffrey, in 1133 and 1134.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} proved difficult, as {{the couple}} did not particularly <b>like</b> <b>each</b> other. There was a further dispute over Matilda's dowry; she was granted various castles in Normandy by Henry, {{but it was}} not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. It is also unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping Geoffrey's status deliberately uncertain. Soon after the marriage, Matilda left Geoffrey and returned to Normandy. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but the couple were finally reconciled in 1131. Henry summoned Matilda from Normandy, and she arrived in England that August. It was decided that Matilda would return to Geoffrey {{at a meeting of the}} King's great council in September. The council also gave another collective oath of allegiance to recognise her as Henry's heir.|$|E
5|$|In The King of Fighters '99 Iori is {{a secret}} {{character}} in most versions of the game. Iori can be faced as a bonus fight {{in the end of}} the game if the player manages to get a high score. In the story, Iori discovers the creation of Kyo clones and enters the annual tournament where he finds those responsible, an organization named NEST. Iori follows the battles in secret and fights against the Nests' agents to continue his fight against Kyo. An assistant version of his character, named Striker, also appears for Iori in The King of Fighters 2000 but with an outfit based on his illustrations from artbooks. In The King of Fighters 2001, an agent named Seth invites Iori to join his team for the next King of Fighters tournament, presuming that he would get his shot against Kyo. While his regular form appears in KOF 2002, his Orochi form is also featured in the PlayStation 2 port from the game as well as the remake of KOF '98. In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru appears to both Kyo and Iori, requesting that they form a team and investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi seal. During the investigation, the team is ambushed by the fighter Ash Crimson, who plans to get the power from the descendants of the clans who sealed Orochi and steals the ones from Chizuru. In the following video game, Iori and Kyo form a team once again with Kyo's student Shingo Yabuki to fill Chizuru's spot to stop Ash. At the end of the tournament, the strengthening presence of Orochi causes Iori to enter the Riot of Blood state, in which he attacks his comrades. Ash appears afterward and defeats Iori, stealing his powers. Iori is a playable character in The King of Fighters XII. Iori is featured with a different outfit, and with a new moveset, that does not use purple flames. <b>Like</b> <b>each</b> character, he does not have a team. Iori's appearance in The King of Fighters XIII sees him teamed with his former team members from the 1996 tournament, Mature and Vice, who return as spirits. He recovers his flames in his ending and appears as downloadable content in this form. He is set to return in the upcoming The King of Fighters XIV, and he is also the one who tracked Orochi's weakened body in the middle of Hungary when Verse's destructions scatters every revived souls including Orochi and Ash who were sealed inside the monster's across the globe after the tournament is over, thus sealing the weakened snake with the help from Kyo and Chizuru immediately.|$|E

Both men were blunt, and although the Germans and Spanish did not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> other, they had a healthy respect which translated into {{an effective}} working relationship.

25|$|The way a DP can bind {{given this}} domain {{depends on the}} kind of that DP that is being bound. Anaphors (reflexives pronouns like herself and reciprocals <b>like</b> <b>each</b> other) must be bound in their domain, meaning they must have a c-commanding {{antecedent}} in their domain. Pronouns (such as she or he) must not be bound in their domain, meaning they cannot have a c-commanding antecedent in their domain. Finally, R-expressions (such as proper names, descriptions, or epithets) must not be bound, meaning they must not have a c-commanding antecedent at all.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, a {{psychologist}} named Ross Stagner asked {{a number of}} personnel managers to take a personality test.

More than half described the assessment as accurate, and almost none described it as wrong.|$|E
