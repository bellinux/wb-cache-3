If you could visualize {{all the things we}} don't see, Earth could look <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea I have in my head– surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships." [...] Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's.

At the end, when Goodman says that he is a prisoner of his own mental state, that this is <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hell, it was necessary for the hotel to have already suggested something infernal." [...] The peeling wallpaper and the paste which seeps through it also mirror Charlie's chronic ear infection and the resultant pus.|$|E

500|$|The show {{received}} a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were {{more critical of}} the show. Columnist Jerry Roberts of the Daily Breeze remarked [...] "The whole mess was <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> geek show from a carnival row that had incestuously multiplied itself into a gargantuan sequin-lined ego battle royal accompanied by a firestorm of ballyhooing." [...] Despite Chase and Hawn's best efforts to liven up the broadcast, he commented, [...] "The lumbering procedure completely defeated them." [...] Television critic Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "As usual, the Academy Awards show was marked by missed cues, noisy moving scenery, plunging necklines, inane scripted chatter and, as has often happened in recent years, few galvanizing or gratifying surprises." [...] He also quipped that the segment showcasing the Best Costume Design nominees slowed down the ceremony's pace. The Philadelphia Inquirers film critic Carrie Rickey observed, [...] "As pace goes, the Academy Awards show was like watching a race between slugs and snails." [...] She later wrote, [...] "Oscarsclerosis is the show's most critical condition, {{the result of a}} telecast larded, once again, with too many Vegas-style production numbers." ...|$|E
500|$|Likewise, Mike Diver of BBC Online {{reviewed}} the album positively, praising the narrating {{story of the}} performances, calling it [...] "polished, [...] professional". Diver further noted that Beyoncé's vocals [...] "peak and dip, tremble and roar, mercifully without ever hitting Mariah Carey levels of skull-rattling intensity". He added that the album would look predictable {{because it was an}} [...] "entirely second-guessable affair with each movement telegraphed and every realigned arrangement (bombast turned down, jazz and funk switched up) meeting the listener's expectations head on". The Huffington Posts Mike Ragogna compared Beyoncé with Diana Ross during the concert, adding, [...] "Beyoncé's I Am...Yours is a satisfying decade-and-then-some retrospective that reveals the artist's interesting back story with a personal warmth". Nate Chinen of The New York Times noted that the album documents a smaller show than the other ones Beyoncé usually makes. He further stated, [...] "But the stagecraft — wind machines, lasers, arena lighting — keeps a viewer at a worshipful remove... Of course Beyoncé has always fared better with declaration than with disclosure, framing her sentiments as actions. Still, the old-fashioned extravagance of this production... feels <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> honesty: it's a sincere gesture from a show-business savant." ...|$|E

Shone asks [...] "Why {{is a new}} sequel to Less Than Zero... so moving?", noting the presence of [...] "feelings" [...] in the novel to be starkly different from Ellis' usual style. Touching on its personal qualities, Shone notes [...] "If Lunar Park unspooled the atrocities of American Psycho back to their source, Imperial Bedrooms pulls the thread further and reaches Less Than Zero". The emotive energy {{in the new book}} is traced back to the last pages of Lunar Park as well; fellow writer Jay McInerney observes that [...] "The last few pages of [...] are among the most moving passages I know in recent American fiction ... Bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book." [...] Vice observes that the [...] "final passages in both Imperial Bedrooms and Lunar Park pack a lot of emotional impact." [...] San Francisco Chronicle hails Imperial Bedrooms as [...] "the very definition of authorly meta: Ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can't write his way out of it, or else he is such a genius that he's created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Escher print." ...|$|E

The technique is especially suited for desktop and portable virtual reality applications—applications that do not use special rooms or equipment but only twodimensional displays and simple pointing devices for interaction with the virtual environment. Our system solves the difficult problem of controlling the movements of a highly articulated, 3 D avatar using a common input device within the context of an office or other real world environment...|$|R

5000|$|The {{edible fruit}} of Syzygium jambos is shaped <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> guava; in fact, the fruit is so like the guava in {{appearance}} that people unfamiliar with it may mistake {{it for a}} guava on sight. However, the fragrance, flavour and texture are different, and instead of containing dozens of small, hard seeds set in a jelly-like tissue, as a guava does, the fruit of Syzygium jambos usually contains one or two large, unarmoured seeds about a cm in diameter, lying loose in a slightly fluffy cavity when ripe. Shaking a fruit to feel whether the seeds rattle, gives some indication whether it is ripe. The skin is thin and waxy. The flowers are described by some as fragrant, though {{this appears to be}} a variable attribute. The ripe fruit, however, has a strong, pleasant floral bouquet, hence such common names as [...] "Rose apple" [...] and [...] "pomarrosa".|$|R
30|$|The HAp is {{well known}} as {{eco-friendly}} biomaterials and widely applied for industrial products, e.g., dental powder, bone-repairing or bone-replacing material. Since the HAp is water-insoluble material, it has a potential {{to be used as}} a fixative in wood preservative formulations. In the previous studies of wood-HAp combining, the HAp was used as fixatives of the antibacterial metal ions within woods [9], and it was also synthesized and fixed on the surface of modified bamboo with the phosphorylation methods [10]. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the HAp contains a phosphoric component <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> fireproof agents; therefore, by combining with the HAp, the treated woods would improve their fire retardance. So in this study, the combustion behavior of the HAp-wood composites was examined using a thermogravimetric analyzer, an oxygen index flammability tester and a corn calorimeter to evaluate the effects of the wood ash-based HAp agent on the fire-retarding properties of the HAp-wood composites.|$|R

Besides, she was accustomed to glide along the walls with her eyes cast down; for her natural boldness would never show itself through that nun-like mien except when bargaining, if only on a matter of threepence. Such a turn-out had never been presented to her notice before. The traffic in the street of the Consuls was mostly pedestrian and far from fashionable.

40|$|Faustus, a man {{of great}} {{learning}} and scholarship, barters his soul to the Devil for twenty-four years in return for omnipotence and gifts that include the restoration of his youth and youthful pleasures. We see a “knowing ” Faustus deliberately launching himself upon an evil course. He is a scholar empowered by his intellectual pride “swollen with cunning, of a self-conceit”. He is not only seeker for power, but also a knower and a desirer to know. Faustus is the personification of the pride, of will and eagerness of curiosity, devoured by a tormenting desire to probe the secrets of the universe, and so enlarge his knowledge to the utmost bounds, and to extend his power with his knowledge. To attain this purpose, he defies all moral consequences and allies himself with the devil. He gets very little in return for the damnation to which he has agreed. He never becomes a real boss of evil who has sworn to serve him. He experiences a painful mental conflict between his godly and ungodly impulses throughout the period during which he practices magic since the desire to turn to God does not become totally defunct in him. Dissatisfied with his human status, he rebels against human limitations. He strives against human limitation to the point of selling his soul. But Faustus does not change his limitations for freedom; he merely changes one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> limitation for another. He cannot have all the wants, for the satisfaction of some desires involves the frustration of others.
