50|$|Ganz {{recognized}} that {{to develop his}} factory {{he had to make}} products that are mass-produced. In 1846 the Pest-Vác railway line was built. In that time the European foundries made wrought iron rims for spoked wagon wheels. They poured the casts in shapes in the sand, and <b>leave</b> it there <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> down. Meanwhile, in the United States and England they used a better method, the chill casting which was invented by the Englishman John Burn in 1812. The essence of this process is if you cool down the cast faster, the metal will be harder, and wear-proofer. That is possible if the casting frame is made of a good heat conductor. Ganz could made one in 1853 for the first time. And he could also improve this method by using antimony. He got a patent for this invention in 1856.|$|R

The Flamboyant (Delonix regia (Bojer ex Hook) Raf.) is {{an exotic}} ornamental species {{adapted to the}} conditions of the Brazilian territory, belonging to subfamily Caesalpinioideae and it has seeds with hard coat that promotes seed dormancy caused by the impermeability of seed coat to water and oxygen. The aim {{of this study was to}} test different types of mechanical scarification to overcome seedcoat dormancy of seed, associated with physical and biological aspects of Flamboyant. The study was conducted in laboratory and experimental area of the Department of Biological Sciences at the Institute of Exact and Natural Sciences, Federal University of Mato Grosso, in Rondon??polis, MT, from October 2011 to April 2012, the experimental field was protected by a screen shading retaining 50 % of brightness. The treatments were: control, whose seeds had not been scarified, treatments with a hole in the coat, mechanical scarification with sandpaper number 150 for wood, water heated to 90 ?? C with immersion of the seeds and water heating to 90 ?? C and then immersion seeds <b>leaving</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> room temperature. Experimental design was completely randomized (CRD) with five treatments and four repetitions, totaling twenty installments of fifteen seeds each. With the observations, there were no significant differences between the means of overcoming the five methods employed in the work. To overcome dormancy in flamboyant the recommended method is immersion in water heated to 90 ?? C and subsequent soaking of the seeds. The use of techniques to overcome flamboyant seeds may cause problems when growth in height and diameter of plants in the initial phase of establishment...|$|R

60|$|When a man {{wishes to}} make a bag of pemmican, he first of all kills the buffalo--not {{an easy thing to}} do by any means, for the buffalo runs well. Having killed him, he skins him and cuts up the meat--also a {{difficult}} thing to do, especially if one is not used to that sort of work. Then he cuts the meat into thin layers, and hangs it up to dry. Dried meat will keep for a long time. It is packed up in bales and sent about that country to be used as food. The next thing to be done is {{to make a}} bag of the raw hide of the buffalo. This is done with a glover's needle, the raw sinews of the animal being used instead of thread. The bag is usually about three feet long, and eighteen inches broad, and the hair is left on the outside of it. A huge pot is now put on the fire, and the fat of the buffalo is melted down. Then the dried meat is pounded between two stones, until it is torn and broken up into shreds, after which it is put into the bag, the melted fat is poured over it, and the whole is well mixed. The last operation is to sew up the mouth of the bag and <b>leave</b> it <b>to</b> <b>cool,</b> after which the pemmican is ready for use.|$|R

3000|$|In 2008, it was {{proposed}} that a Sierpinsi manifold {{could be an}} alternative <b>to</b> the <b>leaves</b> of trees <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> down warming cities by discovering the fractal similarity of the former and the latter. Seen from one direction, a Sierpinski manifold is a plane, whereas it is three-dimensional when it is seen from the other. By selecting a tree, {{it has been observed}} that its fractal is two-dimensional, although it has a three-dimensional structure. Samples of the Sierpinski manifold were made and placed on the roof of a building in a central business district in a city and obtained the desired result of cooling down by mitigating solar heat and light under their structure. It was verified that the trees have two fractal dimensions which are the same as the Sierpinski Tetrahedron. A roof as a complex of many Sierpinski tetrahedrons could be a substitute to trees, in terms of an efficient method to combat against urban warming and heat island. Some experiments were conducted by constructing roofs made by Sierpinski tetrahedrons and showed that the temperature beneath these roofs was lower than that measured on a road without the roofs. What is important is that maintenance and waterworks are not necessary for these manifolds, which could save on the cost of water. Different from trees, water is not necessary and just the management of roofs is needed. 7 [...]...|$|R

Significant relationships existed among leaf dry mass per area, photosynthesis, leaf thickness and palisade mesophyll thickness. While the acclimatory {{response of the}} summer annuals <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> temperature and/or high light levels was limited, the winter annuals {{increased the number of}} palisade cell layers, ranging from two layers under moderate light and warm temperature to between four and five layers under cool temperature and high light. A significant relationship was also found between palisade tissue thickness and either cross-sectional area or number of phloem cells (each normalized by vein density) in minor veins among all four species and growth regimes. The two winter annuals, but not the summer annuals, thus exhibited acclimatory adjustments of minor vein phloem <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> temperature and/or high light, with more numerous and larger phloem cells and a higher maximal photosynthesis rate. The upregulation of photosynthesis in winter annuals in response to low growth temperature may thus depend on not only (1) a greater volume of photosynthesizing palisade tissue but also (2) leaf veins containing additional phloem cells and presumably capable of exporting a greater volume of sugars from the <b>leaves</b> <b>to</b> the rest of the plant...|$|R
