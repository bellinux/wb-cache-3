I am indebted to the University of Ottawa, and {{especially}} to my brilliant thesis committee (obviously brilliance attracts brilliance, tisk tisk).

When I first visited uOttawa to find a thesis advisor and had many doors (figuratively) slammed in my face, you saw some potential in that young(ish) teacher from the Ottawa Valley. With your background in physics and mine in journalism, you were always flexible and ready to adapt. You introduced me to the great thinkers in diffusion research, whose thinking became the foundation for this study. You had unwavering commitment to my success, were an unabashed cheerleader, and wrote the most flattering reference letters any student could ever hope to receive.

In it he alerts the nation to the alarming rise of social dislocation in Black inner city communities. But rather than joining with the conservative chorus which dominates political debate about this issue, Wilson focuses on the social structure, especially joblessness, {{as the key to}} the whole network of pathologies. Black inner city joblessness is, in turn, explained by large-scale economic shifts, interacting with a legacy of past racial discrimination, as well as various demographic factors. The result is the construction of a liberal analysis that challenges the dominant conservative position, which places the blame on the welfare system and ghetto subculture. Instead, Wilson claims, the blame lies with larger, social structural forces...|$|R

" This supposition has until very recently harmonized nicely with ideas in evolutionary biology and in sociobiology which see our species' behavior, {{as well as that of}} all other sexually reproducing species, as driven by "selfish genes " seeking only to maximize their inclusive fitness [...] their representation in the next generation [4].

40|$|Common to our {{understanding}} of so-called primitive and modern science is {{the idea that there is}} a problem already recognized and waiting to be solved: the cause of sickness must be divined and reversed.

We are used to the idea of psychoanalysis as resting on this assumption.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{assume a}} connection between the evolution of language and that of distinctively human group-level morality. Unfortunately, such thinkers frequently downplay a central implication of modern Darwinian theory, which precludes the possibility of innate psychological mechanisms evolving to benefit the group {{at the expense of the}} individual. Group level moral regulation is indeed central to sexual, social and political life in all known hunter-gatherer communities. The production of speech acts would be impossible without such regulation. The challenge, therefore, is to explain on a Darwinian basis how life could have become subject to the rule of law.

Still, from this humbling observation, after having written numerous books and teaching scores of seminars on leadership, comes another realization: There is nothing wrong with the theory, and this insight comes after another two decades of firsthand experience in higher education administration (i. e., leadership). The truth is that the theory is fine and it makes sense; it is just that the application is more challenging than we can rightfully convey and that the “noise” (or unexplained variance) in any real situation is often much greater than we can describe, sometimes even imagine (as conveyed by Bradshaw’s experience as Senate Chair).

Therefore, it may come off like “already existing socialism” came off to residents of the late Soviet Union. Moreover, my understanding of what content analysis is and does is doubtlessly biased in the opposite direction, some vague memories of graduate school reading assignments that purported to be using that method supplemented by the contributions to this symposium. I apologize for both biases, but hope you will not stopreading just yet! What follows is an enumeration of those aspects of DA that I find fundamentally incompatible with CA, conventionally understood.
