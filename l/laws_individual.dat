5000|$|It {{was tied}} with the {{decrease}} in monetary rent, replaced by physical labor, demands for which increased over time. Whereas {{in the early days}} of serfdom in Poland, the peasant might have been required to farm less than three weeks in a year for his lord, in the 16th century, a weekly service of 1-2 man-days become common, and in the 18th century, almost all of a peasant's time could have been requested by the lord, in extreme cases requiring a peasant to labor eight man-days a week per 1 łan of land farmed by a peasants family for their own needs (the land belonged to the landlord), which in practice meant that the male head of the family worked full-time for the lord, leaving his wife and children working on the peasant's family land, and even then they had to help him occasionally, unless a peasant hadn't hired additional workers (poorer peasants). Simultaneously, peasantry rights (to own land, to leave it, or to have independent, royal justice) were reduced. 1521 marked the end of the peasant right to complain to the royal court. By the mid-16th century no peasant could leave the land without explicit permission of the lord. The situation of individuals who did not own land also worsened (migrant peasant workers), as several laws attempted to force them to become peasants (serfs). They were also forced to partake in various monopolies of their local lords (such as to buy drinks only in the tavern owned by the lord, or use only the lord's owned mills). Due to increased population, and impact of certain <b>laws,</b> <b>individual</b> peasant estates became steadily smaller. This resulted, particularly from the second half of the 16th century, in increased impoverishment of the peasantry, banditry and the occasional peasant uprising. This phenomenon was also witnessed in several other Central and Eastern European countries, and was known as the [...] "second serfdom" [...] or [...] "neo-serfdom".|$|E

40|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War and the {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, newly formed governments throughout Eastern Europe and the former Soviet states have created constitutions that provide legal frameworks for the transition to free markets and democracy. In Constitution-Making in the Region of Former Soviet Dominance, Rett R. Ludwikowski offers a comparative study of constitution-making in progress and provides insight into the complex political and social circumstances that are shaping its present and future. The first study of these recent constitutional developments, this book also provides an appendix of all newly ratified constitutions in the region, an essential new reference source for scholars, students, and professionals. Beginning with a review of the constitutional traditions of Eastern and Central Europe, Ludwikowski goes on to offer analysis of the recent process of political change in the region. A second section focuses specifically on the the new constitutions and such issues as the selection of the form of government, concepts of divisions of power, unicameralism vs. bicameralism, the flexibility or rigidity of constitutions as working documents, and the process of reviewing the constitutionality of <b>laws.</b> <b>Individual</b> states as framed in these documents are analyzed in economic, political, and cultural terms. Although {{it is too soon to}} fully consider the implementation of these constitutions, special attention is devoted to the effect of reform on human rights protection, a notorious problem of continuing concern in the region. A final section offers an insightful comparative study of constitutional law by reviewing the post-Soviet process of constitution-making against the backdrop of Western constitutional traditions. Constitution-Making in the Region of Former Soviet Dominance is both a comprehensive study of constitutional developments in the former Soviet bloc and a primary reference tool for scholars of constitutional law, and Eastern European and post-Soviet studies.

40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{inquiry is}} a chronological {{overview}} {{of the history of}} school music education in Hungary. The study explores the topic from a large-scale humanistic perspective, in which historical context, general education <b>laws,</b> <b>individual</b> institutions and music educators, as well as music curriculum, textbooks, and teaching methods serve as evidence. The chronological narrative delineates four distinct historical periods within which music education is examined: from the annexation of Hungary by the Austrians (around 1700) {{to the creation of the}} first royal edict on education in 1777; the effects and modifications of the edict and other policies from 1777 until the Compromise between Austria and Hungary in 1867; Hungary's education system from the era of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of World War II; and the history of Hungarian education in the second half of the 20 th century. Within each period, the study provides a general historical overview, a discussion of educational policies and laws, and specifics of music education. The latter includes the place and rationale of music in the curriculum, the content and methods of music education, and the teachers and students of the subject. This research found that for over three centuries educational laws have consistently set out to shape Hungary's culture by mandating that Hungarians learn to sing, mostly for religious or aesthetic reasons. Historically, outstanding teachers have made great strides in making this goal a reality at specific schools. Zoltan Kodaly in particular was ahead of his time with his child-centered educational ideas and commitment to teaching children a variety of musics. To date, Kodaly's approach is the only one that has realized the goals set out in the educational laws of Hungary. However, Hungary has far from succeeded in implementing Kodaly's vision, having served only those children that were enrolled in music elementary schools. For the most part, inadequate teacher training and bureaucratic hindrances have kept the majority of elementary and secondary schools from adopting his approach in its entirety. Current policies perpetuate these problems, and discourage innovation or critical review of existing practices in music education...|$|E
