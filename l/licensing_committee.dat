5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a <b>licensing</b> <b>committee</b> exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E

500|$|By 1895, Lloyd's risqué {{songs were}} {{receiving}} frequent criticism from theatre reviewers and influential feminists. As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged {{the rest of}} her career. The writer and feminist Laura Ormiston Chant, {{who was a member of}} the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes. [...] Her campaign persuaded the London County Council to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions. The screens were unpopular and protesters, among them the young Winston Churchill, later pulled them down. That November at the Tivoli theatre, Lloyd performed [...] "Johnny Jones", a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend. The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience. [...] Social reformers cited [...] "Johnny Jones" [...] as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day. Upon the expiry of a music hall's entertainments licence, the <b>Licensing</b> <b>Committee</b> tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal. As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee. [...] She sang [...] "Oh! Mr Porter" [...] (composed for her by George Le Brunn), [...] "A Little of What You Fancy" [...] and [...] "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas", which she retitled [...] "I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks" [...] after some protest. The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council's interference, she then rendered Alfred Tennyson's drawing-room ballad [...] "Come into the Garden, Maud" [...] and displayed leers and nudges, to illustrate each innuendo. [...] The committee were left stunned at the performance, but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was [...] "all in the mind".|$|E

60|$|But {{the rather}} spinsterish flutter {{among some of}} the old Freethinkers has put one tiny ripple of truth in it; and that affects the idea which I wish to emphasise even to monotony in these pages. I mean the idea that the new {{community}} which the capitalists are now constructing will be a very complete and absolute community; and one which will tolerate nothing really independent of itself. Now, it is true that any positive creed, true or false, would tend to be independent of itself. It might be Roman Catholicism or Mahomedanism or Materialism; but, if strongly held, it would be a thorn {{in the side of the}} Servile State. The Moslem thinks all men immortal: the Materialist thinks all men mortal. But the Moslem does not think the rich Sinbad will live forever; but the poor Sinbad will die on his deathbed. The Materialist does not think that Mr. Haeckel will go to heaven, while all the peasants will go to pot, like their chickens. In every serious doctrine of the destiny of men, there is some trace of the doctrine of the equality of men. But the capitalist really depends on some religion of inequality. The capitalist must somehow distinguish himself from human kind; he must be obviously above it--or he would be obviously below it. Take even the least attractive and popular side of the larger religions to-day; take the mere vetoes imposed by Islam on Atheism or Catholicism. The Moslem veto upon intoxicants cuts across all classes. But it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist (who presides at a <b>Licensing</b> <b>Committee,</b> and also at a large dinner), it is absolutely necessary for him, to make a distinction between gin and champagne. The Atheist veto upon all miracles cuts across all classes. But it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist to make a distinction between his wife (who is an aristocrat and consults crystal gazers and star gazers in the West End), and vulgar miracles claimed by gipsies or travelling showmen. The Catholic veto upon usury, as defined in dogmatic councils, cuts across all classes. But it is absolutely necessary to the capitalist to distinguish more delicately between two kinds of usury; the kind he finds useful and the kind he does not find useful. The religion of the Servile State must have no dogmas or definitions. It cannot afford to have any definitions. For definitions are very dreadful things: they do the two things that most men, especially comfortable men, cannot endure. They fight; and they fight fair.|$|E

40|$|According to {{the basic}} values of the Swedish Trotting Association the horse and its welfare should always be held in highest consideration. One part of the animal welfare work in the {{organization}} is to ensure good horse management practices by controlling all active trainers through the local <b>licensing</b> <b>committees</b> situated at the Swedish racetracks. The Swedish Board of Agriculture stated that high quality animal welfare assurance programs used by the industry organizations {{can be used in}} the risk assessment of the official animal welfare control to make the official control work more effective and the ambition of the Swedish Trotting Association is to establish an animal welfare assurance program which may be approved by the Swedish Board of Agriculture. Racehorses are exposed to welfare hazards both in their management as well as during training and racing and factors like handling, training, feedstuff, stable environment, medication and the possibility to express natural behavior all affect the welfare of the horses. The aim of the project is to investigate and evaluate the animal welfare work performed by the <b>licensing</b> <b>committees</b> and to give advice on how to improve the industry’s animal welfare control. A questionnaire was sent out to all <b>licensing</b> <b>committees</b> and the results showed that they were in general satisfied with their work situation and their ability to communicate with the trainers but that they were not offered enough education in animal welfare with relevant legislation and disease control as the most mentioned gaps of knowledge. A majority of the committees believed that the committees over the country were not unified in their judgments and they felt a need for more active support from the Swedish Trotting Association. 39...|$|R
