40|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to measure {{velocity}} in liquid metals. All of these efforts, however, share the same inherent limitation, namely, not being operative at the high temperatures required by liquid metals and <b>liquid</b> <b>slags</b> in an industrial application. In this paper, the current methods used were reviewed, and a new technique was presented for the measurement of velocity in high temperature liquid metals. In using this technique there are two stages. Starting with the calibration stage and then moving to the actual measurement stage by making use of the data obtained from calibration stage. Calibration proceeds in the following manner. Metallic spheres moving with a specific velocity are immersed in liquid metal held under isothermal conditions and at specific temperature. Their melting times are determined very accurately with a novel technique. These measurements are repeated for different metal bath temperatures and for different velocities of metallic spheres. In this manner it is possible to calculate the correlation between velocity and melting times for each metal bath temperature. During the actual measurement stage, when the metal bath temperature is known and its velocity is unknown, the magnitude of the unknown liquid metal velocity can be derived as follows: metallic spheres are immersed into the moving liquid metal and their melting times are determined. Using the above mentioned correlations, it will be shown that the magnitude of the unknown velocity in liquid metal can be deduced. This new technique was applied to high temperature liquid aluminum and liquid steel and these results were presented.

In these smelting ovens, which were equipped with bellows also driven by water power, the ore was melted into a glowing clump of soft, raw iron, fluid slag and charcoal remnants. The iron was not fluid {{as it would}} be in a modern blast furnace, but remained a doughy, porous lump mainly due to the presence of <b>liquid</b> <b>slag.</b> These lumps of sponge iron, known historically as [...] "blooms" [...] were initially compacted by hand using a sledgehammer. After that they were forged several times, usually with the trip hammer or with sledgehammers until all the slag and charcoal had been removed. For that, the iron was heated in another forge oven or smith's hearth. The iron could then be directly used as soft iron. A further improvement process, such as fining as used in blast furnace operations, was not needed.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} composition of a slag varies considerably {{depending on the}} composition of the raw materials in the iron production process. Silicate and aluminate impurities from the ore and coke are combined in the blast furnace with a flux which lowers the viscosity of the slag. In the case of pig iron production the flux consists mostly of a mixture of limestone and forsterite or in some cases dolomite. In the blast furnace the slag floats on top of the iron and is decanted for separation. Slow cooling of slag melts results in an unreactive crystalline material consisting of an assemblage of Ca-Al-Mg silicates. To obtain a good slag reactivity or hydraulicity, the slag melt needs to be rapidly cooled or quenched below 800 °C in order to prevent the crystallization of merwinite and melilite. To cool and fragment the slag a granulation process can be applied in which molten slag is subjected to jet streams of water or air under pressure. Alternatively, in the pelletization process the <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> is partially cooled with water and subsequently projected into the air by a rotating drum.

50|$|In {{the second}} major phase of mining in the Upper Harz from 1524, {{smelting}} was gradually moved into fixed sites. The transportation of logs as rafts {{and the use of}} water power led to the selection of advantageous sites on the rivers in the Harz - such as the Innerste, Grane and Oker. At one location that had already been used in medieval times (1180), the Frankenscharrn Hut emerged, which later became the Clausthal Lead Smelting Works (Bleihütte Clausthal), the most famous one in the Upper Harz. It was worked until 31 December 1967. Other important smelters were the silver works (Silberhütte) in Lautenthal (later merged with the Bleihütte Clausthal), the silver works in Altenau (to 1911) and the Andreasberg Silver Works (Silberhütte Andreasberg, to 1912). After the Upper Harz metal works were closed the ores of the remaining Grund Ore Mine were reduced in the Upper Harz works (to 1981) and finally in the Binsfeldhammer Lead Works near Aachen. The various metalworks, especially the Clausthal Works left behind considerable environmental damage. By contrast, the buildings and facilities in the Upper Harz have completely disappeared. From the first mining period until just before the industrial age the so-called precipitation method (Niederschlagsarbeit) was used in the Upper Harz. Instead of the usual roasting (desulphurising) of the ore, the slag was melted using charcoal with granulated iron (Eisengranalien) as a reduction medium using the roast-reaction process (Röst-Reaktions-Verfahren) (direct conversion from metal sulphide to metal) in arched kilns (Krummofen). The comparatively low kiln temperatures of around 1000 °C produced no <b>liquid</b> <b>slag,</b> the residue (gangue) remained in solid form. Not until the development of more powerful fan shaft kilns around 1850 were the concentrates roasted in double-deck ovens (Etagenöfen) and sintering pans and then melted in crucible shaft kilns (Tiegelschaftofen) on silver-containing argentiferous lead (Werkblei) and molten slag. The argentiferous lead was initially worked immediately in the German tests on lightened silver. At the start of the 20th century a multi-stage refining process was carried out in Kesselherden and silver extracted using the Parkes process.|$|E

In previous research,[1] two distinct types of microstructures were observed in these freeze layers: one with only melilite columnar crystals and one with both melilite and olivine columnar crystals.

The element distribution, the phase fraction, and the crystal morphology were examined using electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis. In addition, thermodynamic software was {{used to calculate the}} solidification path of the slag. The impact of the mass transport on the growth of a freeze lining depends on the solidification rate. For high solidification rates, only short-range mass transport is observed and small crystals form. For lower solidification rates, long-range mass transport is observed, resulting in an exchange of components between the freeze layer and <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> bath and in the formation of large crystals.
