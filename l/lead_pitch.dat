50|$|Britton throws three pitches. His <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> is a sinker {{averaging}} 96 mph (maxing out at 99). He {{throws a}} four-seam fastball {{at the same}} speed. He also throws a curveball averaging 82-83.|$|E
50|$|The {{body size}} of a SOP was {{compressed}} and the <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> tightened to obtain a smaller version SOP.

50|$|Hammel {{throws a}} mix of five pitches: a four-seam fastball at 92-95 mph, a two-seam fastball (his <b>lead</b> <b>pitch)</b> at the same speed, a slider in the mid 80s, a curveball in the upper 70s, and a changeup in the high 80s. He uses all of his pitches against left-handed hitters, but {{eliminates}} the changeup against right-handers. His chief off-speed pitch with 2 strikes is the slider.|$|E
50|$|Example: A CNC {{vertical}} mill has {{a vertical}} lead screw on the Z-axis. A low <b>lead</b> screw <b>pitch</b> (i.e. 5 {{turns per inch}} or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, {{the weight of the}} spindle will cause the lead screw to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use a finer (higher) <b>lead</b> screw <b>pitch</b> (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.|$|R

50|$|Lyon survives on five pitches: a four-seam fastball at 90-92 mph, a two-seamer at 90-91, a cutter at 89-91, and a curveball at 78-80. Occasionally, he also {{throws a}} changeup to left-handed hitters (85-87). Lyon's most {{commonly}} thrown pitch to right-handed hitters (and overall) is the cutter, while his <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> against lefties is the two-seamer. The curve is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E
50|$|Price uses a {{wide variety}} of pitches and {{complements}} them with excellent velocity. He throws two fastballs in the 93-96 mph range (tops out at 98 mph): a four-seamer and a two-seamer. His two-seamer is his <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> against right-handed and left-handed hitters, although he uses it more often against lefties. Price also throws a cutter at 90-92 mph, used mainly against right-handed hitters (especially in 2-strike counts). He rounds out his repertoire with a changeup he uses mainly against right-handed hitters, but also features to left-handed hitters (83-86) and a spike curveball at 78-81.|$|E
50|$|Maholm {{throws a}} wide variety of pitches and with a great range of speeds. His <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> is a sinker in the 87-89 mph range. He also throws a four-seam fastball (87-90), changeup (80-83), cut fastball (83-86), slider (79-82), and curveball (70-75). Maholm uses the cutter and changeup almost {{exclusively}} on right-handed hitters, while the slider is used only on lefties. He throws his curveball to batters {{from both sides of the}} plate. In 2013, he added a slow curveball that ranges from 70 MPH to 62 MPH, that at times dips in the 50's.|$|E
50|$|In manual linear stages, {{a control}} knob {{attached}} to a lead screw is typically used. The knob may be indexed to indicate its angular position. The linear displacement of the stage {{is related to the}} angular displacement of the knob by the <b>lead</b> screw <b>pitch.</b> For example if the <b>lead</b> screw <b>pitch</b> is 0.5 mm then one full revolution of the knob will move the stage platform 0.5 mm relative to the stage base. If the knob has 50 index marks around its circumference, then each index division is equivalent to 0.01 mm of linear motion of the stage platform.|$|R

50|$|TQFPs {{help solve}} {{issues such as}} {{increasing}} board density, die shrink programs, thin end-product profile and portability. Lead counts range from 32 to 176. Body sizes range from 5 mm x 5 mm to 20 x 20 mm. Copper lead-frames are used in TQFPs. <b>Lead</b> <b>pitches</b> available for TQFPs are 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.65 mm, 0.8 mm, and 1.0mm.PQFP, or plastic quad flat pack, {{is a type of}} QFP, as is the thinner TQFP package. PQFP packages can vary in thickness from 2.0 mm to 3.8 mm.A Low-profile Quad Flat Package is a surface mount integrated circuit package format with component leads extending from each of the four sides. Pins are numbered counter-clockwise from the index dot. Spacing between pins can vary; common spacings are 0.4, 0.5, 0.65 and 0.80 mm intervals.|$|R
50|$|Through the 2011 season, Baker threw six pitches: a four-seam fastball, his <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> (89-94 mph); a two-seam fastball (88-93 mph); a cut fastball (mid 80s); {{a slider}} (low 80s); a curveball (79-81 mph); and a changeup (low 80s). His {{repertoire}} against right-handed hitters is mostly four-seamer/slider, while against lefties {{he throws the}} two-seamer, as well. The cutter, curveball, and changeup are infrequent offerings. Since Baker's return in 2013, his average fastball velocity has dropped to the high eighties, {{and he has been}} reluctant to throw the curveball, not using it at all in 2014 as of June 4.|$|E
50|$|The spacing {{between the}} clips (<b>lead</b> <b>pitch)</b> is {{typically}} 0.1 in (2.54 mm). Integrated circuits (ICs) in dual in-line packages (DIPs) can be inserted to straddle the {{centerline of the}} block. Interconnecting wires and the leads of discrete components (such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors) can be inserted into the remaining free holes to complete the circuit. Where ICs are not used, discrete components and connecting wires may use any of the holes. Typically the spring clips are rated for 1 ampere at 5 volts and 0.333 amperes at 15 volts (5 watts). The edge of the board has male and female notches so boards can be clipped {{together to form a}} large breadboard.|$|E
50|$|Kuroda {{throws a}} mix of five pitches. His <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> is a shuuto—similar to a sinker and labeled as such by PITCHf/x—which he throws between 90 and 94 mph. Kuroda's shuuto topped out at 97 mph when he pitched for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Although Kuroda's shuuto {{velocity}} has declined, this pitch still makes him an effective ground-ball pitcher in recent years. His main off-speed pitch is a slider in the 83-85 range. Kuroda rounds out his repertoire with a four-seam fastball (90-94), splitter (86-88), and an occasional curveball (76-78). Nearly 90% of the pitches Kuroda throws to right-handed batters are shuutos or sliders, split about evenly. Against lefties, he adds considerable variety and draws on his splitter as a strikeout pitch. Kuroda is prone to leave a slider low and away against righties in two strike counts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lead</b> [...] and <b>pitch</b> {{are closely}} related concepts. They can be {{confused}} {{because they are the}} same for most screws. Lead is the distance along the screw's axis that is covered by one complete rotation of the screw (360°). Pitch is the distance from the crest of one thread to the next. Because the vast majority of screw threadforms are single-start threadforms, their <b>lead</b> and <b>pitch</b> are the same. Single-start means {{that there is only one}} [...] "ridge" [...] wrapped around the cylinder of the screw's body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of one ridge. [...] "Double-start" [...] means that there are two [...] "ridges" [...] wrapped around the cylinder of the screw's body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of two ridges. Another way to express this is that <b>lead</b> and <b>pitch</b> are parametrically related, and the parameter that relates them, the number of starts, very often has a value of 1, in which case their relationship becomes equality. In general, lead is equal to pitch times the number of starts.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{integrated circuits}} were packaged in ceramic flat packs, which {{continued to be}} used by the military for their reliability and small size for many years.

40|$|Abstract- The FEM {{method was}} {{used to analyze the}} effects of lead widths and pitches on {{reliability}} of soldered joints. The optimum simulation for QFP devices was also researched, the results indicate that when the lead pitches are the same, the maximum equivalent stress of the soldered joints increases with the increase of lead widths, while the reliability of the soldered joints reduces. When the lead widths are the same, the maximum equivalent stress of the soldered joints doesn’t decrease completely with the increase of lead pitches, and a minimum value of the maximum equivalent stress values exists in all the curves. Under this condition the maximum equivalent stress of the soldered joints is relatively the least, the reliability of soldered joints is high and the assembly is excellent. The simulating results indicate that, as the best parameter setting, the lead width is 0. 2 mm and <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> is 0. 3 mm (the distance between two leads is 0. 1 mm). This parameter setting is beneficial to the micromation of QFP devices now. The minimum value of the maximum equivalent stress of soldered joints exists while lead width is 0. 25 mm and <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> is 0. 35 mm (the distance between two leads is 0. 1 mm). In such a setting, the devices can serve for a long time, the reliability is the highest, and the assembly is excellent. The simulating results also indicate that the limit of QFP occurs when the lead width is 0. 15 mm and <b>lead</b> <b>pitch</b> is 0. 2 mm. This is significant for the high lead count and micromation of assembly. Key words: QFP; maximum equivalent stress; soldered joints; assembly optimization; finite element metho...|$|E

A placement accuracy of _-"+ 3 #sigma#=_-"+ 5 #mu#m is necessary for achieving high process quality (_-"+ 6 #sigma#). TAB-components with gold plated leads and a pitch of 0. 3 mm were used in a multichip module. The hotbar soldering process was investigated and optimized.
