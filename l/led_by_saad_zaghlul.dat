50|$|Shortly {{after the}} First World War {{armistice}} on the 11th of November was concluded on the Western Front in Europe, {{a delegation of}} Egyptian nationalist activists <b>led</b> <b>by</b> <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul</b> made a request to High Commissioner Reginald Wingate to end the British Protectorate in Egypt and Sudan, and gain Egyptian representation at the planned peace conference in Paris.

5000|$|In 1917, Wingate succeeded Sir Henry McMahon as High Commissioner in Egypt, a post he held until 1919. He {{was not a}} {{successful}} administrator in the very different political climate in that country, and was made a scapegoat for the riots incited <b>by</b> <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul</b> and his party that spread across Egypt. Angry at his treatment, Wingate refused to actually resign, even after he was officially replaced by Lord Allenby, and threatened to embarrass the British Government. He was made a Knight of the Venerable Order of St John in 1919. [...] He was refused a peerage or another appointment, although he was created a baronet in the 1920 King's Birthday Honours, gazetted as a Baronet, of Dunbar, in the County of Haddington, and of Port Sudan.

2500|$|Towards {{the close}} of the 1980s, and {{continuing}} to 2000, most of the remaining fighting in Lebanon occurred in the south, inside the Israeli-occupied zone, under the Southern-Lebanese-Army influence <b>led</b> <b>by</b> <b>Saad</b> Haddad and later by Antoine Lahd, the latter who had close ties with the National Liberal Party (Al Ahrar in Arabic).

50|$|Numerous {{political}} parties exist in Lebanon. Many parties {{are little more}} than ad hoc electoral lists, formed by negotiation among influential local figures representing the various confessional communities; these lists usually function only for the purpose of the election, and do not form identifiable groupings in the parliament subsequently. Other parties are personality-based, often comprising followers of a present or past political leader or warlord. Few parties are based, in practice, on any particular ideology, although in theory most claim to be. No single party has ever won more than 12.5 percent {{of the total number of}} seats in the Parliament, and until 2005 no coalition ever won more than a third of the total. The general election held in 2005, however, resulted in a clear majority (72 seats out of 128) being won <b>by</b> the alliance <b>led</b> <b>by</b> <b>Saad</b> Hariri (son of murdered former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri); half of these were held by Hariri's own Current for the Future.|$|R
