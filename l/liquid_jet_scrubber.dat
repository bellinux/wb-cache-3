A novel optical technique, based on internal illumination of the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> through the jet nozzle by a laser pulse, which excites a fluorescing dye introduced in the atomizing liquid, was used to obtain instantaneous measurements of the breakup length and the three dimensional location of the liquid core of the continuous <b>liquid</b> <b>jet.</b> The latter was achieved by simultaneously imaging the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> from two directions normal to each other. Such measurements are usually prevented by droplets surrounding the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> at the dense spray near the nozzle exit. The measurements showed that the break-up length of the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> scaled well with the air to liquid momentum ratio. The standard deviation of the temporal fluctuations of the break-up length was around 10 % of the mean breakup length for each considered flow condition. The instantaneous jet surface does not develop axi-symmetric wave structures but the time-averaged <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> is axi-symmetric around the nozzle axis, while the maximum deflection of the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> occurs close to the breaking point...|$|R

The measurements of wavelength and amplitude of jet oscillation are extracted from digital images of the <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> captured via still photography technique at different flow conditions using three different liquids (pure water, water-glycerol mixture, and Jet A- 1 fuel). The measured wavelength of jet oscillation (lambda), irrespective of the shape geometry of the tested non-circular orifices, increases linearly with increase in <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> velocity (U-o) and scales with the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> Weber number (We) as lambda/D-eq alpha We(0. 5).

For a given U-o, the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> of Jet A- 1 displays higher value of lambda and undergoes a larger increase in lambda along the axis of the jet compared to the jets of other two liquids.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> discharging from elliptical orifices into still ambient air. The experiments were conducted with a set of elliptical orifices of approximately same area of cross section but varying orifice aspect ratio using water and water-glycerol mixture as experimental fluids. The flow behavior of <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> was analyzed using their photographs captured by an imaging system. The measurements obtained for the elliptical <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> were compared with the circular <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> discharging from a circular orifice of the same area of cross section. Elliptical geometry of the orifice results in a flow process by which the emanating <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> periodically switches its major and minor axes as it flows downstream of the orifice. In this paper, we attempt to characterize the axis-switching process through its wavelength and amplitude. For a given elliptical orifice, the axis-switching process is dominantly seen in a particular range of flow conditions. The effects of the orifice aspect ratio and liquid viscosity on the axis-switching process are revealed through this study. The experimental results on jet breakup show that axis-switching process has a destabilizing effect on elliptical <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> within a particular range of flow conditions and it results in shorter breakup lengths compared to the circular jet. The extent to which axis-switching destabilizes the jet is dictated by the viscosity of liquid.

To apply the Airy formula, some characteristic information relevant to the radius and refractive index should be properly extracted from the rainbow. This is challenging for the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> radius changing in a wide range because the rainbow structure, especially the ripple structure, is affected by the noise and the cone effect of a practical <b>liquid</b> <b>jet.</b> In this paper, a novel optimization scheme for the measurement of <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> parameters based on Debye theory (p= 2) is proposed.

Immunoassay incubation by free <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> was extended to detect a simulant for biowarfare agents with SERS detection.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} breakup processes involved {{in the formation of}} a spray created by a <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> injected into a gaseous crossflow. This work is motivated by the utilization of this method to inject fuel in combustors and afterburners of airplane engines. This study aims to develop better understanding of the spray breakup processes and provide better experimental inputs to improve the fidelity of numerical models. This work adresses two key research areas: determining the time required for a liquid column to break up in the crossflow (i. e., primary breakup time) and the effect of injector geometry on spray properties. A new diagnostic technique, the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> light guiding technique that utilizes ability of the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> to act as a waveguide for laser light was developed to determine the location where the liquid column breaks up, in order to obtain the primary breakup time. This study found that the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> Reynolds number was an important factor that governed the primary breakup time and improved the existing correlation. Optical diagnostic techniques such as Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer, <b>Liquid</b> <b>Jet</b> Light Guiding Technique, Particle Image Velocimetry and Imaging techniques were employed to measure the spray properties that include spray penetration, droplet sizes and velocities, velocity field {{on the surface of the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> and the location of the primary breakup time. These properties were measured for two injectors: one with a sharp transition and the other with a smooth transition. It was found that the spray created by the injector with a sharp transition forms large irregular structures while one with smooth transition produces a smooth <b>liquid</b> <b>jet.</b> The spray transition creates a spray that penetrates deeper into the crossflow, breakup up earlier and produces larger droplets.

Recently, a greater {{attention has been dedicated}} to the impinging <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> since orders of magnitude of the heat transfer rates are several times those of gas <b>jets.</b> <b>Liquid</b> <b>jets</b> have possible application to the cooling of heat engines [5, 7], thermal control in electronic devices [8 – 10] and in the thermal treatment of metals and material processing [11 – 14].|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a novel air-assisted {{impinging}} jet atomization is demonstrated. A configuration {{in which a}} gas jet is directed on to the impinging point of two <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> is used to improve the atomization. The effect of liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension, angle between <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> and gas injection orifice diameter on spray characteristics has been experimentally studied. Backlit imaging and particle/droplet imaging and analysis techniques are utilized to characterize the sprays. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} effect of liquid viscosity is significant on the liquid sheet break up formed by the impinging jets. However, surface tension does not affect the spray structure significantly in this mode of atomization. At low <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> velocity, the prompt mode of atomization is observed where as atomization occurs in classical mode at higher <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> velocity. Results showed that variation in the angle between <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> do not affect the breakup phenomenon significantly. The spray angle is computed by finding the angle between the lines joining the impinging point and spray edge at an axial distance of 15 mm downstream of the impinging point from the ensemble-averaged data over 100 spray images. It was observed that effect of <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> impinging angle on the spray angle is higher at higher liquid velocity. Higher viscosity liquids exhibit lower spray angles. Droplet size measurements indicate a radial variation in the spray. An overall Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) value is obtained by combining the droplet statistics at all radial locations at a fixed axial location. A very interesting trend is that the SMD is constant beyond a critical Gas to Liquid Ratio (GLR) and momentum ratio for a large variation in liquid viscosity and surface tension. This observation has important ramifications for fuel flexible systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
