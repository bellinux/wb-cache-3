Wu Zetian's procession of ladies up Taishan conspicuously linked Wu with the most sacred traditional rites of the Chinese empire.|$|E

Upon its completion, Restigouche remained at Halifax for local escort duties until January 1941 when she sailed for the UK where she was reassigned to the Western Approaches Command. The ship was ordered to St. John's, Newfoundland on 30 May to reinforce escort forces in the Western Atlantic. Whilst guarding the battleship [...] at Placentia Bay on 8 August, Restigouche damaged her propellers when she struck bottom and required repairs that lasted until October.

500|$|Andy Buckley, who portrayed David Wallace, former CFO of Dunder Mifflin, was {{originally}} {{billed as a}} guest star for this episode and his character {{was supposed to have}} a part in Michael's movie. When NBC first aired the episode, Wallace's scenes were not shown. It was revealed by Novak that, in the script, Wallace was Michael's first choice as Goldenface, but turned it down because [...] "it wouldn't look good to people at Corporate". Furthermore, Buckley filmed a talking head interview, which had his character exclaiming his regret in not taking the role. This scene was deleted due to time constraints. The scene does not appear on the Season 7 DVD. [...] The script also had a scene that brought back Amy Adams' character Katy, but it was cut because Adams was working on a movie during the time this episode was filmed. Ellie Kemper, who portrays Erin Hannon on the series, did not appear in the movie; Novak reasoned that Michael had finished his filming <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> arrived at the office, and had spent the remaining years [...] "editing and procrastinating".|$|E

500|$|Classic Coronation Street was a {{recreation}} of 1960s Coronation Street. It starred Wood as the show's gossiping Ena Sharples, with Julie Walters as Martha Longhurst and Lill Roughley as Minnie Caldwell, with Ena telling them the [...] "gossip" [...] she has {{heard about the}} show's plotlines {{for the next two}} decades. The sketch was written with a detailed knowledge of the soap opera's past: [...] "That stuck up Ida Barlow, who's no better than she should be... it'll not be too <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> falls under a bus! That Harry Hewitt'll likely get crushed under the axle of 'is own van, and as for Valerie Barlow – and if this isn't judgement for setting 'erself up in 'er own front parlour as a so-called 'air stylist then my name isn't Ena Sharples – from what I 'ear, it's two clogs to a threpenny bit that she'll electrocute 'erself with 'er own 'airdryer."

500|$|According to a {{reviewer}} in Choice, {{the poems}} in Oh Pray focus on themes of love, insight, and tension. [...] They also focus on [...] "the black condition celebrated triumphant over difficulties". [...] The reviewer finds some poems uneven, sometimes banal, also best if read aloud, and meant to [...] "be reread and laughed over and thought about". [...] Reviewer James Finn Cotter states that this volume suffers from [...] "the dangers of success" [...] that happen when poets gain too much fame too soon. [...] Gilbert blames Angelou's publishers for capitalizing on her success as an autobiographer, stating that Oh Pray [...] "...is such a painfully untalented collection of poems that I can't {{think of any}} reason other than the Maya myth {{for it to be}} in print". [...] Writer Lyman B. Hagen responds to Gilbert's criticism by stating that Angelou had been a poet <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> began writing prose and that Angelou's audience is comfortable with her sparse lines. [...] He insists that Angelou's critics have missed the power of her poems' message in her apparently simple lines. [...] Hagen calls Angelou's poetry light verse. [...] He states that she writes about ordinary objects and experiences, and with deep feelings, about a variety of racial themes and concerns.|$|E
500|$|From the beginning, Malouma sang in {{a variety}} of languages, {{including}} traditional Arabic, Hassania (Mauritanian Arabic), French and Wolof. By singing in various languages, she sought to air her message to a broader audience. It was not <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> appeared on television together with her sister, Emienh, and her brother, Arafat, an instrumentalist. Their style was controversial, especially after the release of her song [...] "Habibi Habeytou" [...] and a 1988 appearance at the Carthage Festival in Tunis, as she addressed social issues, such as poverty, inequality and disease which were not generally acceptable in Mauritania. Her participation in the Carthage event led to her subsequent appearance on Arab satellite channels, giving her greater exposure. Malouma became nationally known and was a sought after performer until a 1991 song about freedom of speech. After being censored for writing songs promoting women's rights and challenging apartheid, she was banned from appearing on television and radio, holding concerts, and was even denied a permanent address. She did not perform anywhere for a lengthy period but in the late 1990s she began to sing in other African countries, in Europe, and in the United States. While she won audiences among the people, Malouma was persecuted by both the moral authorities and authoritarian governments, her music being completely banned until 2003 when a crowd of 10,000 successfully called on President Ould Taya to cancel her censorship. Some restrictions still remained until the overthrow of the Ould Taya regime in 2005.|$|E

500|$|Dr R. Nagulendran, a {{consultant}} psychiatrist, testified that Tan was mentally impaired by reactive psychotic depression. [...] According to {{him she was}} depressed before she met Lim, due to her family background. [...] Physical abuse and threats from Lim deepened her depression; drug abuse led her to hallucinate and believe the medium's lies. [...] Dr Chee disagreed; he said that Tan had admitted to being quite happy with the material lifestyle Lim gave to her, enjoying fine clothes and beauty salon treatments. [...] A sufferer from reactive psychotic depression would not have paid such attention to her appearance. [...] Also, Tan had earlier confessed to knowing Lim was a fraud, but changed her stance in court to claim she was acting completely under his influence. [...] Although Dr Chee had neglected Lim's physical abuse of Tan in his judgment, he was firm in his opinion that Tan was mentally sound during the crimes. [...] Both Dr Nagulendran and Dr Chee agreed that Hoe suffered from schizophrenia <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> met Lim, and that her stay in Woodbridge Hospital had helped her recovery. [...] However, while Dr Nagulendran was convinced that Hoe suffered a relapse {{during the time of}} the child killings, Dr Chee pointed out that none of the Woodbridge doctors saw any signs of relapse during the six months of her follow-up checks (16July 1980 [...] 31January 1981). If Hoe had been as severely impaired by her condition as Dr Nagulendran described, she would have become an invalid. [...] Instead, she methodically abducted and helped kill a child on two occasions. [...] Ending his testimony, Dr Chee stated that it was incredible that three people with different mental illnesses should share a common delusion of receiving a request to kill from a god.|$|E
500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man. Boing Boings Caroline Siede {{explained}} that Ariel [...] "just happens to end up with a prince in the process of achieving her larger dream" [...] to become human. Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world. But crucially, her love of 'the world above' is established <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> sets eyes on the prince" [...] during [...] "Part of Your World". Laura Stampler, writing for Time, agreed that the character [...] " [...] in love with the human world before she even knew who Eric was" [...] because [...] "she has always dreamed of being a 'part of your world'". Ariel sings [...] "Bright young women, sick of swimmin’, ready to stand" [...] to indicate that she fantasizes about [...] "living in a feminist-friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually", demonstrating envy towards women who are capable of doing this on land. However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me (even though I had legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E
500|$|Supervising {{animator}} Glen Keane designed Rapunzel {{under the}} tutelage of veteran animator Ollie Johnston, one of Disney's Nine Old Men. Johnston advised Keane to attempt to capture what Rapunzel is thinking as opposed to simply animating what the character is doing after reviewing one of his early pencil tests. Keane compared receiving this advice to receiving a [...] "slap that I never forgot, so when I was drawing over people's work, I really tried to get into the head of the thinking of the character". Co-director Byron Howard was inspired by the appearance of Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), a character who was also animated by Keane. Howard elaborated that [...] "Ariel was the first character that I ever thought there was a soul behind her eyes ... We hoped to do that with Rapunzel to find some sort of soul and depth that people could relate to". Meanwhile, Keane observed that Ariel and Rapunzel also share [...] "irrepressible" [...] spirits while encountering barriers that prevent them from pursuing their dreams. Keane was inspired by a book about the idea of feminine beauty; the book cited [...] "strangeness" [...] as [...] "the key to beauty ... in a woman's face." [...] Taking this into consideration, Keane maintained a sense of asymmetry while drawing Rapunzel, incorporating into her face several subtle imperfections, specifically her bucked teeth. The character was also drawn with freckles, making her the first Disney princess to have this feature. Keane designed Rapunzel with large eyes in order to convey her [...] "irrepressible quality", a trait her also discovered in Mandy Moore's voice. The animators created nine different versions of Rapunzel before finally settling on a design with which they were satisfied. Although Moore has observed some physical similairites between the character and herself, she maintains that Rapunzel's appearance was developed <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> became involved with the project, dismissing any similarities as [...] "coincidental".|$|E

2500|$|According {{to her own}} audio diaries, she met Hearst <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> {{had started}} working in films. Hearst later formed Cosmopolitan Pictures, which would produce most of her {{starring}} vehicles. Hearst's relentless efforts to promote her career had a detrimental effect, but he persisted, making Cosmopolitan's distribution deals first with Paramount, then Goldwyn, and with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Davies herself was more inclined to develop her comic talents alongside her friends at United Artists, but Hearst pointedly discouraged this. Davies, in her published memoirs The Times We Had, concluded that Hearst's over-the-top promotion of her career, in fact, had a negative result. [...] One particular example, he had purchased the Cameo Theatre (located in San Francisco) in 1929. He then lavishly remodeled both the exterior and interior decor in a rosebud-hued Art Moderne motif, and renamed it The Marion Davies Theatre. From Hearst's office windows further up Market Street, he could see pink neon letters constantly spelling out her name above the marquee. Hearst Metrotone Newsreels were included on the program, and these newsreels regularly touted Miss Davies' social activities.|$|E

Protestants were especially appalled that Ogilby, herself a Protestant, had become a victim of loyalist violence and angrily denounced the UDA. Journalist Ciarán Barnes described it as being one of the most brutal murders of the Troubles; adding that its sheer savagery {{and the fact that it}} was carried out by women against another woman within earshot of her child left a lasting impression upon the public psyche. The UDA leadership had not sanctioned the killing; and there was general condemnation from the UDA prisoners inside the Maze Prison. According to Ian S. Wood, the UDA's commander Andy Tyrie had not sufficient control over the many units that comprised the UDA to have been able to prevent the punishment beating from being carried out. A spokesman for the UDA released a statement condemning the killing and the women's unit that carried it out which was first published in the Irish Times on 8 February 1975:"We have completely disowned them [...] We think the whole affair was foul and sickening. Ogilby was cleared by the UDA of an allegation about her private life <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> was killed. The killing was an act of jealousy by a group of women." ...|$|E
