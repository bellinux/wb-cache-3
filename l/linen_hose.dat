This rubber hose was as bulky, heavy, and stiff as a leather hose, but was not prone to leaking. It also proved more durable than unlined <b>linen</b> <b>hose.</b> Its wrapped construction resembled some hoses used today by industry, for example, fuel delivery hoses used to service airliners.|$|E

5000|$|The early {{prosperity}} of the town was {{largely due to the}} nearby quarries of slate, whose abundant use for the roofs of Angers led to its sobriquet as the [...] "Black City". In the mid-19th century, the principal manufactures were goods for sailing ships (sailcloth and rope), <b>linen</b> and <b>hose,</b> sugar, leather, wax, and oil, as well as agricultural products (mainly wheat, wine, and fruit). By the time of the First World War, Cointreau had developed the distillation of liqueurs from the area's fruit to an industrial level. The work for sailing ships was still carried on but steamships had greatly reduced demand. Instead, local companies produced cables, wires, and thread and increased production of footwear, umbrellas, and parasols. The area's vineyards focused on sparkling wine and fruit was increasingly preserved for sale elsewhere. The area had also developed a small-scale textile industry and begun producing machines, as well as commercial-scale production of hemp and flowers.|$|R
