25|$|After {{joining the}} Detours, Entwistle {{played a major}} role in {{encouraging}} Pete Townshend's budding talent on the guitar, and insisting that Townshend be admitted into the band as well. Eventually, Roger Daltrey fired all the members of his band with the exception of Entwistle, Townshend and the drummer, Doug Sandom, a semi-pro player who was several years older than the others. Roger Daltrey relinquished the role of guitarist to Pete Townshend in 1963, instead becoming frontman and lead singer. The band considered several changes of name, and finally settling on the name the Who while Entwistle was still working as a tax clerk (temporarily performing as the High Numbers for four months in 1964). When the band decided that the blond Roger Daltrey needed to stand out more from the others, Entwistle dyed his naturally <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> black, and it remained so until the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 in Sierra Leone, Wanless found adult females 4.8 to 9.6millimetres in {{body length}} and adult males 5.2 to 7.2millimetres.

25|$|Two further {{unidentified}} {{males are}} estimated to have been killed between August and October 1976. One of these victims was buried directly above the body of William Carroll, who had been murdered on June 13, yet higher than the body of Rick Johnston, who was last seen on August 6. This particular unidentified male is estimated to have been aged between 15 and 24 {{years old and had}} <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair.</b> Sequential burial patterns of victims within the crawl space, plus the circumstantial fact that Cram had not lived with Gacy before August 20, leave a possible date of between August 6 and August 20, 1976 as the time this particular man was murdered. The second unidentified male likely to have been murdered between August and October 1976 is a youth with dark brown hair, aged between 17 and 21 years old, who is known to have suffered from an abscessed tooth {{at the time of his}} murder. This male was buried in the northeast corner of the crawl space. Subsequent recollections by an employee of PDM Contractors of a trench Gacy had ordered him to dig on or before October 5, 1976, being the location where this particular victim was buried suggest a date between August and October 1976 as being when this man was murdered.|$|E

2500|$|Intermezzo {{became an}} {{enormous}} success {{and as a}} result Bergman became a star. The film's director, Gregory Ratoff, said [...] "She is sensational," [...] as an actress. This was the [...] "sentiment of the entire set," [...] writes Life, adding that workmen would {{go out of their way}} to do things for her, and the cast and crew [...] "admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines." [...] Film historian David Thomson notes that this would become [...] "the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America" [...] where her lack of makeup contributed to an [...] "air of nobility." [...] According to Life, the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5ft. 9 in.) girl [...] "with <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> and blue eyes who was painfully shy but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile."

2500|$|Jane {{was three}} years younger than Stephen. Prior to her {{marriage}} to Stephen Foster, she was engaged to another man identified as being from Lisbon. By the summer of 1850, Stephen Foster had begun to sell his music and had become increasingly well known. Jean has not been identified as having musical interests, talents or abilities. She was called pretty, had <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> {{and according to the}} custom of the time it was long and [...] "luxuriant". Jane McDowell was married Monday, July 22, 1850 by a minister from the Trinity Episcopal Church in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania to Stephen Foster, even then, the well-known composer and lyricist. Her wedding gown was noted to be beautiful and well-fitting. The wedding ceremony was described by Jane's sister to be quite strained, attributed to the couple's nervousness. Immediately after the wedding, the couple took an extended honeymoon to New York and Baltimore. They stopped in Paradise, Pennsylvania, Mercersburg, Pennsylvania and Chambersburg. Jane's mother-in-law had relatives in Chambersburg and the couple visited the while they were there. Biographers speculate that the honeymoon was really a business trip to establish business arrangements with music publishers in New York and Baltimore.|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Elizabeth was the {{particular}} favorite of her father. She resembled him {{both physically and}} temperamentally. She was a bright girl, if not brilliant, but received only a desultory formal education. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education. He had a son (and grandson) {{from his first marriage}} to a noblewoman, and did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid and second wife might one day inherit the throne. Indeed, no woman had ever sat upon the throne of Russia yet. It was therefore left to Catherine to raise the girls as best she could, but she was herself too uneducated to be able to superintend the formal education of her daughters. Elizabeth had a French governess and grew fluent in Italian, German and French. She was also an excellent dancer and rider. Like her father, Elizabeth was physically active and loved riding, hunting, sledging, skating, and gardening. From her earliest years, she delighted everyone with her extraordinary beauty and vivacity, and was regarded as the leading beauty of the Russian Empire. The wife of the British minister (ambassador) described Elizabeth as [...] "fair, with <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair,</b> large sprightly blue eyes, fine teeth and a pretty mouth. She is inclinable to be fat, but is very genteel and dances better than anyone I ever saw. She speaks German, French and Italian, is extremely gay and talks to everyone..." ...|$|E

In Rear Window, Lisa (Grace Kelly again) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In North by Northwest and Vertigo the main female character is blonde-haired. Tippi Hedren is the main character in [...] "The Birds" [...] {{and appears to be}} the main subject of the Bird's attacks. Ingrid Bergman, who Hitchcock directed three times (Spellbound, Notorious and Under Capricorn) has what is considered dark blonde or <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair.</b> [...] The best-known example is in Psycho where Janet Leigh's unfortunate character steals $40,000 and is murdered by a reclusive psychopath. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was Barbara Harris as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in Family Plot (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by Karen Black could also fit that role, as she wears a long blonde wig in various scenes and becomes increasingly uncomfortable about her line of work. The English 'Hitchcock blonde' was based on his preference for the heroines to have an [...] "indirect" [...] sex appeal of English women, ladylike in public, but whores in the bedroom, with Hitchcock stating to Truffaut: ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{with other}} species of Avicularia, juveniles have distinctively {{different}} colour patterns to adults. Juveniles of A. juruensis lack any kind of metallic sheen, have black tarsi contrasting {{with the rest of}} the leg which is lighter, and also have a reddish upper surface to the abdomen with a central longitudinal black stripe and separated transverse black stripes. Adults lose the stripes on the abdomen and gain a metallic sheen. There are two colour forms or [...] "morphotypes". Morphotype 1 has a golden and pink sheen, a whitish carapace and whitish leg rings and longer <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hairs</b> evenly distributed over shorter darker hairs. Males appear to lack whitish tips to the hairs on the upper surface of the abdomen. Morphotype 2 has an intense purple sheen and yellower leg rings. Females have long reddish <b>brown</b> <b>hairs</b> on the front and sides of the upper abdomen over shorter darker hairs. Males have white-tipped hairs evenly distributed on the upper abdomen. Morphotype 1 is more commonly found in Brazil, morphotype 2 in Ecuador and Peru, but this is not an absolute difference. Morphotype 2 is the form previously known as A. urticans.|$|R
