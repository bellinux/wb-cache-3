5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that <b>Lexer</b> and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of <b>Lexer,</b> has also repeatedly warned <b>Lexer</b> that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storms}} approach, early storms knock out the city's primary power {{generating}} plant, and Benson {{is forced to}} negotiate with <b>Lexer</b> for even more power. Not realizing the devastating nature of the storms coming, London sets out to force <b>Lexer</b> {{to listen to his}} warnings by hacking the system and causing a cascading chain reaction that knocks out all of the power in Chicago. Goodman and his team are unable to warn the citizens that the storms have formed into a category 6 hurricane over the Great Lakes and will hit Chicago head on.|$|E
5|$|Perl has a Turing-complete grammar because parsing can be {{affected}} by run-time code executed during the compile phase. Therefore, Perl cannot be parsed by a straight Lex/Yacc lexer/parser combination. Instead, the interpreter implements its own <b>lexer,</b> which coordinates with a modified GNU bison parser to resolve ambiguities in the language.|$|E

50|$|ANTLR can {{generate}} <b>lexers,</b> parsers, tree parsers, and combined lexer-parsers. Parsers can automatically generate parse trees or abstract syntax trees {{which can be}} further processed with tree parsers. ANTLR provides a single consistent notation for specifying <b>lexers,</b> parsers, and tree parsers. This is in contrast with other parser/lexer generators and adds greatly to the tool's ease of use.|$|R
40|$|Compiler toolkits make it {{possible}} to rapidly develop compilers and translators for new programming languages. Although there exist elegant toolkits for modular and extensible parsers, compiler developers must often resort to ad-hoc solutions when extending or composing <b>lexers.</b> This paper presents MetaLexer, a new modular lexical specification language and associated tool. MetaLexer allows programmers to define <b>lexers</b> in a modular fashion. MetaLexer modules can be used to break the lexical specification of a language into a collection smaller modular lexical specifications. Control is passed between the modules using the concept of meta-tokens and meta-lexing. MetaLexer modules are also extensible. MetaLexer has two key features: it abstracts lexical state transitions out of semantic actions and it makes modules extensible by introducing multiple inheritance. We have constructed a MetaLexer tool which converts MetaLexer specifications to the popular JFlex lexical specification language and we have used our tool to create <b>lexers</b> for three real programming languages and their extensions: AspectJ (and two AspectJ extensions), Matlab (and the AspectMatlab extension), and MetaLexer itself. The new specifications are easier to read, are extensible, and require much less action code than the originals...|$|R
5|$|Harkin realizes what {{happened}} to the power and rushes to find London, while Benson and Secretary Abbott gather energy from a multitude of other companies to get around the breakdown at <b>Lexer.</b> Unaware of what each party is doing, London quickly reverses the hacks {{at the same time as}} the energy starts flowing in from other companies. This overloads the system, knocking out the entire Midwest power grid as the storm hits the city and London is killed in the process.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mitch Benson (Thomas Gibson), the Chief of Operations at Midwest Electric, is {{struggling}} to keep power going to the residents because the six-week heat wave is straining the system and residents are refusing to follow power conservation requests. To get more energy, he {{is working with the}} company's largest supplier, <b>Lexer,</b> but the company's CEO is trying {{to find new ways to}} profit from this crisis. Benson also finds himself caught in a conflict of interest as he is having an affair with the Lexer's public relations representative, Rebecca Kerns (Chandra West).|$|E

50|$|As well as <b>lexers</b> and parsers, ANTLR {{can be used}} to {{generate}} tree parsers. These are recognizers that process abstract syntax trees which can be automatically generated by parsers. These tree parsers are unique to ANTLR and greatly simplify the processing of abstract syntax trees.|$|R
50|$|The Lex {{tool and}} its {{compiler}} {{is designed to}} generate code for fast lexical analysers based on a formal description of the lexical syntax. It is generally considered insufficient for applications with {{a complex set of}} lexical rules and severe performance requirements. For example, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) uses hand-written <b>lexers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Lexers</b> and parsers {{are most}} often used for compilers, but {{can be used for}} other {{computer}} language tools, such as prettyprinters or linters. Lexing can be divided into two stages: the scanning, which segments the input sequence into groups and categorizes these into token classes; and the evaluating, which converts the raw input characters into a processed value.|$|R
50|$|Matthias <b>Lexer</b> (18 October 1830 - 16 April 1892), later Matthias von <b>Lexer</b> (from 1885), was a German lexicographer, {{author of}} the {{principal}} dictionary of the Middle High German language, Mittelhochdeutsches Handwörterbuch von Matthias <b>Lexer,</b> completed in 1878 in three volumes. This dictionary was founded upon {{the base of the}} Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch by Benecke, Müller and Zarncke, completed in 1866 in three volumes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} programming, the <b>lexer</b> hack (as {{opposed to}} [...] "a <b>lexer</b> hack") describes a common {{solution to the}} problems in parsing ANSI C, due to the reference grammar being context-sensitive. In C, classifying a sequence of characters as a variable name or a type name requires contextual information of the phrase structure, which prevents one from having a context-free <b>lexer.</b>|$|E
50|$|These tools yield {{very fast}} development, {{which is very}} {{important}} in early development, both to get a working <b>lexer</b> and because a language specification may change often. Further, they often provide advanced features, such as pre- and post-conditions which are hard to program by hand. However, an automatically generated <b>lexer</b> may lack flexibility, and thus may require some manual modification, or an all-manually written <b>lexer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Today regexes {{are widely}} {{supported}} in programming languages, text processing programs (particular <b>lexers),</b> advanced text editors, {{and some other}} programs. Regex support {{is part of the}} standard library of many programming languages, including Java and Python, and is built into the syntax of others, including Perl and ECMAScript. Implementations of regex functionality is often called a regex engine, and a number of libraries are available for reuse.|$|R
50|$|Lexical {{analysis}} mainly segments {{the input}} stream of characters into tokens, simply grouping the characters into pieces and categorizing them. However, the lexing may be significantly more complex; most simply, <b>lexers</b> may omit tokens or insert added tokens. Omitting tokens, notably whitespace and comments, is very common, when {{these are not}} needed by the compiler. Less commonly, added tokens may be inserted. This is done mainly to group tokens into statements, or statements into blocks, to simplify the parser.|$|R
50|$|Examples of domain-specific {{languages}} include HTML, Logo for pencil-like drawing, Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages, MATLAB and GNU Octave for matrix programming, Mathematica, Maple and Maxima for symbolic mathematics, Specification and Description Language for reactive {{and distributed}} systems, spreadsheet formulas and macros, SQL for relational database queries, YACC grammars for creating parsers, regular expressions for specifying <b>lexers,</b> the Generic Eclipse Modeling System for creating diagramming languages, Csound for sound and music synthesis, and the input languages of GraphViz and GrGen, software packages used for graph layout and graph rewriting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{solution}} generally {{consists of}} feeding {{information from the}} semantic symbol table back into the <b>lexer.</b> That is, rather than functioning as a pure one-way pipeline from the <b>lexer</b> to the parser, there is a backchannel from semantic analysis back to the <b>lexer.</b> This mixing of parsing and semantic analysis is generally regarded as inelegant, {{which is why it}} is called a [...] "hack".|$|E
5000|$|Storable state. [...] re2c {{supports}} both pull-model lexers (when <b>lexer</b> runs without interrupts {{and pulls}} more input as necessary) and push-model lexers (when <b>lexer</b> is periodically stopped and resumed to parse new chunks of input).|$|E
50|$|In older {{languages}} such as ALGOL, {{the initial}} stage was instead line reconstruction, which performed unstropping and removed whitespace and comments (and had scannerless parsers, with no separate <b>lexer).</b> The/se steps are now done {{as part of}} the <b>lexer.</b>|$|E
30|$|Though NICAD {{has proved}} to {{effectively}} detect the function clones, the initial phases employ an external parser. Whereas, the proposed method uses a hand-coded parser, external <b>lexers</b> or parsers have not been deployed. Moreover, NICAD tool did not classify the clones types- 1, 2 or 3 as specified in the literature. Instead of that, the tool fixed some threshold value. If the threshold value is 0.0 then Roy called it as exact clones (type- 1). Then Roy matches with threshold value 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and called it as 10 %, 20 %, 30 % of dissimilarity in the clones respectively. It is able to detect near-missed clones (type- 3) but fails to detect type- 2 and type- 4 clones.|$|R

40|$|In reverse engineering, parsing may be {{partially}} done to extract lightweight source models. Parsing code containing preprocessing directives, syntactical errors and embedded languages is a di#cult task using context-free grammars. Several researchers have proposed {{some form of}} lexical analyzer to parse such code. We present a lightweight tool, called RegReg, based on a hierarchy of <b>lexers</b> described by tagged regular expressions. By using tags, the automatically generated parse tree can be easily manipulated. The ability to control the matching rule mechanism for each regular expression increases e#- ciency and disambiguation choices. RegReg is lightweight as it uses a minimal number of features and its implementation uses only deterministic automaton. It has been implemented in Scheme which allows extending the tool in a functional programming style. We demonstrate how RegReg {{can be used to}} implement island and fuzzy parsing. RegReg is publicly available under a BSD-like license...|$|R
5000|$|The {{off-side}} rule (blocks {{determined by}} indenting) {{can be implemented}} in the <b>lexer,</b> as in Python, where increasing the indenting results in the <b>lexer</b> emitting an INDENT token, and decreasing the indenting results in the <b>lexer</b> emitting a DEDENT token. These tokens correspond to the opening brace [...] and closing brace [...] in languages that use braces for blocks, and means that the phrase grammar {{does not depend on}} whether braces or indenting are used. This requires that the <b>lexer</b> hold state, namely the current indent level, and thus can detect changes in indenting when this changes, and thus the lexical grammar is not context-free: INDENT-DEDENT depend on the contextual information of prior indent level.|$|E
50|$|Generally lexical grammars are context-free, {{or almost}} so, and thus require no looking back or ahead, or backtracking, which allows a simple, clean, and {{efficient}} implementation. This also allows simple one-way communication from <b>lexer</b> to parser, without needing any information flowing {{back to the}} <b>lexer.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{more complex}} {{example is the}} <b>lexer</b> hack in C, where the token class of a {{sequence}} of characters cannot be determined until the semantic analysis phase, since typedef names and variable names are lexically identical but constitute different token classes. Thus in the hack, the <b>lexer</b> calls the semantic analyzer (say, symbol table) and checks if the sequence requires a typedef name. In this case, information must flow back not from the parser only, but from the semantic analyzer back to the <b>lexer,</b> which complicates design.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first fully general {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} incremental lexical analysis. Our approach utilizes existing generators of (batch) lexical analyzers to derive the information needed by an incremental run-time system. No changes to the generator’s algorithms or run-time mechanism are required. The entire pattern language of the original tool is supported, including such features as multiple user-defined states, backtracking, ambiguity tolerance, and non-regular pattern recognition. No a priori bound is placed on the amount of lookahead; dependencies are tracked dynamically as required. This combined flexibility makes it possible to specify the lexical rules for real programming languages in a natural and expressive manner. The incremental <b>lexers</b> produced by our approach require little additional storage, run in optimal time, accommodate arbitrary (mixed) structural and textual modifications, and can retain conceptually unchanged tokens within the updated regions through aggressive reuse. We present a correctness proof and a complete performance analysis and discuss the use of this algorithm as part of a system for fine-grained incremental recompilation...|$|R
40|$|For decades programmers {{have had}} access to production-quality tools for {{generating}} <b>lexers</b> and parsers from high-level declarative specifications. Recent work on nano-pass compiler frameworks [3] {{makes it possible to}} develop a many-pass compiler using a grammar-based domain-specific language. Yet we still do not have mature, flexible tools for generating efficient type checkers and type inferencers from a high-level description (ideally, directly from the typing judgements). Although researchers use logic programming, term writing, and proof assis-tants to express type systems in a declarative fashion, in practice developers— including computer science researchers—write production type inferencers and type checkers by hand using general-purpose programming languages. This point was driven home for one of us during development of the compiler for Harlan [2] (a language for high-level GPGPU programming). After defining the type system for Harlan’s region-based memory management system, we wanted to generate a type inferencer from the typing judgements. We knew of no too...|$|R

Most parser frameworks can parse a context-free language generated by different context-free grammars. However, many languages are not context-free. One important class of such languages is layout-sensitive languages (e. g. Python, Haskell), in which the structure of code depends on indenta-tion and whitespace. The parsers (and <b>lexers)</b> of this kind of languages are not declaratively specified but hand-tuned to account for layout-sensitivity. To support parsing of layout-sensitive languages, we propose an extensio...|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, lexical {{analysis is}} the process of converting a sequence of characters (such as in a computer program or web page) into a sequence of tokens (strings with an assigned and thus identified meaning).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tool called Elex(Prolog) to construct tokenizers (lexical analysers, scanners, <b>lexers)</b> in Prolog.

It also compares Elex(Prolog) to the only alternative Prolog scanner generator that we are aware of: plex. 1 Motivation The argumentation for developing Elex(Prolog) consists of three steps: 1. Tokenization is a separate programming task (separate from reading input on the one hand, and parsing on the other hand). 2. Scanner generators are useful to create such tokenizers automatically {{on the basis of}} a number of regular expressions. 3. Multilingual scanner generators have a number of advantages over language specific tools. In many (Prolog) programs, the problem arises to analyse input in some format.
