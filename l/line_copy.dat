50|$|The {{obvious reason}} for the need of {{information}} policy deals with the legal issues that {{can be associated with}} the advancement of technology.

A technique published by Bushinsky in 1947 produces excellent results with chalks containing a trace of clay minerals.

40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer is}} a highly {{aggressive}} disease characterized by poor prognosis and vast genetic instability. Recent microarray-based, genome-wide surveys have identified multiple recurrent copy number aberrations in pancreatic cancer; however, the target genes are, for the most part, unknown. Here, we characterized the 19 q 13 amplicon in pancreatic cancer to identify putative new drug targets. Copy number increases at 19 q 13 were quantitated in 16 pancreatic cancer cell lines and 31 primary tumors by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cell <b>line</b> <b>copy</b> number data delineated a 1. 1 Mb amplicon, the presence of which was also validated in 10 % of primary pancreatic tumors. Comprehensive expression analysis by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR indicated that seven transcripts within this region had consistently elevated expression levels in the amplified versus nonamplified cell lines. High-throughput loss-of-function screen by RNA interference was applied across the amplicon to identify genes whose down-regulation affected cell viability. This screen revealed five genes whose down-regulation led to significantly decreased cell viability in the amplified PANC- 1 cells {{but not in the}} nonamplified MiaPaca- 2 cells, suggesting the presence of multiple biologically interesting genes in this region. Of these, the transcriptional regulator intersex-like (IXL) was consistently overexpressed in amplified cells and had the most dramatic effect on cell viability. IXL silencing also resulted in G 0 -G 1 cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis in PANC- 1 cells. These findings implicate IXL as a novel amplification target gene in pancreatic cancer and suggest that IXL is required for cancer cell survival in 19 q 13 -amplified tumors.

40|$|In {{the present}} study a new test is {{proposed}} and tested, which requires ability to use information both from kinesthesia and from mental rotation of previously produced cyclic movements over a distinct trajectory. This <b>Line</b> <b>Copy</b> Test (LICT) was performed by 58 children aged 7 - 11 years. For the S-part, the participants first had to make movements till they reached a barrier {{and then they were}} required to reproduce the same (S) movements without the barrier. For the O-part of the test the participants had to rely on an internal representation of a felt trajectory length, and reproduce the movement orthogonal (O) to the ones felt. Trajectory Length Error (TLE) and variable error (VE) were measured. Furthermore, results of the LICT were correlated to the Kinesthetic Acuity Test and a pegboard task. The general finding was that the TLE, capturing the spatial calibration of the movement, and the VE, used as a measure of noise or inconsistency in the 10 reproductions, was largest for the youngest children, but this developmental effect was not significant in the O-part of the test. Although participants of all age groups made much larger TLE in the rotated task (O-part) than in the LICT_S-part, the VE was much smaller. This can be explained by assuming that different underlying control mechanisms underlie each task. Also differences in correlations of the two parts of the test with the other measures infer that they measure dissimilar underlying entities. It is likely that at least some portion of the increased movement variability in the S-part seen during development in young children can be attributed to partly unstable kinesthetic representations for hand movements. The finding that no significant development was found on the O-part indicates that changes in the use of internal models must occur outside the age window studied. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has suggested both links {{and differences between}} children's <b>copying</b> of <b>line</b> diagrams and their drawings of solid objects. If the diagram represents a familiar object, children make more errors than when copying a diagram of a nonobject or unfamiliar object, {{as if they are}} drawing from their representation of the object rather than copying the surface features of the diagram. However, copying a diagram yields fewer and different types of errors than drawing the equivalent solid, which suggests a different process. In Experiment 1 (n = 72), possible relations between copying and drawing are investigated by asking children to draw a solid cube, then to copy or trace a line diagram of the cube in oblique projection, and finally to draw the solid again. Copying was better than drawing, and there was positive transfer to a subsequent drawing. Tracing was very accurate, but transfer to drawing did not occur, possibly because of the automatic nature of tracing. In Experiment 2 (n = 120) different groups received versions of the copying task that differed in the extent to which temporal order of <b>line</b> <b>copying</b> was structured. Asking children to <b>copy</b> the <b>lines</b> in a systematic order led to improved copies, but this performance did not carry over to a subsequent drawing of the solid. In contrast, when temporal ordering of <b>line</b> <b>copying</b> was not manipulated, there was positive transfer from copying to the subsequent drawing. In Experiment 3 (n = 80), provision of structure that emphasized faces by color-groupings of lines or coloring faces led to improved copies and did not hinder transfer to drawing the solid. Experiment 4 (n = 90) showed that in a solid drawing task emphasis on faces but not edges produced a positive effect, both on the immediate drawing and on a subsequent drawing of a plain cube. We conclude that emphasis on order of <b>line</b> <b>copying</b> improves performance in a copying task because in that case line-to-line matching is an important element of the skill, whereas this does not aid drawing of the solid object, in which the focus is primarily on representation of faces and their interrelations...|$|R
