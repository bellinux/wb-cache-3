25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 21 October 1969, New York radio station WABC's disc jockey Roby Yonge {{discussed}} the rumour on the air for over an hour before being pulled off the air for breaking format. At that time of night, WABC's signal covered a wide <b>listening</b> <b>area</b> and could be heard in 38 states and, at times, in other countries. Later that day, the Beatles' press office issued statements denying the rumour which were widely reported by national and international media.|$|E
25|$|Small {{listening}} rooms {{suffer a}} paucity of low frequency resonances with gaps between them, so another complementary method is adding a subwoofer to drive the room resonances from an optimal physical location that minimizes ripple in the frequency response at the listening position. Yet another complementary method is splitting an existing subwoofer allocation up into multiple smaller subwoofers in spatially separated locations that increase the degrees of freedom available to tune the response with. Multiple subwoofers also tend to smooth the bass response across a larger <b>listening</b> <b>area</b> and are often easier to place for good bass response than a single larger subwoofer (or no subwoofer).|$|E
25|$|ABC Riverina, is {{the local}} ABC station in Griffith, {{servicing}} the entire MIA region. It broadcasts a local breakfast show and a local morning show each weekday broadcast from the ABC studios in Wagga Wagga. Wednesday and Saturday's local morning show is also broadcast to each station on the ABC Local Radio network enabling listeners from outside of the local <b>listening</b> <b>area</b> to call into the popular gardening talk back program. ABC Riverina also has a local news service, produced by local journalists. As well as rural reports, The station also airs a local Saturday breakfast show, which {{is followed by a}} local Saturday morning sports program. Apart from local programming, ABC Riverina takes national programs like AM, Conversations, The World Today, PM, Nightlife, Overnights, Grandstand, Saturday Night Country and Australia All Over along with a mid-afternoon program, an evening show and a weekend morning program, all broadcast from Sydney, along with a drive program, broadcast from regional NSW. Other national ABC services that are available in Griffith on separate FM frequencies include Triple J, RN, ABC Classic FM and ABC NewsRadio.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to {{serving as a}} training unit for TSU students, the station was established to serve the university at the program level {{as well as the}} community by presenting various types of TSU athletics, educational, cultural and social programs to a primarily <b>listening</b> <b>area</b> within a [...] radius of the university. A 1973 survey indicated that radio was generally the preferred source of information of African-Americans, particularly those with less than a high school education. By the late 1970s, the station had secured an ample audience and programming increased in scope. At the same time, the station increased its power range from 10 watts to 18,500 watts. According to the Arbitron Rating Service (ARS), KTSU has an audience of 244,700 listeners and is number one overall of Houston and Galveston stations for its Sunday format and its Friday format of Golden Oldies.|$|E
2500|$|Electrostatic {{loudspeakers}} use a {{high voltage}} electric field (rather than a magnetic field) {{to drive a}} thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning. [...] However, their optimum <b>listening</b> <b>area</b> is small {{and they are not}} very efficient speakers. [...] They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitationsâ€”the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency. [...] This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.|$|E
