It utilizes a terminal emulator application to send characters, with flow control set to off, to the serial port and receive the same back.

5000|$|In telecommunications, loopback, or a loop, is a {{hardware}} or software method which feeds a received signal or data {{back to the}} sender. It is used as an aid in debugging physical connection problems. As a test, many data communication devices can be configured to send specific patterns (such as all ones) on an interface and can detect the reception of this signal on the same port. This is called a <b>loopback</b> <b>test</b> and can be performed within a modem or transceiver by connecting its output to its own input. A circuit between two points in different locations may be tested by applying a test signal on the circuit in one location, and having the network device at the other location send a signal back through the circuit. If this device receives its own signal back, this proves that the circuit is functioning.|$|E

This system will be an imitation of the SHiP (Search for Hidden Particle) DAQ (Data Acquisition) system led by CERN. The practical implementation is to mainly apply Altera Cyclone V GT development board attached with SFP+ daughter card to achieve accurate timing and high speed performance. Experiments include three <b>loopback</b> <b>test</b> implementations. <b>Loopback</b> <b>test</b> is the simplest technique to assess a channel's integration. The first one is the Ethernet <b>loopback</b> <b>test.</b> An Ethernet card daughter board is inserted to the HSMC port of the Cyclone V GT development board. After that, a SFP card is applied alternatively on the same port to do the similar <b>loopback</b> <b>test</b> but {{at a much higher}} speed via optical fibers. And finally, a more advanced XAUI to SFP+ card daughter board will be used to replace the previous SFP card {{in order to get a}} further speed improvement at around 10 Gbps. The last part is being implemented to check whether the system can distribute clock and data even on higher transfer rates. An alternative, more appropriate, DE 4 FPGA development board is also used for the last experiment part apart from Cyclone V. The system is implemented by Altera Cyclone V GT board, Altera DE 4 board, Terasic Ethernet-HSMC board, Terasic SFP-HSMC card and Dual XAUI to SFP+ HSMC card. The design is built and programmed by the Quartus II 13. 1 and Nios II Software Build Tool.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Loopback</b> <b>tests</b> for a {{differential}} mixed-signal Device Under Test (DUT) {{have rarely}} been attempted, since any imbalance introduced by a Design for Test (DfT) circuitry on differential signaling delivers an imperfect sinusoidal wave to the DUT input, thereby degrading the DUT performance. In addition, this methodology inherently suffers from fault masking. These problems result in low test accuracy and serious yield loss. This paper presents a novel methodology for efficient prediction of individual DUT dynamic performance parameters with a Radio-Frequency (RF) transformer in loopback mode {{to overcome the}} imbalance problem of DfT circuitry. Cascaded RF transformer in loopback mode produces differently weighted loopback responses, which are used to characterize the DUT dynamic performance. Hardware measurement results show that this approach can be effectively used to predict the specifications of a DUT. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{essentials}} of the on-chip <b>loopback</b> <b>test</b> for integrated RF transceivers are presented. The available on-chip baseband processor {{serves as a}} tester while the RF front-end is under test enabled by on-chip test attenuator {{and in some cases}} by an offset mixer, too. Various system-level tests, like BER, EVM or spectral measurements are discussed. By using this technique in mass production, the RF test equipment can be largely avoided and the test cost reduced. Different variants of the loopback setup including the bypassing technique and RF detectors to boost the chip testability are considered. The existing limitations and tradeoffs are discussed in terms of test feasibility, controllability, and observability versus the chip performance. The fault-oriented approach supported by sensitization technique is put in contrast to the functional test. Also the impact of production tolerances is addressed in terms of a simple statistical model and the detectability thresholds. The paper is based on the present and previous work of the authors, largely revised and upgraded to provide a comprehensive description of the on-chip <b>loopback</b> <b>test.</b> Simulation examples of practical communication transceivers such as WLAN and EDGE under test are also included. © 2009 IEEE.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of wireless communication integrated circuits is increasing {{day by day}} due to the trend of multifunction and multistandard support. This has not only increased the production cost of these RFICs but the testing cost is also increased significantly, as much advanced test equipments and instruments are needed {{to carry out the}} sophisticated performance tests. To avoid this higher cost and to reduce the test time, the alternative is to perform on-chip test.. In RF transceivers, loopback is an on-chip test technique in which Tx signal, instead of radiating through antenna is fed to the Rx chain through a test attenuator (TA) during the test mode. A highly linear offset mixer is needed to implement this on-chip <b>loopback</b> <b>test</b> for these transceivers. The aim of this thesis work is to design a highly linear upconversion offset mixer for <b>loopback</b> <b>test</b> in CMOS technology. This mixer is designed for Bluetooth and GSM/EDGE standards. Few highly linear mixer architectures were simulated in 0. 35 um AMS process using Cadence SpectreRF software. When compared with active mixers, passive mixer consumes no dc power and there is significant reduction in silicon area overhead. The thesis presents a highly linear passive mixer with very low conversion loss and noise figure. The mixer is designed in 0. 13 um AMS CMOS process for higher cut off frequency and improved conversion loss. Pre and Post layout simulation results of the designed mixer are presented...|$|E

This paper presents an efficient <b>loopback</b> <b>test</b> methodology which enables individual characterization of dynamic performance of Devices Under Test (DUTs) in loopback mode.

40|$|International audienceFor {{more than}} 30 years, the {{electronics}} {{industry has been}} driven by the development and the exploitation of the permanent shrink in the fabrication processes such as CMOS technologies (nanotechnologies, “More Moore” [...] .). The next steps requiring huge investments, only a few European companies will be able to compete with majors worldwide. But this monolithic approach cannot meet one of the main market needs: more functions in a same chip. Indeed, only the use of heterogeneous technologies (Analog, RF, MEMS) in a single chip is suitable. Fortunately, the micro-systems (SiP, “More than Moore”) approach is now adopted, which permits to propose new solutions and new applications at reasonable costs. In this tutorial, we will at first give an overview of the existing and emerging technologies of micro-systems, illustrated by some typical examples. Although promising, we will subsequently list the major challenges posed by the technologies, from both technical and economical perspectives.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{reliability}} of a wireless sensing unit by testing it in a real-world university laboratory environment. The unit employs off-the-shelf products for their key components, while a flexible payload scheme was adopted for radio packet transmission to maximize throughput and minimize latency. The testing consists of two main parts: (1) a series of loopback tests using two off-the-shelf radio components with carrier frequencies of 900 MHz and 2. 4 GHz, respectively, and (2) wireless transmission of a shake table response to a periodic swept sine excitation. The performance of the wireless channel is examined in {{each part of the}} study. Through this experimental investigation, it is validated that a <b>loopback</b> <b>test</b> may be used as a fast prototyping approach to characterize the complex transmitting environment of a structure in which a wireless monitoring system is installed. Various factors leading to signal attenuation are ranked according to their effects on packet delivery performance. Transmitting range and building materials are among the leading factors causing packet loss (and therefore data loss) in this specific testing environment. The severity of interference from 802. 11 b wireless systems in close proximity to the wireless sensing unit was investigated. Some preliminary results on the influence of operating rotating machinery and human activities are to wireless sensors were investigated. The results presented herein offer a guideline for applying wireless sensing within real-world structures so that {{the reliability of}} the wireless monitoring system is maximized. Due to uncertainties associated with the reliability of wireless communications, statistical analysis is performed on the collected time histories to reveal the underlying patterns associated with data loss. Temporal correlations of data loss were measured and found {{to be related to the}} adopted radio. A statistical distribution of the size of consecutive lost data points was further derived from the collected data. Such results have identified the need to further develop: (1) reliable communication protocols to reduce these losses in data and information, and (2) robust data processing and system identification tools to anticipate and explicitly handle any data loss.

The methods are used to develop a design approach that utilizes a test module structure in two blocks. A core logic block is designed using a multi-GHz FPGA that provides control functions. Another block called the â application specificâ logic block includes components required for specific test functions. Six test functions are demonstrated in this research: high-speed signal multiplexing, <b>loopback</b> <b>testing,</b> jitter injection, amplitude adjustment, and timing adjustment. Furthermore, the test module {{is designed to be}} compatible with existing ATE infrastructure, thus retaining full ATE capabilities for standard tests. Experimental results produced by this research provide evidence that the methods are sufficiently capable of enhancing the multi-GHz testing capabilities of ATE and are extendable into future ATE development.
