40|$|AbstractNearby Jin Mao {{tower and}} the World Financial Center, the 632 -meter, 121 -story mixed-use Shanghai tower {{will be the}} tallest super tall tower in the new Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone of Shanghai. Due to the super tall height, curved façade and {{spiraling}} form of the Shanghai tower project, wind is the dominant lateral load and governed {{many aspects of the}} structural design. To precisely determine the design wind loads, a detailed wind climate study was conducted. The influences of typhoon events and typhoon profiles were considered in the wind climate study. Due to its long structural period, the across-wind load of the Shanghai tower project is prominent. Aerodynamic optimization studies were conducted to reduce the correlation of vortex shedding along the building height, and thus reduce the across-wind building response. The optimization results show that the across wind load can be effectively reduced with certain building configuration. Detailed wind tunnel studies, including HFFB and HFPI studies, high Reynolds number tests and aeroelastic model tests, were conducted to accurately capture the wind load on the building. The wind load parameters, such as the Shape factor, Strouhal number and the terrain type, were obtained and derived from the wind tunnel studies. The wind load and wind induced structural responses obtained from the wind tunnel studies were then compared with those calculated based on Chinese load code. The design criteria for the ultimate <b>limit</b> <b>check</b> and serviceability <b>limit</b> <b>check</b> of Shanghai tower for wind loads were discussed. Finally, the building vibration under wind load and the related human comfort problem is addressed. Different human comfort criteria are compared and the building acceleration results from both the wind tunnel tests and code-based calculation are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} check memory {{references}} against their associated array/buffer bounds helps programmers to detect programming errors involving address overruns {{early on and}} thus avoid many difficult bugs down the line. This paper proposes a novel approach called Cash to the array bound checking problem that exploits the segmentation feature in the virtual memory hardware of the X 86 architecture. The Cash approach allocates a separate segment to each static array or dynamically allocated buffer, and generates the instructions for array references {{in such a way}} that the segment <b>limit</b> <b>check</b> in X 86 ’s virtual memory protection mechanism performs the necessary array bound checking for free. In those cases that hardware bound checking is not possible, it falls back to software bound checking. As a result, Cash does not need to pay per-reference software checking overhead in most cases. However, the Cash approach incurs a fixed set-up overhead for each use of an array, which may involve multiple array references. The existence of this overhead requires compiler writers to judiciously apply the proposed technique to minimize the performance cost of array bound checking. This paper presents the detailed design and implementation of the Cash compiler, and a comprehensive evaluation of various performance tradeoffs associated with the proposed array bound checking technique. For the set of complicated network applications we tested, including Apache, Sendmail, Bind, etc., the latency penalty of Cash’s bound checking mechanism is between 2. 5 % to 9. 8 % when compared with the baseline case that does not perform any bound checking. ...|$|E

Ground systems which monitor on-orbit vehicles must process, analyze, display, and archive the telemetry data received during contacts with the satellites. Data from perhaps thousands of individual measurands must be extracted from very complex wavetrains and processed during a live contact. Most commercially available telemetry systems are not well suited to handling satellite wavetrains because they were built for range telemetry and flight test applications which typically deal with limited numbers of measurands. This paper describes the design of a software system which was built specifically to process satellite telemetry. The database-driven system performs full decommutation of very complex wavetrains entirely in software. The system provides for defining the satellite vehicle's telemetry in multiple databases which define the wavetrain formats, the measurands themselves, how they are to be processed, and associated data conversion and calibration information. The database accommodates the complexities typically found in satellite telemetry such as multiple wavetrain formats, embedded streams, measurand dependencies, segmented measurands, and supercommutated, subcommutated, and sub-subcommutated data. A Code Generator builds a set of control structures from the wavetrain and measurand definitions in the database. It then generates highly optimized in-line software libraries for processing the satellite vehicle's telemetry. These libraries are linked to a Server process for run-time execution.

40|$|The ocean {{monitoring}} community requires {{high quality}} data that is Data Management and Communications (DMAC) - compliant for both near real time (ex., weather forecasting and warnings) and climate data records (ex., comprehensive delayed mode). SAIC {{has developed a}} flexible and cost effective automated data quality assurance (ADQA) system {{that can be used}} to assess the quality of marine observations and provide quality controlled data to a wide variety of end users. For example, if a researcher needs data sets from different sources for a modeling project, ADQA provides a means of characterizing the relative quality of these input sets. These characterizations are necessary to enable the researcher to determine the cumulative accuracy of his modeling output. The system is scalable and can be used by a single data provider or a large data center. For the U. S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), this approach is well-suited for a diverse science community employing many different methods to characterize the quality of their data products. The ADQA system has been implemented by integrating a set of data quality algorithms based upon National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) Technical Document 03 - 02 "Handbook of Automated Data Quality Control Checks and Procedures of the National Data Buoy Center" into a processing system that was created using the CALIPSO science data processing framework developed by SAIC. The CALIPSO framework is actually a library of reusable components that provide the core non-science functionality of any science data processing system. This design separates the science processing components from the basic, reusable system infrastructure and allows for the addition or removal of algorithms with relative ease. The generic infrastructure of the framework includes substantial core functionality (ex., read inputs, organize/format data, run algorithms, write output, handle errors and generate metadata) that is common to many science data management applications and is easily configurable to work with a wide variety of marine instruments and science data sets. The basic architecture includes the following subsystems: Input, Control, Data Store and Output. The Input subsystem uses an American Standard Code for Information Exchange (ASCII) configuration file to identify input parameters and define the input file format. As a data record is read from the input file, it is processed into discrete parameters and stored in the Data Store subsystem. Thus, the data are readily available within Framework. The current data formats are: Network Common Data Form (NetCDF), Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), Sensor Metadata Language (SensorML) and ASCII. However, the flexibility of the framework allows for the inclusion of additional data formats without having to redesign the entire ADQA system. The Control subsystem provides the linkage between Framework and the algorithm library and orchestrates the processing activities between the various Framework subsystems and the Algorithm Library. This subsystem balances the flexibility and performance of the ADQA system as it readily accommodates algorithm and data product additions with minimal code changes. The Store Data subsystem is implemented using common data structure for application specific data structures assembled from standard building blocks. Thus, allowing other Framework elements to be generic and configurable. This architectural approach facilitates changing "on the fly" the underlying data structures to allow the addition of parameters or new algorithms. Localized changes to algorithms are made with minimal changes to the input, control, data store and output modules. Furthermore, this subsystem allows parameters to be retrieved by name, consequently, other Framework subsystems and the algorithms in the algorithm library are able to query data structures and retrieve the necessary information. The output subsystem also uses an ASCII configuration file to define the format and content of data products. We are able to add additional data formatwithout having to design the entire ADQA system. The current data formats are: NetCDF, HDF, Sensor and ASCII. The Algorithm Library of the ADQA system was implemented using a modular architecture that encapsulates algorithms into decoupled, re-useable modules while providing the mechanism for assembling them into a working system. We are building a library of re-useable validation algorithms by implementing the algorithms as generic re-useable modules based upon NDBC Technical Document 03 - 02 that can be configured to work with parameters from any source. For example, we have configured a rate and <b>limit</b> <b>check</b> algorithm to process several marine parameters by simply defining the appropriate thresholds. For this paper, we will present a scalable ADQA processing system that is well-suited to address many different methods of characterizing the quality of data products. The system is a modular design that simplifies the integration of additional data quality assurance (DQA) processing components. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Entwicklung und Charakterisierung von Mess-systemen zur Bestimmung einer möglichen Beeinflussung des menschlichen Körpers durch elektromagnetische Felder. Exemplarisch werden anhand von drei Beispielen Messsysteme vorgestellt, mit deren Hilfe diese mögliche Beeinflussung untersucht werden kann. Dabei werden neben thermischen Wirkungen elektromagnetischer Wellen, also der Erwärmung des Gewebes auf Grund absorbierter Feldenergie, auch nicht-thermische Wirkungen, d. h. direkte Wirkungen elektromagnetischer Felder auf den menschlichen Organismus, und Wirkungen auf medizinische Hilfsgeräte (z. B. implantierte Herzschrittmacher) untersucht. Nach einer Einführung in Kapitel 1 wird im Kapitel 2 eine grundsätzliche Beschreibung elektromagnetischer Felder und Wellen entwickelt, aus der die für diese Arbeit relevanten Eigenschaften elektromagnetischer Felder abgeleitet werden. Es werden die Zusammenhänge zwischen Nah- und Fernfeldern dargestellt sowie die Beschreibungen dieser Felder für messtechnische Zwecke. Mit dieser für Messungen geeigneten Beschreibung elektromagnetischer Felder und Wellen im Hochfrequenzbereich (in dieser Arbeit werden nur Frequenzen oberhalb von 1 MHz betrachtet) werden in Kapitel 3 {{nationale}} und internationale Vorschriften und Normen zusammengefasst, die für die weitere Betrachtung von Wirkungen elektromagnetischer Wellen auf den Menschen von Bedeutung sind. Ebenso wird die Methode der Ersatzfeldstärken erläutert und im Zusammenhang mit normativen Vorgaben diskutiert. Ausgehend von der grundsätzlichen Beschreibung elektromagnetische Felder und Wellen und den Forderungen, die sich aus den entsprechenden Normen und Vorschriften ergeben, werden in den sich anschliessenden Kapiteln Messsysteme und Messungen vorgestellt, mit denen eine mögliche Beeinflussung des Menschen durch elektromagnetische Felder bestimmt werden sollen. Gemäß der Unterteilung möglicher Wirkungen in thermische und nicht-thermische sowie Wirkungen auf Medizingeräte, die wiederum direkt den Menschen beeinflussen, wird in den Kapiteln 4 und 5 ein Messsystem entwickelt, mit dessen Hilfe einfach und genau elektrische und magnetische Feldstärken gemessen werden können. Mit diesem Messsystem können genaue Informationen über die Art und v. a. die Stärke der möglicherweise gefährdenden elektromagnetischen Felder gewonnen werden und damit die thermische Wirkungen auf den Menschen ermittelt und gegebenenfalls vermieden werden. Besonderes Augenmerk wird neben der technischen Realisierung eines normgemäßen Messvorgangs auch auf eine mögliche Beeinflussung des Messvorgangs und des Messergebnisses durch den Anwender und das zu messende Signal selbst gelegt. Als Beispiel eines Messsystems zur Bestimmung des Einflusses elektromagnetischer Felder auf Medizingeräte wird in Kapitel 6 ein im Menschen implantierter Herzschrittmacher untersucht. Dabei steht der Vorgang der Störeinkopplung eines äußeren Feldes in den im Menschen implantierten Herzschrittmacher im Vordergrund. Die tatsächliche Störbeeinflussung der Herzschrittmacher-Steuerung und die daraus resultierende mögliche Beeinflussung oder gar die Gefährdung des Herzschrittmacherpatienten muss jedoch auch von medizinischer Seite bewertet werden und wird in dieser Arbeit nicht untersucht. Abschliessend wird in Kapitel 7 ein Messsystem bzw. ein Messaufbau vorgestellt, mit dem versucht wird, nicht-thermische Wirkungen von höchstfrequenten Signalen (77 GHz) auf den Menschen und speziell das vegetative Nervensystem zu untersuchen. Neben den eingesetzten Messsystemen werden auch die Ergebnisse der durchgeführten Untersuchungen präsentiert und diskutiert. This thesis {{deals with}} the development and the characterisation of measurement systems of electromagnetic fields {{for the detection of}} possible influences on the human body. Usually, possible effects are distinguished as thermal or non-thermal. The first describes absorption of electromagnetic power by human body tissue and its heating. This effect is well known and clearly described by suitable measurement procedures. In the case of non-thermal effects, until now no reproducible effects have been described (or found). But nevertheless, especially in public discussions, worries about possible effects like cancer, insomnia, leukaemia or other diseases exist. Additionally to this, the influence of electromagnetic fields on medical aids like cardiac pacemakers is investigated. This is strictly spoken a problem of electromagnetic compatibility between instruments and machines, which directly impacts human health (a negatively influenced pacemaker may be of immediate risk to the patient). In this work, measurement systems and set-ups are presented to detect and - if possible - to quantify possible effects on the human organism. Based on fundamentals of electromagnetic field theory, a suitable description of these fields is derived. For evaluation of these fields, current safety limits of both national and international institutions and their requirements for measurements are presented. In case of thermal effects, absorption of electromagnetic fields and heating of human tissue are well known and described by safety regulations. Therefore this work was focused on the development of a precise and nevertheless easy to use measurement device, which enables an untrained user to check the safety status in terms of corresponding national or international safety limits. By using resistively loaded dipoles and loop antennas, a measurement device (complying with the above requirements - precise and easy measurements -) was developed. Unlike conventional broadband field probes with a flat frequency response, this device utilizes specially loaded dipoles with a specific frequency response which enables a safety <b>limit</b> <b>check</b> without an explicit frequency measurement. By utilizing the distinguished frequency response of the field sensor, it is possible to calculate the difference to the safety limit for a broad frequency range and even for a mix of several signals of different frequencies. To further improve the results of these measurements, possible measurement influences caused by the environment or by improper set-up of the device were taken into account. Considering these influences, an assessment of the achieved results is possible. Currently in Germany the discussion about re-evaluating safety limits concerning the interference of cardiac pacemakers by radio signals of a frequency range between 50 MHz and 500 MHz is going on. For this purpose a suitable coupling model based both on measurements and numerical computations was developed. In this work, the measurement set-up and the results of the corresponding measurements are presented. In order to compare the measurements with numerical calculations, some results of the computations are presented. Since {{it is not possible to}} measure the interference signal at the input of an implanted pacemaker in a patient (without risking the patient's health), a human body model, a so-called phantom was utilized for these measurements to simulate the electromagnetic properties of the human body. The phantom consists of an epoxy resin filled shell containing a specifically designed solution consisting of water, sucrose and sodium chloride. Inside the phantom a specially developed model of a pacemaker with a sensitive input amplifier and voltage measurement unit was implanted. With this set-up it is possible to measure the interference of a pacemaker at the input location in an environment comparable to the human body. The results of measurements using radiation sources in close proximity to the phantom as well as far-field sources producing an incident plane wave are presented. The present safety limits consider only thermal effects, but the public more and more does not preclude possibilities of non-thermal effects on the human body such as headache, insomnia or - much worse - cancer. In the current public opinion it is feared that even very low field strengths might cause these non-thermal effects. Due to very low field strengths, a statistical evaluation of a sufficiently large number of subjects needs to be chosen to detect small and rare effects. This section regarding non-thermal effects on the human body is based on a provocation study. The goal was to determine if signals in the microwave frequency range (a frequency of 77 GHz was regarded) can cause effects on the vegetative nervous system of the human body. For this purpose 50 people were exposed to an intensity of 0. 3 mW/cm². By recording and a subsequent statistical analysis of essential properties of the vegetative nervous system (e. g. pulse, blood pressure, skin conductivity), it was possible to detect any effects, if they exist at all. The development and calibration of the measurement set-up as well as the basic idea of the statistical analysis are presented. Finally, the results of the exposure experiment are shown. The experiment showed that no effect, which means no measurable change of the observed properties within very small ranges, could be detected. For example, this means that a small pulse rate change of ± 0. 6 beats/min could be detected as statistically significant. In summary the data show that in this case (at a frequency of 77 GHz and an intensity of 0. 3 mW/cm²) an effect on the vegetative nervous system can be neglected...|$|E
