5|$|Johnson {{stated that}} {{his goal was}} to win at least 5 percent of the vote, as winning 5 percent would allow Libertarian Party {{candidates}} equal ballot access and federal funding during the next election cycle. In a national Gallup poll of likely registered voters conducted June 7 through June 10, 2012, Johnson took 3% of the vote, while a Gallup poll conducted September 6 through September 9, 2012, showed Johnson taking 1% of <b>likely</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Polling firm Public Policy Polling {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} Giron's district between September 7 and 9, asking <b>likely</b> <b>voters</b> if they supported the recall of Giron, whether they supported various components of the gun control bill, whether they approved of the NRA and Governor Hickenlooper, and who {{they would vote for}} in a hypothetical 2014 gubernatorial election between Hickenlooper and Republican Tom Tancredo, as well as various methodological questions. The results found voters supported recalling Giron by 54% to 42%, with 4% undecided.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of <b>likely</b> <b>voters</b> in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E

25|$|Taxes and {{the economy}} were {{overwhelmingly}} the top issues in this campaign. Corzine's strongest issue was on education, {{but it was the}} most important issue for only 4% of <b>likely</b> <b>voters.</b> Christie attacked Corzine's record of raising taxes, failing to deliver property tax relief, and presiding over a period of unusually high unemployment in the state. Corzine pointed to the global economic recession as the reason for the state's economic troubles. However, Republicans contended that Corzine's policies led to over-taxation and economic decline, causing an out-migration of residents documented in a report by the Edward J.

Snyder was briefly mentioned as a possible pick to be the Republican Party candidate for Vice President of the United States in 2012. His business executive background and 'positive' style have been cited as political assets, with his deeds seen as strengthening the case for electing a business executive candidate as President of the United States. He was also mentioned as a potential Republican Party candidate for President of the United States in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Carney was the Democratic Party {{nominee for}} Delaware's at-large {{seat in the}} United States House of Representatives in 2010.

The seat had been held since 1993 by Republican Michael Castle, who {{declined}} to seek re-election to the House in order {{to run for the}} U.S. Senate seat once held by Vice President Joe Biden. In the first week of October, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll released the results of its opinion research, showing Carney with a 15-point advantage over Urquhart, 51%-36%; well ahead in New Castle County (56-32) but running even with Urquhart (43-43) in the downstate counties of Kent and Sussex. Days before the election, a second Fairleigh Dickinson poll showed Carney leading by 17 percentage points, 53% to 36% among <b>likely</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E

Fifteen percent of those polled were undecided. Conway's five-percentage-point margin held up a month later; just a week before the election, a Bluegrass poll showed 45 percent support for Conway, 40 percent for Bevin, and 6 percent for Curtis. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that Bevin had trailed in every publicly released poll, and political analyst Stephen Voss said that, given the consistency of the data, [...] "Bevin needs a sudden shift in voter preferences if he hopes to win this contest, and he may be dragging down some of his Republican ticket mates as well." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{only two}} weeks {{remaining}} before the primary, a Quinnipiac University poll released May 4 showed Specter's lead against Sestak had significantly narrowed, dropping from 53-32 percent in the previous month to 47-39 percent. A daily tracking poll by Muhlenberg College showed the race as even closer, with Specter supported by 46 percent of <b>likely</b> <b>voters</b> surveyed, and Sestak trailing only four points at 42 percent. The Quinnipiac poll indicated the strongest factor in these changes was that Sestak was gaining better name recognition due to his television commercials. According to the poll, 43 percent of respondents now had a favorable view of him, compared to only 33 percent in March. The day after the poll was released, Sestak unveiled a new television advertisement strongly critical of Specter, highlighting the incumbent Senator's Republican history and showing images of him with George W. Bush and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The commercial featured a clip of Specter saying, [...] "My change in party will enable me to be reelected" [...] and ended with a narrator saying, [...] "Arlen Specter switched parties to save one job: his, not yours." [...] The same week the advertisement ran, T.J. Rooney {{said in an interview}} with Politico that a Sestak primary victory would be [...] "cataclysmic" [...] for the party in the general election, and warned Democratic voters, [...] "If we want to keep this seat in Democratic hands, the only person capable of delivering that victory is Arlen Specter." ...|$|E
