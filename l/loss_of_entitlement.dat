40|$|As VAT {{becomes an}} {{increasingly}} important source of tax revenue world-wide, tax policy makers should be well aware of its strengths and weaknesses. In academia, there is strong consensus that tax exemptions rank among the most problematic features of VAT. The very concept of exemption is already a misrepresentation, because it normally entails the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> to an input VAT credit; exempt supplies are therefore actually “input-taxed”. It is generally accepted that this particular form of occult taxation detrimentally affects economic efficiency and increases administrative complexity. Moreover, VAT as an indirect and impersonal tax on consumption {{is intended to be}} borne by final consumers but it is imposed on business. It will therefore often be questionable who really benefits from the intended relief, and whether there are superior alternatives to VAT exemptions to attain their underlying policy objectives. Even where they can be defended, exemptions are often implemented in an inconsistent fashion. All of these aspects are particularly troublesome in the EU VAT system that suffers from legislative eurosclerosis. The present paper discusses these topics with special emphasis on the EU constitutional and institutional framework. It offers an overview of the current array of exemptions and lays out the relevant economic and legal benchmark for their critical assessment. The paper identifies eight main rationales for tax exemptions and analyzes their merits in the light of those benchmarks. Particular attention is given to considerations of tax equity and social policy, and to exemptions of so-called “hard to tax”-supplies. In a separate section, the paper discusses the detrimental effects of the corresponding denial of input VAT deduction and its eventual justifications. Policy makers are thus provided with clear legal guidance as to which exemptions are required, which are tolerable, and which should be abolished within the framework of EU VAT, and how the defendable ones should be amended. ...|$|E
40|$|WIFO {{studied the}} effects which two schemes {{to reform the}} {{severance}} payment currently proposed to Parliament {{would have on the}} Austrian labour market. Only a few terminated employment relationships currently meet the requirements to qualify for severance payment. An employee giving notice him-/herself is not eligible for severance payment. Eligibility rises in graduated steps with the length of stay in a company: no severance payment is due for employment of less than three years, but it amounts to one year's salary after 25 years of employment. In Austria, about one third of all employment relationships are terminated annually, with most of these employees not eligible for severance payment, since the currently applicable stepped rate acts to the detriment of employees who are employed by the same company for less than three years. Severance payment thus operates rather as a premium for employee loyalty. Two proposals have been submitted to Parliament which aim to bring the severance payment system more in line with high mobility rates and which simultaneously attempt to change severance payments into an old-age pension provision scheme (second pillar). The proposals furnished, respectively, by the SPÖ (Social Democratic Party) and ÖVP (Austrian People's Party) are contribution-based systems. In both models, the employee's entitlement to severance payment grows uniformly with the length of gainful employment. Even when an employee quits, the entitlement remains active in the severance payment fund, although the ÖVP's model precludes the employee from disposing of the money. Under the ÖVP's model, the employer pays contributions only for employees who have worked for the employer for more than a year. While this is an improvement over the current stepped model, it is still detrimental to the desired higher mobility of employees who would thus suffer a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> For mobile and seasonal workers in particular this model grants neither a bridging support nor any additional old age pension provision. After 300 contributory months (25 years), no more contributions need to be paid for the employee. The envisaged slow transition to the new system would reduce wage costs for older employees only in the 26 th year, at a time when demographic projections forecast a severe shortage of workers. Seen from today, the capping will have a long-term effect in the loan and insurance industry, chemicals manufacturing industry, and energy and water utilities. With the maximum severance payment set at one year's salary, just as today, employees of these industries would not be worse off than today. The SPÖ proposal includes all employees in the system, regardless of the period of gainful employment and the type of termination. Employers need to make contributions to the severance payment funds for all employees, from the time they are first employed until the time they leave/retire. The model places greater emphasis on bridging and on additional old-age provision, since entitlements rise with the duration of gainful employment. Almost 71 percent of terminated employment relationships and 23 percent of continuing employment relationships have a duration of less than one year. Short term employment is particularly widespread in the construction industry, tourism, retail trade, data processing, loan and insurance businesses, and producer and other services. A reform of severance payments as envisaged by the SPÖ model would mean additional expenditure for employers, but would offer better security against unemployment and old-age provision to employees of these sectors, whereas this security would be lower if the ÖVP model were implemented.

40|$|Legal rights may erode as {{a result}} of past, uncontested, breach.

In analyzing the effects of such laws, the Article confronts two conflicting intuitions. On the one hand, the "license" to continue breach prospectively encourages opportunism. On the other hand, the risk of erosion may reinforce the rightholder's motivation to take anti-erosion measures, bolstering the credibility of the threat to enforce, thus better preserving the entitlement. The article proves that these two effects of erosion rules always balance out. The same amount of value will be extracted from the right holder irrespective of the law's erosion doctrine. The article also demonstrates the limits of this "irrelevance" claim and the factors that may lead to its collapse.

40|$|The {{notion of}} 'welfare capitalism' {{refers to a}} political-economic regime that {{integrates}} the functions of a capitalist market economy with the functions of a democratic welfare state. The term is commonly used by Esping-Andersen (1990) in The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, {{but it is also}} linked to Marshall's (1950, p. 14) idea of three generations of rights, which all form part of modern citizenship: civil rights, political rights, and social rights. The question that this chapter seeks to address is how social rights, which Esping-Andersen and Marshall understood as the apex of the democratic welfare state, remain bound to the logic of the capitalist market economy. Employing the perspective of the economic sociology of law, it will be argued that the transformation of welfare capitalism over the last few decades has led to a reinterpretation of social rights in the light of economic incentives. To make this point, changes in the financial structure of the welfare state, both on its revenue and expenditure side, will be connected with changes in the moral discourse on citizens¿ rights and duties, which is increasingly informed by economic arguments. The chapter first outlines the analytical framework that connects the language of social rights with the concept of welfare capitalism. In the perspective of the economic sociology of law, scholarship in comparative and critical political economy can be fruitfully integrated and related with the moral-economy approach, which is particularly suited to document a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlements,</b> or accustomed social rights. The following analysis is divided into two parts. The chapter first turns to the revenue side of the welfare state and explores the moral economy of taxation, emphasising changes over time and across different welfare regimes. What we can, by and large, observe, is a move from 'contribution tax' to `exchange tax¿, or a renegotiation between social rights and property rights. The chapter then proceeds to discuss the expenditure side of the welfare state and the moral economy of debt, again focusing on the overall patterns of development. Accordingly, we are not only witnessing a transition 'from welfare to workfare' but also 'from welfare to debtfare', which replaces unconditional social rights or welfare benefits with activation in the labour market and the credit market. The chapter concludes by interpreting the above developments {{in the light of the}} social contract, or social compromise, underlying welfare capitalism...|$|R

40|$|This {{body of work}} {{examines}} {{the concept of an}} inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement,</b> the modern term for a concept that {{can be traced back to}} Plato in 360 BCE (Before Christian Era). Although the concept is advanced and examined in philosophical terms, Plato’s work is also considered to be one of the first and most comprehensive psychological theories of human motivation. A sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is frequently referred to in contemporary literature, and yet there has been a lack of investigations into the nature <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and how it operates in violent men. This investigation set out to rectify the deficiency by examining the concept through four studies. The global purpose of this thesis is to determine if an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related to both violent offending and self-harming behaviour. The first study was designed to refine a definition of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for violent offenders and to determine if there was a qualitative difference in this characteristic between violent offenders and male members of the general public. The study examined twelve domains used to describe an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> It also identified two main themes which were an action theme and an experiential theme. The action theme included actions that were likely to be elicited when an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated. These actions were assault, confrontation and rejection of others. This was particularly so when the domains of anger, respect, power, obedience from subordinates and obedience from family and friends were violated. The experiential theme included emotions and cognition and whether these were expressed in an outward direction towards others or inwardly towards the self. The second study was conducted on archival material from a prison database. It examined the self-harming behaviour of offenders currently incarcerated in Western Australia (WA). This study was conducted to test the assumption that violent offenders are more likely to self-harm than non-violent offenders, using a current cohort. It was revealed that violent offenders self-harm at a far higher rate than incarcerated nonviolent offenders. Of the self-harming offenders, nine out of ten were violent offenders. It was also found that violent offenders were far less likely to have warnings of potential self-harm on the prison database than non-violent offenders. The third study involved the construction and validation of the Sense <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire (SOEQ) on a student population. The purpose of this study was to enable the measurement of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men. The action themes and the domains from the first study formed the basis of the questions. This scale had sound psychometric properties and revealed two statistical factors indicating both attitude and behaviour subscales. Further investigations found differences in levels of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in terms <b>of</b> age and sex. The fourth study was the administration of the SOEQ to violent and non-violent, as well as self-harming and non-self harming, incarcerated offenders. This was to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men as well as to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in self-harming offenders. It was found that violent men have an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in both attitude and behaviour. If their inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated then violence was most likely their first choice. This was particularly likely when the respect, power, forgiveness and anger domains were involved. When examining self-harming behaviour and entitlement, this study found a difference in attitude only. This body of work demonstrated that an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related both to violent offending and self-harming behaviour. Through these investigations different aspects of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> were identified, which included a strong desire for respect, power, admiration and status, as well as a profound aversion to feelings of shame, disrespect and humiliation. A violation of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has the capacity to end in violent behaviour towards others and harm towards the self. These findings show how an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> meets two <b>of</b> the three criteria required to qualify as a criminogenic need: that is, that the characteristic has the ability to distinguish non-criminal from criminal behaviour and has the ability to be measured. This opens the way for further research to investigate the third criterion required to qualify for a criminogenic need, which is whether an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> can be changed...|$|R
