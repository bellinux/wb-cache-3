5|$|Prior to the Lebanese Civil War of 1975–90, {{the party}} was closely allied to the Phalangist Party of Pierre Gemayel and {{generally}} ran joint tickets with the Phalangists, especially in Beirut constituencies with large Armenian populations. The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to {{play an active role}} in the civil war, however, soured relations between the two parties, and the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Forces</b> (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by Bachir Gemayel, Pierre Gemayel's son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud. Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst of the Lebanese civil war, the shadowy guerrilla organization Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide emerged and carried out assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.|$|E

25|$|During the Lebanese Civil War, {{the party}} and its militia were a small but active part of the Maronite-led {{alliance}} fighting the Palestinians represented by the Rejectionist Front and PLO, and its allies in the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) of Kamal Jumblatt. During the early fighting in the war, the party was implicated in the massacres of Karantina and Tel al-Zaatar. In 1977, the main Christian-backed militias (LRP plus the National Liberal Party and the Kataeb Party) formed the Lebanese Front coalition. Their militias joined {{under the name of}} the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Forces,</b> but the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Forces</b> soon fell under the command of Bashir Gemayel and the Phalange.

The Command Council then elected Hobeika to be LF President, and he appointed Geagea to be LF Chief of Staff. In January 1986, Geagea and Hobeika's relationship broke down over Hobeika's support for the pro-Syrian Tripartite Accord, and an internal civil war began. The Geagea-Hobeika Conflict resulted in 800 to 1000 casualties before Geagea secured himself as LF leader and Hobeika fled.
