Meiklejohn saw this as desirable and indicative of abetting nonconformity, and did not attempt to curb it. Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could not intervene. Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities. By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe.|$|E

5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E

Girls {{as young as}} 10 years old are impregnated by rape, and they usually carry these pregnancies to birth.

5000|$|Impiety is a {{perceived}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> proper <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> something considered sacred. Impiety is often {{closely associated with}} sacrilege, {{though it is not}} necessarily a physical action. Impiety cannot be associated with a cult, as it implies a larger belief system was disrespected. One of the Pagan objections to Christianity was that, unlike other mystery religions, early Christians refused to cast a pinch of incense before the images of the gods, an impious act in their eyes. Impiety in ancient civilizations was a civic concern, rather than religious. It was believed that impious actions such as disrespect towards sacred objects or priests could bring down the wrath of the gods.|$|R

The Akha people of South East Asia are an example of those who believe that missionaries are only converting others for personal gain. The Akha people have complained the missionaries are more worried about building a church than building a clinic in a village that is very unhealthy. Many traditional values of the Akha have been lost {{as a result of these}} conversions.

5000|$|As {{the years}} went on and American life {{continued}} to be deeply unfair towards blacks, cynicism towards Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation increased. Perhaps the strongest attack was Lerone Bennett's Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream (2000), which claimed that Lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the Emancipation Proclamation {{in lieu of the}} real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed. In his Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, Allen C.

Protests became a frequent occurrence in the streets of the capital city of Malé after the president’s coalition slowly dissolved.

Such prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26. Thus, for instance, it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favor of or against one or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious believers over non-believers. Nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions {{to be used to}} prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith.|$|E

40|$|Hate {{crimes and}} {{bullying}} behaviors among children have similarities. Both often focus on “different” individuals as preferred targets, {{such as those}} from controversial groups (e. g., homosexuals). Thus, unequal power exists between a bully {{and his or her}} victim, and this dynamic precludes the use of equal-power interventions such as mediation. A second similarity is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> basic <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> all persons and the subsequent justification of violence against a particular person or group. A third similarity is the predominance of these behaviors among young (juvenile) offenders. These similarities between hate crimes and bullying in children may inform bullying-prevention efforts. Programs need to reduce bullying behaviors by focusing on tolerance of differences, the promotion of positive attitudes toward diversity, and negative attitudes toward hate-based victimization of people who may be different from the mainstream.
