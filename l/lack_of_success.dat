5|$|Lovefilm (1970) {{focuses on}} a young man’s {{relationship}} with his childhood sweetheart, told through flashbacks that include the Arrow Cross dictatorship and 1956, and rendered in an experimental, fragmented form. This experimental tendency in Szabó’s films reached its apotheosis in 25 Fireman Street (1973), which began as a short film, Dream About a House (1971). 25 Fireman Street takes place {{during the course of}} a long, hot night in Budapest, during which the residents of a single apartment building are plagued by dream-memories of pain and loss spanning thirty years, including both World Wars, the Arrow Cross dictatorship, the Communist takeover, and 1956. While the film won the top prize at Locarno, Szabó was upset by its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> at the box office and at film festivals. Attributing this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> to the film's complex structure, he decided to give his next film a simpler structure.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 1952, {{after the}} Maxim bout, Robinson {{gave up his}} title and retired {{with a record of}} 131–3–1–1. He began a career in show business, singing and tap dancing. After about three years, the decline of his {{businesses}} and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in his performing career made him decide to return to boxing. He resumed training in 1954.|$|E

An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Riverina region, the {{majority}} of Wagga Wagga residents supported the federation of the Australian colonies, in large part due to the prospect of free trade across colonial borders. In 1898, a group of residents promoted Wagga Wagga for consideration as the site of the future national capital due to its location equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne and its ample water supply. Despite the bid's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success,</b> in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted strongly in favour of federation.|$|E

Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte, two {{low-level}} associates dissatisfied with their perceived <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in the Soprano crew, {{try to make a}} name for themselves by attempting to kill Christopher. Their plan backfires; Christopher kills Sean and, though critically wounded, survives their attack. Tony and Big Pussy locate Matthew and assassinate him.

5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals for communication. Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel Telescope {{to search for}} such signals from the nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success,</b> Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes {{placed in the}} top half of their events before 1976, while the vast {{majority}} placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, as well as the lack of support for the athletes—sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{eventually}} removed Hutton {{and ended}} with 3/178 off 85 overs. Nevertheless, these compared favourably with Fleetwood-Smith's 1/298 off 87 overs. O'Reilly was the only Australian to {{take more than a}} solitary wicket, and rated Hutton's knock as the finest innings played against him. Australia collapsed to lose by an innings and 579 runs, the heaviest defeat in Test history. O'Reilly's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> went with The Oval Test in 1934, when he took a total of 4/151.|$|E

5|$|The Highlanders' {{franchise}} area {{consists of}} the region controlled by the North Otago, Otago and Southland Rugby Unions. Both Otago and Southland compete in the semi-professional ITM Cup (formerly the Air New Zealand Cup), and North Otago in the amateur Heartland Championship. However, given Otago and Southland's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in the ITM Cup, the Highlanders have often looked further afield to sign players from. This {{is a reflection of}} Otago's historically large influx of people from distant lands during the early settlement period, particularly from the Celtic countries of Scotland and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, {{critical}} and public reception of Impossible Princess were divided by regions, particularly between the UK, and throughout Australasia and the Americas. In retrospect, the record has achieved critical acclaim for {{its status as}} an underrated release, and was highlighted for Minogue's creative input and mixture of genres. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland and the United Kingdom, but was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for physical shipments of 70,000 units; its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in Europe was further scrutinised by the British media.|$|E
5|$|Watson {{enrolled}} at the University of Washington and played baseball for the Huskies under head coach Tubby Graves. He played very briefly with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, amassing one hit {{in a total of}} two at-bats. He often blamed his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in professional baseball on his inability to hit a curveball. He graduated from the university in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in communications. After leaving baseball, Watson worked in the Seattle-Tacoma Shipyard during World War II.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} {{is the creation of}} a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success,</b> some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E
5|$|Adrift is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company and directed by Lucius J. Henderson. The film depicts {{a story of a}} young artist whose <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> leads him to attempt suicide. Before he can carry out the act, his daughter follows and stops him. He confesses to his wife and she thanks her child, providing the inspiration for the artist to complete a great painting.

Once again saved by his daughters actions, whose crying moves the woman to break off the relationship with the artist. The artist destroys the painting and learns a moral lesson.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success,</b> Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{formation}} of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{frustrated}} with the perceived <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership with younger blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The likes of Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, handing over JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau {{was considered to be}} one such rising star. However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. Kurt Tank, the Focke–Wulf designer, although many of the younger generation were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders ever produced by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the likes of Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland.|$|E
5|$|In private, Thơ {{expressed}} his displeasure with Diệm's rule to U.S. officials. He complained of Diệm's reliance on Nhu {{in the running}} of the country, Nhu's attempt to run a police state through his secret Cần Lao apparatus and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> against the Việt Cộng. During the McNamara Taylor mission to South Vietnam, Thơ confided his belief that the country was heading in the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Diệm to reform his policies. He privately revealed his belief that of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, fewer than thirty were functional.|$|E

50|$|The {{peace of}} Ferrara in May 1433 {{institutionalized}} an unsteady status quo.

Another result of the peace agreement was the reduction of Montferrat to a satellite of Savoy.|$|R
