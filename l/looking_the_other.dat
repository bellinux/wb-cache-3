25|$|Following the Reading {{game was}} the home FA Cup tie versus Cardiff, where the team were {{defeated}} 2–0, producing a dreadful performance. The performance drew huge criticism from fans and they and manager alike demanded a better performance away at Villa Park three days later. Changes saw Arca dropped from the squad after a run of poor performances and Rochemback moved to the bench as Shawky and Boateng formed the new centre midfield partnership. Pogatetz captained the side. Downing got his seventh goal of the season after 23 minutes. Referee Steve Bennett gave Villa a penalty for a handball by Luke Young while the defender was <b>looking</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way, which Gareth Barry slotted home. The game finished 1–1.|$|E
25|$|Hippie Hill {{has also}} been part of San Francisco’s history, namely the Summer of Love, which was a large {{counterculture}} movement that partially took part on the hill. During this Summer of Love, people gathered together to {{connect with one another}} in many ways, mainly dropping acid and playing music together. Music has its own history on the hill, with musicians and bands like Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison playing music for free to the public. Improvised drum circles still form on the weekends where people come together and fill the park with a constant beat for hours on end. The hill played a major part in the hippies' ability to openly use drugs because the police had employed a policy of <b>looking</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way {{when it came to the}} hill.|$|E

500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a good long time, {{we had no idea}} what the game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up." [...] Church recalled that [...] "the basic stealth model was [...] having the guard <b>looking</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way and you going past pretty quickly. So Paul [...] had been pushing for a while that the thief side of it was the really interesting part and why not you just do a thief game." [...] A previously unreleased trailer for [...] Dark Camelot and its Stargate Engine was uploaded to YouTube in 2013.|$|E

[...] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: [...] "We lost our way, pure and simple." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lancaster House Agreement further {{provided}} for a ceasefire which {{was followed by}} an internationally supervised general election, held on February 1980. ZANU led by Robert Mugabe won this election, some alleged, by terrorising its political opposition, including supporters of ZAPU, through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points, as stipulated by the Lancaster House Agreement. The observers and the newly installed governor Lord Soames were accused of <b>looking</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way, and Mugabe's victory was certified. Nevertheless, few could doubt that Mugabe's support within his majority Shona tribal group was extremely strong. The Rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election ("Operation Quartz") to prevent ZANU from taking over the country. [...] The alleged coup was to include the assassination of Mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country. The plan was eventually scuttled, as {{it was obvious that}} Mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation, as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support, and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable.|$|E
