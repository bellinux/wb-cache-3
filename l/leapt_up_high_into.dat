60|$|The {{remaining}} volunteers saw {{the force}} of this argument and when somebody increased the blast of the lamp so that the roaring column of flame <b>leapt</b> <b>up</b> <b>higher,</b> the men stood very still, staring at the two who had now gained {{the center of the}} partly submerged log.|$|R
60|$|So {{after their}} meal {{they went down}} together, but could not get {{anywhere}} near the works, all the approaches now being guarded by the police. It was a grand sight, but the worst was over, {{and there was a}} general feeling of confidence in the crowd that it would spread no further. A dozen engines were at work now. Some of the firemen were on the roof, some on the stacks of timber, which looked red-hot from the deep glow from the fire. The flames were intermittent now, sometimes <b>leaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>high</b> above the shell of the burned-out buildings, then dying down again.|$|R
6000|$|The air was cold, Tom; so it was, {{there was}} no denying it; but would it have been more genial in the gig? The blacksmith's fire burned very bright, and <b>leaped</b> <b>up</b> <b>high,</b> as though it wanted men to warm; but would it have been less tempting, looked at from the clammy {{cushions}} of a gig? The wind blew keenly, nipping the features of the hardy wight who fought his way along; blinding him with his own hair if he had enough to it, and wintry dust if he hadn't; stopping his breath as though he had been soused in a cold bath; tearing aside his wrappings-up, and whistling in the very marrow of his bones; but it would have done all this a hundred times more fiercely to a man in a gig, wouldn't it? A fig for gigs! ...|$|R
2500|$|Judith Shapiro [...] {{survived the}} fire. She was about 7 years old {{attending}} with her neighbors. They exited <b>up</b> <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> {{the stands and}} survived by jumping off; Judith refused to jump and was pushed.|$|R
50|$|The {{flue gas}} stack is a {{cylindrical}} structure {{at the top}} of all the heat transfer chambers. The breeching directly below it collects the flue gas and brings it <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the atmosphere where it will not endanger personnel.|$|R
60|$|But {{the horse}} did not stop. Instead, {{he began to}} back, and then {{of a sudden he}} <b>leaped</b> <b>high</b> <b>up</b> in the air, to come down on all fours with a thump that nearly jounced poor Hans to pieces.|$|R
60|$|The Scotch stole up quietly. Wallace's party, {{composed}} {{of half the}} strength, handed their bundles of straw to the men of Grahame's company; then with a sudden shout they fell upon the English soldiers, while Grahame's men, running straight {{to the door of}} the barn, threw down their trusses of straw against it, and Sir John, snatching down a torch which burned beside the entrance, applied fire to the mass, and then, without a moment's delay, started at a run towards the town. Taken wholly by surprise the English soldiers were slain by Wallace and his men almost before they had time to seize their arms. Then the Scots gathered round the barn. The flames were already <b>leaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>high,</b> and a terrible din of shouts and cries issued from within. The doors had been opened now, but those within were unable to force their way across the blazing mass of straw. Many appeared at the windows and screamed for mercy, and some leapt out, preferring to fall by the Scottish swords rather than to await death by fire within.|$|R
60|$|It {{looked like}} a safe hit to center field, but as {{the crack of the}} bat sounded on the air Jack Rover was seen to <b>leap</b> <b>high</b> <b>up</b> with hand out-stretched. The next instant he came down with the sphere safe within his grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tweet, tweet!' {{sang the}} bird, and {{flew into the}} green wood. Thumbelina was very unhappy. She {{was not allowed to}} go out into the warm sunshine. The corn which had been sowed in the field over the field-mouse's home grew <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air, and made a thick forest for the poor little girl, who was only an inch high.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the roof}} fell in, and the flames shot <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air, but grand as the sight was, the boys did not {{wait any longer}} looking on. Their faces smarted {{severely}} from the heat to {{which they had been}} exposed; their hands had been a good deal burned by the shavings; their hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes were singed, and the eyeballs ached with the glare.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long while}} the lion tossed {{it up and down}} gaily, feeling that, however sound asleep the boy-brother might LOOK, he was sure to have one eye open; but {{gradually}} he began to edge closer to the opening, and at last gave such a toss that the ball went <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air, and he could not see what became of it.|$|R
60|$|By {{night it}} is less dreary, for then the sky gleams with a lurid light, {{and out of the}} {{darkness}} the red flames <b>leap,</b> and <b>high</b> <b>up</b> in the air they gambol and writhe--the demon spawn of that evil land, they seem.|$|R
60|$|The flag-ship {{was well}} into the bay, {{steaming}} at a four-knot speed, when from the smoke-stack of the little McCulloch a column of sparks shot <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air. In the run her fires had fallen low, and it became necessary to replenish them. The firemen, perhaps fearing lest {{they should not be}} in at the death, were more energetic than prudent, and thus a signal was given to the sleepy garrison of Corregidor.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought the}} big beast was retreating, but soon found out otherwise. The moose was badly wounded, and ugly in the extreme. Around he wheeled, {{and then came}} {{straight}} for Chet. The lad could not locate his gun, and, feeling his peril, darted for the nearest tree and <b>leaped</b> <b>high</b> <b>up</b> among the branches.|$|R
6000|$|I {{sat there}} {{nearly an hour}} before the why and the how of the little joker's actions became quite clear. This is what happens in such a case. Bunny comes down from the ridge for his nightly frolic in the little clearing. While still in the ferns the big white object, {{standing}} motionless {{in the middle of his}} playground, catches his attention; and very much surprised, and very much frightened, but still very curious, he crouches down close to wait and listen. But the strange thing does not move nor see him. To get a better view he <b>leaps</b> <b>up</b> <b>high</b> above the ferns two or three times. Still the big thing remains quite still and harmless. [...] "Now," [...] thinks Bunny, [...] "I'll frighten him, and find out what he is." [...] Leaping high he strikes the ground sharply two or three times with his padded hind foot; then jumps up quickly again to see the effect of his scare. Once he succeeded very well, when he crept up close behind me, so close that he didn't have to spring up to see the effect. I fancy him chuckling to himself as he scurried off after my sudden start.|$|R
60|$|So it was {{all agreed}} to. They lighted their torches, and marched along, waving them in the air, until {{they came to the}} wigwam, and then they danced around it, singing and {{shouting}} as they set it on fire in many places on all sides. The flames spread rapidly, and flashed <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air, and soon there was nothing left of the poor wigwam but a few smoking and blackened sticks lying on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Robles {{stands for}} the last time on the hill of the Mexico - United States border while two Immigration Officers sit in their truck {{watching}} in laughter. The song [...] "America" [...] by Neil Diamond is heard as Robles raises his arms and hundreds of people appear and race forward to reach the American Dream. The Immigration Officers hide in their truck. Rudy, Dolores, and their [...] "Waas Up" [...] friends walk with their heads <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the United States.|$|R
50|$|Christmas Rooftop - on a winter's night (with the {{flashing}} grey 'Children's' logo in the dark). Father Christmas twists {{a few times}} in a chimney (with the 'Children's' logo on the sack next to the chimney.) and boings <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the sky, the reindeer stands in the chimney a few seconds and then Father Christmas crashes back into the chimney and the BBC logo appears on the grey paving slabs on the roof after the snow slides off the roof and the reindeer has a couple of giggles behind the rooftop.|$|R
5000|$|Christoph Meckel, {{who spent}} his {{childhood}} in Freiburg, describes in an autobiographical narrative published in 1965, the blaze after the bombing of Freiburg's city centre as and the spot where, a few miles away, the silhouette of Freiburg could usually be seen, powerful flame was burning. The walls were flooded with twitching fires, the valleys were sunk in black shadows, the fir trees were clearly visible on the slops of the Ro√ükopf mountain. Large orange smoke seethed <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the night, drifting ferociously over the mountain tops and devouring all darkness.|$|R
60|$|The storm ceased {{almost as}} quickly as it began, and {{although}} the sea did not all at once stop the heavings of its angry bosom, the wind fell entirely {{in the course of a}} few hours, the dark clouds broke up into great masses that were piled <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the sky, and out of the midst of these the glorious sun shone in bright rays down on the ocean, like comfort from heaven, gladdening our hearts as we busily repaired the damage that we had suffered from the storm.|$|R
25|$|Aarfy is {{a social}} climber looking to work his way <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>high</b> society.|$|R
50|$|The {{role of the}} ruckman in Australian {{rules is}} similar to a lock in rugby union contesting a line-out. The key {{differences}} are that with the exception of boundary throw-ins, the ball is almost always thrown straight <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air rather than horizontally, so in this respect, the ruckman {{is similar to a}} basketball centre. The ruckman {{needs to be able to}} control the ball by palm tap or fist with outstretched arms. Unlike rugby, the ruckman must rely on his vertical leap and is not assisted by teammates and Australian football rucking often involves vigorous mid-air collisions with the opposing ruckman.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will teach}} you,' yelled the Troll, and struck {{at him with}} his iron club so that the earth flew <b>up</b> fifteen yards <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air.|$|R
50|$|Laura Restrepo's Delirium is a book-and-a-half: stunning, dense, complex, mind-blowing. This novel {{goes far}} above politics, right <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>high</b> art.|$|R
50|$|During summer supplejack tips grow 5 {{centimetres}} a day, {{enabling the}} plant to climb <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the canopy of the forest.|$|R
60|$|Dale {{helped the}} girls <b>up</b> the <b>high</b> step <b>into</b> the stage, and then, placing the lighter luggage, in with them, {{he threw the}} heavier pieces on top.|$|R
2500|$|The boys {{defend the}} Docks {{from a group}} of enemies led by General Disarray. After doing so, Pip {{attempts}} to reveal the villain's identity to the boys, but, typically, they reject him before he is able to finish his sentence. The boys head <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the mountains above South Park to meet Randy, who tells them that they are about to be attacked. They are able to stop ManBearPig and a mass of Demons from taking over the geology building, before Timmy comes to meet them and they are directed one final time to Downtown South Park. Randy confirms that they must head Downtown to stop the villain, and warns the boys that [...] "he has always been waiting" [...] for them.|$|R
60|$|It {{is of no}} use mincing the matter; Dr John Marsh, {{after being}} {{regarded}} by his friends at home as hopelessly unimpressible--in short, an absolute woman-hater--had found his fate on a desolate isle of the Southern seas, he had fallen--nay, let us be just--had jumped over head and ears in love with Pauline Rigonda! Dr Marsh was no sentimental die-away noodle who, half-ashamed, half-proud of his condition, displays it to the semi-contemptuous world. No; after disbelieving {{for many years in}} the power of woman to subdue him, he suddenly and manfully gave in--sprang <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air, spiritually, and so to speak, turning a sharp somersault, went headlong down deep into the flood, without the slightest intention of ever again returning to the surface.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he seized me violently by the arm; {{the roof of}} the palace opened to make way for us, and we mounted <b>up</b> so <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air that the earth looked like a little cloud. Then, as before, he came down with the {{swiftness}} of lightning, and we touched the ground on a mountain top.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] roared Hans, {{and tried}} {{to climb out of}} the blanket. But before he could manage it, the thing was given a toss and <b>up</b> he went, <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air.|$|R
60|$|Then {{we heard}} a splash, and a great struggle. Another minute and he had grabbed at and caught Sir Henry's outstretched hand, and we had pulled him <b>up</b> <b>high</b> and dry <b>into</b> the tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, Bagnold is {{credited}} with devising a method of driving over the large sand dunes found in the [...] "sand seas" [...] of the Libyan Desert. He wrote, [...] "I increased speed. ... A huge glaring wall of yellow shot <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the sky. The lorry tipped violently backwards‚Äîand we rose as in a lift, smoothly without vibration. We floated up on a yellow cloud. All the accustomed car movements had ceased; only the speedometer told us we were still moving fast. It was incredible ..." [...] However, noted Fitzroy Maclean, [...] "too much dash had its penalties. Many of the dunes fell away sharply {{at the far side}} and if you arrived at the top at full speed, you were likely to plunge headlong over the precipice. ... and end up with your truck upside down on top of you." ...|$|R
40|$|Hibbs {{root cellar}} {{is owned by}} several family members who live on {{original}} family land on Jordan Place in Portugal Cove-St. Phillips. The cellar was built in 1920 by brothers Jake and Jordan Hibbs and was used until the 1960 ‚Äôs. The cellar has fallen into complete disrepair with the roof being removed in the early 1980 ‚Äôs for fear that children would get hurt. Today {{there is a huge}} evergreen that has grown up over the front entrance. It was built <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> a hillside with three sides surrounded by earth. It has a concrete foundation, and originally had an exterior and interior entrance with a roof made out of wood and sod with steel beam supports. Cellar measures approximately 4. 5 m x 3 m. It was used to store vegetables that the family grew on the land which fed multiple families...|$|R
50|$|Based on {{interviews}} {{of the survivors}} on board Flight 129, {{it was revealed that}} the accident occurred suddenly, with loud noise and violent shaking of the aircraft at the point of impact. All items inside the aircraft fell down, seats were thrust forward, and all lights went out, making it dark inside the aircraft. The fire filled the cabin with heavy smoke, which made it difficult to breathe. Most of the passengers briefly lost consciousness during impact, with the feet and legs of some passengers forced under the seats in front of them. A flight attendant who was seated at the aft right position stated that his body was crushed underneath something. He reached to open the door but could not find the handle. He crawled out of the cabin and evacuated the survivors. The survivors then escaped by walking or crawling through the gaps in the broken fuselage. As they escaped, several large explosions were heard, with pillars of fire shooting <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the sky.|$|R
60|$|A mighty shout hailed its downfall. The gods of the Britons, insulted and outraged, were avenged {{upon those}} of Rome; the altars of Mona had {{streamed}} {{with the blood}} of the Druids, those of Camalodunum were wet with the gore of Roman legionaries. The statues were broken to pieces, the altars torn down, and then the chiefs ordered the tribesmen to fetch in faggots. Thousands went to the forest, while others pulled down detached houses and sheds that had escaped the flames, and dragged the beams and woodwork to the temple. By nightfall an enormous pile of faggots was raised round each of the eight interior columns that in two lines supported the roof. Torches were applied by Boadicea, her two daughters and some of the principal Druids, and in a short time the interior of the temple was a glowing furnace. The beams of the ceiling and roof soon ignited and the flames shot <b>up</b> <b>high</b> <b>into</b> the air.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to decompose a parameter into sub-parameters and to describe the meaning of each sub-parameter. For example, a 48-bit IRIG time parameter is typically broken <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>High,</b> Low and Micro time components.|$|R
