30|$|Major {{metropolitan}} {{areas in the}} U.S. {{and other parts of}} the world are facing congestion and environmental issues. The growing number of single occupancy vehicles and truck operations add pressure to transportation networks and infrastructure. Cities are trying to cope with the increased demand for scarce road space by building more transit infrastructure and eliminating parking spaces. Nevertheless, increasing e-commerce activity by city residents drives delivery vehicles to city streets and on-street parking facilities are often unable to accommodate the increased delivery demand. Freight infrastructure in {{metropolitan areas}} is unlikely to significantly change to accommodate this increase, and it is important to consider alternative delivery modes. It is clear from traffic congestion, idling trucks, and the lack of sufficient Commercial Vehicle Load Zones (designated freight curb space) that current freight infrastructure is challenged to meet the diverse and dynamic delivery needs of the <b>last</b> <b>mile,</b> which is described as the most costly part of the supply chain in which goods are transported between a DC or warehouse and the recipient’s location [2].

These delivery alternatives are highly possible to be adopted and generalized by different logistics service providers in China if not concerned about the cost or density of orders. The current business mode of supermarket in China cannot fulfill the demand from an overwhelming number of customers. Costs for both pick-up stations are acceptable, and the cost is a positive factor for pick-up station mode. The higher density of orders, the higher possibility of different time-window may require, and high competitive advantage of intelligent locker can be achieved. The high density of orders for intelligent locker is a positive factor. The cost for intelligent locker is a very negative factor, which seriously limits the popularization of this delivery alternative.

40|$|Urban {{cities are}} {{affected}} by negative externalities coming from urban mobility and goods distribution, such as air pollution and traffic congestion. In recent years, many European municipalities had introduced market-based measures, aiming at externalities’ internalisation, such as vehicle pollution charges (e. g., the Ecopass system in Milan, the Low Emission Zones in London, etc.) together with structural solutions which, however, end up adding complexity (i. e., transhipment, delivery times, handling costs, etc.) to urban supply chains, such as the introduction of urban consolidation centres (UCCs) to cover <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> <b>deliveries.</b> By using a simple Hotelling spatial model, we analyse the effect of semi-public UCCs on urban competition among logistics service providers (LSPs) assuming heterogeneous urban retailers with respect to demand elasticity to delivery times. We show that for increasing public shares/interests into UCCs' ownership (implying lower service costs), LSPs that apply for UCC-based services are likely to increase their market shares even if competition among LSPs is relatively low (i. e., high differentiation) and retailers' demand elasticity to delivery times is relatively high.

The paper takes a case study approach, analysing a pilot project of consolidated <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> <b>deliveries</b> in the city centre of Gothenburg. The findings suggest that the improvement potential of innovative technology enabling zero-emission last-mile distribution is only marginal. Organisational changes enabling a separation of feedering trip and last-mile trip have a much bigger improvement potential, even in case conventional technology is used for last-mile deliveries.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of a logistic service provider (LSP), there is a growing pressure from the e-commerce sector to keep prices for shipping and handling as low as possible.

In other words, the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> <b>delivery</b> of parcels is a purely cost-driven business which discourages the development of more sustainable distribution solutions [7]. Therefore, standard deliveries are still vastly based on traditional distribution networks, using vehicles such as diesel vans instead of eco-friendly alternatives.|$|E

30|$|Differences in {{location}} {{between these}} two sectors, processing the same food and fresh products, are significant. Public policies have influenced the duality of this system and promoted an urban wholesale trade and a suburban distribution system to supply supermarkets. Peripheral zones become the main theatre {{for the development of}} logistics real estate [48], while the centers become areas of very selective logistics [49]. The existence of a twofold dynamic involving both logistics deconcentration within a metropolitan region and the re-concentration of some activities in densely-settled areas, encouraged by public policies to fight against urban sprawl, is leading to a complex logistics landscape. It seems that wholesale trade and mass retail are a very good example of these two opposite trends, which pose a new challenge for public policies. To regulate the food market in the Paris region, public authorities have to coordinate two different locations of facilities, networks at different scale (local and national) and different stakeholders involved in the two sectors. A public policy that seeks to regulate the food supply (by favoring local production or by restricting trucks or <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> <b>deliveries)</b> should take into account not only the operating differences internal to the sectors as well as the differences in location. A location in a dense urban area where the pressure is high tends to weigh heavily on the food wholesale trade and can favor supermarkets.|$|R
