But one day, when asked to help proofread a document, Bartleby answers with what soon becomes his perpetual response to every request [...] "I would prefer not to." [...] To the dismay of the lawyer and the irritation of the other employees, Bartleby performs fewer and fewer tasks and eventually none, instead staring {{for long periods of}} time at a brick wall just outside one of the office's windows.

Colin Renfrew, a proponent of the new processual archaeology, observed in 1987 that it focuses attention on [...] "the underlying historical processes which are at the root of change". Archaeology, he noted [...] "has learnt to speak with greater authority and accuracy about the ecology of past societies, their technology, their economic basis and their social organization.

2500|$|It is, however, {{said that}} Plato once {{disclosed}} this {{knowledge to the}} public in his lecture On the Good (Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ), in which the Good (τὸ ἀγαθόν) is identified with the One (the Unity, τὸ ἕν), the fundamental ontological principle. The content of this lecture has been transmitted by several witnesses. Aristoxenus describes the event in the following words: [...] "Each came expecting to <b>learn</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the things that are generally considered good for men, such as wealth, good health, physical strength, and altogether a kind of wonderful happiness. But when the mathematical demonstrations came, including numbers, geometrical figures and astronomy, and finally the statement Good is One seemed to them, I imagine, utterly unexpected and strange; hence some belittled the matter, while others rejected it." [...] Simplicius quotes Alexander of Aphrodisias, who states that [...] "according to Plato, the first principles of everything, including the Forms themselves are One and Indefinite Duality (ἡ ἀόριστος δυάς), which he called Large and Small (τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν)", and Simplicius reports as well that [...] "one might also learn this from Speusippus and Xenocrates and the others who were present at Plato's lecture on the Good".|$|E
