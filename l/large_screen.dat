5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the <b>large</b> <b>screen.</b> During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
