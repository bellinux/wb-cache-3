5|$|In the 19th century, {{particularly}} {{after the publication}} of On the Origin of Species in 1859, the idea that <b>life</b> <b>had</b> evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists. However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} life on Earth is not well understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once <b>life</b> <b>had</b> appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.|$|E
5|$|The ruling {{has been}} criticized for its {{intrusion}} into state affairs and its basis in previous rulings. Prior to Santosky, the realm of family <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been left to the states. Because of this, Santoskys direct intervention into the affairs of state interests was seen as contrary to United States v. Yazell, which held that federal courts should only overturn state statutes when those statutes cannot adequately serve a clear and substantial federal interest.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues {{and prayer}} houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual <b>life</b> <b>had</b> {{moved to new}} centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz {{and the development of}} new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.|$|E
5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his <b>life</b> <b>had</b> also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E

5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his <b>life.</b> <b>Had</b> he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E
5|$|In September, Mary {{was fully}} {{prepared}} to depart for the Netherlands and resume her post {{when she was}} informed of Charles's death. Distressed {{by the death of}} another sibling, the Queen, who had suffered from a heart disease most of her <b>life,</b> <b>had</b> two heart attacks in October. Both were so severe that her doctors thought that she had died. When Joan visited her, Mary was still determined to fulfill the promise she had given to Charles and assume the regency in the Netherlands, but she was weak and feverish. She died only few weeks later, in Cigales on 18 October 1558.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century, René Descartes' {{mechanical}} philosophy encouraged the use of the metaphor of the universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution. Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as Benoît de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and <b>life,</b> <b>had</b> developed mechanically, without divine guidance. In contrast, most contemporary theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder, regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Jean Baptiste Lamarck used fossils in his {{arguments}} for {{his theory of}} the transmutation of species in the early 19th century. Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that <b>life</b> <b>had</b> changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic {{during the next few}} decades. Robert Chambers used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that <b>life</b> <b>had</b> progressed from the simple to the complex. These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream. Many of the critics of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories. Hugh Miller would make a similar argument, pointing out that the fossil fish found in the Old Red Sandstone formation were fully as complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by Vestiges. While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.|$|E
5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. <b>Life</b> <b>had</b> grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, {{there were only two}} alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to eschew scripts for storyboards {{is one that}} Hillenburg made {{early on in the}} series' development. Rocko's Modern <b>Life</b> <b>had</b> also used storyboarding, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for SpongeBob SquarePants— even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show greater preference for script-driven cartoons. Another writer for the series, Merriwether Williams, described in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o'clock.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} histories had {{on occasion}} been threatened with political interference, {{particularly with the}} change in government in 1949. Kippenberger, a person of high standing with both {{the government and the}} ordinary New Zealander, was a strong advocate for the project, and was able to convince the new government of the merits of the official histories. Kippenberger encouraged a positive atmosphere at the War History Branch, despite a tight budget and at times crowded work conditions. He was proud of its rate of output, which exceeded the efforts of the better resourced official histories of Australia and Great Britain. By 1963, the War History Branch he had presided over for much of its <b>life</b> <b>had</b> produced nearly 50 major volumes.|$|E

5|$|After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him {{as their}} group's leader and primary channeler. She {{subsequently}} began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy {{to purchase a}} property {{to serve as the}} landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past <b>life</b> <b>had</b> caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.|$|E
