5|$|<b>Local</b> <b>transit</b> {{services}} in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo's Amarillo City Transit (ACT) department since 1966; before that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response paratransit which are designed for people with disabilities. The ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers per year on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers, {{but it is a}} declining ridership. ACT has no plans to scale back any of their transit routes or services.|$|E

5|$|Swedbank Stadion {{is served}} by Malmö bus lines 3, 5, 6, and 34, all of which stop in the {{vicinity}} of the stadium. <b>Local</b> <b>transit</b> authority Skånetrafiken also operates dedicated match-day buses, branded as line 84, which run to the stadium from different areas of Malmö. Due to the central location of the stadium within the city, parking space is limited, and spectators are advised to use public transportation, particularly for more prominent matches. The stadium is also located close to the underground railway station Triangeln, which opened in December 2010 as a part of Citytunneln. The station {{is served by}} Pågatåg and Öresund Trains, and is reachable non-stop from many parts of the Öresund Region.|$|E
5|$|GO Bus service {{consists}} {{of a combination of}} routes, many of which stand in for train service when it is not operating and/or which extend the reach of train service to communities beyond their termini. Other GO buses are independent of rail services, such as the Highway 407 series of routes, which provides an orbital-type service that encircles Toronto proper and makes connections between all train lines. There are also routes that serve Pearson International Airport, seasonal destinations such as Canada's Wonderland, and several colleges and universities. The vast majority of GO train stations have connecting GO bus service, of which almost all the exceptions are situated within Toronto proper. There are also 16 bus terminals served by GO buses, many of which provide <b>local</b> <b>transit</b> connections, as well as intermediate stops and ticket agencies.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{service in the}} tunnel, International District/Chinatown station is within close proximity to several other regional and <b>local</b> <b>transit</b> services. King Street Station is located one block west of the station and is served by inter-city Amtrak trains on the Cascades, Coast Starlight, and Empire Builder, as well as Sounder commuter trains to Everett, Tacoma, and Lakewood. BoltBus, a private bus operator, uses a curbside stop near the station for its intercity routes serving Vancouver and Portland, Oregon. The First Hill Streetcar stops one block east of the station on South Jackson Street, connecting the area to Little Saigon, Yesler Terrace, First Hill, and Capitol Hill. The Waterfront Streetcar also served the station, using a separate platform on 5th Avenue South, until service was suspended in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Just {{like the}} {{neighbouring}} Swedbank Stadion, Malmö Stadion is currently served by Malmö bus lines 3, 5, 6 and 34, {{all of which}} stop {{in the vicinity of}} the two stadiums. <b>Local</b> <b>transit</b> authority Skånetrafiken also operates dedicated match-day buses, branded as line 84, which run from different areas of Malmö when Malmö FF play home matches at Swedbank Stadion. Due to the central location of the two stadiums within the city, parking space is limited, and spectators are advised to use public transportation, particularly for more prominent matches at Swedbank Stadion. This does not apply to matchdays for IFK Malmö, as not so many fans are drawn for that club's games. Malmö Stadion is also near the underground railway station Triangeln, which opened in December 2010 as a part of Citytunneln. The station is served by Pågatåg and Öresund Trains, and is reachable non-stop from many parts of the Öresund Region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study tax {{competition}} on a parallel road network when different governments have tolling authority on different links of the network. Reflecting many current situations in Europe, each link is used by both <b>local</b> and <b>transit</b> traffic, and transit has a choice of route. Each government maximises the surplus of local users plus total tax revenues in controlling <b>local</b> and <b>transit</b> transport. Three types of tolling systems are considered: (i) toll discrimination between <b>local</b> traffic and <b>transit,</b> (ii) uniform tolls on <b>local</b> and <b>transit</b> transport, (iii) <b>local</b> tolls only. The results suggest that the welfare effects of introducing transit tolls are large, but that differentiation of tolls between <b>local</b> and <b>transit</b> transport as compared to uniform tolls does not yield large welfare differences. Moreover, the welfare effects of coordination between countries are relatively small in comparison with the welfare gains of tolling transit. Numerical application of the model further illustrates the effects of different transit shares and explicitly considers the role of asymmetries between countries. Higher transit shares strongly raise the Nash equilibrium transit toll and slightly decrease local tolls. With asymmetric demands, the welfare gains of introducing differentiated tolling rise strongly for the country with lower local demand...|$|R

25|$|Some bus {{routes of}} the {{surrounding}} <b>local</b> <b>transit</b> agencies run on Toronto streets along with TTC buses, mainly to reach TTC subway stations. Examples of this include YRT and Viva buses plying Yonge Street en route to Finch Bus Terminal and MiWay buses plying Dundas Street in Etobicoke en route to Islington station. However, by law, other <b>local</b> <b>transit</b> agencies are prohibited from carrying passengers wholly within the City of Toronto. Therefore, YRT and MiWay buses can only drop off passengers inbound and pick up passengers outbound while {{within the boundaries of}} Toronto.|$|E
