5|$|In most battle situations, Aya is {{accompanied}} by a group of allied NPC (non-playable character) soldiers that the player can direct around the battle area. Available commands include offering supporting fire, directly attacking enemies, or staying behind cover. They can also all fire at the same enemy in certain situations, dealing high damage. Each NPC has a separate health meter, and is permanently removed from battle upon defeat. Central to combat is Overdive, an ability which enables Aya to transmit herself between bodies. If her health is low, Aya can transport into the body of an allied NPC, taking on their health <b>level,</b> <b>position</b> and current weapon in the process. NPCs not controlled by Aya are controlled by the game's AI. Aya can remain in a body for the duration of a level, or until the unit has died. If Aya cannot jump to another body, she dies and the level must either be restarted or exited. Overdive can be activated at any time, enabling Aya to transport around the battlefield to avoid enemy attacks or save herself when her current unit's health is low. Overdive {{can also be used to}} attack enemies if Aya maintains a sustained assault. After a time, a triangle icon appears on enemies, allowing her to perform an Overdive attack, dealing high damage to the targeted enemy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{in-depth}} understanding of the career development of women in executive <b>level</b> <b>positions</b> in information technology. This study utilized a qualitative research design. The major research method for this study was in-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews with a group of twenty-five women in executive positions in information technology from across the United States. The study provided an insight into the perception of women executives working in information technology (IT), and their role in this fast-growing technological area. The study examined the educational and career paths that the women took to reach their executive <b>level</b> <b>positions.</b> This study provided a better understanding of why women entered the field of information technology and what their experiences have been. The study examined the barriers that hindered and the factors that assisted the women in achieving executive <b>level</b> <b>positions.</b> Furthermore, this study obtained an in-depth understanding of the challenges and opportunities faced by the women in their educational programs and as they moved up the career ladder to executive <b>level</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R

25|$|Before {{the last}} round Carlsen and Kramnik were the only players who had a shot at winning the tournament. Kramnik with black against Ivanchuk needed to {{outperform}} Carlsen, who had white against Svidler, to win the tournament, since the second tiebreak favoured Carlsen with five wins against Kramnik's four. (The first tiebreak, the head-to-head score between Carlsen and Kramnik, was 1–1.) Carlsen played to win, since that would guarantee him the tournament victory regardless of Kramnik's result; similarly, Kramnik knew that the odds of Carlsen losing with white were minute, and he went all-in against Ivanchuk with the Pirc defense. This backfired and Ivanchuk obtained an early advantage, while Carlsen got a <b>level</b> <b>position</b> against Svidler. Carlsen later got into serious time trouble and did not defend adequately against Svidler's attack, which gave Svidler a winning endgame. Meanwhile, Ivanchuk had outplayed Kramnik, who resigned {{a few minutes after}} Carlsen lost. Thus the tournament was won by Carlsen on the second tiebreak.|$|E
500|$|The obliquely-mounted {{fuselage}} cannon {{were thought}} to be too difficult to aim and {{were not included in the}} prototype; the weight savings allowed the ammunition for the four 23mm Shpital'nyy Sh-3 wing-mounted guns to be increased to 900 rounds. One additional innovation in the prototype was that they could be adjusted on the ground to fire at a 23° downward angle in addition to the normal <b>level</b> <b>position.</b> The dorsal gunner also fired a Sh-3 gun, which was mounted in a separate, remotely controlled, Il-VU-11 turret that could traverse through 180° and elevated to a maximum of 80°. A cassette of ten AG-2 aerial grenades was provided to deter any fighters approaching from below. Maximum bomb load was [...] and four bomb bays were provided in the wing center-section for small bombs. Alternatively two [...] bombs could be carried on wing racks. Launch rails were provided for four [...] RS-132 rockets.|$|E
2500|$|Hockey skates are {{optimized}} for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, {{and changes in}} skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill <b>level,</b> <b>position,</b> and body type. The blade width of most skates are about [...] thick.|$|E

He said he could lift a keg of nails with his teeth. He picked up a common glass tumbler and bit a semi-circle out of it. Then he opened his bosom and showed us a net-work of knife and bullet scars; showed us more on his arms and face, and said he believed he had bullets enough in his body to make a pig of lead. He was armed to the teeth. He closed with the remark that he was Mr. ---- of Cariboo--a celebrated name whereat we shook in our shoes. I would publish the name, but for the suspicion that he might come and carve me. He finally inquired if Brown still thirsted for blood.

40|$|The United States {{has been}} {{developing}} a GPS (Global Positioning System), and now We can make use of it too in Japan but the usable time is limited due to the incompleteness of the system. We measured the usable time and took position fixes from our fixed station at Nagasaki in order to evaluate the positioning accuracy for about one month in Dec. 1986. We received positioning signals from 6 satellites. The usable time at this station was about 6. 5 hours of which high <b>level</b> <b>positioning</b> accounted for 45 % {{in the first half}} of the month but only 17 % in the latter half. The positioning errors of 3 H (three-dimensional high <b>level</b> <b>positioning),</b> 3 M (three-dimensional middle <b>level</b> <b>positioning)</b> and 2 H (two-dimensional high <b>level</b> <b>positioning)</b> were smaller than 100 meters. Even the positioning error of 2 L (two-dimensional low <b>level</b> <b>positioning),</b> which was largest, was only about 181 meters (0. 1 nautical mile). From the practical standpoint, 2 L is sufficiently accurate to be used for the positioning of an ordinary ship sailing normally. Until the system is completed,if we use not only high level but also middle and low level, we will be able to prolong the usable time. We measured the positioning signal at ten-minute intervals, so data were not as full as possible, and the evaluation of the positioning accuracy by combination of satellites was limited to only partial combinations. The positioning accuracy by combination of satellites (3 ・ 6 ・ 9 ・ 11) in the case of 3 H and combination of satellites (3 ・ 11 ・ 13) on 2 H and 2 M was good by comparison with other combinations and these combinations had long usable times...|$|R
