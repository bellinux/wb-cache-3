Fluorescent protein constructs can be introduced through transformation. The developmental stage of each cell can be inferred from its location in the plant or by using fluorescent protein markers, allowing detailed developmental analysis.|$|E

25|$|Optical {{microscopy}} and {{electron microscopy}} involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscopy</b> and scanning electron microscopy). Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E
25|$|There are {{uncertainties}} {{with this}} approach using current microscopy techniques. If {{it is possible to}} replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique. However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at synapses, but also at other places on the neuron's cell membrane), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read via confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscopy.</b> However, as the physiological genesis of 'mind' is not currently known, this method {{may not be able to}} access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Modern Confocal <b>Laser</b> <b>Scan</b> <b>Microscopy</b> is a {{sophisticated}} technique allowing {{acquisition of information}} from different fluorescence markers in the same tissue by separating them into different confocal channels. For an adequate interpretation of these multidimensional images advanced image processing techniques are required. In this study, we introduce an automated image analysis based on Boolean logic working with features instead of single pixels. Feature based image analysis preserves the original morphology of the objects and allows the unlimited identification of co-localisations. We demonstrate the practicability of our feature-based algorithm on triple-immuno fluorescence stained neural cells of the auditory cortex of gerbils. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the molecular defect causing Schnyder crystalline corneal dystrophy (SCCD) in a Chinese family with bilateral corneal abnormalities. Methods: The Chinese SCCD family {{was subjected to}} a complete ophthalmic examination that included slit-lamp examination and slit-lamp photography to assess and document the crystalline deposits and arcus lipoides. In vivo <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal <b>microscopy</b> and Fourier-domain OCT were also performed on both eyes of SCCD patients. Blood samples were taken for subsequent genetic analysis. The two coding exons of the UbiA prenyltransferase domaincontaining protein 1 (UBIAD 1) gene were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. Results: We report on a novel heterozygous mutation of UBIAD 1, G 98 S, in two patients with SCCD. The identified molecular defect cosegregates with the disease and is not found in 50 unaffected individuals. Morphological evaluation on SCCD by in vivo <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal <b>microscopy</b> and Fourier-domain OCT highlighted pathological observations {{at the level of}} Bowman’s membrane and anterior stroma. Conclusion: The newly identified mutation expands the spectrum of mutations in UBIAD 1 that may cause pathological corneal cholesterol deposition. Observations by in vivo <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal <b>microscopy</b> and Fourier-domain OCT were consistent with the previous histopathologic descriptions of SCCD.
