50|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's PV systems {{include the}} valve regulated lead-acid battery- {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead-acid battery, nickel-cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Compared to the other types, lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, due to their high reliability, low self discharge as well as low investment and maintenance costs, they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries. Furthermore, as storage devices for PV systems are stationary, the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead-acid batteries are not as critical as, for example, in electric transportation Other <b>rechargeable</b> <b>batteries</b> that are considered for distributed PV systems include sodium-sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.

40|$|Li 2 S is a {{high-capacity}} {{cathode material}} for lithium metal-free <b>rechargeable</b> <b>batteries.</b> It has a theoretical capacity of 1166 mAh/g, which is nearly 1 {{order of magnitude}} higher than traditional metal oxides/phosphates cathodes. However, Li 2 S is usually considered to be electrochemically inactive due to its high electronic resistivity and low lithium-ion diffusivity. In this paper, we discover that a large potential barrier (∼ 1 V) exists {{at the beginning of}} charging for Li 2 S. By applying a higher voltage cutoff, this barrier can be overcome and Li 2 S becomes active. Moreover, this barrier does not appear again in the following cycling. Subsequent cycling shows that the material behaves similar to common sulfur cathodes with high energy efficiency. The initial discharge capacity is greater than 800 mAh/g for even 10 μm Li 2 S particles. Moreover, after 10 cycles, the capacity is stabilized around 500 - 550 mAh/g with a capacity decay rate of only ∼ 0. 25 % per cycle. The origin of the initial barrier is found to be the phase nucleation of polysulfides, but the amplitude of barrier is mainly due to two factors: (a) charge transfer directly between Li 2 S and electrolyte without polysulfide and (b) lithium-ion diffusion in Li 2 S. These results demonstrate a simple and scalable approach to utilizing Li 2 S as the cathode material for <b>rechargeable</b> <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> <b>with</b> high specific energy. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrolytic}} solutions {{of contemporary}} Li-ion batteries are made exclusively with the organic solvents since anodic materials of these <b>batteries</b> have potentials <b>with</b> greater negativity than {{the potential of}} the water reduction, thus the organic electrolytes can withstand the voltages of 3 - 5 V that are characteristic for these batteries. Ever since it was discovered that some materials can electrochemically intercalate and deintercalate Li+ ions in aqueous solutions, numerous studies have been conducted with the aim of extending operational time of the aqueous Li-ion batteries. Manganese oxide has been studied as the electrode material in <b>rechargeable</b> <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> <b>with</b> organic electrolytes. In this paper its electrochemical behavior as an anode material in aqueous electrolyte solutions was examined. MnO 2 as a component of nanodispersed MnO 2 /C (Vulcan®) composite was successfully synthesized hydrothermally. Electrochemical properties of this material were investigated in aqueous saturated LiNO 3 solution by both cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charging/discharging (LiMn 2 O 4 as cathode material) techniques. The obtained composite shows a relatively good initial discharge capacity of 96. 5 mAh/g which, after 50 th charging/discharging cycles, drops to the value of 57 mAh/g. MnO 2 /C (Vulcan®) composite, in combination with LiMn 2 O 4 as a cathode material, shows better discharge capacity compared to other anodic materials used in aqueous Li-ion batteries according to certain studies that have been conducted. Its good reversibility and cyclability, and the fact that hydrothermal method is simple and effective, makes MnO 2 /C(Vulcan®) composite a promising anodic material for aqueous Li-ion batteries...|$|R
