25|$|Press fit are {{available}} in two types with liners or without (wearing bushings). Liner bushings, sometimes called master bushings, are permanently installed into the jig and accept liners that can easily be replaced. Press-fit wearing bushings are used in short run applications or in applications where the tolerance on a hole location is so tight that it cannot facilitate {{the use of a}} <b>liner</b> <b>bushing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fixed {{renewable}} bushings {{are used}} in applications where the liner {{is meant to be}} used until it wears out. Slip renewable bushings are designed to be interchangeable with a given sized liner so that two different sized slip renewable bushings can be used in one <b>liner</b> <b>bushing.</b> This facilitates the ability to do multiple machining operations that require different inner diameter (ID) bushings, such as drilling and reaming. They usually have knurled heads so they can be easily removed.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{bushings}} must {{be secured}} in their <b>liner</b> <b>bushing,</b> otherwise the tool can cause it to spin, which rapidly wears out the liner, or chips can force the bushing out of the liner. There are {{many different types of}} locking systems for renewable bushings. One system is a dog, which is a collar that is pressed over the head of the bushing and has a long tail. The tail may be bent at the end so it can lock {{around the edge of the}} jig plate or it may be left straight if it can butt up against another object. Another option to keep the renewable bushing from rotating is to pin it, either by putting a pin in the renewable bushing and a hole in the liner or vice versa. A more complicated version uses a hole in the bushing collar and a pin with a head; the head on the pin holds the edge of the collar down, but for removal the bushing can be rotated so that the hole lines up with the pin.|$|E
