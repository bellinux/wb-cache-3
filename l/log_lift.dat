His weight, {{pressing}} upon the outer {{ends of the}} <b>logs,</b> had <b>lifted</b> the other ends off the shore, and the raft was slowly floating up the stream. The reason why it floated up was, that there was at this place what they call an eddy, which is a current near the shore, flowing up the stream.

5000|$|Most {{terrorist}} organizations incorporate guerrilla warfare. Terrorist recruits {{must be in}} good shape in order to withstand the constant challenges of this non-conventional battle tactic. From viewing the ISIS organization's workout video, terrorist leaders form their physical agendas based off cardiovascular exercise. Their routines are very basic, including: Air squats, tumbling, jumping over smoke, crawling under wire, crouch-walking holding bricks, hand-walking on monkey bars, squats with tires, pushups with tires, marching with tires, crawling with tires, overhead squats with rifles, basic hand to hand combat and self-defense technique, and team <b>log</b> <b>lifts.</b> Terrorist recruits train in full uniform, and often times with weapons in hand. Above all else, terrorist recruits need to be trained for survival {{as well as being}} able to perform with little to no nourishment. Recruits {{need to be able to}} withstand the elements of their nation. Recruits need to understand that failure is not an option; if success is not attained then they will not be pulled out action, there will be no rescue mission for them. When given a mission, terrorists will accomplish the task for risk of punishment, reprimand, organization seclusion, or even disgrace to themselves and family.|$|R

40|$|This article {{approaches}} {{the option of}} <b>logging</b> <b>lifting</b> activities by nurses in patient care. Practical problems in nursing limit the use of direct observation and measurements to assess exposure to lifting in real life settings. Indications were found that logs registering the frequency of manual handling could be an option in nursing. The development of a log is accounted for and its use during an intervention, introducing 40 patient hoists in home care, is described. The exposure to manual handling was reduced significantly in the intervention group (average number of patient transfers per nurse/week (ptn/w) 35 - 21). The control group remained stable (ptn/w 24 - 24). The reduction of exposure was only {{partly due to the}} hoists substituting manual transfers, suggesting the presence of an eliminating effect. Possible explanations indicating that the hoists were partly responsible for this are: 1. The patients' relatives could now perform the transfers with the hoists; 2. Hoists combine several manual transfers into one mechanical transfer; 3. Hoists require only one operator for manual transfers that require two nurses; The log pointed to unpredicted elimination effects in addition to the substitution effects, and provided detailed information for evaluating the intervention. Relevance to industry: Assessment of exposure to manual handling, using a frequency-oriented log, appears to provide relevant information for designing back pain prevention policies in nursing. Insight is given into the effects fo an intervention using hoists. With some adaptions, the log could monitor ergonomic policies in nursing practice on a routine basis. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

50|$|De Gekroonde Poelenburg is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 3.0 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20.3 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft cast by foundry De Prins van Oranje as number 0430 in 1866. The brake wheel with 66 cogs on the wind shaft drives the crank wheel with 26 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has three crank pins. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the three frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the <b>log</b> hoist to <b>lift</b> <b>logs</b> from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the log carriages back to their starting position.|$|R

After several bends it then climbed its second lift hill. After the <b>lift,</b> <b>Log</b> Jammer went through several turns, then it went down a medium-sized drop.
