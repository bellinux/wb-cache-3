5000|$|To {{decide how}} much fuel needs to be {{injected}} into each intake runner the ECU calculates the air mass that had been drawn into the cylinder. The calculation makes use of the cylinder volume (the B204 engine has a displacement of 0.5 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> <b>cylinder).</b> That cylinder volume holds equal amount of air which has a density and thus a certain mass. The air density is calculated using the absolute pressure and temperature in the intake manifold. The air mass for combustion has now been calculated and that value is divided by 14.7 (stoichiometric relation for gasoline mass to air mass) to determine the required fuel mass for each combustion to inject. Since the flow capacity of the injector and {{the density of the}} fuel (pre programmed values) are known, the ECU can calculate the duration of the injection.|$|R
50|$|The {{water demand}} in 2001 was 750 million <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> {{day and the}} actual supply is only 570 million <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day and the per capita usage is about 105 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day.

50|$|Following the {{successful}} 1984 championship, Eckersley and Romano prepared {{the car for}} the Sandown 1000 which was a round of the 1984 World Endurance Championship where it would compete in the special AC Class for Australian-based GT and Sports cars. The preparation included adding 70 kg of ballast to the 775 kg WE84 to bring it {{in line with the}} FIA weight scale for cars with a 3.9 <b>litre,</b> four valves <b>per</b> <b>cylinder</b> engine (the lead weight, bringing the car to 845 kg, was placed on the passenger floor which would bring its own problems). Despite Romano purchasing a 3.9 litre Cosworth DFL V8 with the intent on putting it in before the meeting, it was only put in after the first day of practice when it became apparent the 3.0 litre DFV was past its best after Romano's co-driver, four times Australian Drivers' Champion Alfredo Costanzo (the faster of the pair by over 2 seconds despite not having driven the car previously after missing a pre-meeting sorting session at Calder Park) could not lap in better than 1:42 when it was expected that the Romano was capable of lapping around 8 seconds faster.|$|R

50|$|Compared to a {{conventional}} boat powered by diesel with same functional features and safety standards which costs 231,000 US$, the solar ferry costs 370,000 US$. An efficient conventional boat consumes 120 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day (12 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> hour), or 3,500 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> month and 42,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> year of diesel. This amounts to 39,000 US$ for diesel (@ 0.93 US$/litre) and {{total operating costs}} including lube oil and other maintenance costs amounts to 44,600 US$ per year.|$|R
50|$|Pakistani and Afghani camels are {{supposed}} to produce the highest yields of milk, up to 30 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day. The Bactrian camel produces 5 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day and the dromedary produces an average of 20 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day. Intensive breeding of cows has created animals that can produce 40 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day in ideal conditions. Camels, with their ability to go 21 days without drinking water, and produce milk even when feeding on low-quality fodder, are a sustainable option for food security in difficult environments.|$|R

50|$|Muslim {{engineers}} used norias {{to discharge}} water into aqueducts which carried {{the water to}} towns and fields. Some of the norias used in the medieval Islamic world were as large as 20 meters in diameter, the norias at Hama being a surviving example still used in modern times (although currently only serving aesthetical purposes). It has 120 water collection compartments and could raise more than 95 <b>litres</b> of water <b>per</b> minute. Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi's Kitab al-Hawi in the 10th century describes a noria in Iraq that could lift as much as 153,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> hour, or 2550 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> minute.
