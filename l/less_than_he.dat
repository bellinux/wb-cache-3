Hope Shakespear relented when the couple agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20April 1914. Olivia gave them two early circus drawings by Pablo Picasso.|$|E
5|$|Debs ran for {{president}} in the 1920 election while in prison in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. He received 919,799 votes (3.4%), slightly <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had won in 1912, when he received 6%, {{the highest number of}} votes for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S. During his time in prison, Debs wrote a series of columns deeply critical of the prison system. They appeared in sanitized form in the Bell Syndicate and were published in his only book, Walls and Bars, with several added chapters. It was published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, the Flames signed Regehr {{to another}} five-year {{contract}} extension worth {{a total of}} US$20-million. The deal {{was considered to be}} worth <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> could have gotten as an unrestricted free agent the following year, but he chose to take less to stay in a city his family enjoyed and on a team he felt was competitive. Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E

5|$|Piłsudski's arch-rival Roman Dmowski, {{traveled}} to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring {{to discourage the}} Japanese government from supporting at this time a Polish revolution which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure. Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political arch-enemy {{to the end of}} Piłsudski's life. In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.|$|E
5|$|Lane advises Joan {{to demand}} a 5% {{partnership}} stake in the company, adding that, when {{he thought he was}} essential {{to the future of the}} firm, he settled for much <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{having been}} restored, a grand {{ceremonial}} procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding {{through the streets}} on horseback, while the Prince of Antioch and the King of Jerusalem followed on foot. Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd. In May, {{at the head of}} a united Christian army, he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Syria, of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade.* P. Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, 67* J. H. Norwich, A short history of Byzantium Despite the glorious end of the expedition, modern scholars argue that Manuel ultimately achieved much <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had desired in terms of imperial restoration.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E

25|$|Melville's {{earnings}} {{from the book}} add up to $1,260: the ₤150 advance from Bentley was equivalent to $703, and the American printings earned him $556, which was $100 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> earned from any of his five previous books. Melville's widow received another $81 when the United States Book Company issued the book and sold almost 1,800 copies between 1892 and 1898.|$|E

Frederick's allowance was raised but by <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had asked for.|$|E
25|$|On December 19, 2006, Allen Iverson, {{along with}} Ivan McFarlin, {{were sent to}} the Denver Nuggets in {{exchange}} for guard Andre Miller, forward Joe Smith, and two first-round draft picks. Then, on January 11, Sixers GM Billy King announced that the Sixers and aging forward Chris Webber had agreed to a buyout of the remainder of his contract. The Sixers would pay Webber $36 million over the next 1½ seasons, which is $7 million <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> would have been paid to play. After the buyout, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In August 1969, {{following}} the annual Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in the city, serious rioting {{took place in}} Derry and Belfast. The Civil Rights movement responded by calling marches across Northern Ireland to further stretch police resources and on 14 August the British Government allowed the deployment of the Prince of Wales's Own Regiment in Derry to relieve the Police. The following day the deployment was extended to Belfast. Early the next year Chichester Clark flew to London to request more military support {{in an attempt to}} stem the increasing violence. Receiving much <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had requested, he resigned and was replaced by Brian Faulkner.|$|E

The game {{marked the first time}} that the Bears had been held out of the end zone at home since 1998 and was the third time during Jeff Tedford's tenure as head coach that Cal failed to score a touchdown, the second time being the previous week.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his lifelong}} love of theatre, he financed {{elaborate}} musicals, often to his financial detriment. One of Baum's worst financial endeavors was his The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays (1908), which combined a slideshow, film, and live actors with a lecture by Baum {{as if he}} were giving a travelogue to Oz. However, Baum ran into trouble and could not pay his debts to the company who produced the films. He did not get back to a stable financial situation for several years, after he sold the royalty rights to many of his earlier works, including The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. This resulted in the M.A. Donahue Company publishing cheap editions of his early works with advertising which purported that Baum's newer output was inferior to the less expensive books that they were releasing. Baum had shrewdly transferred most of his property into Maud's name, except for his clothing, his typewriter, and his library (mostly of children's books, such as the fairy tales of Andrew Lang, whose portrait he kept in his study)—all of which, he successfully argued, were essential to his occupation. Maud handled the finances anyway, and thus Baum lost much <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> could have.|$|E
25|$|The {{team lost}} several players to free agency after the 2016 season, {{including}} right-handed relief pitcher Matt Belisle, left-handed reliever Sean Burnett, infielder Stephen Drew, outfielder Chris Heisey, right-handed pitcher Mat Latos, closer Mark Melancon, catcher Wilson Ramos, and left-handed reliever Marc Rzepczynski. Additionally, the Nationals {{chose not to}} exercise their 2017 option on right-handed pitcher Yusmeiro Petit, who also became a free agent, and injured right-handed reliever Aaron Barrett declined an outright assignment to the minors and elected free agency as well. The team did not extend a qualifying offer to any of its free agents. Ramos was considered a likely candidate for a qualifying offer, but due to an injury late in the 2016 season expected to sideline him {{for part of the}} 2017 season, he did not receive one; he ultimately signed a two-year deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. Outfielder Ben Revere was eligible for arbitration, but after an injury-plagued and offensively dismal season, he was not tendered a new contract and became a free agent; he later signed a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> was due to earn through the arbitration process. The Nationals extended one-year contracts for the 2017 season to all of their other arbitration-eligible players: shortstop Danny Espinosa (who ended up being traded before arbitration to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim), right fielder Bryce Harper, catcher Jose Lobaton, third baseman Anthony Rendon, and right-handed pitcher Tanner Roark. Heisey and Drew both signed new one-year contracts with the Nationals as well.|$|E
