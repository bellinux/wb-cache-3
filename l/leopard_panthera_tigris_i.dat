We administered a questionnaire survey of people residing in and around the corridor and also examined forest department records. Results revealed that leopards caused more frequent losses, whereas tigers caused greater economic losses. Local communities perceived leopards as a bigger threat than tigers, due to the intrusive nature of leopards (i. e., entering villages and houses and carrying off livestock and, in some cases, children). Although people currently are tolerant of wild felids, they are likely to become hostile to them in the future; we discuss specific strategies to resolve the conflicts...|$|R

40|$|In conjoining the {{disciplines}} of “ethology” and “chemistry” {{the field of}} “Ethochemistry” has been instituted. Ethochemistry is an effective tool in conservation efforts of endangered species and the understanding of behavioral patterns across all species. Chemical constituents of scent-markings have an important, yet poorly understood function in territoriality, reproduction, dominance, and impact on evolutionary biology, especially in large mammals. Particular attention has recently been focused on scent-marking analysis of great cats (Kalahari <b>leopards</b> (<b>Panthera</b> pardus), puma (Puma concolor) snow <b>leopard</b> (<b>Panthera</b> uncia), African lions (Panthera leo), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and tigers (<b>Panthera</b> <b>tigris))</b> {{for the purpose of}} conservation. Sensory analyses of scent-markings could address knowledge gaps in ethochemistry. The objective of this review is to summarize the current state-of-the art of both the chemical and sensory analyses of scent-markings in wild mammals. Specific focus is placed on sampling and sample preparation, chemical analysis, sensory analysis, and simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses. Constituents of exocrine and endocrine secretions have been most commonly studied with chromatography-based analytical separations. Odor analysis of scent-markings provides an insight into the animal’s sensory perception. A limited number of articles have been published in the area of sensory characterization of scent marks. Simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses with chromatography-olfactometry hyphenation could potentially aid conservation efforts by linking perceived odor, compounds responsible for odor, and resulting behavior...|$|R
