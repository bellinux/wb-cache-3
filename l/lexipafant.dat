40|$|BACKGROUND: Intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion {{can lead}} to {{pulmonary}} injury characterised by increased macromolecular leakage and leukocyte sequestration. Important mediators of ischaemia-reperfusion-associated injury include polymorphonuclear granulocytes and platelet-activating factor. AIM: To investigate the potential therapeutic inhibition of platelet-activating factor in intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion associated pulmonary injury, by use of a potent platelet-activating factor-receptor antagonist, <b>lexipafant.</b> METHODS: Rats were subjected to 30 minutes of intestinal ischaemia followed by 3 or 12 hours reperfusion. <b>Lexipafant</b> or saline was given intraperitoneally after 30 minutes reperfusion. RESULTS: Increased leakage of radiolabelled human serum albumin {{was found in the}} lungs after intestinal ischaemia followed by 3 or 12 hours reperfusion. Administration of <b>lexipafant</b> did not significantly prevent the increased leakage. Pulmonary myeloperoxidase content increased after intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion, indicating polymorphonuclear granulocyte sequestration through the pulmonary endothelium. The increase in interleukin- 1 beta seen after 3 hours reperfusion was partly reversed by <b>lexipafant.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary injury occurred following intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion, characterised by increased leakage of radiolabelled albumin over the endothelial barrier; correlating with increased pulmonary myeloperoxidase-content, implying involvement of polymorphonuclear granulocytes in the pathogenesis of remote organ injury after intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion. <b>Lexipafant</b> did not significantly decrease severity of pulmonary damage...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{platelet}} activating factor (PAF) {{is believed to}} amplify the activity of key mediators of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in acute pancreatitis, resulting in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that a potent PAF antagonist, <b>lexipafant,</b> could dampen SIRS and reduce organ failure in severe acute pancreatitis. Methods: we conducted a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial of <b>lexipafant</b> (100 mg/ 24 hours intravenously for seven days commenced within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms) involving 290 patients with an APACHE II score > 6. Power calculations assumed that complications would be reduced from 40 % to 24 %. Secondary end points studied included severity of organ failure, markers of the inflammatory response, and mortality rate. Findings: overall, 80 / 138 (58 %) patients {{in the placebo group}} and 85 / 148 (57 %) in the <b>lexipafant</b> group developed one or more organ failures. The primary hypothesis was invalidated by the unexpected finding that 44 % of patients had organ failure on entry into the study; only 39 (14 %) developed new organ failure. Organ failure scores were reduced in the <b>lexipafant</b> group only on day 3 : median change - 1 (range - 4 to + 8) versus 0 (- 4 to + 10) in the placebo group (p= 0. 04). Systemic sepsis affected fewer patients in the <b>lexipafant</b> group (13 / 138 v 4 / 148; p= 0. 023). Local complications occurred in 41 / 138 (30 %) patients in the placebo group and in 30 / 148 (20 %) in the <b>lexipafant</b> group (20 %; p= 0. 065); pseudocysts developed in 19 (14 %) and eight (5 %) patients, respectively (p= 0. 025). Deaths attributable to acute pancreatitis were not significantly different. Interleukin 8, a marker of neutrophil activation, and E-selectin, a marker of endothelial damage, decreased more rapidly in the <b>lexipafant</b> group (both p< 0. 05); however, absolute values were not different between the two groups. Interpretation: the high incidence of organ failure within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms undermined the primary hypothesis, and power calculations for future studies in severe acute pancreatitis will need to allow for this. <b>Lexipafant</b> had no effect on new organ failure during treatment.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{platelet}} activating factor (PAF) antagonists, potent neuroprotective agents in experimental cerebral dysfunction, in clinical practice. Design: Double blind, minimised, placebo controlled trial of {{low and high}} dose PAF antagonist (<b>lexipafant).</b> Setting: Cardiac surgery unit. Patients: 150 patients undergoing {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Interventions: Randomisation to placebo, low dose (10 mg) or high dose (100 mg) <b>lexipafant.</b> Main outcome measures: Incidence of impairment on four established cognitive tests, undertaken before, five days, and three months after CABG, examined by three methods for defining impairment. Results: The three groups were similar with respect to preoperative and intraoperative factors. Observed levels of cognitive impairment were less than had been predicted from previous studies. There was no difference in the groups in cognitive change scores at five days or three months. Group mean analysis showed significant time factors for all four tests but not for interactions or for the <b>lexipafant</b> group. A composite cognitive index, based on the aggregate of four normally distributed tests, showed a significant effect for timing of the test but not for the <b>lexipafant</b> group or interaction. Age, but not duration of bypass, was the most important determinant of postoperative cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The neuroprotective PAF antagonist <b>lexipafant</b> did not differentially reduce the level of cognitive impairment after CABG as determined by power estimates derived from published studies. The strongest predictors of cognitive impairment were age and timing of the test after operation...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Pulmonary {{injury is}} an {{important}} determinant of outcome in severe acute pancreatitis. The aim of this experimental {{study was to investigate}} the potential effect of <b>lexipafant,</b> a platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, on pancreatitis-associated pulmonary injury in experimental acute pancreatitis. Material and methods. Acute pancreatitis was induced by intraductal infusion of 5 % sodium taurodeoxycholate in rats that were given the PAF antagonist <b>lexipafant</b> either before (pretreatment) or after (treatment) induction of pancreatitis. Pulmonary endothelial barrier permeability, oedema, protease inhibitor levels, pulmonary ultrastructure and membrane system integrity and levels of interleukin- 1 and - 6 were evaluated. Results. Pulmonary injury was characterized by increased pulmonary endothelial barrier permeability, alveolar oedema and hypoxaemia, which were noted 12 h after the induction of pancreatitis. Pretreatment with <b>lexipafant</b> counteracted the increase in endothelial permeability and partially prevented derangements of protease inhibitor levels. Treatment with <b>lexipafant</b> reduced the severity of pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction and diminished the pancreatitis-induced increase in cytokines. Conclusions. PAF seems {{to play a major role}} in experimental pancreatitis-associated pulmonary injury and protease inhibitor imbalance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Oxygen free {{radicals}} (OFRs), platelet activating factor (PAF), cell adhesion molecules, and transmigration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes through the gut barrier are probably all essential {{in the development}} of gut barrier dysfunction following intestinal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Pretreatment and early treatment of I/R with the OFRs-scavenger (NAC), the PAF inhibitor <b>lexipafant,</b> and monoclonal antibodies against the adhesion molecule PECAM- 1 (anti-PECAM- 1 -Mab) have been reported to be effective in the prevention or recovery of gut barrier dysfunction and result in a decrease in cytokine levels. Less is known about the effect of treatment inserted during the late stage of I/R. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential therapeutic value of single or combination therapy with NAC, <b>lexipafant,</b> and anti-PECAM- 1 -MAb administered late during intestinal I/R in the rat. METHODS: NAC, <b>lexipafant,</b> and anti-PECAM- 1 -MAb were administrated, alone or in combination, after 3 h of reperfusion following 40 min of superior mesenteric arterial ischemia in the rat. Intestinal endothelial and epithelial barrier permeability, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), and protease inhibitor levels were evaluated after 12 h of reperfusion. RESULTS: Intestinal endothelial and epithelial permeability significantly increased in rats with I/R and saline treatment. Proteolytic activity in plasma was indicated by low levels of the three measured plasma protease inhibitors. Intestinal mucosal MPO content increased significantly. These changes were, to different degrees, reduced by late inserted treatment with NAC, <b>lexipafant,</b> or anti-PECAM- 1 -MAb. Alterations in systemic levels of IL- 1 beta paralleled the changes found in gut barrier permeability and leukocyte trapping. Systemic antithrombin III levels and increased barrier permeability in remote organs were partly restored, especially by multimodal therapy. CONCLUSION: Treatment with NAC, <b>lexipafant,</b> and/or monoclonal antibodies against PECAM- 1, inserted at a later stage of I/R, reduced the severity of I/R-associated intestinal dysfunction and decreased the systemic concentrations of IL- 1 beta, local leukocyte recruitment (MPO), and partly restored plasma protease inhibitor levels...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Platelet-activating {{factor is}} a {{mediator}} of lung injury during cardiac operation. Platelet-activating factor antagonists reduce lung injury in animal models of cardiopulmonary bypass {{but there is}} no confirmatory evidence in clinical practice. METHODS: The effect of a low or high dose of a platelet-activating factor antagonist (<b>Lexipafant)</b> was assessed in a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. One hundred fifty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized by minimization into three groups to receive placebo infusion, 10 or 100 mg of <b>lexipafant</b> for over 24 hours. Serial arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension, alveolar arterial oxygen gradient, and percent saturation were measured before operation and at 1, 6, 24, 48 hours, and 5 days after operation. RESULTS: Patient groups were similar with respect to age, sex, body surface area, and urgency of operation. Likewise, the groups were similar with respect to duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and the number and type of grafts. Maximum lung injury occurred at 48 hours when the arterial oxygen tension and percent saturation reached a nadir (both p < 0. 001) accompanied by the maximum increase in the alveolar arterial gradient (p < 0. 001). All measurements demonstrated partial recovery by 5 days but remained significantly (p < 0. 001) impaired in comparison to baseline values. Duration of ventilation was similar in all groups. <b>Lexipafant,</b> at low or high dose, did not moderate lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass and did not influence the duration of postoperative ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite experimental and clinical evidence implicating platelet-activating factor in the pathophysiology of lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass, no beneficial effect of a platelet-activating factor antagonist on lung function or ventilation could be demonstrated in this clinical trial...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of cell {{adhesion}} molecules and transmigration of PMNs through the endothelial barrier is probably essential in intestinal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) -induced gut barrier dysfunction.

40|$|Intestinal {{ischemia}} and reperfusion (I/R) is not infrequent in {{the clinical}} situation and the intestinal barrier {{plays an important role}} in gut barrier function, preventing not at least septic complications and potentially the development of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Mechanisms of intestinal I/R induced gut epithelial and endothelial barrier dysfunction and remote organ dysfunction, as well as potential preventive and therapeutic modes of management were evaluated in the rat. A short period of intestinal ischemia (20 min) was followed by an early epithelial barrier recovery as compared to longer (40 min) ischemia and same time period of reperfusion, though without obvious recovery of endothelial barrier permeability. Following the longer period of ischemia, no increased incidence of apoptosis and composition of epithelial DNA could be found. Intestinal I/R induced epithelial and endothelial barrier and remote organ dysfunction seemed to be the result not only from oxygene free radicals (OFRs), but also by other effects of over-activated phagocytic cells, cytokines like interleukin- 1 beta and 6, platelet-activating factor (PAF), imbalance of the protease- antiprotease system (including alfa 1 -macroglobulin, alfa 2 -antiplasmin, antithrombin III, prekallikrein, factor X) and effects depending on adhesion molecules such as ICAM- 1 and PECAM- 1. Pretreatment and treatment both at the early and late stage of I/R with OFR-scavengers, the antioxidant NAC, the PAF inhibitor <b>lexipafant,</b> and monoclonal antibodies against ICAM- 1 or PECAM- 1 were effective in reversing the otherwise occurring changes found like gut barrier dysfunction with increased barrier permeability, increased ileal MPO activity and bacterial translocation, consumption of protease inhibitors, and increased systemic levels of cytokines. Conclusion: Activated phagocytes, OFRs, cytokines, PAF, adhesion molecules, and imbalance in the protease-antiprotease system all seems involved in intestinal I/R induced gut endothelial and epithelial barrier as well as remote organ dysfunction. Treatment with NAC, <b>lexipafant</b> and/or monoclonal antibodies against PECAM- 1 inserted before reperfusion or at both early or later stages of I/R were effective in reducing the changes that otherwise ocurrred after intestinal I/R...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal I/R is {{considered}} to be an important initiating event in several pathophysiological conditions such as trauma, bleeding, sepsis and pancreatitis, frequently leading to concomitant both single and potentially multiple organ dysfunction. The purpose of this thesis was to study mechanims underlying the development of multiple organ dysfunction, with special focus on intercellular proinflammatory regulation in the concurrent development of tissue injury. A further aim was to evaluate novel forms of therapy and prevention against the development of multipel organ dysfunction. Experimental intestinal I/R was induced by clamping the superior mesenteric artery in male Sprague-Dawley rats for 40 min, followed by reperfusion up to 12 hrs. Treatment attempts with N-Acetylcystein (NAC), the platelet activating factor (PAF) inhibitor <b>lexipafant,</b> monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1), active-site-inactivated FVIIa (FVIIai) or the FXa inhibitor fondaparinux were tested. It was found that intestinal I/R induced an increase in intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) expression in different tissues with marked organ variability. In parallel, an inflammatory response with neutrophil recruitment in the lungs and intestines as well as an increased endothelial barrier permeability in several organs was observed. Inflammatory mediators such as TNF-a, IL- 1 b, MCP- 1 and MIP- 2 also increased, with an earlier response in organs directly affected by the I/R-injury than in organs more distantly located. Treatment 15 min after the start of reperfusion with NAC and <b>lexipafant</b> attenuated the inflammatory response, but did not affect the ICAM- 1 expression, suggesting that the protective effects of NAC and PAF-inhibition is not mediated via decreased expression of ICAM- 1. Therapy inserted at 3 hrs of reperfusion, also decreased the inflammatory response and tissue injury, although not as pronounced as demonstrated after early treatment. Administration of the anticoagulants FVIIai or fondaparinux resulted in decreased plasma levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant MIP- 2, whereas only FVIIai restored endothelial barrier dysfunction and decreased intestinal neutrophil recruitment. This demonstrates that inhibition of the TF-FVIIai complex formation by FVIIai can attenuate inflammatory responses in connection with intestinal I/R. Based on our results, we suggest that a multimodal treatment regime with inhibitors against inflammatory mediators such as oxygen free radicals, platelet activating factor and coagulation factors such as FVIIa and FXa, could represent potential future strategies in the prevention and treatment of organ dysfunction in hyperinflammatory states, seen e. g. in association with critical illness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In recent years, {{a number}} of {{articles}} have been published on the treatment of acute pancreatitis in experimental models {{and most of them}} concerned animals with mild disease. However, it is difficult to translate these results into clinical practice. For example, infliximab, a monoclonal TNF antibody, was experimentally tested in rats and it was found to significantly reduce the pathologic score and serum amylase activity and also to alleviate alveolar edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome; however, no studies are available in clinical human acute pancreatitis. Another substance, such as interleukin 10, was efficacious in decreasing the severity and mortality of lethal pancreatitis in rats, but seems to have no effect on human severe acute pancreatitis. Thus, the main problem in acute pancreatitis, especially in the severe form of the disease, is the difficulty of planning clinical studies capable of giving reliable statistically significant answers regarding the benefits of the various proposed therapeutic agents previously tested in experimental settings. According to the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis, the efficacy of the drugs already available, such as gabexate mesilate, <b>lexipafant</b> and somatostatin should be re-evaluated and should be probably administered in a different manner. Of course, also in this case, we need adequate studies to test this hypothesis. </p...|$|E

Following the rectal instillation of formalin 0. 75 % into male New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits, 0. 85 ml of aggregated immunoglobulin was administered i. v. Treatment groups (0. 8 mg/kg, n = 6; 2. 4 mg/kg, n = 13; 3. 2 mg/kg, n = 10) were given bolus doses of BB- 882 two-hourly i. v. (control group, n = 25). Rectal dialysis was performed before induction of colitis and sacrifice. Dialysate leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) levels were determined. Tissue was saved for histology and measurement of myeloperoxidase content. There was a dose-dependent improvement in macroscopic scores (2. 4 and 3. 2 mg/kg: P < 0. 02, P < 0. 001) and myeloperoxidase levels (3. 2 mg/kg: P < 0. 04).

Each study was ranked according to the evidence-based methodology of Sackett; whenever feasible, we performed new meta-analyses using the random-effects model. Recommendations were based on the available level of evidence (A=large randomized; B=small randomized; C=prospective trial). RESULTS: None of the evaluated medical treatments is recommended (level A). Patients with AP should receive early enteral nutrition (level B). While mild biliary AP is best treated by primary cholecystectomy (level B), patients with severe biliary AP require emergency endoscopic papillotomy followed by interval cholecystectomy (level A). Patients with necrotizing AP should receive imipenem or meropenem prophylaxis to decrease the risk of infected necrosis and mortality (level A). Sterile necrosis per se is not an indication for surgery (level C), and not all patients with infected necrosis require immediate surgery (level B). In general, early necrosectomy should be avoided (level B), and single necrosectomy with postoperative lavage should be preferred over "open-packing" because of fewer complications with comparable mortality rates (level C).

HT 29 (cl 19 A) cells were grown to confluency and incubated with neutrophils under conditions of: (i) neutrophil stimulation with phorbol-myristate-acetate; (ii) monolayer stimulation with interferon gamma, tumour necrosis factor alpha (IFN gamma, TNF alpha); and (iii) recent epithelial cell trypsinisation. These experiments were {{carried out in the}} presence of neutralising antibodies to CD 18, CD 11 b, LFA- 1, E-selectin, P-selectin, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), and ICAM- 2; a novel CD 11 b/CD 18 antagonist, neutrophil inhibitory factor (rNIF); adenosine receptor agonists (5 'N-ethycarboxamido adenosine/N 6 -cylopentyladenosine (NECA/CPA)) and a platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist <b>lexipafant.</b> Adhesion of stimulated neutrophils to resting monolayers was Mac- 1, CD 18 dependent and ICAM- 1, ICAM- 2, E-selectin, P-selectin, PAF independent.

40|$|Background: In {{predicted}} severe acute pancreatitis, {{many patients}} develop organ failure and recover without local complications, and mortality is only 14 – 30 %. It {{has been suggested}} that half of patients with progressive early organ failure may die, but there are no data to relate death or local complications to duration of early (week 1) organ failure. Aims: To determine mortality rates in patients with transient ( 48 hours) early organ failure and to show whether persistent organ failure predicts death or local complications. Patients: A total of 290 patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis previously studied in a trial of <b>lexipafant,</b> recruited from 78 hospitals through 18 centres in the UK. Method: Manual review of trial database to determine: the presence of organ failure (Marshall score >= 2) on each of the first seven days in hospital, duration of organ failure, and outcome of pancreatitis (death, complications by Atlanta criteria). Results: Early organ failure was present in 174 (60 %) patients. After transient organ failure (n = 71), outcome was good: one death and 29 % local complications. Persistent organ failure (n = 103) was followed by 36 deaths and 77 % local complications, irrespective of onset of organ failure on admission or later during the first week. Conclusion: Duration of organ failure {{during the first week of}} predicted severe acute pancreatitis is strongly associated with the risk of death or local complications. Resolution of organ failure within 48 hours suggests a good prognosis; persistent organ failure is a marker for subsequent death or local complications.
