40|$|The {{hold down}} bolt {{of the fans}} of an air cooler has failed by fatigue. Investigation showed that jamming of the <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> at the eye-end due to {{corrosion}} restricted {{the rotation of the}} <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> when the positioner acted to adjust the pitch of the blade. This has resulted in excessive stresses on the hold down bolt leading to failure by fatigue. The damages seen on other parts of the air cooler are secondary and subsequent to the failure of the hold down bolt. Use of stainless steel grade material for the construction of the linkages and periodic lubrication at the eye-end of the <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> are recommended to prevent the recurrence of similar failure...|$|R
40|$|A broken tail gearbox (TGB) {{housing and}} failed pitch link {{assemblies}} {{of a helicopter}} {{were sent to the}} laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that three out of the four attachment lugs of the TGB housing had fractured by overload. The fourth one had a 2. 4 mm long fatigue crack at the fillet of the lug fusing area with the temperature sensor – locating boss. Analysis shows that the failure of this lug was also due to overload and the presence of the fatigue crack was coincidental. All the pitch <b>link</b> <b>rods</b> had fractured due to sudden overload, probably during the dislodgement of the tail rotor blades. This had also resulted in snapping of all the cables with the pitch <b>link</b> <b>rods.</b> It appears that all the failures were instantaneous and would have taken place due to sudden overload on the TGB housing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{time-dependent}} reliability {{model of}} Mechanical Component {{is influenced by}} many parameters such as stress, load, strength, strength degeneration and lifetime index. This paper builds the time-dependent reliability model when life {{is measured by the}} loading numbers. The variety law of mechanical component’s reliability with the lifetime is derived from the built model and simulation of <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> in needle bar mechanism used in the sewing machine. The result shows that the time-dependent reliability model is effective and the reliability of component decreases obviously with the loading numbers when the strength degeneration is considered...|$|R

In this system, a <b>linked</b> <b>rod</b> and bead metallic chain {{in the form of}} a ring is collisionally excited by a vertically oscillating plate. The dynamics are driven primarily by inelastic bead-plate collisions and are simultaneously constrained by the rings' physical connectedness. By imaging many instances of the ring configurations, we measure the ensemble averages and distributions of several physical characteristics on the scale of individual beads and composite ring. We study local properties such as inter-bead seperation and inter-bonds angles, and global properties such as the radius of gyration and center of mass motion. We characterize scaling with respect to the size of the chain. Comment: 10 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

25|$|Built in Fishponds, Bristol by Brazil-Straker {{under the}} {{direction}} of Roy Fedden, the Mercury featured an unusual crankshaft and connecting rod arrangement that dispensed with the more normal design of a single master <b>rod</b> <b>linking</b> to individual <b>rods</b> for each cylinder. It was said to run well without vibration and set an unofficial time to climb record while fitted to the Bristol Scout F, the aircraft achieving 10,000ft (3,000 m) in 5.4 minutes and 20,000ft (6,000 m) in 16.25 minutes.|$|R
40|$|The SHARCS project aims {{to develop}} an {{actively}} controlled helicopter rotor for the simultaneous suppression of vibration and noise.

The project is an international effort of seven partner institutions from Canada, Italy and Greece, which goal is to design, build and wind tunnel test a scaled rotor incorporating all three subsystems.

The boxes slid in cast iron ways placed at right angle {{to the line of}} the engine, and each axle had a crank keyed upon its upper end. The well known slotted yoke connection was used. The slide valves were of the usual locomotive form. The links were placed in a horizontal instead of a vertical position, and were operated by two bell cranks. The throttle valve, <b>link</b> <b>rod,</b> brake, and coupling rods, and the connection between the driving boxes for producing pressure against the rails, were operated by hydraulic power, although hand levers were also provided.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{investigation}} {{studies the}} speed design of lift-up mechanism in a welfare vehicle that lowers and raises a seat {{from the side}} door of the vehicle. The seat functions like a wheelchair as it is landed to the ground. A parallelogram configuration is adopted in the mechanism design. A parallelogram linkage, in which a <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> is shaped as a cam, governs {{the motion of the}} mechanism. The cam pair mechanism, like a motion-generator cam, determines the motion to expand the lift-up mechanism. The system is kinematically analyzed. The constraint relations, velocity equations, and acceleration equations of the mechanism are obtained. The kinematic characteristics of the lift-up mechanism are investigated, which gives the guidance to design the speed of the system. The speed of the lift-up mechanism is investigated, in which the method of linear function with parabolic blends for a path with via-points is adopted in the trajectory planning...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRod photoreceptors {{contribute}} to vision over an ∼ 6 -log-unit range of light intensities. The {{wide dynamic range}} of rod vision is thought to depend upon light intensity-dependent switching between two parallel pathways <b>linking</b> <b>rods</b> to ganglion cells: a rod→rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway that operates at dim backgrounds and a rod→cone→cone bipolar cell pathway that operates at brighter backgrounds. We evaluated this conventional model of rod vision by recording rod-mediated light responses from ganglion and AII amacrine cells and by recording RB-mediated synaptic currents from AII amacrine cells in mouse retina. Contrary to the conventional model, {{we found that the}} RB pathway functioned at backgrounds sufficient to activate the rod→cone pathway. As background light intensity increased, the RB’s role changed from encoding the absorption of single photons to encoding contrast modulations around mean luminance. This transition is explained by the intrinsic dynamics of transmission from RB synapses...|$|R
40|$|Structural static {{strength}} test {{was conducted on}} the CFRP Composite Co-cured rudder for LCA, to demonstrate the structural integrity of the rudder and to experimentally determine the deflections and strains at selected locations and to correlate the test values with those obtained by theoretical analysis. The rudder was loaded upto the limit load (2614. 0 kgs) and a limit reaction load (652. 2 kgs) was also simultaneously applied. The load Vs deflection / strain behaviour was obtained. The rudder successfully withstood the limit load without any failure and the corresponding maximum tip deflection was 37. 16 mm. The maximum strain recorded was 1998 micro strain on the shear web of the front spar of the rudder. The torque monitored on the <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> was 3874. 20 N-m and the applied torque was 3675. 17 N-m. Both the deflections and strains were well within design requirements. It was therefore concluded that the structural behaviour of the rudder is satisfactory and it was cleared for flight trials. This report deals with the results of the static testing of the rudder...|$|R

40|$|A failed {{undercarriage}} door-operating lever of {{an aircraft}} {{was sent to}} the laboratory for analysis. The lever was found to have fractured in three locations, one in each arm of the lever. The <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> had fractured in the tubular section near one of the ends. Fractographic study revealed that all the fractures except the one on the long arm of the lever were caused due to sudden overload on the component. The fracture on the long arm showed presence of a fatigue crack. The crack was located in one of the webs of the arm and had a depth of 4 to 5 mm. Analysis suggests that in spite of the presence of this fatigue crack, the component had adequate strength to sustain the normal operating load. Hence, the presence of this fatigue crack appears to be coincidental and {{does not appear to have}} played any role in the present failure. In view of this, it is concluded that the door-operating lever has failed due to overload on the component, possibly due to malfunctioning/problems elsewhere in the system. It is suggested that the source (s) of overload on the component be identified and corrective measures incorporated to prevent recurrence of similar failure. No metallurgical abnormalities in the material or corrosion were found to be responsible for the failure...|$|R
