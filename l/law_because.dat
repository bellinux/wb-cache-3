5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second <b>law</b> <b>because</b> the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E
5|$|After 1952, the {{building}} {{served as the}} European centre of the American armed forces and {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed {{the building}} the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in <b>law,</b> <b>because</b> the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner.|$|E
5|$|Apple's {{litigation}} over {{object code}} {{contributed to the}} development of contemporary copyright <b>law</b> <b>because</b> the company's object code cases brought different results in different courts, creating a conflict of laws that resulted in international litigation. In the 1980s, Apple litigated two copyright cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code (as contrasted with source code) of a computer program is subject to copyright laws. A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand. The specific cases were Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc. (1986, Australia) ("Computer Edge"), Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd., (Canada, 1987) ("Apple v. Mackintosh"), and IBM v. Computer Imports Ltd. ("IBM v. Computer Imports"), (New Zealand, 1989).|$|E

5|$|Bart and Marge {{take the}} lizards to the Springfield Birdwatching Society. Principal Skinner, {{a member of}} the society, {{explains}} that they are Bolivian tree lizards, a type of lizard that steals a bird’s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. Skinner says the lizards must be killed by <b>law,</b> <b>because</b> they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, but before he can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the lizards glide to the ground, where they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|E
5|$|During 1166, Neville was {{in charge}} of Staffordshire for the general eyre {{undertaken}} in that year, and also tried the pleas of the forest for Devonshire and Worcestershire, and perhaps elsewhere. The abbot of Battle Abbey in 1167 sent a monk to plead with Waleran of Meulan to intervene and stop Neville's exactions on the abbot's manors. After the Revolt of 1173–74, Neville {{was in charge}} of a forest eyre held from 1176 to 1178 which resulted in fines totaling 12,000 pounds from breaches of the forest law during the revolt. It appears that the king intended this eyre to be a punishment, and used the forest <b>law</b> <b>because</b> it was solely dependent on the king's will rather than being based in customary law.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the legislators}} would become {{prominent}} figures during the territorial years of Oregon. At first {{the body was}} a small committee of nine people, but the group was altered when the Organic Laws of Oregon were revised in 1845 with the legislative branch of the Provisional Government becoming the Oregon House of Representatives {{with a minimum of}} 13 members. Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that <b>law,</b> <b>because</b> it was in conflict with Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the sole right to coin money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins.|$|E

5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any <b>law</b> <b>because</b> {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before 312 BC, the Plebeian Council {{enacted the}} Plebiscitum Ovinium. During the early republic, only consuls could appoint new senators. This initiative, however, {{transferred}} this {{power to the}} censors. It also required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate. By this point, plebeians were already holding {{a significant number of}} magisterial offices. Thus, the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly. However, it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a well-known political family, as a new patrician-like plebeian aristocracy emerged. The old nobility existed through the force of <b>law,</b> <b>because</b> only patricians were allowed to stand for high office. The new nobility existed due to the organization of society. As such, only a revolution could overthrow this new structure.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{developed}} by the National Congress was implemented in July 1831. It guaranteed individual liberty, property rights, freedom of religion and the press, and equality before the <b>law.</b> <b>Because</b> of its perceived balance between freedom and rule of law, it was praised by liberals {{around the world and}} promoted as a model for future constitutions. Under the new constitution, Belgium had two chambers, a Chamber of Representatives and Senate, both elected by a small number of wealthy citizens. The King was allowed substantial power in military affairs, but was given little independent power in any other sphere, which was instead given to the elected chambers.|$|E

5|$|Under the new system, {{newly elected}} magistrates were awarded with {{automatic}} {{membership in the}} senate, although it remained difficult for a Plebeian from an unknown family to enter the senate. Several factors {{made it difficult for}} individuals from unknown families to be elected to high office, in particular the very presence of a long-standing nobility, as this appealed to the deeply rooted Roman respect for the past. Ultimately, a new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy emerged, which replaced the old Patrician nobility. It was the dominance of the long-standing Patrician nobility which ultimately forced the Plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. The new nobility, however, was fundamentally different from the old nobility. The old nobility existed through the force of <b>law,</b> <b>because</b> only Patricians were allowed to stand for high office, and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed. Now, however, the new nobility existed due to the organization of society, and as such, it could only be overthrown through a revolution.|$|E

25|$|The Forum of National Parties, an {{association}} of 12 moderate Islamist parties, said it rejected the proposed election <b>law</b> <b>because</b> it encouraged voting along tribal lines and gave undue influence to the wealthy.
