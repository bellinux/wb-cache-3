40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{research}} question; ‘how does environmentalism influence the <b>export</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>export</b> ventures exporting hardwood woodchips from Australia to Japan?’ The Australia-Japan hardwood woodchip export industry {{is used as}} the focus of the study because it is an interesting exemplar of the influence <b>of</b> environmentalism on <b>export</b> activity. It also facilitates the use of a number of research design features that enhance the contribution of the research to the development of new knowledge and, it is an economically and socially important industry to both Australia and Japan. Environmentalism is presented as a useful construct to consider the influence {{of a wide range of}} ‘environmental’ related issues across a broad spectrum of business activities. In this thesis, environmentalism is defined as ‘the social movement concerned with the pursuit (through political and social influence) of perceived improved preservation and/or conservation conditions of the natural state of selected environs and the inferred benefits to human welfare’. A two-stage approach is used to address the research question. The first stage involves the synthesis (from reviews of industry issues and related theory) of a conceptual framework <b>of</b> the <b>export</b> performance <b>of</b> Australian hardwood woodchip export ventures exporting to Japan. The second stage then uses this export performance framework to identify and discuss how environmentalism influences the <b>export</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>export</b> ventures. The research technique used is grounded theory. Data is collected from case studies <b>of</b> five <b>export</b> ventures that export hardwood woodchips from Australia to Japan (out of a total of nine such ventures in existence) and interviews with 18 industry participants who are senior managers <b>of</b> <b>export</b> ventures that export hardwood woodchips to Japan. Analysis of results reveals that assessments <b>of</b> venture level <b>export</b> performance vary between Australian-owned export ventures and Japanese-owned export ventures. Analysis also reveals that <b>export</b> ventures, regardless <b>of</b> ownership type, assess their export performance as a mix of financial and non-financial measures. The notion of ‘License to Operate’ is found to be the most prominent non-financial consideration. Analysis of results also reveals that the influence of environmentalism on the <b>export</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>export</b> ventures is particularly expressed via three features. Firstly, the preferences of Japanese buyers for hardwood woodchips sourced from plantations and/or forests certified as being sustainably managed. Secondly, the impact that changes to the forest resources available as wood supply to export ventures have made on the cost-competitiveness and <b>export</b> reliability <b>of</b> those <b>export</b> ventures. Thirdly, aspects <b>of</b> the <b>license</b> to operate <b>of</b> <b>export</b> ventures including the requirements of regulatory compliance and how environmentalism shapes stakeholder sentiment regarding the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>export</b> ventures and related forest management activities. The discussion highlights that the strategic outlook for Australian-owned export ventures is one characterised by their diminishing bargaining power. This diminishing bargaining power is a consequence of the likely oversupply situation in the Pacific Rim market and the transfer pricing strategies of the Japanese pulp and paper industry expressed. In this context, the transfer pricing strategies of the Japanese pulp and paper industry are expressed via their longer term supply policies and their investment in overseas hardwood plantations and woodchip export ventures. It follows that the search for feasible alternative markets is a critical strategic consideration for Australian-owned export ventures. Analysis reveals that environmentalism can act as an impediment to the realisation of some of these alternative markets (e. g. as opposition to a pulp mill development proposal) or as a catalyst in others (e. g. as support for the emergence of environmental markets such as carbon trading). It is also surmised that, in general terms, environmentalism has contributed to the enhancement of the sustainable governance <b>of</b> <b>export</b> ventures that export hardwood woodchips from Australia to Japan...|$|R

Moreover, we examine whether the quality standards–export activities relationship is firm size dependent. The findings indicate that while quality standards improve the logarithm <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> per employee and the logarithm <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> per employee destined for non-EU countries for all categories of firm size, they do not influence logarithm <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> per employee destined for EU countries among large and small firms.

40|$|Purpose- The issue <b>of</b> <b>export</b> {{success and}} the ability to sustain oneself in {{international}} horticultural markets have become more critical in the recent global and economic downturn because of its significance to the economy and to actors in the horticultural export chain. The extent of success is even much critical for enterprises. Therefore this study establishes the factors which influence the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success which measures the extent <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Design- Primary data were collected from 52 managers and representatives <b>of</b> horticultural <b>exporting</b> firms through a semi-structured questionnaire. The tobit model was used to estimate the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success by horticultural enterprises in Ghana. Findings- The result indicates that, manager’s educational level, managers past experience, manager trained in export management, manager’s entrepreneurial orientation, presence <b>of</b> <b>export</b> department, product diversification and government support directly influences the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Export barriers and constraints in accessing working capital negatively influences intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Practical implications- Personnel or personal development in terms <b>of</b> training in <b>export</b> management and build up of experience is important in the quest to improve the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Organizational reforms such as institution <b>of</b> <b>export</b> department and diversifying horticultural export products improves the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. To improve the intensity of success, external factors such as working capital inaccessibility and trade barriers should be addressed by various stake holders. In all government and institutional interventions has been proved to be of the essence. Originality/value- Although various determinants <b>of</b> <b>export</b> performance or success have been established by researchers the factors that influence the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success is not known.

Within export memory use, four export memory use dimensions have been discovered: instrumental, conceptual, legitimizing and manipulating. Results from the qualitative study based on the data from a mail survey with 354 responses reveal that the development <b>of</b> <b>export</b> memory quality is positively related with quality <b>of</b> <b>export</b> information acquisition, the quality <b>of</b> <b>export</b> information interpretation, export coordination, and integration of the information into the organizational system.

The two factors found to be significantly related to the extent <b>of</b> <b>export</b> memory use are acquisition <b>of</b> <b>export</b> information quality and export memory quality.
