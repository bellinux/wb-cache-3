50|$|A {{commercial}} barbecue typically has a <b>larger</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>capacity</b> {{than traditional}} household grills, {{as well as}} featuring a variety of accessories for added versatility. End users of commercial barbecue grills include for-profit operations such as restaurants, caterers, food vendors and grilling operations at food fairs, golf tournaments and other charity events, as well as competition cookers. The category lends itself to originality, and many commercial barbecue grills feature designs unique to their respective manufacturer.|$|R

40|$|Induction <b>cooking</b> <b>units</b> work by {{generating}} a radio frequency (RF) magnetic field for heating purposes. Concerns have been expressed {{from time to}} time about whether induction cookers may present a health hazard to humans. The first paper, “Analysis of Stray EM Fields Generated by Induction Cooktops”, authored by Marco Bullo, Fabrizio Dughiero and Elisabetta Sieni of Padova University, Italy, aims to evaluate possible biological effects to the human body due to an RF magnetic field emitted by the induction cooktop. The measurement results of several models of cooktops have shown that most of the induction cooktops do comply with the exposure limits given in the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) standard. The results have also shown that the emitted field is much lower if the pot is centered at the cooktop, as the pot bottom serves as a shield that blocks the magnetic field from the induction coil. For the users of induction <b>cooking</b> <b>units,</b> you will pick up some useful tips to minimize the exposure risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiment {{study was to determine}} the effect of canary shell liquid smoke on the chemical, physical and sensory qualities of beef stored at room temperature. Beef samples were dipped in liquid smoke solution with the concentration of 0, 4, 8, and 12 % (v/v) during 15 minutes and then stored for 0, 2, and 4 days at room temperature. Each treatment was carried out three times and the variables measured were water, phenol and acid content, pH, water-holding <b>capacity,</b> <b>cooking</b> loss and sensory properties of samples. Data on chemical and physical qualities were analyzed using analysis of variance (Completely Randomized Design/CRD) with factorial 4 x 3. The sensory properties were analyzed by a non parametric h-test. The results showed that liquid smoke concentration up to 12 % significantly (p< 0. 05) increased water holding <b>capacity</b> and <b>cooking</b> loss of samples. Storage time up to four days significantly (p< 0. 05) increased its pH value, cooking loss, whereas water-holding capacity was decreased. The meat sensory test showed that flavor and slimming rate were affected significantly (p< 0. 05) by liquid smoke. There was no interaction between liquid smoke concentration and storage time. In conclusion, the addition of liquid smoke up to 12 % increased phenol and acid content, while the physical quality of meat has decreased. Quality of beef stored up to 4 days showed a decreased of quality such as pH, water-holding <b>capacity,</b> <b>cooking</b> loss, and sensory meat.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{slaughter}} weight on muscle dimensions and muscle quality traits i. e. colour, pH, water holding <b>capacity</b> <b>cooking</b> loss from Western Sudan bulls were studied. The largest muscle identified was the M. Biceps femoris, while M. Biceps brachii was the smallest in size. Muscles pH increased (P> 0. 05) as slaughter weight increased. The M. Semitendnosus was the lightest (P< 0. 05) {{in terms of}} muscle colour whereas the M. Supraspinatus, M. Semimembranosus and M. Adductor were the darkest (P< 0. 05). Water holding <b>capacity</b> and <b>cooking</b> loss improved (P< 0. 001) progressively as slaughter weight increased from 200 kg to 400 kg in all muscles. The M. Psoas major {{was found to have}} the best water holding capacity ratio (1. 48) and the lowest (32. 72 %) cooking loss whereas the M. Biceps brachii was found to have the highest (41. 66 %) cooking loss. The implication of animal husbandry practices and live weight changes on meat quality attributes and consequent consume...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{materials were}} 75 broiler chickens of 1 day old and feeds. The research employed five treatments, namely (P 0 : feed without addition of fermented shrimp meal, P 1 : feed with 5 % addition of fermented shrimp meal, P 2 : feed with 7. 5 % addition of fermented shrimp meal, P 3 : feed with 10 % addition of fermented shrimp meal, P 4 : feed with 12. 5 % addition of fermented shrimp meal. Every treatment was repeated 3 times, with 5 chickens respectively. Variables {{of this research}} were Water Holding <b>Capacity</b> (WHC), <b>cooking</b> loss and tenderness of broiler meat. Data were analyzed by completely randomized design, {{if there was a}} significant effect, it was followed by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The result of this research showed that the use of fermented shrimp meal in broiler feed can improve WHC, degrading cooking loss and improving tenderness of broiler meat.   Keywords : Water holding <b>capacity,</b> <b>cooking</b> loss, tendernes...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{smoke is}} one of the feed {{additive}} that can be given to animals. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the influence of liquid smoke given through drinking water on meat quality and production of fecal ammonia in broiler. Variables observed were meat pH, water holding <b>capacity,</b> <b>cooking</b> loss, the tensile strength of meat, cut off strength of meat, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations, and fecal ammonia. The experiment was assigned in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments, and 4 equal replicates. The treatments tested were symbolized as R 0, R 1, R 2, R 3, and R 4, based on the level of liquid smoke added into drinking water (v/v) namely, 0 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, 0. 75 %, and 1. 00 %, respectively. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, and continued to Duncan’s multiple range test to determine the difference between treatment mean values at 5 % probability. The results indicated that addition of liquid smoke up to 1 % did not affect the meat pH, water holding <b>capacity,</b> <b>cooking</b> loss, the tensile strength of meat, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine content, but it decreased the cut off strength of meat and fecal ammonia. It was concluded that an optimal dose of granting liquid smoke through drinking water was 1 %...|$|R
