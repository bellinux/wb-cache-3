40|$|In {{structural}} engineering, the {{damping device}} {{is the best}} way to equip the structure for resisting earthquakes. The newly developed displacement dependent semi-active hydraulic damper (DSHD) is a kind of hydraulic damper to reduce the structural response. The DSHD is a fixture connecting the brace and the structure. At a seismic loading, the DSHD is functioned to dissipate the energy at the transition of bracing from the tensile constraint to the compressive constraint or in reverse. When a structure suffers a large seismic excitation, the overflow function is triggered to prevent the failure of a bracing member. That is, at the stress in the <b>linked</b> <b>brace</b> reaching a certain value, it will start the opening of the overflow valve maintaining an aptotic pressure for confining the bracing deformation within the design value. This DSHD provides availability for resisting excessive vibration in the structural design. In this paper, the analysis modeling is set up for simulating the nonlinear behavior of DSHD. The performance of DSHD is investigated in the nonlinear analysis for seismic evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of combined earthquake and dead load on a simulated lateral load resistance building systems. An eight-floor level steel building was modelled in SAP 2000, and analysed using seismic information obtained from an earthquake which occurred at Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria. The study {{was based on a}} selected magnitude of earthquake by considering the highest magnitude ever experienced in Nigeria which was within 4 – 4. 9 (light earthquake category). The building was analysed under bracing and shear wall systems, and it was checked for a maximum deflection and inter-storey drift not exceeding 500 mm and 2 % respectively. From the analysis conducted, it was inferred that eccentric bracings are better than concentric bracings in dissipating energy under seismic conditions, short link eccentric bracings provide more stiffness than long link eccentric bracings hence in order to quickly achieve the requirements of a maximum deflection of 500 mm or below and a maximum inter-storey drift of two per cent or below, short links bracings were used which require lesser number of elements compared to long <b>link</b> <b>bracing</b> thus leading to a more economical solution...|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} was deep, {{giving the}} J 15 a tubby look, {{with the two}} passengers in a windowed internal cabin above the wing. The pilot sat well behind them and clear of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, in an open cockpit. The tailplane was mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage and a small triangular fin carried a rudder that extended down to the bottom of the fuselage, moving in a cut-out between the elevators. The J 15 was powered by a 158 hp (118 kW) upright inline Mercedes D.IIIa engine driving a four-blade propeller. The fixed main undercarriage had a pair of main wheels each mounted on V-legs splayed out from the fuselage bottom and interconnected by <b>linked</b> axles <b>braced</b> by a pair of centre line struts.|$|R

For <b>links</b> in {{eccentrically}} <b>braced</b> frames (EBFs), today’s {{design codes}} {{requirement of the}} flange width-thickness ratio is strict on high-strength steels, which eliminate a number of rolled wide-flange shape from use in EBFs.

This paper applies unidirectional load and cyclic load on the finite element models respectively. Through the calculation of the inelastic rotation which the link beams reach after the relaxation of the flange width-thickness ratio, the paper analyses the influences {{on the performance of}} the three tapes of links by the flange width-thickness ratio...|$|R
40|$|In the {{structural}} engineering, the damping device {{is the most}} consideration to equip the structure for resisting earthquake. A hydraulic damper {{is a kind of}} energy-dissipating device to reduce {{the structural}} response in earthquake engineering. Newly developed Displacement Dependent Semi-Active Hydraulic Damper (DSHD) is one of hydraulic dampers. The DSHD is a fixture connecting the brace and the structure. For this damper, the hydraulic cylinder is acting as a damper connector. This damper connector, which links a resistance component with a structure, is like a flexible switch with tight-loose and close-open functions. At a seismic loading, the DSHD is functioned to dissipate the energy at the transition of bracing from the tensile constraint to compressive constraint or in reverse. When a structure suffers a large seismic excitation, the overflow function is triggered to prevent the failure of bracing member. That is, at the stress in the <b>linked</b> <b>brace</b> reaching a certain value, it will start the opening of the overflow valve maintaining an aptotic pressure for confining the bracing deformation within the design value. This DSHD provides availability for resisting excessive vibration in the structural design. In this paper, the analysis modeling is set up for simulating the nonlinear behavior of DSHD. The performance of DSHD is investigated in the nonlinear analysis for seismic evaluation. For a DSHD-added structure, to linearize the nonlinear behavior of DSHD is required for structural design. Using damping ratio as a parameter, the DSHD is modeled as a fixture of linear spring and linear viscous damper. This approach is valid for the application in the engineering practice. 在結構振動控制的領域，於結構物上安裝能量消散器為目前提升結構耐震能力的策略之一。藉由能量消散器所提供之遲滯廻圈以吸收地震力輸入結構的能量，使結構物不產生破壞。本研究針對半主動位移相依阻尼器(Displacement Semi-active Hydraulic Damper, DSHD) 建立該元件之非線性模型與等值線性模型，並探討該元件於建築結構上之設計流程，進而討論其與摩擦型阻尼器之比較。 本文探討主題大至可分為緒論、半主動位移相依阻尼器DSHD之元件與消能行為、DSHD應用於結構之有效性、DSHD等值線性化之分析、DSHD與摩擦型阻尼器之比較、結論共六個章節。本研究中探討目前常見之半主動阻尼器其阻尼機制並與半主動位移相依阻尼器之不同。由於DSHD主要是由油壓缸與方向控制閥組成，藉由油路之變換改變其對結構物作用力，本文利用等值阻尼比的概念，探討DSHD的參數設計與其適用性，討論中包括DSHD時間延遲量對其消能效益的影響。經由數值分析探討，可以發現DSHD在結構週期與地盤主控週期相接近時其消能效益為最佳，並由分析中可知DSHD能夠降低高模態的貢獻量，對位移反應有良好的控制效果。由於DSHD的消能效應取決加勁元件的勁度與溢流力的設定，在高勁度與高強度的加勁元件下，DSHD所提供的阻尼力有良好的調適性。由於DSHD所提供的阻尼力隨振振增加而產生調適性，經由其與摩擦型阻尼的比較後，可知DSHD的消能效應優於摩擦型阻尼器，並在結構與地盤共振的情況下，安裝DSHD之結構位移反應呈現收斂的行為。Chapter 1 Introduction	 1 Chapter 2 Energy reduction of DSHD	 6 2. 1 Energy-dissipating behavior of DSHD	 6 2. 2 Fixtures of DSHD	 7 Chapter 3 Validity of the DSHD used in a structure	 10 3. 1 Non-overflow state 	 11 3. 2 Overflow state	 14 3. 3 Validity of DSHD	 17 Chapter 4 A linearization model for DSHD	 29 4. 1 Linearization model for non-overflow state	 31 4. 2 Linearization model for overflow state	 33 4. 3 Equivalent damping ratio	 35 4. 4 Design of overflow force	 37 4. 5 Numerical Simulation 	 38 4. 6 Effect of Time delays	 40 Chapter 5 DSHD versus friction Damper	 56 5. 1 Free Vibration	 59 5. 2 Displacement response factor	 63 5. 3 Comparison of energy reduction	 67 Chapter 6 Concluding remarks	 79 References	 81 Appendix	 8...|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of social}} capital (SC hereinafter) on {{household}} welfare (rice yield, income, health) were examined in rice granary area of south peninsula Malaysia. SC is categorized into eight types by its form (structural and cognitive) and function (birding, <b>linking,</b> and <b>bracing).</b> OLS is used for estimation on randomly selected 60 household data. As for self-rated health status, those attending more community activity (bonding structural SC) appear less healthy, seemingly that old farmers normally {{have more time to}} spend on community activities and they are more loyal to their organization. Those who highly evaluate bureaucratic organization (linking cognitive SC) are relatively healthier. Frequency of attending community activities (bonding structural SC) and duration of involvement in organization (birding structural SC)) contribute to higher rice yield. Farmers who have wider and longer relationships with organizations seem to perform better farming. Wile official status in formal organization (linking structural SC) and involvement in bureaucratic organization (bracing structural SC) cause a decline in ric e productivity. The finding of bonding/bridging structural social capital has positive effect on productivity suggests that to further improve farming performance, more spontaneous and horizontal farmer-to-farmer connections became increasingly important. At the same time, to alleviate poverty, bracing structural social capital which strengthens both vertical and horizontal human network appears important. The efficacy of networking is also reflected by the positive sign of cognitive linking social capital for income and health. Institutional and Behavioral Economics, I 3, O 13, Q 12, Z 13,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} testing of a proof-of-concept eccentrically braced frame specimen that utilizes a hybrid rectangular shear link that is not laterally braced. Equations used for design are given and references for their derivations are provided. The quasi-static cyclic proof-of-concept testing is described and results are reported. Stable and full hysteretic loops were obtained and no signs of flange, web, or lateral torsional buckling were observed. The link was subjected to 0. 15 radians of rotation in the final cycle, which is almost twice the maximum rotation allowed in building codes for links with I-shaped cross-sections. Although the final failure mode was fracture of the bottom link flange, the large rotations achieved were well above what would be required in a seismic event, indicating that hybrid rectangular <b>links</b> without lateral <b>bracing</b> of the <b>link</b> can indeed be a viable alternative for applications in steel bridge piers in seismic regions...|$|R
50|$|The {{footings}} are of mortared flint {{and stone}} rising to 1.2 m {{at the northern}} end of the barn. They may originally have been lime rendered internally. The heart of the structure is a series of rectangular frames (arcade posts and collar beams) rising approximately 5 m above the dwarf walls. The frames are transversely <b>braced.</b> <b>Linking</b> the tops of the frames longitudinally is the arcade plate which is jointed and braced to each upright. 2 m outside the arcade are the aisle posts (2m high) supporting an aisle tie to the main arcade posts. The aisle posts are linked by the eaves plate, though not braced to it. Resting on and braced to the collar beams are crown posts supporting a collar plate. The rafters are supported by the eaves plates, arcade plates and collar plates forming a single unbroken slope. To complete the exterior of the building, weatherboards run from under the eaves vertically down to the ground plates. The weatherboards are thought to be a rare survival of the original boards. A dendrochronological of one board gave 1357, but this was not the outermost ring of the tree.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the development, {{calibration}} and experimental validation of a component-based {{model of a}} dissipative steel link connecting a reinforced concrete wall and a steel gravity frame is presented. The structural configuration of the system studied is extrapolated by an innovative hybrid structure proposed within the European RFCS project INNO-HYCO (INNOvative HYbrid and COmposite steel-concrete structural solutions for building in seismic area). The system studied is the hybrid coupled shear wall (HCSW), obtained coupling a reinforced concrete wall with two side steel columns by means of steel links where the energy dissipation takes place. Such dissipative elements are intended to behave similarly to <b>links</b> of eccentric <b>braces</b> while the connection with the reinforced concrete wall has to be suitably designed {{in order to make}} the links replaceable. Obviously, the dissipative capacity of such structures is greatly influenced by the effective hysteretic behaviour of the link and of the link-to-wall and link-to-steel frame connections. For this reason, an experimental research programme on HCSW system sub-assemblages containing the dissipative element and the aforementioned connections has been carried out. Two different types of link-to-wall connection systems have been tested in order to highlight their influence on the global dissipative capacity. A non-linear cyclic component-based model of the entire sub-assemblage is then developed and, on the basis of experimental results, calibrated, enabling in this way a better understanding of the force transmission mechanisms...|$|R
