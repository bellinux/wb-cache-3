R-bar approach allows natural forces to brake the orbiters approach more than would occur along standard approach {{directly in front of}} the space station; also, an R-bar approach minimizes the number of orbiter jet firings needed for approach. The manual phase of the docking began with Atlantis about a half-mile (800 m) below Mir, with Gibson at the controls on aft flight deck. Stationkeeping was performed when the orbiter was about 75 m from Mir, pending approval from Russian and U.S. flight directors to proceed. Gibson then maneuvered the orbiter to a point about 10 m from Mir before beginning the final approach to station. Closing rate was close to the targeted 0.1 foot per second (30 mm/s), being approximately 0.107 foot per second (33 mm/s) at contact. Interface contact was nearly flawless: less than 25 mm <b>lateral</b> <b>misalignment</b> and an angular misalignment of less than 0.5 degrees per axis. Docking occurred about 216 nautical miles (400 km) above Lake Baikal region of the Russian Federation.

This application includes 10 - 20 meter links and requires minimum size, weight, and power (SWaP). The optical power must not present an eye hazard and must be easily integrated into the existing ISS infrastructure.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} photonic {{integration of}} microring resonators {{in three dimensions}} made possible by recent developments in vertical coupling and wafer bonding technology is shown {{to be sensitive to}} lateral mask misalignment for the ring and bus waveguides introduced during the fabrication process. For a typical 20 -µm radius, vertically coupled microring calculations reveal a linear relationship between deviation in the coupling coefficient and <b>lateral</b> <b>misalignment.</b> A coupling coefficient reduction of 50 % is predicted for a <b>lateral</b> <b>misalignment</b> of 0. 3 µm, which is typical for an alignment accuracy limited by the current state-of-the-art mask alignment process. The use of a wide multimode bus waveguide is proposed to ameliorate this alignment sensitivity. The mode-expanded bus waveguide, together with its physically wider structure, reduces the dependence of modal overlap and coupling length on precise alignment, resulting in significantly relaxed fabrication tolerance. Deviation of coupling coefficient decreases by an order of magnitude for the new ring coupler geometry, where a sole reduction of 5 % is obtained for the same amount of misalignment. The implications of the proposed structure are subsequently investigated for microring laser performance. The differential slope efficiency is shown to be at least five times less sensitive to <b>lateral</b> <b>misalignment</b> for the proposed structure within a small misalignment regime.

Maintaining alignment accuracy between the lens array and the collecting fibers is addressed by using a collimator array, thereby fixing each fiber to one lens, or specially constructed fiber array structures in a dedicated housing. A collimator array is preferable for ease of construction but presents trade-offs with respect to power collected and misalignment tolerance.

40|$|In the {{mathematical}} modelling of gear vibrations {{it is found}} that there is a gap between the transient models developed in academia and the steady state models frequently used in industry. It is seen that the academic models are adept at modelling the nonlinear phenomena seen during gear contact for system with only a few degrees-of-freedom, whereas the industrial models are capable of solving the linear steady state response of more complex transmission systems. The work presented in this thesis attempts {{to bridge the gap between}} the two models, through the development of a transient nonlinear model of a gear pair with increased degrees-of-freedom. An understanding of the gear contact is achieved through the use of advanced static finite element analysis with nonlinear gear contact. Through FEA the effects of gear misalignment on these contact conditions is also investigated. The findings from the FEA are then used in a mathematical model of a single stage spur gear transmission, which is developed as part of the thesis, to determine the system accelerations. The mathematical model includes the time varying mesh stiffness and the time varying and nonlinear bearing stiffness's and frictional forces. The effects of <b>lateral</b> <b>misalignment</b> seen in the FEA results are also included into the model to investigate their effects.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of multimode polymer waveguide technology for use in board-level communication links for future data centres and supercomputers. The motivation for this work comes from the severe interconnection bandwidth challenges faced by the conventional electrical interconnections technology and the potential performance advantages of optical interconnections. This thesis presents the work to address the bandwidth bottleneck by developing high-bandwidth multimode polymer waveguides. The use of multimode waveguides provides relaxed alignment tolerances enabling low-cost assembly tools. Siloxane polymer materials developed by Dow Corning Corporation are chosen to form the waveguides in this work due to their favourable optical properties (optical losses as low as 0. 03 dB/cm {{and the ability to}} withstand temperatures in excess of 350 °C) that allow the waveguides to be directly integrated on printed circuits boards (PCBs) using conventional manufacturing processes. Useful design rules {{for the use of the}} multimode polymer waveguides are theoretically derived while the bandwidth-length products are investigated under various launch conditions. Frequency-domain measurements and ultra-short pulse measurements are then carried out to investigate the bandwidth performance of the polymer waveguides under different launch conditions and with <b>lateral</b> <b>misalignments.</b> The instrument-limited frequency-domain measurements show that these waveguides exhibit bandwidth-length products (BLPs) of at least 35 GHz×m, while the pulse broadening measurements reveal the actual BLPs to be in excess of 70 GHz×m under a 50 μm multimode-fibre (MMF) launch and 100 GHz×m for a restricted launch across a wide range of input offsets (>± 10 μm). This shows the potential for data transmission rates of 100 Gb/s and beyond over a single waveguide channel. A theoretical model is developed using the measured refractive index profile and good agreement with the above experimental results is found. The effects of graded refractive index profiles on the performance of waveguide components (bends, crossings) are also investigated, demonstrating that appropriate refractive index engineering can provide enhanced waveguide loss performance while exhibiting adequate bandwidth. Waveguide bends with excess loss below 1 dB for a radius > 6 mm, crossings with loss less than 0. 02 dB/crossing while exhibiting adequate link bandwidth (> 47 GHz×m) can be achieved for a MMF launch. On this basis, advanced modulation formats are investigated across the board-level waveguide links for further increasing the on-board data rates.

40|$|Solder {{self-aligning}} {{technology is}} important to the manufacturing of cost-effective optoelectronic modules requiring accurate alignments. This thesis is to understand major effects on self-alignment accuracies in order to establish a model to guide the design for precision solder self-alignments. A solder self-alignment model based on force optimization with six degrees of freedom in a static configuration has been developed to predict an alignment accuracy with respect to different manufacturing parameters and variations. The model was used to design a VCSEL (vertical cavity surface emitting laser) array soldered on a substrate. It was proven to be a powerful tool for the design of optoelectronic modules. For example, when using Ø 80 µm solder spheres with 2 µm diameter variation to attach a VCSEL chip (3200 µm × 500 µm × 650 µm) on a substrate, the model shows that the chip 2 ̆ 7 s standoff height variation could be reduced from 5. 6 to 2. 0 µm by adding extra alignment pads. Solder insufficient wetting on the bonding pads was identified to be the most undesirable factor affecting self-alignment accuracy. It could result in a planar misalignment from several to tens of µms depending on wetting quality and design parameters. Solder void was another undesirable factor that could increase the average standoff height of the assembled unit by 4 to 10 µms in the cases studied. Other factors, e. g. manufacturing variations in pad position and diameter, chip/substrate warpage, small tilt of the reflow stage, could only account for less than ± 1 µm misalignments. The accuracy of the solder self-alignment model was verified by experimental characterizations using 3 mm × 3 mm glass-on-silicon flip-chip test vehicles comprising 25 solder joints. In addition to static cases, solder self-alignments in a dynamic condition was studied. The vibration of the substrate near the resonant frequencies could cause large chip-to-substrate misalignments. The resonant motion could be 2 ̆ 2 frozen in 2 ̆ 2 during the solidification of the reflow process and resulted in large misalignments. For a 25 mm × 25 mm ball grid array test vehicle reflowed under a horizontal vibration at 12 Hz and less than 2 µm amplitude, the chip-to-substrate <b>lateral</b> <b>misalignments</b> could reach beyond 100 µm due to the resonance effect.
