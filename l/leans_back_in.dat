500|$|The {{standing}} {{image is}} the focus of much discussion among historians and archaeologists, since there is a general belief {{that it is not a}} statue of the Buddha. The image is [...] tall, and stands on a low pedestal shaped like a lotus. It <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a relaxed manner, its arms folded across its chest. [...] The statue's face carries a sorrowful expression and the reclining image—which depicts the Buddha's parinirvana—lies next to it, which has led some to believe that it is the monk Ānanda, who is lamenting the Buddha's demise at his deathbed. [...] The remains of the walls, however, indicate that the two images were once in separate chambers, rather than next to each other. Paranavithana believes that the statue is of the Buddha, which depicts the para dukkha dukkhitha mudra or [...] "sorrow for the sorrow of others". However, this is a rarely used gesture in Sinhalese sculpture, and is seen at only a few locations in the country. Another possibility is that the image shows the Buddha during his second week after enlightenment, which he spent gazing at the Bodhi Tree in gratitude for providing him shelter. The image is not mentioned in the Chulavamsa, which only mentions the other three. While this may be an indication that it is not an image of the Buddha, it is also possible that it may have been made at an earlier period than the others.|$|E

6000|$|As an [...] "Adoration of the Magi," [...] {{the picture}} is, of course, {{sufficiently}} [...] absurd: the St. Sebastian <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{the corner to}} be out of the [...] way; the three Magi kneel, without the slightest appearance of [...] emotion, to a Madonna seated in a Venetian loggia of the fifteenth [...] century, and three Venetian servants behind bear their offerings in a [...] very homely sack, tied up at the mouth. As a piece of portraiture and [...] artistical composition, the work is altogether perfect, perhaps the [...] best piece of Tintoret's portrait-painting in existence. It is very [...] carefully and steadily wrought, and arranged with consummate skill on [...] a difficult plan. The canvas is a long oblong, I think about eighteen [...] or twenty feet long, by about seven high; one might almost fancy the [...] painter had been puzzled to bring the piece into use, the figures [...] being all thrown into positions which a little diminish their height. [...] The nearest chamberlain is kneeling, the two behind him bowing [...] themselves slightly, the attendants behind bowing lower, the Madonna [...] sitting, the St. Theodore sitting still lower on the steps at her [...] feet, and the St. Sebastian leaning back, so that all the lines of the [...] picture incline more or less from right to left as they ascend. This [...] slope, which gives unity to the detached groups, is carefully [...] exhibited by what a mathematician would call coordinates,--the upright [...] pillars of the loggia and the horizontal clouds of the beautiful sky. [...] The color is very quiet, but rich and deep, the local tones being [...] brought out with intense force, and the cast shadows subdued, the [...] manner being much more that of Titian than of Tintoret. The sky [...] appears full of light, though it is as dark as the flesh of the faces; [...] and the forms of its floating clouds, as well as of the hills over [...] which they rise, are drawn with a deep remembrance of reality. There [...] are hundreds of pictures of Tintoret's more amazing than this, but I [...] hardly know one that I more love.|$|E

After a drink called [...] "Load" [...] is advertised by Ulrich and Hetfield in matching suits, a game show called [...] "Hero of the Day" [...] (which is a parody of Jeopardy!) is seen being played of which Jason Newsted is the host.
