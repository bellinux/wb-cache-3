The proposed adaptive relay, automatically adjusts its operation based on the acquisition of the data from distance relay of adjacent line and status of adjacent line from <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> IED (Intelligent Electronic Device). The zero sequence current of the adjacent parallel transmission line is used to compute zero sequence current ratio and the mutual coupling effect is fully compensated. The relay adapts to changing circumstances, like failure in communication from other relays and non- availability of adjacent transmission line. The performance of the proposed adaptive relay is tested using steady state and dynamic test procedures. The fault transients are obtained by simulating a realistic parallel transmission line system with mutual coupling effect in PSCAD. The evaluation test results show the efficacy of adaptive distance relay over the conventional distance relay.

While PLC technology {{has the potential}} to improve connectivity and is considered a key enabler for sensing, control, and automation applications in enterprises, it has been mainly deployed for improving connectivity in homes. Deploying PLCs in enterprises is more challenging since the power distribution network is more complex as compared to homes.

40|$|The {{onset of}} a {{ferroresonance}} phenomenon in power systems is commonly {{caused by the}} reconfiguration of a circuit into the one consisting of capacitances in series and interacting with transformers. The reconfiguration can be due to switching operations of de-energisation or the occurrence of a fault. Sustained ferroresonance without immediate mitigation measures can cause the transformers {{to stay in a}} state of saturation leading to excessive flux migrating to transformer tanks via internal accessories. The symptom of such an event can be unwanted humming noises being generated but the real threatening implication is the possible overheating which can result in premature ageing and failures. The main objective of this thesis is to determine the accurate models for transformers, transmission <b>lines,</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and cables under transient studies, particularly for ferroresonance. The modeling accuracy is validated on a particular 400 / 275 kV transmission system by comparing the field test recorded voltage and current waveforms with the simulation results obtained using the models. In addition, a second case study involving another 400 / 275 kV transmission system with two transformers is performed to investigate the likelihood of the occurrence of sustained fundamental frequency ferroresonance mode and a possible quenching mechanism using the 13 kV tertiary connected reactor. A sensitivity study on transmission line lengths was also carriedout to determine the probability function of occurrence of various ferroresonance modes. To reproduce the sustained fundamental and the subharmonic ferroresonance modes, the simulation studies revealed that three main power system components which are involved in ferroresonance, i. e. the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> the transmission <b>line</b> and the transformer, can be modeled using time-controlled switch, the PI, Bergeron or Marti line model, and the BCTRAN+ or HYBRID transformer model. Any combination of the above component models can be employed to accurately simulate the ferroresonance system circuit. Simulation studies also revealed that the key circuit parameter to initiate transformer ferroresonance in a transmission system is the circuit-to-circuit capacitance of a double-circuit overhead line. The extensive simulation studies also suggested that the ferroresonance phenomena are far more complex and sensitive to the minor changes of system parameters and <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> operations. Adding with the non-linearity of transformer core characteristics, repeatability is not always guaranteed for simulation and experimental studies.

40|$|Power {{systems are}} {{interconnected}} for enhancing {{the availability of}} power supply to the customers and for reducing the prices charged to them. A natural consequence of the interconnections is that the interconnected power systems are likely to swing following faults and other disturbing events. The systems {{should be allowed to}} settle down to a stable state if one exists but should be disconnected from each other if the swing is likely to result in dynamic instability. For maintaining generation-load balance, it becomes necessary to shed load in some cases and shed generation in other cases. During power-system swings, currents and voltages swing in amplitude and phase. The impedances seen by distance relays, which calculate the impedances from the measured voltages and currents, also swing in magnitude and phase. At certain locations in the power system, the impedances calculated from the voltages and currents become so small that they enter the protection zones of distance relays. Power swing relays are traditionally used to block distance relays from tripping <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> if the swing is not likely to cause dynamic instability but open the interconnecting lines if the systems are likely to become unstable.

The DC breaker main components are Insulated bipolar gate transistors (IGBT) and metal oxide varistors (MOV). Under normal operation the IGBTs are placed in series with the DCline. The current commutates the current into a parallelMOV if current interruption is demanded. The MOV provides subsequently a counter voltage and forces the current to zero. A test model was assembled initially and corresponding simplified PSCAD simulation model was developed in order to gain a deeply understanding of the operation of a DC breaker and facilitate the selection of components and the design of the DC breaker for the SINTEF/NTNU laboratory. The selection of components for the DC breaker was based on the results from the experimental activities. In addition, corresponding ratings were obtained in an adjusted PSCAD model, which included an electro thermal equivalent circuit for temperature calculations.
