40|$|The {{effects of}} blade {{discharge}} angle {{on the performance}} of a standard industrial centrifugal oil pump of type 65 Y 60 &# 13; were investigated experimentally as the pump handled both water and viscous oil. A one-dimensional hydraulic loss&# 13; model was established to identify such effects mathematically. The effects have been estimated analytically by using&# 13; the model at various viscosities. The results showed that the blade discharge angle has significant but equal influence&# 13; on the head, shaft power and efficiency of the centrifugal oil pump at various viscosity conditions. For any viscosity,&# 13; <b>the</b> total hydraulic <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> impeller and volute rises with increasing blade exit angle. <b>The</b> diffusion <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> and&# 13; behind the impellers as well as <b>the</b> friction <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> volute are noticed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pump, especially for highly viscous&# 13; liquids. <b>The</b> hydraulic <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> impellers is about 0. 8 - 0. 6 times <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> volute. <b>In</b> order to improve the pump&# 13; performance, <b>the</b> hydraulic <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> volute must be kept as small as possible...|$|R

Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Various {{tools are}} {{available}} in market to measure packet <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end-to-end networks. But all the existing tools {{are not able to}} calculate packet <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network accurately. So measuring packet loss efficiently is still an open problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> networks due to relatively occurrence and short duration of packet loss. The aim of our research is to understand how to efficiently calculate packet <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network. <b>In</b> this paper we presented an algorithm for measuring packet <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we simulate <b>the</b> algorithm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NS 2 simulator. Our experimental results shows the trade-offs between impact on the network and measurement accuracy. We show that measuring packet loss is more efficient in our proposed algorithm than traditional loss measurement tools...|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} {{definitions}} of clinical malnutrition.

5|$|Despite this, and at Godley's urging, {{a further}} attack was planned for 12 October, this time using the New Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division. By now {{the ground was}} a sea of mud {{and a lack of}} {{preparation}} on the part of Godley's corps headquarters hampered the preliminary movements of the attacking divisions and supporting artillery. Godley's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month in better weather and ground conditions and with more time to prepare. The operation on 12 October proved to be a failure with limited gains and heavy <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attacking divisions. After the battle, Godley downplayed the <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Division (which amounted to around 2,900 casualties) and overstated the gains made in official correspondence to Allen, and a friend, Clive Wigram, who was the assistant private secretary to King George V.|$|E
