40|$|Partial Feed {{simulating}} {{moving bed}} (SMB) {{has proved to}} be more efficient in binary separation performance (purity, recovery, productivity) because of its two additional degrees of freedom, namely <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> and <b>feed</b> time, as compared to classical SMB process. The binary separation of dextran T 6 and fructose with linear isotherm is modeled with Aspen Chromatography simulator in a four zone SMB with one column per zone for both normal-feed and Partial Feed. Increase in number of <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> and <b>feed</b> time in the cycle plays a very important role in the separation performance with Partial Feed. In addition, the effect of mode of operation (early or late introduction of increase in number of <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> in the cycle) on product purity and recovery is also investigated. Furthermore, the binary separation system is designed with the safety margin method and the optimum operating parameters for simulation are calculated with triangle theory.

40|$|Food-limitation in late larval {{and early}} post-larval plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, {{may be an}} {{important}} factor in the determination of year class strength. In this study data on stomach content, hepato-somatic index and condition index of metamorphosing and early post-larval plaice from a sandy beach in the mouth of the Western Schelde are compared to data from the Zwin lagoon. Settlement in the area starts at the end of february. All plaice examined from the sandy beach were fasting. Their condition, as measured by hepato-somatic index and condition index, did not differ significantly from the condition of feeding post-larvae from the lagoon.

40|$|First paragraph: As any {{fish farmer}} knows, feed {{is usually the}} most {{important}} variable production cost.  A simple objective is therefore to minimize waste from uneaten food, which has {{the added benefit of}} reducing the risk of environmental degradation. However, decreasing feed level risks reducing growth rate, leadìng to a rise in other costs per unit of production. The optimum biological feeding rate is thus rarely the same as the optimum economic rate. In practice, these calculations are complicated as feed requirement and efficiency of conversion varies with changing environmental conditions including water temperature, oxygen concentration, water quality, current speed, light intensity and day <b>length.</b> <b>Feed</b> utilisation also varies with diet quality and physiological factors such as age/size, life-stage, stress level and endogenous rhythms. lt is therefore not surprising that these factors contrìbute towards an element of uncertaìnty regarding the amount of feed required, often leading to under or over feeding of stock and resultant under performance of the system...|$|E

The stock of streaked seer, however is much less than that of either of the other two species in the study areas. Feeding is active around 7 p. m. and between about 5 and 9 a. m. Competition between fish -Z 800 mm length and fish > 800 mm length was obvious in 19869 when there was a shortfall in forage abundance. Food intake and utilisation do not show definite evidence of the prevalence of spawning stress.

40|$|Radial gas holdup {{profiles}} {{were determined}} in 50 cm and 91 cm dia. flotation columns. The local gas holdup {{was measured using}} an electrical conductivity technique, which is described in detail. The effect of gas rate and axial location on the profiles was investigated. The relative variation in gas holdup was about 20 %. The profiles were axially symmetric but of complex shape: parabolic, saddle and 'W' shapes were observed. For {{the case of a}} parabolic profile, the shear stress model was solved to give liquid circulation velocity profiles; no solution was found for the other gas holdup profile shapes. Measurement of radial gas holdup profiles may prove useful in evaluating sparger systems. For example, in the pilot column, one off-centre sparger gave a non-symmetrical shape but nevertheless did distribute the gas relatively evenly. Liquid residence time distributions (RTD) were measured for various operating and design conditions using the pulse tracer technique. Application of the one-dimensional plug flow axial dispersion model {{and the use of the}} vessel dispersion number $N sb{ rm d}$ to quantify the degree of mixing was evaluated. A numerical solution to the axial dispersion model with closed-closed boundary conditions using the finite difference method is recommended for column RTD studies.

The effect of gas rate, liquid rate, column <b>length,</b> <b>feed</b> percent solids and column verticality on $N sb{ rm d}$ was studied.

Birds were withdrawn from feed 0, 3, 9, 12, 14, 16, or 18 h before slaughter. Crop and gizzard contents were determined after dissection, and intestinal shape and villi were subjectively scored. Raw liver color was measured colorimetrically. <b>Length</b> of <b>feed</b> withdrawal (time) and its interaction with grower (time by grower) and replication (time by replication) had a significant effect (P < 0. 05) on gizzard contents, intestinal shape, and villi; however, time by grower and time by replication did not affect the crop contents or the incidence of bile contamination in the digestive tract. Results also suggested that the integrity of the intestines declined after 12 to 14 h feed withdrawal, as indicated by heavy intestinal sloughing. Color analyses of livers showed that <b>length</b> of <b>feed</b> withdrawal did not affect lightness (L * values), but livers became less red (lower positive a*) as feed withdrawal time increased.
