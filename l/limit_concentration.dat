Rate constants of hydrolysis of the P-N bond in guanosine 5 '-monophosphate 2 -methylimidazolide (2 -MeImpG) and in guanosine 5 '-monophosphate imidazolide (ImpG), kh, have been determined in the presence/absence of magnesium ion as a function of temperature and polycytidylate [poly(C) ] concentration. Using the rate constant of hydrolysis of 2 -MeImpG and the rate constant of elongation, i. e., the reaction of an oligoguanylate with 2 -MeImpG in the presence of poly(C) acting as template, the <b>limiting</b> <b>concentration</b> of 2 -MeImpG necessary for oligonucleotide elongation to compete with hydrolysis can be calculated. The <b>limiting</b> <b>concentration</b> is defined as the initial concentration of monomer that results in its equal consumption by hydrolysis and by elongation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ten {{brands of}} spent {{portable}} rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones (lithium-ion and nickel metal hydride) were collected and disassembled and the battery electrode and {{printed wiring board}} prepared using the EPA Method 3050 B. The metal concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The mean (± standard deviation) concentrations and range of cobalt, chromium, nickel and cadmium in the battery electrodes were 361284 ± 32281 mg/kg (range 20870 - 575330 mg/kg); 25. 3 ± 4. 6 mg/kg (7. 9 - 149 mg/kg); 75272 ± 14630 mg/kg (3589 - 266607 mg/kg) and 2. 8 ± 0. 6 mg/kg (0. 2 - 16. 3 mg/kg), respectively. Similarly, the mean values of cobalt, chromium, nickel and cadmium in the PWB were 564 ± 165 mg/kg (56. 1 - 4068 mg/kg); 28. 1 ± 4. 0 mg/kg (ND- 97. 2 mg/kg); 735 ± 188 mg/kg (22. 7 - 2727 mg/kg) and 1. 8 ± 0. 3 mg/kg (ND- 7. 2 mg/kg), respectively. The Li-ion battery electrodes contained {{significantly higher levels of}} cobalt (p < 0. 01) whereas, the NiMH battery contained significantly higher nickel (P < 0. 01). All the results for the cobalt and nickel levels in the battery electrodes exceeded the toxicity threshold <b>limit</b> <b>concentration</b> used in the toxicity characterization of solid wastes (cobalt, 8000 mg/kg; nickel, 2000 mg/kg). In fact, the mean cobalt level of the battery electrode is about 45 times the toxicity threshold <b>limit</b> <b>concentration</b> limit for cobalt while the mean nickel result is about 38 times the toxicity threshold <b>limit</b> <b>concentration.</b> Spent portable rechargeable batteries should be handled as toxic materials that require special treatment.

40|$|In the Czech Republic {{are mine}} waters well defined by Directives No. 254 / 2001 and No. 44 / 1988. Pumped mine waters from strip or {{underground}} mines {{are affected by}} increased volumes of iron cations, manganese cations, sulphates anions, acid carbonates and by acid pH. Excess limit volumes of dissolved solids are typical. The concentration of characterised pollution of mine waters does not allow direct discharge of these waters into the surface waters, not even their utilization without previous modification or treatment. Mine waters treatment technology on particular localities could be characterised as mechanical–chemical processes, including processes of solid matter sedimentation and further neutralization. This procedure ensures quality of treated waters for its discharge into the surface waters almost in all limited parameters of pollution. Exception is formed by excess <b>limit</b> <b>concentration</b> of dissolved solids (over 1, 000 mg/l) and excess <b>limit</b> <b>concentration</b> of sulphates (over 300 mg/l).

The removal efficiency had a maximum value near the i. e. p. of OA (pH 4. 6); thus, most experiments were conducted at pH 4. 6. Typical experimental conditions; superficial gas velocity, Ug: 1. 97 × 10 – 2 – 5. 37 × 10 – 2 cm/s; initial bulk concentration of OA, Ci: ca. 0. 05 – 0. 25 g/L; liquid volume, V: 600 cm 3. A model estimating bulk concentration profile was proposed by taking into account a mass balance of the present system. The model predicted that OA could be removed perfectly, however, was not all removed experimentally. The residual OA concentration of the bulk liquid within the column reached plateau value, which correspond to ca. 18 % of the initial OA concentration.
