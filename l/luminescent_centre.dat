Here the question of configurational averaging ovet the random sinks, involved in the calculation of the fluorescence yield; or efficiency, has been treated in an approximation {{that goes beyond the}} virtual-crystal approximation (VCA), and presumably incorporates the quasicrystalline approximation (QCA). An expression has been derived for the efficiency of fluorescence (7 J) in terms of the trap concentration C, and the phenomenological rate constants 1 /t>, r and X characterizing, respectively, the de-excitation of the <b>luminescent.</b> <b>centre</b> by re-radiation, resonance tra~~fer to another ' <b>luminescent</b> <b>centre,</b> and through capture by a trap. This has. been done for the case. of ah idealized phosphor consisting of a lattice of luminescent centres:With randomly substituted traps, assuming nearest-neighbour transfers only.

40|$|AbstractThe {{modifications}} in the crystal and electronic structure {{due to the}} Eu 2 + <b>luminescent</b> <b>centre</b> and isolated vacancies in the Sr 2 MgSi 2 O 7 (:Eu 2 +) persistent luminescence material were calculated using the density functional theory (DFT). The exact role of defects in the storage of excitation energy is currently not well understood. They can be formed e. g. due to charge compensation and preparation conditions. The probability of vacancy formation was studied using the total energy of the defect containing host. The most significant structural modifications due to defects in {{the environment of the}} Eu 2 + <b>luminescent</b> <b>centre</b> were found with the introduction of the strontium vacancy. Electron traps were created by Eu 2 + and the strontium as well as oxygen vacancy, whereas the strontium, magnesium and silicon vacancies created also shallow hole traps in the material. The electron traps close to the conduction band can contribute to the persistent luminescence efficiency since they are readily bleached by the thermal energy at room temperature. However, too shallow or deep traps can decrease this efficiency. The role of the intrinsic defects and dopants in the energy storage of the persistent luminescence materials was discussed.

40|$|This work is {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} the origin and. behaviour of the defect centres in the forbidden gap of cadmium sulphide. The methods of measurement used were thermally stimulated current and infra-red luminescence techniques. After introductory chapters on semiconductor theory and the material, cadmium sulphide, the published results on T. S. C. and infra-red luminescence measurements are surveyed and analysed. Results are then given for a series of samples with varying degrees of sulphur doping. During the work, the need for a more accurate method of T. S. C. curve analysis arose, and the curve fitting technique was developed for this purpose. It was found to have many advantages over existing techniques. The combination of T. S. C. and infra-red techniques led to the identification of the centres involved in the infrared luminescence. Important traps at O. 48, 0. 62 and O. 84 eV below the conduction band are identified, and their photochemical reactions with the <b>luminescent</b> <b>centres</b> described.

30|$|Although the {{progress}} in combination lanthanides and magnetic NPs within one hybrid nanomaterial has advanced rapidly, {{there are still}} some challenges for these novel functional materials. One of the most important challenges is the risk of fluorescence quenched by magnetic cores. Therefore, it is of great importance to make sure that both optically active components and magnetic properties were conveyed without compromising by each other. In our synthetic strategy, SiO 2 was chosen as the coating spacer between the lumophore and the magnetic NPs which could effectively diminish the fluorescence quenching by magnetic cores and prevent Fe 3 O 4 NPs from aggregation in the solution. Meanwhile the SiO 2 shell can be easily surface-functionalized and is more biocompatible for further application in biomedical uses [10]. In order to introduce the <b>luminescent</b> <b>centre,</b> we grafted lanthanide complexes directly on the SiO 2 shell through the covalent bonding.

The most satisfactory means of reducing the resistivity of zinc selenide to values consistent with its use as a device (approx. 1 ohm cm.) was to heat nominally undoped crystals In molten zinc. Measurements of the Hall voltage and conductivity over the range 15 ºK to 400 ºK revealed a shallow donor level (Ed = 0. 012 eV) thought to be associated with unremoved trace impurities of chlorine.

40|$|Phosphors with {{optimized}} luminescence {{properties for}} white-LEDs applications {{are the subject}} of very active research [1]. Still, a detailed theoretical understanding of their electronic and temperature-dependent properties is lacking. A striking example is given by the two chemically close oxynitride materials, Ba 3 Si 6 O 12 N 2 :Eu 2 + and Ba 3 Si 6 O 9 N 4 :Eu 2 + : the host materials have very similar electronic and structural properties [2] but Eu doping leads to different luminescence properties and temperature behaviour. The green phosphor Ba 3 Si 6 O 12 N 2 :Eu 2 + [3] has weak thermal quenching at working temperature (around 100 °C), while Ba 3 Si 6 O 9 N 4 :Eu 2 + is a bluish-green phosphor that exhibits an unfavourable decrease of the luminescence intensity with temperature. Luminescent properties of such rare-earth doped compounds are based upon radiative transition between 5 d and 4 f electronic states of the dopant. We propose a scheme for the computation of the excited states in such phosphors that allows to identify and study active luminescent centres and to shed light on their temperature-dependent behaviour. This scheme is based on the Δ-SCF methodology, coupled to a stabilization of the created hole in the 4 f electronic state. We find that in both cases there is only one active <b>luminescent</b> <b>centre,</b> despite the existence of several doping sites. This explains the narrow and well-resolved emission peaks for the two BSON compounds (with a full width at half maximum of 50 nm or less) [4]. The relaxation of the Eu doped excited state is of crucial importance as there are major changes in the electronic bandstructure due to Stokes shifts. We also confirm the Dorenbos energy transfer model [5]: the gap between 5 d state and conduction band is 0. 2 eV larger in Ba 3 Si 6 O 12 N 2 :Eu 2 + than inBa 3 Si 6 O 9 N 4 :Eu 2 +. [1] W. M.

40|$|The {{luminescent}} {{solar concentrator}} is a planar, non-tracking device. Originally introduced {{more than three}} decades ago, it has yet to establish itself as a means of making photovoltaic solar energy more cost effective. Advances in organic <b>luminescent</b> <b>centres,</b> the emergence of inorganic nanocrystals and the development of new light trapping techniques have created promising opportunities for the LSC. This thesis investigates novel geometries and materials for the practical exploitation of LSCs. The research is based on experimental measurements as well as computational simulations using a Raytrace Model. It is shown both experimentally and computationally that a thin- lm structure produces the same effciency as a homogeneously doped LSC. Two building integrated applications are examined. The rst one is a power generating window employing a Lumogen Violet dye that absorbs short wavelength radiation and is mostly transparent in the visible. Annual yields of over 23 kWh/m 2 and a conversion effciency of over 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVarious photo-induced silver <b>luminescent</b> <b>centres</b> were {{obtained}} in photosensitive zinc and phosphate glasses containing silver ions after exposure to gamma or ultraviolet nanosecond pulsed-laser radiation. Gamma-irradiation of the glasses results {{mainly in the}} formation within the glass of electron-trapped and hole-trapped silver centres as evidenced by optical absorption, luminescence and electron spin resonance spectroscopies. For the highest irradiation doses silver clusters are obtained. Under ultraviolet nanosecond pulsed-laser exposure similar species are generated along the beam propagation direction as proven by the analogous optical and luminescence signatures. In this case for high irradiation doses few silver clusters are created. The evolution of the luminescence spectra {{with respect to the}} temperature and to the duration of the heat treatment after ultraviolet nanosecond pulsed-laser irradiation evidences the presence of potential barriers determining the stability limits of some species such as the Ag 2 + hole-trapped centres or the Agmx+ clusters composed of silver ions and silver atoms. A heat treatment of several hundreds of degrees is identified as a the key parameter for tailoring the optical properties and controlling the formation of Agmx+ clusters in the photosensitive glasses...|$|R
40|$|Several {{distinct}} <b>luminescent</b> <b>centres</b> form in GaN samples doped with Eu. One centre, Eu 2, recently {{identified as}} the isolated, substitutional Eu impurity, Eu(Ga), is dominant in ion-implanted samples annealed under very high pressures (1 GPa) of N(2). According to structural determinations, such samples exhibit an essentially complete removal of lattice damage caused by the implantation process. A second centre, Eu 1, probably comprising Eu(Ga) in association with an intrinsic lattice defect, produces a more complex emission spectrum. In addition there are several unidentified features in the (5) D(0) to (7) F(2) spectral region near 620 nm. We can readily distinguish Eu 1 and Eu 2 by their excitation spectra, in particular through their different sensitivities to above-gap and below-gap excitation. The present study extends recent work on photoluminescence/excitation (PL/E) spectroscopy of Eu 1 and Eu 2 to arrive at an understanding of these mechanisms in terms of residual optically active defect concentrations. We also report further on the 'host-independent' excitation mechanism that is active {{in the case of}} a prominent minority centre. The relevance of this work to the operation of the red GaN:Eu light-emitting diode is discussed...|$|R
