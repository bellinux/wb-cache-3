40|$|Abstract Global {{stability}} {{analysis is}} becoming increasingly important {{in the design of}} reinforced concrete buildings, especially in the slender ones, due its sensitivity to <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement.</b> The <b>loss</b> of stability is usually associated with the intensity of the second order effects and, in that sense, the gamma-z (γz) coefficient is an important evaluation parameter for this problem. This work aims to verify the γz efficiency as a global stability parameter based on the buckling load factors of the structures and their respective critical buckling modes. To this purpose, a comparative analysis is performed in several idealized structures, from which an approximate equation for calculating the critical load factor based on the γz coefficient is obtained. This equation was verified by numerical analysis of Finite Elements Method models of real reinforced concrete buildings. It was concluded that the proposed equation presents satisfying results within a certain range of γz...|$|R

In {{order to}} analyze the {{characteristic}} of <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> of soft soil foundation under embankment, a typical embankment is studied systemically with nonlinear finite element method, {{and the location of}} maximal <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> and its measuring method is also discussed.

This phenomena could not be measured conveniently with inclinometer pipe, for there are many shortcomings within this technique, although which has been used in engineering widely. It is also shown that the location of the maximal <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> is changeable at different construction stages, which more likely lies in the vertical surface between the toe and the middle of slope of embankment.

40|$|Deterministic <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> {{technology}} was originally {{developed in the}} realm of microfluidics, but has potential for larger scale separation as well. In our previous studies, we proposed a sieve-based <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> device inspired on the principle of deterministic <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement.</b> The advantages of this new device is that it gives a lower pressure drop, lower risk of particle accumulation, higher throughput and is simpler to manufacture. However, until now this device has only been investigated for its separation of large particles of around 785 μm diameter. To separate smaller particles, we investigate several design parameters for their influence on the critical particle diameter. In a dimensionless evaluation, device designs with different geometry and dimensions were compared. It was found that sieve-based <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> devices are able to displace particles due to the crucial role of the flow profile, despite of their unusual and asymmetric design. These results demonstrate the possibility to actively steer the velocity profile {{in order to reduce the}} critical diameter in deterministic <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> devices, which makes this separation principle more accessible for large-scale, high throughput applications. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> in the {{immediate}} roof beam at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is {{a significant factor in}} assessment of excavation performance for the design of ground control systems. Information on roof beam <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement,</b> expansion, fracture formation, as well as excavation convergence, is gathered using a variety of manually and remotely read instruments. Visual observations are also used when possible. This paper describes the methods used to measure <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement,</b> or offset, at the WIPP. Offset magnitudes are determined by the degree of occlusion in drillholes that intersect the offset plane. The Borehole <b>Lateral</b> <b>Displacement</b> Sensor (BLDS) was developed for installation at WIPP to monitor offset at a high degree of accuracy at a short reading frequency. Offset measurements have historically been obtained by visual estimation of borehole occlusion. Use of the BLDS will enable relationships between time dependent roof beam <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> and expansion to be established in much shorter periods than is possible using visual observations. The instrument will also allow remote monitoring of roof beam displacement in areas where visual estimations are not possible. Continued monitoring of roof beam displacement, convergence, and expansion, is integral to timely and pertinent assessments of WIPP excavation performance...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} design {{parameters}} for an {{orbital angular momentum}} (OAM) multiplexed free-space data link. Power loss, channel crosstalk and power penalty of the link are analyzed {{in the case of}} misalignment between the transmitter and receiver (<b>lateral</b> <b>displacement,</b> receiver angular error, or transmitter pointing error). The relationship among the system power loss and link distance, transmitted beam size and receiver aperture size are discussed based on the beam divergence due to free space propagation. We also describe the trade-offs for different receiver aperture sizes and mode spacing of the transmitted OAM beams under given <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements</b> or receiver angular errors. Through simulations and some experiments, we show that (1) a system with a larger transmitted beam size and a larger receiver aperture is more tolerant to the <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> but less tolerant to the receiver angular error; (2) a system with a larger mode spacing, which uses larger OAM charges, suffers more system power loss but less channel crosstalk; thus, a system with a small mode spacing shows lower system power penalty when system power loss dominates (e. g., small <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> or receiver angular error) while that with a larger mode spacing shows lower power penalty when channel crosstalk dominates (e. g., larger <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> or receiver angular error); (3) the effects of <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> and receiver angular error are not necessarily independent; as an example of them combined, the effects of the transmitter pointing error on the system are also investigated.

The normally-distributed {{far field}} of an ultrasound transducer in a lateral direction is {{taken advantage of}} for measuring <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement.</b> The measurement system is composed of several air-coupled ultrasound transducers as a receiver and several transmitters. The transmitters are immobilized at a fixed point, whereas the receiver set-up is separately arranged on the opposite side. In order to improve measurement accuracy, a correction method that utilizes polynomial approximation is introduced. The difference between the corrected <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> and the reference displacement {{is estimated to be}} 0. 2 mm at maximum for the two transmitters system. A good responsiveness is demonstrated by conducting a dynamic response experiment. When five transmitters are arranged, their measurement range is easily extended up to ± 60 mm with an accuracy of 0. 7 mm. In both cases, the fluctuations to the measurement ranges show less than 1 %.
