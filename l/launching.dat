40|$|Research on the <b>launch</b> of new {{products}} in the international realm is scarce. The present paper {{is the first to}} document how <b>launch</b> window (difference in months between the first worldwide <b>launch</b> and the subsequent <b>launch</b> in a specific country) and <b>launch</b> price are interrelated and how regulation influences both <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price. The research context is the global - 50 countries worldwide - <b>launch</b> of 58 new ethical drugs across 29 therapeutic areas. We show that the fastest <b>launch</b> occurs when the <b>launch</b> price is moderately high and the highest <b>launch</b> price occurs at a <b>launch</b> window of 85 months. We find that the health regulator acts strategically in that {{the extent to which it}} delays the <b>launch</b> of a new drug increases with the price of the new drug. We also find that regulation overall increases the <b>launch</b> window, except for patent protection. Surprisingly, regulation does not directly impact <b>launch</b> price. The descriptive information on average <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price and the interconnection between <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price allows managers in ethical drug companies to build more informed decisions for international market entry. This study also provides public policy analysts with more quantitative evidence regarding <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price on a broad sample of countries and categories. regulation;pharmaceutical;entry timing;launch price;launch window;international new product <b>launch...</b>|$|R
