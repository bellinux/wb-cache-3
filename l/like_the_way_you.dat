25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that {{this is the kind of}} thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She wrote a letter to the author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the second}} season and the source novel Dragonfly in Amber, Moore said: The book is a more {{complicated}} structure {{in terms of how}} Diana Gabaldon wrote it ... So it was not as easy an adaptation as the first season was ... Book 2 is just a more complex book. It’s laid out very differently, as a result it took more wrangling {{to try to figure out}} how to translate this particular story into our season. There were more complications, there were more characters ... It was a bigger task. The thing that gives me the most comfort is that Diana likes it a lot. She had said, 'Oh, I really <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> did it. it was a difficult plot, I know, but I think you really found the essence of it. You really found the through line that really defines what this part of the journey is.' ... It’s not going to be a literal adaptation because I don’t think that’s possible with the second book ... But I think it’s very much the same story, the major characters are all represented, the major scenes are all represented, and it still gets you to all the same places you want to go.|$|R
5000|$|... "Right There" [...] was {{recorded}} in 2010 at the Record Plant Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. It was written by Ester Dean, Frank Romano, Daniel Morris and co-written and produced by Jim Jonsin. [...] "Right There" [...] is a pop and R&B, song {{with a duration of}} 4:22. Instrumentation consists of [...] "reggae guitar strums and brazen beats" [...] which glistens throughout the song. Eliot Glazer compared the beat to the guitar riff of Stevie Nicks' song [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] (1982). Lyrically, the song is about the protagonist [...] "talking about all <b>the</b> things she <b>likes</b> her man to do," [...] In lyrics such as [...] "Me <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>you</b> hold my body / Me <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>you</b> touch my body." [...] In the pre-chorus she becomes territorial with her man, and warns other girls away: [...] "No I ain’t never gonna let no girl take him from me / Never gonna let no girl steal him from me." [...] Throughout the song Scherzinger sings in a Caribbean-influenced vocal style. Then, 50 Cent comes in with his verse, rounding out the song with his male perspective. According to Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio Blog, [...] "the rapper drops an uncanny lyrical reference to Destiny's Child." [...] Robert Copsey noted that 50 Cent [...] " [...] adds extra fizz to an already provocative and hip-grinding bottle of pop." [...] On ITV1's Daybreak, Scherzinger defended criticism towards her track that was labeled [...] "too raunchy", she described it as [...] "a beautiful love ballad." ...|$|R

[...] "There {{are so many things}} we might talk about." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, Luis Miguel {{received}} a Grammy Award for his duet [...] "Me Gustas Tal Como Eres" [...] (I <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> Just <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> Are) with Sheena Easton.

Luis Miguel is the only Latin artist to have two Spanish-language albums (Romance and Segundo Romance) go platinum in the USA.|$|R
5000|$|Mat Osman {{talked about}} the writing process: [...] "Neil and Richard pretty much wrote a record, they wrote about 45 minutes of music, lots of which ran into each other and lots of {{different}} themes re-emerged. We went to Belgium which were we started recording and basically recorded everything without Brett having any melodies or any words, which he’s never done before, {{so it was a}} bit of a leap in the dark. And then he sat down to write to the whole thing and we had no idea if it was going to work, it hasn’t ended up the same, uh since then we‘ve added about 4 songs and cut quite a lot of it and moved stuff around. It always started off as a record that was influenced by film music and stuff <b>like</b> that, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> can have quite meandering pieces and scenes that reemerge, theres lots of stuff on the record that is made up of bits and pieces of other songs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kitty Empire in The Observer said Jackson sounded [...] "paler, more emaciated, more effects-laden" [...] than on {{his classic}} {{songs such as}} 'Billie Jean'. She {{characterized}} the album as a [...] "hotchpotch of odds and sods that often make plain their co-authors" [...] but singled out the [...] "breezy" [...] and [...] "carefree" [...] '(I <b>Like)</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> That <b>You</b> Love Me' and the [...] "pugnacious" [...] 'Hollywood Tonight' for praise. The Reno Gazette-Journal gave the album 3 stars out of 4, while the Toronto Sun gave it 3 stars out of 5. Nima Baniamer of Contactmusic.com gave the album 4/5 and stated that Jackson still seems to hold the capability to effortlessly transgress music genres. Baniamer also commented, [...] "It wouldn't be a decent Jackson record if it wasn't surrounded by controversy. 'Breaking News' is a great track that touches upon the media's obsession with the pop icon; ironically a track further surrounded by dispute as fans have claimed {{that it may not}} even be Jackson's own voice on the track." ...|$|R
