50|$|<b>Loan</b> <b>purpose</b> {{is a term}} in United States {{mortgage}} {{industry to}} show the underlying reason an applicant is seeking a loan. The purpose of the loan {{is used by the}} lender to make decisions on the risk and may even impact the interest rate that is offered. For example, if an applicant is refinancing a mortgage after having taken some cash out, the lender might consider that an increase in risk and increase the interest rate that is offered or add additional conditions. <b>Loan</b> <b>purpose</b> is important to the process of obtaining mortgages or business loans that are connected with specific types of business activities.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{corporate}} governance role of banks by investigating the effect of bank monitoring on the borrowers' earnings management behavior. Our analyses suggest that a borrowing firm's earnings management behavior generally decreases as the strength of bank monitoring increases. The strength of bank monitoring is measured as (1) the magnitude of a bank loan, (2) the reputation (rank) of a lead bank, (3) {{the length of a}} bank loan, and (4) the number of lenders. These results imply that bank monitoring {{plays an important role in}} the corporate governance of bank-dependent firms. We further examine other bank loan characteristics (collateral, refinancing, loan types, and <b>loan</b> <b>purposes)</b> and their effects on borrowers' earnings management behavior. Our analyses show that collateral and loan types are significantly associated with borrowers' earnings management behavior while refinancing and <b>loan</b> <b>purposes</b> have no association.

50|$|Credit {{score and}} history, {{property}} use, property type, loan amount, <b>loan</b> <b>purpose,</b> income, and asset amounts, {{as well as}} documentation levels, property location, and others, are common risk based factors currently used. Lenders 'price' loans according to these individual factors and their multiple derivatives. Each derivative either positively or negatively affects {{the cost of an}} interest rate. For example, lower credit scores equal higher interest rates and vice versa; typically, those who provide less verifiable income documentation due to self-employment benefits will qualify for a higher interest rate than someone who fully documents all reported income. Mortgage and other financial service industries value credit score and history most when pricing mortgage interest rates.|$|E
50|$|Collaborative finance is a {{category}} of financial transaction that occurs directly between individuals without the intermediation of a traditional financial institution. This new way to manage informal financial transactions has been enabled by advances in social media and peer-to-peer online platforms. The wide variety of collaborative finance resources may vary not only in their organizational and operational aspects, but also by geographical region, share of the financial market etc. It is precisely this heterogeneity that enables the informal savings and credit activity to profitably reach those income-groups not served by commercial banks and other financial institutions. It is their informality, adaptability and flexibility of operations - characteristics which reduce their transactions costs and confers upon them their comparative advantage and economic rationale. Collaborative Finance is characterized by highly personalized loan transactions entailing face-to-face dealings with borrowers and flexibility in respect of <b>loan</b> <b>purpose,</b> interest rates, collateral requirements, maturity periods and debt rescheduling.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies P 2 P {{lending and}} the factors {{explaining}} loan default. This {{is an important}} issue because in P 2 P lending individual investors bear the credit risk, instead of financial institutions, which are experts in dealing with this risk. P 2 P lenders suffer a severe problem of information asymmetry, because they are at a disadvantage facing the borrower. For this reason, P 2 P lending sites provide potential lenders with information about borrowers and their <b>loan</b> <b>purpose.</b> They also assign a grade to each loan. The empirical study is based on loans' data collected from Lending Club (N = 24, 449) from 2008 to 2014 that are first analyzed by using univariate means tests and survival analysis. Factors explaining default are <b>loan</b> <b>purpose,</b> annual income, current housing situation, credit history and indebtedness. Secondly, a logistic regression model is developed to predict defaults. The grade assigned by the P 2 P lending site is the most predictive factor of default, but the accuracy of the model is improved by adding other information, especially the borrower's debt level...|$|E

This indicates that the higher the age, the higher the group member’s loan repayment rate. This conforms to a priori expectations and parallels the work of Olagunju and Adeyemo (2007), which reported that age positively affects loan repayment. The authors further opined that older borrowers can better obey stated obligations than young people, who have a high propensity to divert <b>loan</b> <b>purposes</b> to other uses, such as substance or, health care without regards to their obligations.

40|$|The {{financial}} crises {{in the early}} 2000 s have given prominence to the financial markets' exposure to credit risk. To minimize credit risk, the risk that a borrower will fail to meet her contractual obligations, lenders seek to identify borrowers with a high probability of default prior to granting credit. In my dissertation I examine several screening devices that lenders utilize in alleviating adverse selection present on the credit market. In the first chapter, I ask whether the existence of informal collateral signals better loan repayment. Taking advantage of a unique dataset of household loans from a Czech commercial bank, I find that housing loans without lien on the property default less compared to <b>loans</b> with unspecified <b>purpose.</b> I also show that the interest rate differential between specific <b>purpose</b> <b>loans</b> and unspecified <b>purpose</b> <b>loans</b> is systematically higher than their default rate differential. In the second chapter, I investigate the role of loan contract terms in household loan demand and performance. Utilizing a sample of accepted and rejected Czech household loans, I find that loan demand for low-income borrowers is more sensitive to liquidity constraint and loan maturity changes than to interest rate changes. The results also suggest that by reflecting the borrower's riskiness in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the determinants of the nominal value of loans in microcredit and the factors that drive long-term relationship banking. The dataset is drawn from primary data gathered from 216 randomly selected borrowers in a Cambodian microfinance institution. Analysis is performed using an OLS regression model.

Contrary to general belief that microcredit is targeted to the “poorest of the poor”, a new market segment in microcredit was discovered within which MFI might target low-income/asset backed clients, granting loans on a “sustainable” basis, by applying the fundamental criteria of commercial banking: assessing credit worthiness and loss given default.

We test for any significant difference of real estate banks with respect to other banks and the different roles of the real estate market trend in explaining changes in bank risk exposure.

USDA guarantees the timely repayment of 90% of principal and interest on guaranteed loans, and in some cases can subsidize the interest rate on these loans. The amount USDA can directly lend or guarantee each year is determined in the annual congressional appropriations process.|$|R
40|$|Although {{banks are}} at the center of {{systemic}} risk, there are other institutions that contribute to it. With the publication of the leveraged lending guideline in March 2013, the U. S. regulators show that they are especially worried about the private equity firms with their high-risk deals. Given these risks and the interconnectedness of the banks through the LBO loan syndicates, I shed light on the impact of a bank’s LBO loan exposure on its systemic risk. By using 3, 538 observations between 2000 and 2013 from 165 global banks, I show that banks with higher LBO exposure also have a higher level of systemic risk. Other <b>loan</b> <b>purposes</b> do not show this positive relationship. The main drivers influencing this relationship positively are the bank’s interconnectedness to other LBO financing banks and its size. Lending experience with a specific PE sponsor, experience with leading LBO syndicates or a bank’s credit rating, however, lead to a lower impact of the LBO loan exposure on systemic risk...|$|R
