The entrance was on the north side, where there also was a small window. The shrine appeared to contain two tombs, one about 1 m high, while the other marked only by a <b>low</b> <b>kerb</b> of stones. The larger tomb was covered with purple and green cloth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The physics {{design of}} the {{accelerator}} for the Heating Neutral Beamline (HNB) on ITER is still being worked on and this paper describes the design considerations, choices and status of the same. Equal acceleration gaps of 85 mm have been chosen to improve the voltage holding while keeping the beam divergence <b>low.</b> <b>Kerbs</b> and biaxial (and/or oblique) apertures are used to compensate for unwanted magnetic deflection, beamlet-beamlet interaction and to point the beamlets in the right direction. A combination of long-range and short-range magnetic fields is used to reduce electron leakage between the grids and limit the transmitted electron power to below 800 kW...|$|R
40|$|The physics {{design of}} the {{accelerator}} for the heating neutral beamline on ITER is now finished and this paper describes the considerations and choices which constitute {{the basis of this}} design. Equal acceleration gaps of 88 mm have been chosen to improve the voltage holding capability while keeping the beam divergence <b>low.</b> <b>Kerbs</b> (metallic plates around groups of apertures, attached to the downstream surface of the grids) are used to compensate for the beamlet–beamlet interaction and to point the beamlets in the right direction. A novel magnetic configuration is employed to compensate for the beamlet deflection caused by the electron suppression magnets in the extraction grid.

5000|$|The sacred zone — {{among the}} most {{important}} and largest circular and rectangular Dacian sanctuaries - includes a number of rectangular temples, the bases of their supporting columns still visible in regular arrays. Perhaps the most enigmatic construction at the site is the large circular sanctuary. It consisted of a setting of timber posts {{in the shape of a}} D, surrounded by a timber circle which in turn was surrounded by a <b>low</b> stone <b>kerb.</b> The layout of the timber settings bears some resemblance to the stone monument at Stonehenge in England.|$|R
50|$|Close to the {{car park}} at the {{southern}} entrance onto Undercliffe Lane is a war memorial {{in the form of}} Cross of Sacrifice to those who died in the First and Second World Wars.Behind the Cross of Sacrifice a <b>low</b> <b>kerb</b> memorial lists Commonwealth service personnel buried in the cemetery whose graves could not be marked by headstones.In all 134 Commonwealth service personnel - 91 from the First and 43 from the Second World War are buried here.Many of the former were burials from the Bradford War Hospital.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} War Memorial, in {{the form}} of a Cross of Sacrifice to the British, Irish, French and Canadian servicemen. It is {{surrounded}} by a Screen Wall memorial and a <b>low</b> <b>kerb</b> listing Commonwealth service personnel of both World Wars whose graves in the cemetery could not be marked by headstones. In all, the cemetery contains 208 graves of Commonwealth service personnel of the First World War, and 107 graves of the Second World War. There are also many foreign nationality war graves that include, from First World War, 77 Belgians and six Germans, and from the Second, eight Czechoslovakian and six Polish war graves ...|$|E
50|$|Its 70 kg {{extruded}} aluminium {{space frame}} and lightweight composite body shell are factors in its <b>low</b> <b>kerb</b> weight of 875 kg. 250 nickel-cadmium batteries provide 300 volts (at full charge) to two Zytek oil-cooled brushless DC motors, which deliver a total power of 150 kW (200 hp) and torque of 100 Nm. These motors are each mated to a single-speed, fixed ratio transmission with an aluminium gear. Its acceleration time from 30 to 70 mph is 5 seconds, and from 0 to 90 mph, 11.2 seconds. The car is governor-limited to 90 mph to conserve charge. The range per charge is typically 100 to 120 mi {{and the car}} can be re-charged within an hour.|$|E
25|$|Copenhagen's {{relatively}} well-developed bicycle {{culture has}} given rise to the term copenhagenization. This is the practice where other cities try to follow the example Copenhagen has set in recent decades, by moving from their own (often long-held) car-centric transport policies to those that attempt to greatly increase the number of journeys by bicycle; they do this by developing bicycle infrastructure and/or improving their current bicycle infrastructure just as Copenhagen has done and continues to do. An example of a city which has introduced bike lanes acknowledging inspiration from Copenhagen is Melbourne in Australia where kerbside bike lanes separated from moving and parked cars by a <b>low</b> concrete <b>kerb</b> are referred to as 'Copenhagen lanes'. The concept of Copenhagenization has been featured by CNNs Richard Quest in the Futures Cities series and on Al Jazeera's Earthrise series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mass grave}} {{containing}} {{the victims of}} the flood is enclosed by a low fence, made from tubular steel posts with chain slung between them. Two marked grave plots containing flood victims are also enclosed by the fence. One belongs to Richard Hooper. The inscription states he [...] "was drowned in the great flood of Clermont". The grave also contains his wife Elizabeth Jane Hooper who died in 1956 aged 85. It consists of a marble plaque attached to a granite headstone, with a <b>low</b> concrete grave <b>kerb</b> surrounding a concrete slab covered in black and white tiles. Four immortelles sit on top of the slab and a marble plaque with the words [...] "Mother Father" [...] are attached to the kerb {{at the foot of the}} grave. The other marked grave, located further to the south, has a concrete headstone with marble plaque, concrete grave kerb and gravel infill. The three names listed on this plaque are: John Thomas Wicks, Peter Olsson and Evelyn Olsson. The inscription states that they [...] "were drowned in the flood of Dec 1916".|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from perennial ryegrass back to bermudagrass is often problematic. Prolonged periods of ryegrass persistence and/or loss of complete turf is troublesome and not {{favorable to the}} re-establishment of the bermudagrass base. A group of select herbicides were applied in May 2000, to assess their response to enhance the removal of perennial ryegrass, and to enhance recovery of the bermudagrass. CORSAIR (Chlorosufuron) applied at 1. 0 ounce/product/acre resulted in reduced turfgrass quality from three to six weeks after treatment, with a decrease in color at three weeks. This treatment caused moderate suppression of the turf and an enhanced {{transition from}} perennial ryegrass to Tifway (419). MANOR (Metsulfuron) applied at 0. 4 ounce/product/acre caused a slight growth suppression, acceptable turfgrass color, but a noticeable decrease in turfgrass quality up to six weeks after application. MANOR increased turf density and minimized scalping by seven weeks after treatment (July 24, 2000) SURFLAN when applied at 1. 5 lb AI/A, produced acceptable quality turf, no visible growth suppression, acceptable overseed turf quality and color. SURFLAN did not provide any affect as a transition agent in this test. KERB did not greatly enhance transition, and was slightly more effective at 0. 5 lb AI/A, than at the 1. 0 lb AI/A rate. Both rates of KERB produced acceptable turfgrass color throughout the test. Turfgrass quality diminished to low levels from July 18 to July 24, ranking <b>lowest</b> in quality. <b>KERB</b> treated turf tended to "scalp" more than other treated turfs and thinned the grass at {{the high rate of}} 0. 50 lb AI/A. FIRST RATE applied at 75 grams AI/hectare caused slight visible suppression for two weeks after treatment, an acceptable quality turf (on six of seven evaluation dates), acceptable turfgrass color and turf density. FIRST RATE did enhance transition, but less so than CORSAIR, possibly less than MANOR, and certainly less than AEF 130630. PROXY was applied on four dates (four, three, two, and zero weeks prior to June 3), selected as a "calendar target" dates observe transition. PROXY when applied on May 13, provided a short transition effect, for a period of about two weeks. Applications made later had little effect whatsoever, on Spring transition back to bermudagrass. From May 19 to June 5, the two "early" applications of PROXY, generally increased turfgrass color and quality scores, most likely by having a PGR response on perennial ryegrass. AEF 130630 readily enhanced Spring transition from perennial ryegrass to Tifway (419) bermudagrass, especially in May and June. All three application rates caused visual suppression of the turf from May 19 until June 5. Turfgrass color and quality were affected by AEF 130630. The maximum expression occurred for the 0. 42 ounce/product/M rate by May 25 (which remained until at least June 5). Mean color scores here were 5. 3, on both dates. The high rate 0. 64 ounce/product/M actually caused less color reductions in the turf (perhaps {{as a function of the}} quicker removal of ryegrass). Reduced turf quality resulted three weeks after treatment for both the low and high rates (means = 5. 0). The turf was similar to that of the control plots, afterwards, and superior by both middle and late July time periods...|$|R
5000|$|The {{open ground}} or Maidan is flanked around its edge by a katta, a simple {{continuous}} <b>low</b> <b>kerb</b> edging that forms a makeshift seat, a popular hangout for {{young and old}} alike. The paved walkway around this perimeter is crowded with people taking walks. The inner circumference of the park is 1.17 km. The maidan covers 112937 m2, {{more than half of}} which is occupied by 31 tenants, the largest being clubs like the Shivaji Park Gymkhana, and the Bengal Club. the remaining part of the ground and open spaces are available to the public for sports and other activities. Other structures dotting the periphery of the grounds include the Samarth Vyayam Mandir (gymnasium), Shivaji Park Nagarik Sangh (established in 1947), a children's Park, Nana-Nani Park ( [...] park for senior citizens), Scout's Pavilion, a Ganesh temple and a library. The walkway is lined with huge rain trees.|$|E
