5|$|All pulmonate <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> are hermaphrodites, {{and have}} a {{complete}} and rather elaborate set of {{both male and female}} reproductive organs (see the simplified anatomical diagram above), but the majority of pulmonate <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> have no love darts and no dart sac.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonates {{are mostly}} <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> and slugs that have {{developed}} a simple lung from the mantle cavity. An externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air {{to be taken into}} the mantle cavity lung.|$|E

5|$|Mating {{begins with}} a courting ritual. For example, in <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> of the genus Helix, {{including}} the escargot Helix pomatia, and the common garden snail Helix aspersa (also known as Cornu aspersum and Cantareus aspersus), copulation is preceded by an elaborate tactile courtship.|$|E
5|$|SEM {{images of}} love darts from eight {{different}} species of pulmonate <b>land</b> <b>snails.</b> The upper images show a lateral view, where the scale bar is 500 μm (= 0.5mm). The lower images show a cross-section, where the scale bar is 50 μm (= 0.05mm).|$|E
5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} {{arboreal}} <b>land</b> <b>snails.</b> Further {{information concerning the}} habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails have generally been collected while they were crawling on trees or shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E
50|$|Achatina albopicta, {{common name}} the African <b>land</b> <b>snail,</b> is {{a species of}} large {{air-breathing}} <b>land</b> <b>snail,</b> a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Achatinidae.|$|R

5|$|The love dart {{is not a}} penial stylet (in {{other words}} {{this is not an}} {{accessory}} organ for sperm transfer). The exchange of sperm between both of the two <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> is a completely separate part of the mating progression. Nevertheless, recent research shows that use of the dart can strongly favor the reproductive outcome for the snail that is able to lodge a dart in its partner. This is because mucus on the dart introduces a hormone-like substance that allows far more of its sperm to survive.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal {{rainfall}} {{patterns of}} the Western Ghats necessitate a period of dormancy for its <b>land</b> <b>snails,</b> resulting in their high abundance and diversity including at least 258 species of gastropods from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species of freshwater molluscs (52 gastropods and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This include 28 endemics. Among the threatened freshwater molluscs are the mussels Pseudomulleria dalyi, which is a Gondwanan relict, and the snail Cremnoconchus, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, 4 species of freshwater molluscs are considered endangered and 3 are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.|$|E

5000|$|P. manokwari {{has also}} {{sometimes}} been introduced intentionally, as a biological control agent. In various {{areas such as}} Guam and the Okinawa islands, P. manokwari was introduced to control {{the population of the}} invasive Giant African <b>land</b> <b>snail,</b> which had damaged crops and threatened the agricultural industry. It has been said that [...] "much of the 'evidence' that these predators can control Achatina fulica populations is based on a poor understanding of ecological principles. That the predators will prey on African <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> is not evidence that they can control its populations...". The flatworm controlled the population of the Giant African <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> but it also began preying on populations of endemic <b>land</b> <b>snail,</b> which led to an unprecedented increase in the P. manokwari populations and a marked decrease in the endemic <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> populations.|$|R
