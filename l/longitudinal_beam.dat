50|$|A crown post is a {{compression}} member, a post, in roof framing {{which carries}} a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> called a crown plate. The crown plate in turn carries collar beams which help support and carry the rafters, thus collar beams are always found in crown post roof framing.|$|E
5000|$|Ladder {{track is}} a type of railway track in which the track is laid on {{longitudinal}} supports with [...] connectors holding the two rails at the correct gauge distance. Modern ladder track can be considered a development of baulk road, which supported rails on longitudinal wooden sleepers. Synonyms include <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> track.|$|E
50|$|Three Roman {{ships were}} built to {{transport}} one obelisk. The two aft ships were of rectangular shape, they were 37 meters {{in length and}} 5 meters in width. The two ships were held together by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beams,</b> while the obelisk was tied to these <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beams</b> and held stationary underwater. The third ship, a larger trireme, was {{in the front and}} was tied to the two larger ships carrying the obelisk. The third ship’s purpose was to help steer the two aft ships and have rowers and sail power the ship across the Mediterranean.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{examination}} of lattice-like structure is intro-duced. Lattice structures are built of crossmembers, side-wall and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beams.</b> Both the crossmember and the beams can be symmetric, but the paper deals global symmetry of lat-tice. This global symmetry means a longitudinal and lateral symmetry plane of the structure. Similarly to the structure, the outer load can be symmetric or antimetric for these two sym-metry planes, as well. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to show reduction the number of the unknowns of the compatibil-ity equation and predict the distribution of the bending moment in beams for practical use.

5000|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two parallel arches with a free span of 45 m and an intermediate deck. The arches rise {{to a total of}} 6 m with a span-rise ratio of 7:5, and attach to the deck with two connected longitudinal beams. The arches have a triangular cross-section, with a central web. Their depth is [...]7 m, constant through their length; the width of each section varies between [...]7 and 1 meter. The longitudinal beams are rectangular hollow sections 1 x [...]5 meters and plates with varying thicknesses between 15 mm and 25 mm. In the central zone (with the arch above the deck) the beams have a central web connected to the web of the arch, allowing transfer of the vertical load of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> to the arch. Two struts (connecting the base of each of the arches {{and the end of the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam)</b> avoid horizontal reaction on the abutments.|$|E
50|$|The shed {{would be}} modular using a 3m by 6m bay, the beams {{of the roof}} being {{supported}} by cast iron columns. The ground to beam clearance was 3.5m and the ground to ridge height was 4.6m. Later sheds used a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> under the gutter beam {{eliminating the need for}} a row of columns, creating a 6m by 6m lattice. The modular nature enable sheds to infill on irregularly shaped sites.|$|E
50|$|The major {{advantage}} {{offered by}} a VFFAG design over a FFAG design is that the path-length is held constant between particles with different energies and therefore relativistic particles travel isochronously. Isochronousity of the revolution period enables continuous beam operation, therefore offering the same advantage in power that isochronous cyclotrons have over synchrocyclotrons. Isochronous accelerators have no <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> focusing, {{but this is not}} a strong limitation in accelerators with rapid ramp rates typically used in FFAG designs.|$|E
50|$|After {{analyzing}} {{many possible}} color combinations for the Llinars bridge, the designers selected blue {{for the members}} above the deck level and gray for {{the bottom of the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beams.</b> This combination was intended to make the structure appear more slender.|$|R
50|$|The piers are Y-shaped and in-situ concrete. The deck {{connects to}} each pier via a {{cross-beam}} that connects two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beams.</b> This arrangement allows the visual {{continuity of the}} depth section of the deck along the bridge, emphasizing its slenderness.|$|R
50|$|The main {{building}} has a dramatic cadence of external pillar elements, connected by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beams,</b> providing a galley level free of internal columns or structural walls. The park was created on landfill in the bay, so the pillars footings reach 20 m down.|$|R
5000|$|Rapidity is used {{to define}} a measure of angular {{separation}} between particles commonly used in particle physics , which is Lorentz invariant under a boost along the <b>longitudinal</b> (<b>beam)</b> direction. Often, the rapidity term in this expression is replaced by pseudorapidity, yielding a definition with purely angular quantities: [...] , which is Lorentz invariant if the involved particles are massless. The difference in azimuthal angle, , is invariant under Lorentz boosts along the beam line (z-axis) because it is measured in a plane (i.e. the [...] "transverse" [...] x-y plane) orthogonal to the beam line.|$|E
50|$|The Jet Provost has an {{uncomplicated}} structure, the airframe being {{based on}} the Percival Provost, albeit being strengthened in key {{areas such as the}} main wing spar and featuring a substantially different undercarriage arrangement. It possesses an all-metal stressed-skin fuselage built in two sections, the forward section stretching {{from the rear of the}} engine bay to the nose comprises a double-frame to absorb the wing and engine loads, while the rear fuselage section uses an orthodox semi-monocoque structure. Major loads across the fuselage are supported by a combination of four longerons and a single <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> across the upper-center line. The ailerons, elevators, and rudder are all attached to the airframe via two inset hinges each. The nose contains a hinged metal assembly, housing the radio, batteries, and other electronic equipment, and is easily serviceable by ground crew. All fuel tankage is housed within the wings. Where possible, all components used were designed to maximized interchangeability and to conform with international standardisation; a total of 49 service panels across the aircraft's exterior provides access for maintenance and servicing.|$|E
50|$|It was the {{negative}} {{result of a}} famous experiment, that required the introduction of length contraction: the Michelson-Morley experiment (and later also the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment). In special relativity its explanation is as follows: In its rest frame the interferometer {{can be regarded as}} at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, so the propagation time of light is the same in all directions. Although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion, the transverse beam must traverse a longer, diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer, the factor by which the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> would be delayed by taking times L/(c-v) & L/(c+v) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer. Therefore, in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted, in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with {{the negative}} experimental result(s). Thus the two-way speed of light remains constant and the round trip propagation time along perpendicular arms of the interferometer is independent of its motion & orientation.|$|E
50|$|The {{bogie frame}} {{has a single}} central cross member which {{supports}} via pivots two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beams</b> (in a 'weighing scale' arrangement) connected to the wheelset via the primary suspension. The cross member supports the vehicle body via the secondary suspension of two outside air springs.|$|R
5000|$|The viaducts were of {{the type}} {{classified}} as Continuous Laminated Beam. There were three <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beams</b> supporting the deck; these were in turn supported by the fans of four raking timbers springing from stone piers.

50|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>beams</b> on the {{underside}} of the bridge deck were relocated in 1992 to increase the possible axle loading available for new generation diesel-electric locomotives to 20 tons. In November 1996 the timber pedestrian footway on the bridge was replaced by a non-slip surface mounted on plywood sheeting.|$|R
50|$|The {{north and}} south sides of the {{building}} have double base courses externally, {{but these are not}} returned across the gables. From the south-east corner, a wall 28 in thick ran down the south scarp of the hill all the way to a ditch which runs in a curve all round castle and hill, passing through the two already mentioned gaps in the kaim. From the existing remains we know that the ground floor of the castle had central pillars caming a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> on which the first floor joists rested, their ends being notched to 3+3/4 in runners supported on corbels (see details). On the upper floor there was a central colonnade, with responds at the ends, supporting either arches or more probably a timber framework to carry the roof. At the west end of the first floor was a fireplace flanked by detached columns with attached moulded caps and bases. Somewhere also at the west end was a neat chimney head with four small outlets for smoke, and if this was really David de Lindsay's stronghold we know from Hugh of Bolbec's description that it had parapet walks round its roof. The existence of parapets is not necessarily confirmed by the presence of several lengths of 12+1/2 in stone channels, but with the blocking up of the loopholes it became almost essential to provide parapets, if only on the turrets.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{optimize}} the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> based on 100 % overlapping rigid barrier (100 % RB) impact and 40 % overlapping offset deformable barrier (40 % ODB) impact. The 100 %RB and 40 %ODB impact FE models were developed in LS-DYNA and validated by using results from crash tests. According to the requirement of crashworthiness, the peak of acceleration of left B-pillar and energy absorbed per unit mass of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> were chosen as optimization objects, and the thicknesses of four parts of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> were considered as the design variables. Furthermore, uniform design was applied to build variable samples. Optimal results were obtained by surrogate model built by Kriging and optimization method NSGA-II (Non-Dominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms-II). The results showed that 100 %RB and 40 %ODB impact should be considered together when <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> was designed. The optimized <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> matches well and effectively improves vehicle crashworthiness...|$|E

40|$|The LHC RF station-beam {{interaction}} strongly {{influences the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> dynamics, both single bunch and collective effects.

Thus, the noise power spectrum of the RF accelerating voltage strongly affects the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> distribution. Furthermore, the coupled-bunch instabilities are also directly affected by the RF components and {{the configuration of the}} Low Level RF (LLRF) feedback loops. In this work we present a formalism relating the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> dynamics with the RF system configurations, an estimation of collective effects stability margins, and an evaluation of longitudinal sensitivity to various LLRF parameters and configurations...|$|E

40|$|The LHC {{operates}} using a 400 MHz SC RF system. A 200 MHz NC RF {{system was}} foreseen in the LHC Design Report to improve beam capture and the bare resonators were manufactured, but never installed. Later the second harmonic RF system was proposed to cure <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> instabilities {{in the absence}} of a dedicated wideband feedback system in the LHC. For nominal intensities the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>beam</b> stability is ensured by controlled emittance blow-up during the acceleration ramp. Recently slow growing instabilities were observed at the end of long fills at 6. 5 TeV as bunches shrink due to synchrotron radiation damping. For High Luminosity LHC twice higher intensities should be kept stable with new equipment installed in the ring. Additional motivations for a second RF system in the LHC have also been considered.

In the thesis we set out the main actions on the bridge and we made static and modal analysis with the computer program Sofistik. We also designed load-bearing elements and their connections. The design {{has been done in}} accordance with the European standard Eurocode, where the National Annex has been taken into consideration. The bridge which we have designed does not exist and we have conceived the load-bearing structure on the basis of already existing similar timber bridges.
