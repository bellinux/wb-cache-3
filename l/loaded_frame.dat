40|$|Column design {{methods for}} {{multi-storey}} frames {{commonly used in}} North America are based upon two nomograms prepared by Julian and Lawrence. The various assumptions behind the equations of these nomograms necessitate a realistic review of the effective column length factor which defines the load carrying capacity of the column. For multi-storey frames subjected to gravity and lateral loads, a theoretical solution based on matrix formulations has been developed. Experiments were done on an aluminum framework designed to verify the behaviour of the multi-storey frame and the columns {{as a part of}} the frame. The behaviour observed for different loading patterns is compared with the theoretical solution using a proportional multiplier of load as parameter. The Southwell plotting technique, is applied to find the critical loads of column members in the <b>loaded</b> <b>frame.</b> Comparisons with the present code are given for interior, exterior and tier columns...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} the recent {{development of the}} semi-rigid connection technique {{and the application of}} this method to the analysis of space frame structure. To carry out the above method of analysis accurately and efficiently, a computer system is presented. The basic concept of the computer program is defined as an assemblage of well-defined subroutines as modules into a package of dealing with such analysis. The computer program takes into account the moment- rotation relationship of five of the most common types of connections. A moment- rotation relationship of a sixth connection type is created in this research work and inserted within the computer program. It is concluded that {{in spite of the fact}} that the amount of different rotation between beam and column is relatively small in the <b>loaded</b> <b>frame</b> structures, this differential rotation has a significant effect on the geometrical behavior of frame structures and consequently on the design of their elements. It has been shown that the consideration of semi-rigid connections in the analysis of frame structures is of great importance...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of frame compliance {{is an essential}} component of instrumented micro- and nanoindentation experiments. In <b>load</b> <b>frames</b> of finite stiffness, the load applied via the indenter induces displacement in both the sample and the <b>load</b> <b>frame.</b> Frame compliance must be identified and subtracted from the total indenter displacement to account properly for sample deformation. Current experimental procedures, in which the frame compliance is inferred from the elastic unloading indentation response of a reference sample, are based on several assumptions and simplifications that can propagate significant uncertainty with respect to subsequent analyses of mechanical behavior of the sample. We outline a new procedure that measures the compliance of the <b>load</b> <b>frame,</b> and identify the effects of load, loading direction, and loading rate on the measured compliance, as well as several possible sources of uncertainty in other available methods of frame compliance determination.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the three-dimensional nonlinear analysis of six 19 -storey steel moment-frame buildings, designed per the 1997 Uniform Building Code, under strong ground motion records from near-source earthquakes with magnitudes {{in the range}} of 6. 7 – 7. 3. Three of these buildings possess a reentrant corner irregularity, while the remaining three possess a torsional plan irregularity. The records create drift demands of the order of 0. 05 and plastic rotation demands of the order of 4 – 5 % of a radian in the buildings with reentrant corners. These values point to performance at or near ‘Collapse Prevention’. Twisting in the torsionally sensitive buildings causes the plastic rotations on the moment frame on one face of the building (4 – 5 % of a radian) to be as high as twice of that on the opposite face (2 – 3 % of a radian). The asymmetric yield pattern implies a lower redundancy in the lateral force-resisting system as the failure of the heavily <b>loaded</b> <b>frame</b> could result in a total loss of resistance to torsion...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a set of finite element analyses (FEAs) carried out to support the development of an integrated design procedure that, based on semi-empirical and analytical methods, is capable of defining generic fuselage sections of a transport aircraft. The procedure, which is implemented in a structural optimization code, defines a structure that, compliant with durability and damage tolerance requirements, is characterized by a post-critical behaviour of the stiffened panels and by a design of the frames that takes the frame flexibility and the presence of the floor beams into account. FEAs, carried out on a reference configuration defined by the optimization code, are used to acquire a deeper knowledge of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the analytical approach in the design of complex structures subjected to realistic load cases. In particular, the influence of the actual frame flexibility on the distribution of the skin shear flow induced by the frame is evaluated; moreover, the effects on the stress distribution in skin and frames, caused by the presence of the stringers, and of the stiffness concentration introduced by the floor beam are addressed. Finite element method results demonstrate the effectiveness of the analytical model of the flexible frame in evaluating the shear flow that a single <b>loaded</b> <b>frame</b> transfers to the skin and highlight the effects of the presence of adjacent loaded frames. By means of geometrically non-linear FEAs, the effects of the stringers on the stress distribution of a pressurized cylinder are evaluated, as well as the magnitude and extension of the perturbation introduced by the floor beams...|$|E
40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} describing the properties of reinforced concrete materials and their interaction. It is therefore necessary to calibrate the mathematical model by accurate testing of laboratory specimens. It can be shown that momentcurvature relationship varies {{along the length of}} a member and at beam-column joints. This behaviour depends critically on the geometry of the joint, reinforcement details and the stress-strain characteristics of concrete and steel. Tests have been carried out on model reinforced concrete portal frames and independent specimens making up the frame to predict their non-linear behaviour. The stiffness of the joint {{plays an important role in}} the response of the complete frame structure. The behaviour of the corner joints is of particular interest because both the strength and ductility differs for opening and closing joints. The loss of stiffness at joints has a significant effect on the inelastic deformations. The non-linear finite element (FE) program developed takes into account the loss of stiffness at joints and the falling branch behaviour of the material stress-strain relationships. Constant, linear, and parabolic variation in flexural rigidity (EI) and axial rigidity (EA) are taken into consideration along the element length. The combined effect of material and geometric non-linearity is considered. The FE program may use either calculated momentcurvature relationship of different elements or the experimental data obtained from tests. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and experimental beam moment-curvature relationships. Horizontally <b>loaded</b> <b>frame</b> analysis, which involves opening and closing joints, shows that ignoring the joint effect over-estimates the strength. In the case of vertically loaded frames, which involves two closing joints, ignoring the joint effects had little or no influence. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and experimental frame force-displacement relationships throughout the loading range providing the change of stiffness at joints is taken into account for horizontally loaded frames...|$|E

Materials and Methods: One hundred and eighty samples were selected. The samples were made cylindrical of size 6 × 8 mm and were divided into six groups as follows with each group consisting of 10 samples. Group 1 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 50 % Portland cement (PMZNPC 50 %) Group 2 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 25 % Portland cement (PMZNPC 25 %) Group 3 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 0 % Portland cement (PMZNPC 0 %) Group 4 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 50 % Portland cement (ZNPC 50 %) Group 5 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 25 % Portland cement (ZNPC 25 %) Group 6 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 0 % Portland cement (ZNPC 0 %) These samples were further subdivided based on time interval and were tested at 1 hour, 24 hours and at 7 th day. After each period of time all the specimens were tested by vertical CVR <b>loaded</b> <b>frame</b> with capacity of 5 tones/ 0473 - 10 kan National Physical laboratory, New Delhi and the results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Scheffe test. Results: Polymer-reinforced cement with 50 % Portland cement, Zinc oxide with 50 % Portland cement, Polymer-reinforced cement with 25 % Portland cement and Zinc oxide with 25 % Portland cement exhibited higher compressive strength when compared to Zinc oxide with 0 % Portland cement and Polymer-reinforced cement with 0 % Portland cement, at different periods of time. The difference between these two groups were statistically significant (P < 0. 05) and it is suggested that mixture of 50 % and 25 % Portland cement in Zinc oxide eugenol and Polymer-modified zinc oxide cement can be used as core build up material and permanent filling material. Conclusion: It is concluded that 50 % and 25 % Portland cement in zinc oxide eugenol and polymer-modified zinc oxide eugenol results in higher compressive strength and hence can be used as permanent filling material and core built-up material...|$|E

The design comprises a double-sided lever, supported on strain-controlled elastic hinges, a binary weight stack of exchange disk design for each direction, mounting accessories for the transducer under test and a counter-torque drive with servo-controller. Compared to conventional types with air bearings and a multitude of several stacks, the chosen design offers distinctive advantages: Higher reliability of the lever support, less complicated auxiliary systems, easier method of operation, low overall height. Calculations show that the parasitic moment of the crossed hour-glass shaped springs for the lever support can be controlled to less than 10 - 5 Nm for a 1 kNm machine, and that the uncertainty of lever length falls within a 20 ppm band, including the equality of both sides.
