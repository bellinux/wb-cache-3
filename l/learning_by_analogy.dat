This method influenced other researchers {{working at the}} same time in the field of reading difficulties. Notable examples include Samuel Orton and Anna Gillingham. The article in the Journal of Educational Research, [...] "The Effect of Kinaesthetic Factors in the Development of Word Recognition in the Case of Non-Readers", outlines five phases of the kinesthetic method. With an emphasis on student choice, focal words are generated by the students during the first stage. Each word is introduced by the teacher who writes it on the chalkboard. The student repeats the word while tracing it on the board. When the student is confident that he knows the word, he attempts to write it while saying each syllable. Successful word study is followed by phase two where sentences are created in a similar fashion. The third step incorporates a student-selected book where words from specific paragraphs are isolated for reading. In the fourth phase, the student is asked to read whole phrases from the paragraphs. Finally, the student is encouraged to do silent reading on his own for the fifth phase. After some time all four boys successfully learned to read well enough to perform at grade level. Follow-ups with the participants reflected the maintenance of reading levels and for some avid readers, additional leaps in reading proficiency. Though not asserting widespread generalizability, Fernald and Keller enumerate several findings. One conclusion of interest today describes each student <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy,</b> demonstrating the [...] "ability to pronounce new words if they resemble words he has already learned." [...] This is a compensatory strategy currently used.Warren's 1977 dissertation study with children exhibiting mild forms of reading problems demonstrated 147% and 77% superior word recognition and comprehension respectively by Fernald tracing compared to Orton-Gillingham phonics, although O-G was 10% more effective in word decoding.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a model of}} learning by analogical reasoning. The model is based on two main ideas, namely, (1) that the analogies used in learning about an unfamiliar domain depend heavily {{on the use of}} previously formed causal abstrac-tions in a familiar or base domain; (2) that these analogies are extended incremenrally to handle related situations. CARL is a computer program that learns about the semantics of assignment statements for the BASIC programming language. It is described as an illustration of causally driven analogical reasoning and learning. The model maps and debugs inferences drawn from several commonly used analogies to assignment in response to presented examples.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{approach}} to skill acquisition {{which is based on}} a technique for inductive program synthesis developed in the domain of automatic programming. This approach enables us to model skill acquisition as generalization on three levels: In a first step, learning by doing is performed by generalizing over problem states which were explored when solving a given problem. This process is similar to compilation or chunking of production rules. But in contrast to these approaches, we represent procedural knowledge as conditional programs. In a second step, descriptive generalization of the initial conditional program is performed. A recursive program scheme is constructed which generalizes over recursive enumerable problem spaces. In a third step, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> is performed by abstracting from the concrete semantic of the operation symbols contained in a recursive program scheme. The abstract scheme represents the class of structurally identical problems. By describing, how problem schemes can be constructed as generalization over knowledge gained during solving concrete problems, our approach gives an unifying framework for describing learning by doing and <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy.</b> Additionally, we consider the acquisition of some types of motor and process control behavior as a special variant of the acquisition of problem solving skills, and demonstrate, how acquisition of behavioral skills can be integrated in our framework...|$|E

40|$|The cyber domain {{presents}} {{a number of}} challenges. Recent worldwide acts of cyber crime stand side to side with ongoing commercial and military espionage and theft of industrial and state secrets, all of which threaten the security and welfare of individuals and nations. As indicated by public reaction to revelations in The Guardian of eavesdropping by security agencies in the U. S. and U. K. on private telephone and internet communications, however, efforts to counter such activities and provide greater individual and state security are strongly opposed in many rights respecting and reasonably democratic societies as constituting an unacceptable infringement of liberty and privacy. In this lecture, Dr George R Lucas Jr, from the Naval Postgraduate School in California, argues {{that some of these}} warnings are somewhat exaggerated. But the need for enhanced cyber security, especially for the protection of individuals and civil infrastructure, is an urgent and still unmet need. Some of the public resistance might be overcome, he suggests, by distinguishing more carefully between individual liberty and privacy as defensible rights, and "anonymity" which offers primarily freedom from accountability and detection.

40|$|Case-based {{reasoning}} is ubiquitous in real-world medical diagnosis, and yet most technology-enhanced medical training systems fail to provide new information {{and training in}} a manner consistent with the way professionals need to later access learned information. Medulator provides an ecologically valid alternative to these systems and also provides the opportunity to optimize learning through application of principles of transfer from the analogical reasoning literature. Analogical reasoning involves comparison of structured information between two cases and allows the reasoner to make inferences about one case (the target) based on prior knowledge of another case (the source). Numerous laboratory studies have suggested conditions that may facilitate transfer via analogy (see 11 - 13 for reviews); however, few of these methods have been evaluated in complex learning environments such as the domain of medicine. In the present study we use Medulator to evaluate two potential methods for the optimization of <b>learning.</b> <b>By</b> definition <b>analogy</b> involves comparison of cases based on structure (i. e., a comparison of the pattern of relations present in each case).

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose the}} concept of {{teaching}} (and <b>learning)</b> unfamiliar visualizations <b>by</b> <b>analogy,</b> that is, demonstrating an unfamiliar visualization method by linking it to another more familiar one, where the in-betweens are designed {{to bridge the gap}} of these two visualizations and explain the difference in a gradual manner. As opposed to a textual description, our morphing explains an unfamiliar visualization through purely visual means. We demonstrate our idea by ways of four visualization pair examples – data table vs. parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix vs. hyperbox, linear chart vs. spiral chart, and pie chart vs. tree map. The analogy is commutative – any member of the pair can be the unfamiliar visualization. A study we conducted suggests that this new paradigm can be an effective teaching tool. We found that for all of the four pairs we studied users could understand the unfamiliar visualization method either fully or at least signifcantly better after they observed or interacted with a series of transitions from the familiar counterpart. Our examples provide good insight how effective visualization pairings can be identified, and we hope that they will inspire other visualizations transformation pairs and associated transition strategies to be identified...|$|R

40|$|Doctor en Ciencias de la Ingeniería, Mención Modelación MatemáticaThis thesis studies a human {{cognitive}} phenomenon called Conceptual Metaphor in {{the context}} of mathematics learning and reasoning. Metaphor enables the understanding of an abstract concept called target, e. g. numbers, in terms of a more concrete concept called source, e. g. piles of can-dies. Often, inferences from the source are carried to the target and applied there yielding some conclusions about the target. This is known as reasoning by analogy. Empirical evidence indicates that metaphor enhances learning. Converging evidence is pro-vided by working scientists who report the use of analogies while developing their theories. On the other hand, some people advise against its usage in education. They argue that politicians and communicators often lead people into erroneous conclusions by using metaphor, and then, analo-gies undermine objective reasoning. This discussion highlights the need for research to shed light into the learning mechanics underlying metaphor in order to understand its scope and limitations. This work presents a formal model of metaphor which {{can be used as a}} framework to study <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy.</b> Since the model is abstract, we use Chapter 1 to make ideas more concrete: we use our formalism for analize deeply a well known example. Along these lines, Chapter 5 presents formalizations of other metaphors frequently encountered in mathematics teaching. The model is built in Chapter 4 where the source and the target of a metaphor are formalized by a key concept named domain. Some results of this chapter are accompanied by cognitive in-terpretations, as for example, Theorems 40, 41, 42, and Proposition 26 can be seen as descriptions of how an analogy carries reasonings from its source to its target. Also, Theorems 30 and 31 sug-gest models for the process of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy.</b> Finally, Chapter 4 presents some theoretical constructions such as products and coproducts of domains. Our metaphor model relates two domains, each one defined as a mixture of language and semantics. Most results of Chapter 4 need the premise that the two involved languages are compatible. Mathematically, they need a map able to preserve the structure determined by a syntactical operation called substitution. This compatibility notion is characterized for the case of language terms in Chapter 2 by applying unification theory and graph theory. And in Chapter 3, this compatibilitynotion is characterized for the case of the language formulas by adapting the methods of Chapter 2. Finally, one Appendix (Relational Spaces) presents another approach to study metaphor. There, domains are defined with semantics only, leaving language aside. Most of the results emphasized above are lost or at least weakened suggesting that the abstract information provided by symbols and the recursion provided by the grammar of the language are necessary to mimic metaphor s behavior. This observation, together with other results of this thesis, might point to a relation between the recursion property of human languages 1 and the ability of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>analogy.</b> 1 The linguist Noam Chomsky claims that recursion is the only human component of the faculty of language [49]...|$|E
