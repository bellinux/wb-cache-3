Thus, the study of a particular stream basin becomes an important tool in order to understanding its dynamics in relation to the land use, in addition to recognizing the existing inter-relationships between the various elements and processes that operate at their limit and characterize their environmental problems. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo mapear as classes de uso e ocupação do solo e seus respectivos conflitos nas Áreas de Preservação Permanente (APPs) da bacia hidrográfica do córrego Barra Seca, localizada no distrito de Guaianás, Pederneiras/SP. A área de estudo situa-se geograficamente entre as coordenadas 48 º 55 ’ 17 ” a 48 º 50 ’ 43 ” de <b>longitude</b> <b>W</b> Gr. e 22 º 23 ’ 40 ” a 22 º 17 ’ 06 ” de latitude S, apresentando uma área de 3937, 59 ha. Para o apoio cartográfico, utilizou-se a carta planialtimétrica em formato digital, editada pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística - IBGE (1973) referente a folha de Agudos (SF- 22 -Z-B-II- 3), em escala 1 : 50. 000. A imagem de satélite, bandas 3, 4 e 5 do satélite Landsat - 5, sensor TM (Thematic Mapper), de 24 de julho de 2011, órbita 221, ponto 75, com resolução espacial de 30 x 30 metros, cedidas pelo Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE). O Sistema de Informações Geográficas (SIG) utilizado foi o IDRISI Selva e o software, o CartaLinx. A realização deste trabalho teve como suporte legal a legislação ambiental, mais especificamente, a Lei Federal nº 12. 651 / 12, com alterações feitas pela Lei Federal nº 12. 727 / 12. Os usos e ocupação do solo da bacia hidrográfica do córrego Barra Seca são mata ciliar, mata, pastagem, reflorestamento, cana-de-açúcar, eucalipto, represa, vias pavimentadas, área urbana, barracões e outros, lazer, outras culturas e cemitério, sendo que os usos mais significantes referem-se a cana-de-açúcar (1960, 29 ha) representando 49, 81 % da área total da bacia, seguido de reflorestamento (1025, 01 ha) e pastagem (405, 63 ha). Quanto as Áreas de Preservação Permanente constatou-se que elas não estão sendo totalmente preservadas conforme a legislação, apenas 93, 57 ha (53, 90 % do total das APPs) estão preservadas. Desta forma, o estudo de uma determinada bacia hidrográfica torna-se uma ferramenta importante para entender sua dinâmica em relação ao uso e ocupação de sua área, além de reconhecer as inter-relações existentes entre os diversos elementos e processos que atuam no seu limite e caracterizar os seus problemas ambientais...|$|E
