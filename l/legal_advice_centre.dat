5000|$|Stephens is {{licensed}} to practise before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council {{and has made}} several legal interventions in the European Court of Human Rights. Stephens {{began his career as}} a volunteer lawyer at ArtLaw, the first <b>legal</b> <b>advice</b> <b>centre</b> for artists, having been interested from an early age as his father was an artist. In 1982 he became the legal director of ArtLaw, a position he held until 1984. In 1983, with Roslyn Innocent, he established Stephens Innocent as a law firm to specialise in visual arts and intellectual property. In 1987, Stephens met Geoffrey Robertson, who along with John Hendy he admires as [...] "creative lawyers", and the pair went on to successfully represent Bob Monkhouse who had been [...] "charged with defrauding film distributors in relation to a film and television archive". In the same year, he defended the American artist J. S. G. Boggs who had been arraigned before The Old Bailey on charges under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 in relation to his painted and drawn artworks which mimicked and adapted bank note designs. According to an article in the Law Gazette in 1992, the case was influential in launching his career. He realised that the case against Boggs was strong, so decided to make the Bank of England [...] "look as stupid as possible" [...] using the media as a tool, and in the end successfully defended the artist. Following this case he represented several other artists and art dealers in cases over freedom of expression, including an art gallery that was displaying earrings made by Rick Gibson from human foetuses. He also advised Robert Mapplethorpe on displaying his images in the UK. In February 1991, Stephens was acting as a solicitor for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), when John Hendy, Geoffrey Robertson and two other QCs defended Arthur Scargill and Peter Heathfield against claims that they had handled funds inappropriately during the miner's strike of 1984-85. In 1992 he worked on a case brought by the NUM against the government which saw an earlier decision to close 31 coal mines, overturned after it was deemed unlawful.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{outcomes}} of survey research conducted between March-September 2007 into the experiences of 554 workers and jobseekers after {{the introduction of the}} WorkChoices legislative amendments. The sample was drawn from a Victoria-wide data base of approximately 12, 000 callers to a community <b>legal</b> <b>advice</b> <b>centre,</b> JobWatch Inc. Survey data were supplemented with qualitative data from 30 focus group participants in Melbourne and a regional centre. Over a quarter of survey respondents had experienced a change in their employment arrangements, with a significant shift towards more individualised arrangements. Within this, there were some pay and conditions changes, with base pay rates increasing and working hours also generally increasing. However, the most significant findings relate to a heightened sense of job insecurity, fear of speaking up at work and general dissatisfaction with work culture and WorkChoices. There were strong indications that workers now had less choice in their working arrangements, and any employment changes had largely been driven by employers or the labour market environment...|$|E
