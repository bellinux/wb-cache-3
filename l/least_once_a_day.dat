He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First English Civil War led to a complete suspension of legal education, and from November 1642 until July 1644 no Pension meetings were held. Only 43 students were admitted during the four years of the war, and none were called to the Bar. Meetings of Pension resumed after the Battle of Marston Moor but the education system remained dormant. Although Readers were appointed, none read, and no moots were held. In 1646, {{after the end of}} the war, there was an attempt to restore the old system of readings and moots, and in 1647 an order was made that students were required to moot at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> This failed to work, with Readers refusing to read, and the old system of legal education completely died out.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd of}} people {{assembled}} below the balcony generally consisted of soldiers, merchants, craft persons, peasants, and women and sick children. As the balcony was set high, the king would stand on a platform so that people gathered below could reassure themselves that he was alive and that the empire was stable; even when the sovereign was ill. He {{felt that it was}} necessary to see them publicly at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> in order to maintain his control, and guard against immediate anarchy. It also had a symbolic purpose. During this time people might make personal requests directly to Akbar, or present him with petitions for some cause. Akbar, therefore, began appearing at the jharokha twice a day and would hear the complaints of the people who wished to speak to him. Sometimes, while the emperor gave his Jharokha Darshan, he would let out a thread down the jharokha so that people could tie their complaints and petitions seeking his attention and justice. It was an effective way of communication and information exchange process, which Badauni, a contemporary of Akbar noted Jharokha Darshan worked effectively under Akbar who spent about four and half hours regularly in such darshan. Akbar's paintings giving Jharokha Darshan are also popular.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The use and {{combined}} use of psychotropic {{drugs and alcohol}} among older adults is a growing public health concern and should be constantly monitored. Relevant studies are scarce in Germany. Using data {{of the most recent}} national health survey, we analyse prevalence and correlates of psychotropic drug and alcohol use among this population. Methods: Study participants were people aged 60 – 79  years (N= 2508) of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults 2008 – 2011. Medicines used during the last 7  days were documented. Psychotropic drugs were defined as medicines acting on the nervous system (ATC code N 00) excluding anaesthetics (N 01), analgesics/antipyretics (N 02 B), but including opiate codeines used as antitussives (R 05 D). Alcohol consumption in the preceding 12  months was measured by frequency (drinking any alcohol-containing beverages at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> week/a <b>day)</b> and quantity (alcohol consumed in grams/day; cut-offs: 10 / 20  g/day for women/men defining moderate and risky drinking). SPSS complex sample module was used for analysis. Results: 21. 4 % of study participants use psychotropic medications, 66. 9 % consume alcohol moderately and 17. 0 % riskily, 51. 0 % drink alcohol at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> week and 18. 4 % daily, 2. 8 % use psychotropic drugs combined with daily alcohol drinking. Among psychotropic drug users, 62. 7 % consume alcohol moderately, 14. 2 % riskily. The most frequently used psychotropic medications are antidepressants (7. 9 %) and antidementia (4. 2 %). Factors associated with a higher rate of psychotropic drug use are female sex, worse health status, certified disability and polypharmacy. Risky alcohol consumption is positively associated with male sex, smoking, upper social class, better health status, having no disability and not living alone. Conclusions: Despite the high risk of synergetic effects of psychotropic drugs and alcohol, a substantial part of older psychotropic drug users consume alcohol riskily and daily. Health professionals should talk about the additional health risks of alcohol consumption when prescribing psychotropic drugs to older adults...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: TREATMEN The {{contribution}} of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) to refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains unknown. When EoE and GERD overlap, the clinical, endoscopic and histological findings are nonspecific and {{cannot be used}} {{to distinguish between the}} two disorders. Limited data are available on this topic, and the interaction between EoE and GERD is a matter of debate. AIM: We have conducted a prospective study of adult patients with refractory GERD to evaluate the overlap of reflux and EoE. METHODS: Between July 2006 and June 2008, we consecutively and prospectively enrolled 130 male and female patients aged 18 to 70 years old who experienced persistent heartburn and/or regurgitation more than twice a week over the last 30 days while undergoing at least six consecutive weeks of omeprazole treatment (at <b>least</b> 40 mg <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>day).</b> The patients underwent an upper digestive endoscopy with esophageal biopsy, and intraepithelial eosinophils were counted after hematoxylin/eosin staining. The diagnosis of EoE was based on the presence of 20 or more eosinophils per high-power field (eo/HPF) in esophageal biopsies. RESULTS: Among the 103 studied patients, 79 (76. 7 %) were females. The patients had a mean age of 45. 5 years and a median age of 47 years. Endoscopy was normal in 83. 5 % of patients, and erosive esophagitis was found in 12. 6 %. Only one patient presented lesions suggestive of EoE. Histological examination revealed > 20 eo/HPF in this patient. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated a low prevalence of EoE among patients with refractory GERD undergoing omeprazole treatment...|$|R

40|$|The life {{histories}} of 429 individual epidermal keratinocyte clones picked at random were studied. Individual basal keratinocytes {{were derived from}} asynchronous rapidly proliferating subconfluent cultures propagated in either a low calcium (0. 1 mM) or a high calcium (2 mM) serum-free medium. Single-celled clones were isolated by seeding trypsin-EDTA dissociated cells into a Petri dish containing cloning chips. Chips with only one cell per chip were transferred into dishes containing either low calcium or high calcium growth factor replete serum-free medium. Clone formation was monitored microscopically {{and the number of}} cells in each colony tallied at least twice daily for further analysis. A total of 369 clones were established from seven different neonatal foreskin cell strains (A-F), and 60 clones were derived from one adult human skin cell strain (G). During a five-day culture interval, among 32 clones of strain A, 83 % divided at <b>least</b> <b>once,</b> 50 % divided once in 24 hours, 86 % divided at least three times within three days, and more than 50 % divided at least four to five times in five days. Of 231 clones amongst the other five cell strains (B-F), an average of 63 % (± 12 S,E) divided more than three times in <b>an</b> eight <b>day</b> period, the remainder divided either once, twice or not at all. Of the 106 clones of strain G, reared in high calcium serum-free medium, 67 % divided more than three times in a six-day period, and 55 % divided five or more times in 6 days. Clones derived from adult skin strain H had a lower clone forming potential with 70 % dividing at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> in seven days, and only 30 % dividing three or more times. By contrast, the average generation time (AvGT) for second and third passage keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskin cultures was 24 hrs. Detailed dendrograms were constructed for many of the proliferating clones. The majority of clones expressed a synblastic division pattern with every cell dividing at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> per <b>day.</b> <b>A</b> fraction of clones either exceeded this circadian division rate or displayed a biphasic division pattern with all cells initially dividing <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and then abruptly slowing to once every other <b>day</b> or to <b>an</b> intermediate rate. A minority of clones was committed to a few terminal divisions. The division patterns of the non-synblastic clones fit an alternating bifurcated branching mode of clonal expansion expressed by the Fibonacci sequence for numbers of accumulated cells per clone per day.

40|$|Introduction Cystic {{fibrosis}} is {{a common}} recessive disorder primarily affecting the lungs and often resulting in pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tobramycin is currently used to prevent the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, it has a narrow therapeutic index and requires extensive monitoring. The {{aim of this study}} was to review the current practice in administration and monitoring of once daily tobramycin in paediatric cystic fibrosis patients at Birmingham Children’s Hospital (BCH). Materials & Methods Design: Analysis of forty-nine once daily tobramycin courses in fifteen patients (five male; ten female) during 2010. Setting: Birmingham Children’s Hospital, UK. Main outcome measures: Patient height and weight, dosage and time of administration, drug plasma levels, urea and electrolyte levels. Results: Once daily tobramycin was administered at a mean dose of 9. 94 mg/kg (n = 49, range 8. 8 – 11. 0 mg/kg) which is consistent with current BCH guidelines. At least one trough level was observed for every course (mean = 1. 33; n = 49). Trough levels greater than 1 mg/L were found in 17 % (n = 11 / 65) of samples. Tobramycin was administered between 15 : 00 and 21 : 00 in 75 % (n = 30 / 40) of courses, with a further 23 % (n = 9 / 40) of courses being administered after 21 : 00. Only 39 % (n = 19 / 49) of courses had urea and electrolyte levels monitored conflicting with current practice elsewhere in the UK. Furthermore, no patients underwent any routine monitoring for ototoxicity. Discussions, Conclusion: The use and associated monitoring of once daily tobramycin varies within the UK. Current practice at BCH with regard to the dosing of once daily tobramycin and the timing of the first trough level are consistent with available guidelines. However an increase in the frequency of renal monitoring is recommended considering national practice as urea and creatinine levels should be taken at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> within <b>a</b> fourteen <b>day</b> course. Furthermore, <b>a</b> proportion of courses were administered after 21 : 00 which, due to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, may result in an increased risk of toxic effects.
