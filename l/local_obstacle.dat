40|$|Many {{applications}} require {{continuous monitoring}} of {{a moving target}} by a controllable vision system. Although the goal of tracking objects is not new, traditional techniques usually ignore the presence of obstacles and focus on imaging and target recognition issues. For a target moving among obstacles, the goal of tracking involves a complex motion problem: a controllable observer (e. g., a robot) must anticipate that the target may become occluded by an obstacle and move to prevent such an event from occurring. This paper describes a strategy for computing the motions of a mobile robot operating in a 2 -D workspace without prior knowledge of the target's intention or the distribution of obstacles in the scene. The proposed algorithm governs {{the motion of the}} observer based on current measurements of the target's position and the location of the <b>local</b> <b>obstacles.</b> The approach is combinatorial {{in the sense that the}} algorithm explicitly computes a description of the geometric arrangement between the target and the observer's visibility region produced by the <b>local</b> <b>obstacles.</b> The algorithm computes a continuous control law based on this description.

40|$|The Lane-Curvature Method (LCM) {{presented}} in this paper is a new <b>local</b> <b>obstacle</b> avoidance method for indoor mobile robots. The method combines the Curvature-Velocity Method (CVM) with a new directional method called the Lane Method. The lane method divides the environment into lanes, and then chooses the best lane to follow to optimize travel along a desired heading. A local heading is then calculated for entering and following the best lane, and CVM uses this heading to determine the optimal translational and rotational velocities, considering the heading direction, physical limitations, and environmental constraints. By combining both directional and velocity space methods, LCM yields safe collision-free motion as well as smooth motion taking the dynamics of the robot into account.

The controller combines reactive obstacle avoidance with global path replanning, enabling collision-free navigation along a preplanned path.

Global path replanning is performed to circumvent obstacles which cannot be avoided locally.
