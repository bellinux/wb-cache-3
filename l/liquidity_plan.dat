40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} how small service firms can improve profitability and if growth is a solution or not. Problems discussed and solutions provided will hopefully serve well to highlight points of improvement for small service firms, especially where the owners are inexperienced in business, marketing and entrepreneurship. The study is conducted {{with the aim of}} providing realistic solutions for The Norwegian Imago Institute. In the process, eight people with great insight and experience were interviewed in Norway, Sweden and Denmark and a survey sent to 250 people with 11 respondents. The paper concludes that previous experience with employment is often necessary to succeed with employment growth. However, other forms of growth proved to have great potential. In order to become more profitable, there is no magic pill. What increases the odds of success is writing a business and <b>liquidity</b> <b>plan,</b> knowing exactly what and where you want to go, innovative thinking about marketing, PR and standardization of services. The implication for small service firms that lack experience in business, marketing and entrepreneurship is mostly a realization that they have to change their view on profitability from thinking it’s a evil phenomenon of the information age to the fact that having healthy profitability might actually improve the service and experience. It is possible to deliver a personalized, intimate and great product, and still make great profits...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} based on the {{internship}} activities I performed at Robert Bosch Benelux (RBBN), from 26 th September 2016 to 31 st March 2017. This firm is one of the regional organization of Robert Bosch GmbH. Robert Bosch GmbH is a private multinational company engaged in the development of engineering and electronics product. The Bosch Group is composed of four major business sectors, named mobility solutions, industrial technology, consumer goods and energy and building technology. Bosch Group desires to enrich the quality of life with solutions that are both innovative and beneficial. The company concentrates their core competencies in automotive and industrial technologies. Bosch is also contributing in the production of products and services for professional and private use. My exposure at Bosch proved to be extremely fruitful. I gained valuable cultural, practical and professional experience. In my role as an assistant controller, my financial expertise developed exponentially. I am a quick learner thus I adapted to the changing needs of the controlling and finance department with perfect ease. I learnt the importance of deadlines, teamwork and effectively coordinating in a fast-paced environment. This traineeship resulted in providing me with a platform to advance my professional prospects. This report attempts to fulfil one specific requirement of Robert Bosch Benelux, which was with regards to <b>liquidity</b> <b>planning.</b> <b>Liquidity</b> <b>planning</b> is essential for the survival and prosperity of any business and it is the foremost gauge of a company’s financial health. The significance of cash flow in business is often compared to the human anatomy and its constant need for oxygen. Therefore to gain enhanced understanding of its cash flow Robert Bosch Benelux provided me with an opportunity to devise a cash flow forecasting methodology. My foremost contribution towards this project was the development of new forecasting strategy for the core cash flows of Robert Bosch Benelux. I developed distinctive forecasting strategy to estimate forecasted account receivables, account payables, salaries, payroll taxes and value added tax. The old forecasting methodology was completely discarded {{due to the fact that}} new forecasting methodology was superior. I arrived at this conclusion after a comparison of the old and new methodology, proven through a percentage forecast error formula. In conclusion, the new methodology presented significantly improved results, relatively to the old forecasting methodology at Bosch...|$|R

Management has demonstrated it has the necessary controls, procedures, and resources to effectively manage risks. Interest rate risk and liquidity risk management are integrated into the credit union's organization and planning to promote sound decisions.

40|$|Based on the {{decision}} of the Monetary Council of 6 September 2010, the MNB began publishing its HUF liquidity forecast. The central bank has been preparing forecasts on the liquidity of the banking system for internal use for a long time, but from now on it will share these with market participants on a weekly basis, before the MNB bond auction on Tuesday. With this publication, the central bank tries to ensure – by supporting the <b>liquidity</b> <b>planning</b> of credit institutions – that the volume of the base instrument, the two-week MNB bond is as close to the ideal quantity as possible, i. e. to reduce the reliance of participants on the availability of the overnight loans and deposits of the central bank. The latter may divert the market interest rates from the level close to the base rate of the central bank. Publication may also reduce the uncertainty of liquidity managers in the banking system and encourage them to use the interbank markets more actively. The MNB’s information advantage, which {{is the result of the}} existing institutional relations and the greater resources than those of the market actors, is another factor supporting the publication of the forecast. Although the central bank’s forecast cannot project the HUF liquidity of the banking system accurately, it still contains a considerable amount of additional information for credit institutions. With this publication, the MNB will disclose, at 10 o’clock on Tuesdays, before to the central bank bond auction, the average inter-bank HUF liquidity expected over the next week based on Tuesday. central bank balance sheet, autonomous factors, interbank deposit market, forecast of liquidity factors, demand on cash, central bank profit...|$|R

This trend has mainly been initiated by financial intermediaries and listed firms themselves, without any regulatory pressure. In this paper we ask why firms {{are willing to pay}} to improve the secondary market liquidity of its shares. We show that a contributing factor in this decision is the likelihood that the firm will interact with the capital markets in the near future, either because they have capital needs, or that they are planning to repurchase shares. We also find some evidence of agency costs, managers desiring good <b>liquidity</b> when they <b>plan</b> insider trades.

40|$|The {{failure of}} Collor Plan in {{stabilizing}} the Brazilian economy, in March 1990, is a neglected area in Brazilian economics. The liquidity blockade involving {{the majority of}} financial assets reduced inflation rates substantially, from 70 % per month to 10 % per month, but it rose again gradually to almost 20 % per month in December. The return to high inflation was attributed to the government’s inability to manage a controlled lifting of the blockade, due to political and social pressure, {{as well as to}} some errors in the program implementation. This interpretation leads to the hypothesis that the liquidity blockade could have been successful if had it been correctly implemented and managed. This article argues the opposite thesis that the blockade failed because implementation was in fact impossible. Maintaining the strict imposition of the blockade rules would have paralysed the payment system and precipitated a very serious banking crisis.

40|$|Owing to the agentification of the Government Housing Loan Corporation, Japanese private {{financial}} institutions are now developing long-term fixed-rate loans. In {{order to reduce}} the risk of yielding mismatches between asset and liability, {{financial institutions}} will sell out their loans by securitization instead of holding loans themselves. Mortgage backed security (MBS) is a product of mortgage securitization, which is issued backed by the repayment cash flow from a loan pool consisting of many mortgage loans. In mortgage loans, borrowers are basically allowed to make prepayment. Repayment cash flow from a loan pool changes due to the prepayment. So there is a prepayment riskin MBS, which means that investors cannot invest excessive <b>liquidity</b> in a <b>planned</b> yield or duration when prepayment occurs faster than forecast. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO) is a form of MBS, in which repayment cash flow from a loan pool is reorganized and bonds with various risks are issued. In this paper, we propose a method of designing CMO with PAC-Companion structure. We divide repayment cash flow, which is unstable due to uncertainty of prepayment, into two parts; a part in which principal repayment schedule must be satisfied (planned amortization class, PAC) and an unstable high-prepayment riskpar...|$|R
40|$|Workable {{financial}} {{mechanisms are}} essential to abate greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, which contributes {{a large proportion of}} total global emissions, must be avoided as an effective emissionsreduction tactic, and to alleviate biodiversity loss and poverty. However, incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) have had mixed and suboptimal success because of opportunity costs and administrative and technical issues, in particular, leakage, permanence, and additionality. We show that these latter concepts can be ambiguous, potentially contrived and in some cases, generate perverse outcomes. Encumbering avoided-deforestation projects with these administrative shackles risks massive increases in global deforestation and a concomitant loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services and emissions-reduction opportunities. We offer a solution built on a proven insurance-based hedging principle, a concept we call iREDD, that could indirectly address specific technical and administrative challenges, whether real or contrived. Project-specific iREDD insurance policies and premiums would be negotiated upfront using a simple assessment of risk based on governance quality, the integrity of management <b>plans,</b> <b>liquidity,</b> monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and political acceptability. iREDD acts as both an incentive for prudent forest management given the seller’s potential financial windfall if forests are diligently managed, and guarantees not to disenfranchise the buyer.
