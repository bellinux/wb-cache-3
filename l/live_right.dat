5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People <b>live</b> <b>right</b> next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E
25|$|Cetaceans were {{historically}} abundant {{around the}} island as commercial hunts on the island was operating until 1956. Today, numbers of larger whales have disappeared, but even today many species such humpback whale, minke whale, sei whale, and dolphins can be observed close to shore, and scientific surveys have been conducted regularly. Southern right whales were once regular migrants to Norfolk, but were severely depleted by historical hunts, and further by recent illegal Soviet and Japanese whaling, resulting in none or very few, if remnants still <b>live,</b> <b>right</b> whales in these regions along with Lord Howe Island.|$|E
25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to <b>live</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sent Scottish {{immigrant}} Ebenezer Bryce and {{his wife}} Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley because they thought his carpentry skills would be useful in the area. The Bryce family chose to <b>live</b> <b>right</b> below Bryce Canyon Amphitheater. Bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders, and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a [...] "helluva place to lose a cow." [...] He also built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber, and a canal to irrigate his crops and water his animals. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place [...] "Bryce's canyon", which was later formalized into Bryce Canyon.|$|E
500|$|The song's pop and sing-along {{sound and}} {{production}} received praise by critics. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune described the song's production as [...] "predictable" [...] and opined {{that the audience}} sing-along chorus sounded like it was created specifically for being performed during an arena encore. Similarly, Nathan S. of the website DJ Booth wrote that the song was suitable for [...] "ecstatic" [...] fans to sing along without efforts during a stadium concert: [...] "This {{is the kind of}} chorus that's going to be sung at full force in traffic jams for months to come, and while XO may be relatively more subdued, that call and response is destined to be a monster when performed <b>live,</b> <b>right</b> down to the way her voice shows a little wear, just like it would {{at the end of a}} show." [...] Jody Rosen writing for Vulture found a [...] "cavernous widescreen" [...] anthemic pop sound in the song further saying that its chorus sounded like it was specifically made for an Olympics opening ceremony. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork described the song as a [...] "stadium-filling" [...] one and classified it as one of Beyoncés [...] "decorous moments". Joe Lynch from Fuse described [...] "XO" [...] as the [...] "most uplifting" [...] pop song since Florence and the Machine's [...] "Shake It Out" [...] (2011). He praised the electronic flourishes, saying that they managed to [...] "keep the music from veering into banal territory" [...] and concluded that the song has a [...] "quirky" [...] sound previously unheard on other material by Beyoncé. Philip Sherburne of Spin found [...] "zero-G bounce... which, purely in terms of sonics, makes the most compelling argument for space tourism I have yet to come across".|$|E
