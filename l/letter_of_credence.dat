500|$|In May and June 1939, the King and Queen toured Canada and the United States. From Ottawa, {{they were}} {{accompanied}} throughout by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, to present themselves in North America as King and Queen of Canada. George {{was the first}} reigning monarch of Canada to visit North America, although {{he had been to}} Canada previously as Prince Albert and as Duke of York. Both Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir and Mackenzie King hoped that the King's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the Statute of Westminster 1931, which gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions. On 19 May, George VI personally accepted and approved the <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credence</b> of the new U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Daniel Calhoun Roper; gave Royal Assent to nine parliamentary bills; and ratified two international treaties with the Great Seal of Canada. The official royal tour historian, Gustave Lanctot, wrote [...] "the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality" [...] and George gave a speech emphasising [...] "the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth".|$|E
500|$|So began {{what has}} been called one of the most brazen {{confidence}} tricks in history—the Poyais scheme. MacGregor devised a tricameral parliament and other convoluted constitutional arrangements for Poyais, drew up commercial and banking mechanisms, and designed distinctive uniforms for each regiment of the Poyaisian Army. His imaginary country had an honours system, landed titles, a coat of arms—doubly supported by Poyers and unicorns—and the same Green Cross flag he had used in Florida. By the end of 1821 Major William John Richardson had not only accepted MacGregor's fantasy as true but become an active ally, providing his attractive estate at Oak Hall, Wanstead to be a British base for the supposed Poyaisian royal family. MacGregor gave Richardson the Order of the Green Cross, commissioned him into the Poyaisian [...] "Royal Regiment of Horse Guards" [...] and appointed him chargé d'affaires of the Poyaisian legation at Dowgate Hill in the City of London—the top representative of Poyais in Britain. Richardson's <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> from [...] "Gregor the First, Sovereign Prince of the State of Poyais" [...] was presented to George IV. MacGregor had Poyaisian offices set up in London, Edinburgh and Glasgow to sell impressive-looking land certificates—initially hand-written, but later printed—to the general public, and to co-ordinate prospective emigrants.|$|E

60|$|For {{some time}} Columbus {{remained}} in this anxious and perplexed state of mind, uncertain what line of conduct to pursue in so singular and unlooked-for a conjuncture. He was soon {{brought to a}} decision. Francisco Velasquez, deputy treasurer, and Juan de Trasierra, a Franciscan friar, arrived at Bonao, and delivered to him the royal <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence,</b> signed by the sovereigns on the 26th of May, 1499, commanding him to give implicit faith and obedience to Bobadilla; and they delivered, at the same time, a summons from the latter to appear immediately before him.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} day, various societies {{and a large}} body of citizens waited upon him with addresses, recalling with gratitude the aid given by France in the achievement of American independence, and extolling and rejoicing in the success of the arms of the French republic. On the same day, before Genet had presented his credentials and been acknowledged by the President, he was invited to a grand republican dinner, [...] "at which," [...] we are told, [...] "the company united in singing the Marseilles Hymn." [...] On the 18th of May, Genet presented his <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> to the President: by whom, notwithstanding his late unwarrantable proceedings at Charleston, he was well received.
