5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in <b>literary</b> <b>history,</b> is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E
40|$|<b>Literary</b> <b>histories</b> play {{a crucial}} role in the construction, maintenance, and {{enforcement}} of literary canons. In some academic quarters, <b>literary</b> <b>histories</b> have come to be thought of as the tanks deployed in the canon wars, forces acting to suppress awareness of the vitality of local, regional, and minority literatures, and even of the national literatures of postcolonial countries. The canon-as represented in <b>literary</b> <b>histories,</b> conservative anthologies, official prizes, traditionally designed university English courses, and other cultural apparatuses- is the bulwark resisted by younger writers, women writers, writers of color, gay, lesbian, aboriginal, and experimental writers. <b>Literary</b> <b>histories</b> themselves, however, can play a very subversive role in cultural construction...|$|R

40|$|New Historicism and {{cultural}} history {{have opened up}} the new approaches to writing histories.

5|$|Igbo Landing (alternatively {{written as}} Ibo Landing, Ebo Landing, or Ebos Landing) is a {{historic}} site at Dunbar Creek on St. Simons Island, Glynn County, Georgia. It was the setting of a mass suicide in 1803 by captive Igbo people who had taken control of their slave ship and refused to submit to slavery in the United States. The event's moral value as a story of resistance towards slavery has symbolic importance in African American folklore and <b>literary</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} to <b>literary</b> <b>history</b> were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The Wrath of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended meaning in The Wrath of Khan) is death, Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E
5|$|As {{literary}} studies {{developed into a}} discipline {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of <b>literary</b> <b>history,</b> Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld still did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman—one who was angry, one who resisted the gender roles of her time, and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E

50|$|In The Literary in Theory (2007) Culler {{discusses}} {{the notion of}} Theory and <b>literary</b> <b>history’s</b> role in the larger realm of literary and cultural theory.

50|$|The {{catalogues}} are {{a valuable}} source to researchers today, {{because they often}} give dates of the publication processes and information about working titles that were eventually dropped.

5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in <b>literary</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

In Vechea organizare fiscală a Principatelor Române până la Regulamentul Organic ("On the Ancient Fiscal Order of the Romanian Principalities to Regulamentul Organic"), he discussed {{the proliferation of}} state taxes over the centuries, and the measure to which the Orthodox clergy was exempted. A fourth book, on <b>literary</b> <b>history,</b> saw print with the title Cărți vechi privitoare la români ("Old Books Relating to the Romanians"). Also in 1935, he released a selection of his memoirs, as Câteva amintiri ("Some Recollections"), and set in print his conferences for the state Radio Company: Dezvoltarea politică a României moderne ("The Political Development of Modern Romania"). Building on his previous research in Arhiva Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, Filitti also contributed {{an article about the}} Romanian origins of French diplomat Maurice Paléologue (Adevărul daily, September 29, 1935) and edited for print the letters of Oltenian engineer Petrache Poenaru (Arhivele Olteniei, 74-76/1934).|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{national}} and transnational <b>literary</b> <b>histories</b> {{have continued to}} take different approaches. The typical new national <b>literary</b> <b>histories</b> have discarded the teleology of grand narratives by chopping up the chronological line into individual essays on specific subjects, each attached to a single date. They compensate for the temporal disintegration with a cultural broadening of literature’s scope and occasional international references. The transnational counter trend has been producing regional histories (of Latin America, East-Central Europe, the Iberian Peninsula and Scandinavia), a history of literature in the European languages sponsored by the ICLA, and schemes for global approaches. Moving towards globalization poses the problem of coordinating vast and divergent empirical information. Two suggestions may help moving towards global perspectives: 1) replace the traditional period concepts with landmarks based on {{the introduction of new}} writing technologies, and 2) conceive of <b>literary</b> and cultural <b>history</b> as a sequence of adaptations. The latter may offer opportunities to interlink culture and biology...|$|R
