Certain disabilities of children are not only innate cognitive characteristics, but also other contextual reasons such as: lack of experience in a specific learning context, previous knowledge deficit, <b>lack</b> of <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> and transferable strategies operation, all of them due to the <b>lack</b> of <b>appropriate</b> mediation. It all started from the idea that applying the Instrumental Enrichment Program will achieve significant changes in neuropsychological development of children with mental disabilities, developing their cognitive functions and inner motivation, managing to improve their ability to deal with real life problems...|$|R
40|$|As prior {{empirical}} {{and conceptual}} work indicates, success and usability of web information systems {{is subject to}} navigational design. Although web information systems are not a new phenomenon and were examined intensively in the past, holistic in-depth investigations of navigational issues seem to be arbitrary rather than theoretically and conceptually founded. In particular, we argue that we are <b>lacking</b> an <b>appropriate</b> description <b>language</b> serving as a shared conceptualization of our subject of research. We present a conceptual framework for describing and assessing web information systems and their navigational capabilities. Moreover, we provide some empirical evidence of its applicability by reporting on a case study that pays special regard to navigational design and usability improvement...|$|R

This approach addresses the <b>lack</b> of an <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> for specifying transformations of hypermedia networks in known methodologies to hypermedia development. 1 Introduction This paper reports about on-going {{research on the}} specification of hypermedia application dynamics by means of graph-grammars. The term hypermedia combines the terms hyper-text, indicating a collection of documents with references between them, which is navigable by means of appropriate browser software, and multi-media, indicating a document that, besides text, can contain images, sound, movies, and so on. A hypermedia application contains a collection of multimedia documents (nodes), with navigable crossreferences (links) between them (see e. g. [MSHR 98] for a thorough discussion on the topic). We call such collections hyperwebs or hypermedia networks, and a typical example thereof is the wor [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Context and motivation] The {{increasing}} demand of software systems to process and manage sensitive information {{has led to}} the need that software systems should comply with relevant laws and regulations, which enforce the privacy and other aspects of the stored information. [Question/problem] However, the task is challenging because concepts and terminology used for requirements engineering are mostly different to those used in the legal domain and there is a <b>lack</b> of <b>appropriate</b> modelling <b>languages</b> and techniques to support such activities. [Principal ideas/results] The legislation need to be analysed and align with the system requirements. [Contribution] This paper motivates the need to introduce a framework to assist the elicitation and management of security and privacy requirements from relevant legislation and it briefly presents the foundations of such a framework along with an example...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} adoption of parallel operations in contemporary CPU designs, their use has been restricted by a <b>lack</b> of <b>appropriate</b> programming <b>language</b> abstractions and development environments. To fully exploit the SIMD model of computation such operations offer, programmers depend on CPU specific machine code or implementation dependent libraries. Vector Pascal is a language designed {{to enable the}} elegant and efficient expression of SIMD algorithms. It imports into Pascal abstraction mechanisms derived from functional languages, in turn having their origins in APL. In particular, it extends all operators to work on vectors of data. The type system is also extended to handle pixels and dimensional analysis. Code generation is via the ILCG system that allows retargeting to multiple different SIMD instruction sets based on formalised descriptions of the instruction set semantics...|$|R
40|$|In what follows, I {{provide some}} {{tentative}} suggestions {{as to how}} informal systems can be integrated into existing methodological norms of film industry analysis. The ideas below were hatched over several years as I worked {{on a book about}} informal distribution circuits. [2] I started out wanting {{to know more about the}} diverse ways in which movies circulate, both on and off the books. Intrigued by the enormous range of titles in street markets and on Bit Torrent servers, I was curious as to why such complex and dynamic distribution systems surface in film industry literature only as policy problems or anti-capitalist resistances. It struck me that we <b>lack</b> an <b>appropriate</b> analytical <b>language</b> for talking about informal distribution, so I set about trying to come up with one. The present essay is a reflection on some of the methodological problems that arose from this project. Many questions are posed and relatively few will be answered. I hope nonetheless that the discussion will be of interest to researchers concerned with how to adapt media industry analysis to encompass informal practices...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} Thai science students’ {{experiences}} in writing their master’s dissertations in English in a Thai university. Situated in an interpretive, qualitative case study design, the study implements {{a theoretical framework}} drawing on the notions of communities of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) and imagined communities and investment (Norton, 2000, 2001). The research participants were five master’s students and their paired dissertation supervisors recruited from three master’s programmes in science disciplines where the medium of instruction was Thai. The students, however, wrote their dissertations in English. Data were derived from questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, collaborative conversations, writing samples, and documents produced by the university. The findings revealed that the students’ preference for writing their dissertations in English encompassed their negotiation and shaping of their social identities and investment in their communities of practice. The students reported that they put {{a great deal of}} effort into preparing themselves to cope with the perceived linguistic demands of dissertation writing. However, they perceived that their preparation, to a certain extent, was unsuccessful, attributing this to the university’s <b>lack</b> of <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> support and their unfamiliarity with autonomous language learning. The students’ negotiation with the demands of writing their dissertations during the writing-up stage reflected their multidimensional engagement in different literate activities of their communities of practice. This included making use of authoritative written artefacts, accommodating their supervisors’ expectations, and developing a linguistic repertoire through interacting with other members of their communities, particularly those from their local, immediate, interactive communities of practice. This study articulates the various needs in understanding dissertation writing practices and other interconnected academic literacy practices as socially and ideologically constructed in a local, immediate milieu. The study also provides EAP practitioners with pedagogical implications for planning, preparing and delivering dissertation writing support for science postgraduate students. It also suggests that dissertation supervisors should initiate an open dialogue with their students during the supervision process and engage in collegial discussions with their colleagues in order to co-construct effective supervision practices.

40|$|Newcomers {{settling}} in Flanders experience a strong contract between the standard language advocated in policy and {{education on the}} one hand and the multitude of non-standard language use and other languages they encounter in daily interaction on the other hand: (1) 	Flemish integration and language-in-education policy documents propagate Standard Dutch as the only acceptable language variety. In line with a European trend (Pulinx e. a. 2014), mastering the national language is increasingly considered to be a conditio sine qua non for successful participation in Flemish society (De Wilde e. a. to appear; Jaspers 2012). The importance attached to Dutch language competence goes hand in hand with the preference and perceived superiority of Standard Dutch, the official language variety in Flanders (see Jaspers & Van Hoof 2013 on the standard language climate). As a consequence, Dutch as a second language classes are tailored to the instruction of Standard Dutch. (2) 	However, the insistence on Standard Dutch in education differs strongly from everyday spoken encounters where Standard Dutch is rarely attested (De Caluwe 2009). On an intralingual level, Flanders is characterised by abundant non-standard language use: either, but less and less, dialect, or tussentaal, an often used umbrella term for language use situated between Standard Dutch and the dialects. Next to intralingual language variation, Flanders also has a strong presence of other languages (e. g. French, to name but one). During my talk I will elaborate on the impact of this contrast between policy and language use for L 2 learners of Dutch. In specialist and non-specialist literature, indications are given that learners do not understand native speakers (Bolten 2004), that they often <b>lack</b> the <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> proficiency for the job market (Jaspers 2012) and that they are not prepared for the receptive demands of academic studies (Deygers to appear). Teachers in and outside the Dutch language area are confronted with unsatisfied students who are giving their teachers the impression they are teaching them ‘the wrong language’ (cf. Diepeveen & Hüning 2013 on the importance of 'tussentaal' in preparing their students for a stay in Belgium). I will critically discuss the discourse on second language education, and I will end my talk with a plea not to overlook the impact of the contrast between policy and language use on L 2 learners...|$|R

40|$|Writing is {{considered}} difficult for most students of Senior High School in Indonesia. This {{is because they}} lack knowledge about writing {{as well as the}} strategies to apply. This study was aimed at investigating the schematic structure, the use of <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> features, and the writing strategies the students employed in analytical exposition text. This study was conducted in one senior high school in Batam. Eight students took part as volunteers in this study. The data were collected by using some instruments such as open-ended survey questionnaire, the students’ written texts, and classroom observation. Open-ended survey questionnaire was used to identify the writing strategies. The final texts were collected to see the schematic structure and the use of <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> features. The notes made by the researcher during observations on the process of writing were analysed. The results of this study showed that the students wrote correctly the schematic structure of analytical exposition. It was found that the students also applied <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> features in their analytical exposition texts. They employed the writing strategies, i. e metacognitive, cognitive, rhetorical, and social/affective strategies. It was important for the students to write correctly the schematic structure, to use <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> features, and to employ the appropriate writing strategies as their knowledge in writing...|$|R
