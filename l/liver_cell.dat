The purposes of this work were to investigate the functions of the cultured <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> and to identify functionally the <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> cultured by our present method with the parenchymal <b>liver</b> <b>cells.</b> At first, the albumin production of the cultured <b>liver</b> <b>cells,</b> one of the well known functions of the <b>liver</b> <b>cells,</b> was examined by the immunological methods, especially, the fluorescent antibody technique and the complement fixation test. Culture methods which could display the functions of the <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> as much as possible were explored simultaneously. The results were as follows: 1. Albumin production was detected in the strain RLN· 10 <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> established from the liver tissues of a Donryu rat with immunofluorescent method and complement fixation test. This confirms that the cultured <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> maintain the function to produce albumin and these cells have originated from the parenchymal <b>liver</b> <b>cells.</b> 2. Hepatoma strains (AH 66 -TC-l, AH 7974 -TC-l) also showed the albumin production but the extent of its production was less than that of the strain RLN- 10. 3.

40|$|Autophagy is {{a pathway}} of {{intracellular}} degradation, in which autophagic vacuoles are formed to transport intracellular biomacromolecules and damaged organelles to lysosomes. Autophagy {{plays an important}} role in the maintenance of the dynamic balance of liver function. Abnormal <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> can be eliminated by autophagy. This article reviews the close relationship of autophagy with the proliferation of <b>liver</b> <b>cells,</b> non-parenchymal <b>liver</b> <b>cells,</b> and hepatic stem cells. Analysis has shown that autophagy may restore the volume and function of the liver by promoting the proliferation of <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> and hepatic stem cells, which can be stopped in time to prevent tumor development. Autophagy may promote the activation of non-parenchymal <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> during <b>liver</b> dysfunction, which can inhibit the regeneration of <b>liver</b> <b>cells,</b> and, in the meantime, lead to the development and progression of liver fibrosis.

40|$|When {{cultured cells}} {{are used in}} experiments, It is very {{important}} to know from what kinds of cells the cultured cells are originated, and what characteristics the cultured cells maintain continuously in vitro Some properties of rat <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> in long-term cultivation were examined for the purpose of identifying the cultured <b>cells</b> with parenchymal <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> by investigating their functions. The production of rat serum albumin and &# 945;-globulin which is regarded as specific functions of <b>liver</b> parenchymal <b>cells</b> was detected in these cultured rat <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> with the method of immunoelectrophoresis. Histochemically, acid phosphatase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, succinic dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, and adenosine triphosphatase were demonstrated in the cultured rat <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> which were morphologically epithelial. Alkaline phosphatase showed little activity in these cells. Glycogen was recognized by the periodic acid-Schiff technique, when bovine serum concentration in the culture fluid was reduced to 5 per cent. These histochemical findings of cultured rat <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> were identical with those of parenchymal <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo.

40|$|Primary {{cultures}} of <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from adult rats by trypsin-and collagenaseperfusion technique {{were carried out}} to compare biological and biochemical properties of the enzymatically prepared <b>liver</b> <b>cells.</b> (1) The population of isolated <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> prepared with trypsin was rich in cells with smaller sizes compared with that with collagenase. On the other hand, {{the population of the}} collagenase-dispersed <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> contained many more cells with larger sizes as compared with the former. (2) The cell attachment efficiency on the 1 st culture day was about twice as high in the <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> prepared with collagenase than with trypsin. (3) Mature hepatocytes isolated by collagenase-perfusion could be maintained in primary culture for a longer time than those by trypsin-perfusion. In primary culture of the trypsin-dispersed <b>liver</b> <b>cells,</b> immature hepatocytes started growing after a lag period of 1 day and the number of cultured cells reached a maximal level on the 8 th culture day. However, the collagenase-dispersed <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> in primary culture continued to decrease in number from the 1 st to 10 th culture day, and then the remaining immature hepatocytes started growing gradually. Furthermore, earlier proliferation of immature hepatocytes could not be induced by trypsinization of the collagenase-dispersed <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> 1 day after initiation of primary culture. (4) Both of the enzymatically prepared <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> showed albumin production, and exhibited G 6 Pase and TAT activities for a week in primary culture. The levels of G 6 Pase activities were nearly the same in both of the enzymatically prepared <b>liver</b> <b>cells.</b> But albumin production was higher in the <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> prepared with collagenase than with trypsin. Especially, the level of TAT activities up to 2 nd culture day was about three times higher in the <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> prepared with collagenase than those with trypsin. (5) In both of the primary culture systems, combined supplementation of dexamethasone (10 - 5 M) and insulin (10 μg/ml) consistently improved the cell attachment efficiency and was also very effective for maintenance of mature hepatocytes. Furthermore, these hormones enhanced albumin production and TAT activities in both of the enzymatically prepared <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> in primary culture. But the <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> prepared by collagenase-perfusion had a higher response to these hormones than those by trypsinperfusion. (6) From these observations described above, it seems that the population of <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> prepared with trypsin would contain much more immature hepatocytes with a higher proliferative ability than that with collagenase. On the other hand, collagenase would isolate highly intact mature hepatocytes from rat liver as compared with trypsin. Therefore, the use of <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> isolated by trypsin-perfusion may be desirable for obtaining rapid growth of immature hepatocytes. On the other hand, the use of collagenase dispersed <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> may be preferred for maintaining mature hepatocytes with specialized liver functions for a longer time in primary culture...|$|R

2500|$|Acetaminophen (in the US and Japan), {{paracetamol}} (INN), {{also known}} by the brand name Tylenol and Panadol, is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose, but overdose {{is the most common}} cause of drug-induced liver disease and acute liver failure worldwide. [...] Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)) produced by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances, this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In an overdose, a large amount of NAPQI is generated, which overwhelms the detoxification process and leads to <b>liver</b> <b>cell</b> damage. [...] Nitric oxide also plays a role in inducing toxicity. The risk of liver injury is influenced by several factors including the dose ingested, concurrent alcohol or other drug intake, interval between ingestion and antidote, etc. The dose toxic to the liver is quite variable from person to person and is often thought to be lower in chronic alcoholics Measurement of blood level is important in assessing prognosis, higher levels predicting a worse prognosis. Administration of Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. Those that develop acute liver failure can still recover spontaneously, [...] but may require transplantation if poor prognostic signs such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy is present (see King's College Criteria).|$|E
2500|$|Steatohepatitis {{is seen in}} both {{alcoholic}} and non-alcoholic liver disease and {{is the culmination of}} a cascade of events that began with injury. [...] In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit. [...] Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their breakdown products [...] in the liver cells in a process called steatosis. This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte's ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect [...] as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response. [...] Overtime, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause <b>liver</b> <b>cell</b> injury and death. [...] These events mark the transition to steatohepatitis and in the setting of chronic injury, fibrosis eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes (ballooning), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies.|$|E

MethodsCells were placed in an microbial fuel cells (MFC) anode and the electric current was measured. Mitochondrial-affecting chemicals, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) and resveratrol (RVT), were used to induce proton leakage in cells and their effect on current production observed. MCF- 7 breast cancer cells exhibited higher proton leakage relative to normal <b>liver</b> <b>cells.</b> A mouse model for Qi-deficiency was prepared according to the Methodology of Animal Experiment in Chinese medicine. The Qi-tonics Buzhongyiqi Tang (BZYQT), {{which is used to}} treat the Qi-deficiency condition, was applied to Qi-deficient <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> to examine how current production was altered. ResultsAdding either DNP or RVT to normal <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> increased current production. MCF- 7 cells that possessed high proton leakage were also found to produce higher currents than normal <b>liver</b> <b>cells.</b> Higher current production, lower cellular glucose content, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production rate were found in Qi-deficient <b>liver</b> <b>cells,</b> in which the use of DNP or RVT further increased current production. The use of BZYQT to treat Qi-deficient <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> decreased current production, counteracted the action of DNP, and also improved cellular glucose content. ConclusionHigh electric current production was found in <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> with high cellular proton leakage. Positive current responses to both mitochondria-affecting chemicals, DNP and RVT, appeared to indicate proper mitochondrial function. The high proton leakage detected in Qi-deficient <b>liver</b> <b>cells</b> might have caused high energy losses, which served to explain the observed lower cellular glucose content and ATP production rate than in normal cells. These results might also explain the exhibited syndromes of low energy and fatigue in Qi-deficient patients. Proton leakage, induced by DNP or the Qi-deficient condition, was possibly caused by unusual uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and appeared to be inhibited by treatment with BZYQT, such that decreased current production was observed after BZYQT treatment...|$|R
