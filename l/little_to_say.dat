5|$|Peter K. Bol {{asserts that}} the {{supporters}} of Wang Anshi's expansionist, activist central government in his New Policies were convinced that he understood the dao which brought utopia to Western Zhou (c. 1050 BC – 771 BC) antiquity and were determined to conform society according to his vision. The marginalised emperor – the last remaining aristocrat with any true political power – embraced the fiction that he was like the sage kings of old who brought society {{into a state of}} total harmony with court rituals and policy reforms. Yet after the reign of Emperor Huizong, Song rulers and officials alike disregarded the New Policies and focused instead on reforming society through a local, bottom-up approach. For example, Emperor Huizong attempted from 1107–1120 to bar anyone who had not attended a government school from serving in public office. He thus rejected anyone who did not acknowledge his brand of Confucian ideology as orthodoxy. However, the government-run school system during the Southern Song eventually lost prominence to private academies, which had outnumbered government schools during the early Northern Song. Even before Emperor Huizong's reign, Sima Guang (1019–1086), a prominent chancellor and political rival to Wang Anshi, had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the emperor's role in shaping major reforms and public policy, mentioning only that the emperor made major appointments when necessary.|$|E

A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, {{is that there is a}} dearth of dependency-based explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard discontinuities. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition are mostly absent from many established dependency-based frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with constituency grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.|$|E

The Torah has <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{on the subject of}} survival after death, but {{by the time of the}} rabbis two ideas had made inroads among the Jews: one, which is probably derived from Greek thought, is that of the immortal soul which returns to its creator after death; the other, which is thought to be of Persian origin, is that of resurrection of the dead.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{influences}} on Structural Marxism, {{primarily from the}} British Marxist historical tradition, included E.P. Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm and Raymond Williams. They criticized the functionalist emphasis in Structural Marxism, that neglected individuals in favour of the structural elements of their model. The British school {{was more interested in}} class, culture and politics, and placed human subjects at the centre of analysis. Where mode of production analysis was abstract, they focused on people. Where world-systems theory had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the local, the Cultural Materialists began and ended there.

25|$|The Canadian Charter has <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{explicitly}} at least, {{about economic}} and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to security of the person and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant. The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment. Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights, economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.|$|E

25|$|The early Spanish {{writers have}} <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the king's (or, {{as the case}} might be, queen's) ritual duties. Nonetheless, one finds the Yucatec king (halach uinic) {{referred}} to as 'bishop', so that, in virtue of his office, the king appears {{to have had a}} leading role in major public rituals. In the Classic period, the rituals of kingship were the most important rituals of the Maya court. The term 'theatre state' (Geertz), originally coined for the Hindu kingdoms of Bali, could also be used for describing the Classic Maya kingdoms; it suggests the cohesion of the state to be dependent on elaborate royal rituals through which status differences between aristocratic families could find expression. On monuments, the king sometimes assumes a dancing posture suggestive of his participation in the rituals that were staged on the large plazas where the royal stelas stood. On important occasions, the royal impersonator would be shown to the crowd while being within a shrine erected on a large palanquin (as on a wooden lintel from Tikal's Temple IV).|$|E

500|$|This lack {{of convincing}} early {{evidence}} {{is the reason}} many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, [...] "at {{this stage of the}} enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about a historical Arthur.|$|E

500|$|As the Whig Party {{broke up}} after Fillmore's presidency, many in Fillmore's {{conservative}} wing joined the Know Nothings, forming the American Party. [...] In his 1856 candidacy as that party's nominee, Fillmore had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about immigration, instead {{focusing on the}} preservation of the Union, and won only Maryland. In his retirement, Fillmore was active in many civic endeavors. He helped to found the University of Buffalo, serving as its first chancellor. During the American Civil War, Fillmore denounced secession and agreed that the Union must be maintained by force if necessary, but was critical of the war policies of Abraham Lincoln. After peace was restored, he supported the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson. Obscure today, Fillmore has been praised by some for his foreign policy, but he is criticized by others for his enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act and for his association with the Know Nothings.|$|E
500|$|The 1878 Bland-Allison Act and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 {{required}} {{the government to}} buy large quantities of silver and strike it into coin.

[...] Bryan, who had been elected {{after the passage of}} the latter enactment, initially had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the subject. [...] Free silver was very popular among Nebraskans, though many powerful Democrats opposed it. [...] After his election to Congress, Bryan studied the currency question carefully, and came to believe in free silver; he also saw its political potential. [...] By 1893, Bryan had become a leading supporter of free silver, arguing in a speech in St. Louis that the gold standard was deflationary [...] "making a man pay a debt with a dollar larger than the one he borrowed...

500|$|In the 1897 season, Peel was {{suspended}} by Yorkshire for drunkenness. Alcohol was popular with many professional cricketers, and {{the careers of}} several Yorkshire players in this period, including Peate, had been ended for this reason. Peel was always {{known to be a}} heavy drinker, but his behaviour had been tolerated. His fame, brought about by his performances, made the problem worse. Derek Hodgson, in the official Yorkshire club history, writes: [...] "A cheerful, gregarious man, [...] took to hospitality and entertaining with alacrity and moved in such society, particularly in London, that when one of the foremost journalists of the day asked to see him he was fobbed off by a man who announced himself as 'Peel's secretary', adding: 'He does not like interviews and has <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He sent me to take his place.'" [...] Hodgson observes: [...] "It is not impossible, of course, that Bobby was either shy, or 'indisposed' at that particular moment", and suggests that Peel's downfall, like Peate's before him, was because he [...] "was too often the toast of the town".|$|E

500|$|Four Times of the Day was {{the first}} series of prints that Hogarth had issued since {{the success of the}} Harlot and Rake (and would be the only set he would issue until Marriage à-la-mode in 1745), so it was eagerly anticipated. On hearing of its {{imminent}} issue, George Faulkner wrote from Dublin that he would take 50 sets. The series lacks the moral lessons that are found in the earlier series and revisited in Marriage à-la-mode, and its lack of teeth meant it failed to achieve the same success, though it has found an enduring niche as a snapshot of the society of Hogarth's time. At the auction of 1745, the paintings of Four Times of the Day raised more than those of the Rake; and Night, which is generally regarded as the worst of the series, fetched the highest single total. Cunningham commented sarcastically: [...] "Such was the reward then, to which the patrons of genius thought these works entitled". While Horace Walpole praised the accompanying print, Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn, as being the finest of Hogarth's works, he had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of Four Times of the Day other than that it did not find itself wanting in comparison with Hogarth's other works.|$|E
500|$|Some {{settlements}} did not survive. [...] The river town of Baltimore thrived {{and was a}} major {{center of}} trade until the river was overshadowed by the railroad for purposes of trade and transportation; a single house, built long after the town's heyday, is all that remains. [...] Warrenton had a promising start as the first county seat, but it began to wane after the seat moved, and today no trace is left. [...] Chesapeake was the first settlement in Steuben Township, but it faded away so early that even an 1883 county history has <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the subject. [...] Brisco was never large, though it did have a school house from the 1850s through the 1920s. It likewise disappeared {{by the end of}} the 20thcentury. Chatterton had a school, a store and a post office, but it has disappeared even though the name continues to appear on maps. [...] Other communities were planned but did not develop. [...] Dresser was never much more than a collection of houses, though it did have a post office for a few years around the turn of the 20thcentury. [...] The settlements of Kickapoo, Locust Grove, Sloan and Walnut Grove were similar in this respect. [...] Point Pleasant never developed much beyond the founder's residence and a liquor store, and was later described as a [...] "paper town".|$|E
500|$|The {{role that}} Wills and others played in {{pioneering}} Australian football went largely unrecognised in their lifetimes as the sport {{had yet to}} develop a historical perspective. In an 1876 piece on the Melbourne Football Club's origins, published in The Australasian, Wills' 1858 letter calling for the organisation and codification of football was noted as a seminal document. Wills later wrote that he attempted to promote football in Victoria as early as 1857, [...] "but it was not taken to kindly until the following year". By 1908, the year of Australian football's jubilee celebrations, H. C. A. Harrison was proclaimed [...] "the father of football" [...] {{on account of his}} substantial reputation on and off the field. Wills was the next most often recalled pioneer during this period, and Harrison credited him with initiating the sport when he [...] "recommended that we Australians should work out a game of our own." [...] More recent historiography has shown that while Harrison was a pivotal figure over a long period, he did not co-write the first rules in 1859 and did not play in the 1858 games. With this correction, Wills was elevated to a position of pre-eminence. He has variously been called the game's father and inventor. Blainey said of Wills: [...] "It is far too much to say that he founded the game, but it would be too <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he was simply one among many founders." ...|$|E
