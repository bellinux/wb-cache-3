40|$|The {{simulation}} of LTE and LTE-A at <b>link</b> <b>level</b> {{is a research}} topic for several COST IC 1004 institutions. It was agreed in previous meetings {{that it would be}} useful to define a common set of scenarios for LTE and LTE-A <b>link</b> <b>level</b> simulations with the goal to allow researchers to configure the different simulation tools in a way that the obtained results can be properly compared and simulators become calibrated to a common reference. Researchers working at system level would also benefit from this initiative by having access to well established <b>link</b> <b>level</b> results and look-up tables. This paper addresses the task by identifying a set of topics, features and parameters to consider when programming the <b>link</b> <b>level</b> simulators. The proposed aspects derive from the experience gained while building our own <b>link</b> <b>level</b> simulator at UPC, but since the LTE radio interface is extremely flexible and supports many features, it is difficult to be exhaustive. The aim is to focus on the relevant topics for <b>link</b> <b>level</b> simulator calibration and to discuss the trade-off between simulation complexity and compliance with the standards.

30|$|The modern {{process of}} new {{technology}} development and evaluation always includes computer simulations as an important stage of the study. Modeling the whole network infrastructure, together with detailed simulation of the individual communication links, is hardly feasible and poses high computational complexity. Therefore, traditionally, a two-level architecture is adopted for network behavior analysis, testing, and evaluation, where <b>link</b> <b>level</b> and system level simulations are performed independently. The goal of the <b>link</b> <b>level</b> simulator is to estimate the performance of PHY-related mechanisms of transmitter and receiver under different propagation conditions. The purpose of the system level simulator is to evaluate {{the performance of the}} whole network in terms of throughput, capacity, coverage, quality of service, radio resource management, etc. In order to avoid costly <b>link</b> <b>level</b> simulations for estimating each link quality, a simplified but accurate link abstraction model has to be implemented. This model is generally realized as follows. First, extensive <b>link</b> <b>level</b> simulation campaigns are performed in order to estimate the link quality in different propagation conditions in terms of a chosen performance metric. Later, the outcome of these simulations is used to calibrate the <b>link</b> <b>level</b> abstraction model for system level simulations. The main function of the <b>link</b> <b>level</b> abstraction model is then to keep the performance characteristics sensible to the transmission mode and propagation conditions, but the link quality estimation has to be simple enough to be feasible on the system level. In this paper, the mean mutual information per coded bit (MMIB) effective signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR) method is considered as the principal link-to-system mapping approach. This method has already demonstrated good performance for OFDM-based systems[20]. In particular, the SNR is used as a link quality measure in the ESNR approach on the <b>link</b> <b>level.</b> We assume that the noise component includes the interference, even though it is not simulated explicitly. On the system level, the inter-cell interference should be taken into account. On the system <b>level,</b> a <b>link</b> <b>level</b> abstraction model is used with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as an input and with the assumption of inter-cell interference. The first implementation results of the MMIB approach, together with several alternative <b>link</b> <b>level</b> abstractions for FBMC, have been presented in the earlier works of the authors[21, 22]. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} justify the applicability of the MMIB technique as <b>link</b> <b>level</b> abstraction for FBMC transmission in the PMR network. This paper presents the complete model of link-to-system mapping and final performance results for the FBMC transmission, including necessary calibration parameters that can be used for the whole set of channel quality indicators (CQIs) in different channel conditions. The particularity of the FBMC system is addressed by taking into account the distortion at the receiver[23] for resource quality measure estimation.|$|R

In particular, they are utilized in the system <b>level</b> simulator for <b>link</b> <b>level</b> abstraction.|$|R

Each mobile station is assumed to have an average power constraint. The base station is assumed to have nR receive antenna. We shall consider scalar power feedback in this paper. Based on the information theoretical analytical model, it is shown that transmit diversity could enhance <b>link</b> <b>level</b> performance but is harmful to the multiuser system performance when there is insufficient feedback information...|$|R
