25|$|On 27 May 1985, a Lockheed TriStar (registration: G-BBAI) overran {{the runway}} at Leeds/Bradford Airport on landing from Palma after a rain shower. The {{aircraft}} was evacuated, with only minor injuries {{sustained by the}} 14 crew and 398 passengers. The nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> folded backwards during the overrun, leading to severe damage to {{the underside of the}} forward fuselage. The undersides of both wing-mounted engines were flattened and both engines suffered ingestion damage. The main wheels of the aircraft also dug deep troughs in the area beyond the end of the runway, damaging the buried airfield lighting cables. The accident report concluded that the overrun was caused by the inability of the aircraft to achieve the appropriate level of braking effectiveness, and recommended that both the scheduled wet runway performance of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the condition of the surface of runway 14 at Leeds/Bradford Airport should be re-examined.|$|E

The second YB-35 converted to a YB-49 all-jet airframe crashed after Air Force test pilot Forbes pulled the outer wing panels off during stall tests at [...] The first YB-35 airframe jet-modified to a YB-49 completed all stall tests and even demonstrated recovery from a spin. It was later destroyed after the Flying Wing's forward <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> and wheel collapsed after encountering high vibration during a highly unusual taxi test procedure made with the engine's fuel tanks full, causing a fire that spread rapidly. Seven incomplete airframes began conversion to jet power as YB-35B but were never finished.|$|E

50|$|The <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{is fixed}} and unsprung. The main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> {{are made of}} {{laminated}} wood with a steel axle. The only shock absorption comes from the tires themselves. Hydraulic wheel brakes are usually fitted.|$|R
50|$|The aircraft's {{structure}} {{is made from}} 6061-T6 aluminum, with the main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> of 4130 steel. The aluminum frame wing is covered in pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. Construction time from the kit is reported as 120 hours.|$|R
50|$|In August 1944 he {{returned}} to JG 52 and took over command of 5./JG 52, his score standing at 111. On the 22 December 1944 he scored his last two kills. Taking off for another sortie from Cs√≥r that day, one of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> hit a truck killing him in the accident.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 November 1991, a SAHSA Boeing 737-200 landed hard on {{the right}} main gear strut at Juan Santamaria International Airport casing the right <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> to collapse. All 36 {{passengers}} and 6 crew escaped.|$|E
50|$|During a post-accident inspection, {{maintenance}} personnel discovered a broken landing gear oleo attachment bracket {{on the left}} main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> assembly. The manufacturer had changed {{the design of the}} oleo attachment bracket which was made of aluminum alloy. The newly designed oleo attachment bracket is made of steel.|$|E
50|$|Further {{additional}} causes {{were certain}} design {{features of the}} aircraft. Computer logic prevented the activation of both ground spoilers and thrust reversers until a minimum compression load of at least 6.3 tons was sensed on each main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut,</b> thus preventing the crew from achieving any braking action by the two systems before this condition was met.|$|E
50|$|The Model 187 shape {{was similar}} to the 177, with a high {{cantilever}} wing (its design was a mix of the cantilever wings on the 177 and the 210), all-moving tailplane, and tubular main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts.</b> In a departure from the 177 approach, the 187's stabilator was mounted atop the vertical tail in a T-tail configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Some R-4s had the {{tailwheel}} {{located at}} the extreme aft end of the boom near the tail rotor while others had it positioned at {{the midpoint of the}} boom. Additionally, some had short [...] "stub" [...] exhaust pipes from the engine while others had a much longer one which extended vertically and then aft above the main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R
500|$|Mounting the {{receiver}} in the Heyford {{was not a}} trivial task; the standard half-wave dipole antenna needed to be about [...] long to detect wavelengths of 6.7m. The solution was eventually found by stringing a cable between the Heyford's fixed <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts.</b> A series of dry cell batteries lining the aircraft floor powered {{the receiver}}, providing high voltage for the CRT through an ignition coil taken from a Ford.|$|R
50|$|On 21 June 1957, {{the sole}} {{prototype}} I-7U suffered damage when the starboard <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> failed as the aircraft landed on its 13th flight. After repair, the test program was resumed but {{came to an}} end after only six more flights. After 19 flights, the last in February 1958, the 1-7U was rebuilt into the 1-75 prototype interceptor.|$|E
50|$|Unauthorized {{passengers}} {{have been}} known to stowaway on larger aircraft by climbing a <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> and riding in the compartment meant for the wheels. There are extreme dangers to this practice, with numerous deaths reported. Dangers include a lack of oxygen at high altitude, temperatures well below freezing, crush injury or death from the gear retracting into its confined space, and falling out of the compartment during takeoff or landing.|$|E
50|$|In January 1962, a B-47 {{based at}} Plattsburgh Air Force Base on a {{training}} mission {{crashed into the}} side of Wright Peak in the High Peaks in the Adirondacks of New York. All four crew members were killed. Wreckage from the plane can still be found at the summit of the mountain, including a <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> and a piece of the engine. The airplane had veered about 30 miles east due to inclement weather.|$|E

50|$|Mounting the {{receiver}} in the Heyford {{was not a}} trivial task; the standard half-wave dipole antenna needed to be about 3.5 m long to detect wavelengths of 6.7 m.

50|$|The {{landing gear}} was a {{retractable}} nosegear type. The {{nose landing gear}} retracted into the forward part of the fuselage in a bay ahead of the air duct divider. The main landing gear wheels remained somewhat vertical as they retracted toward the fuselage. This allowed the wheels to retract {{into the side of}} the fuselage, alongside the engine, as the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> retracted into a horizontal opening in the bottom of the wing.|$|E
50|$|The Tu-114 {{used the}} basic wing, empennage, landing gear, and powerplants of the Tu-95 bomber, mated to {{a totally new}} {{pressurized}} fuselage of much larger diameter. To cope with the increased weight, increased landing flap surface area was required, and the flap chord was increased compared to the bomber's flaps. The wing was mounted low on the fuselage, giving the Tu-114 a much higher stance on its landing gear than the bomber. As a result, a new nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> was required, although the main landing gear remained unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|The Il-62 has {{tricycle}} {{landing gear}} with an additional trademark lightweight <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> {{at the rear of}} the fuselage which extends when the aircraft reaches its parking position. Aircraft with rear-mounted engines are usually tail-heavy when sitting empty on the ground, and to prevent the aircraft from tipping up on its tail, various devices are used for supporting the tail - from simple [...] "pogo stick" [...] fixed struts on small aircraft, to light-weight extendable struts (Il-62). Aircraft like DC-9 or Boeing 727 use an airstair door under their tail which serves the dual purpose of a tail support as well as an extra door for passenger loading.|$|E

25|$|While Johnson {{made it back}} to land at Manston, {{four other}} pilots of the 56th FG were killed in action. A fifth, able to extend only one of his plane's <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts,</b> had to bail out over the English Channel and was rescued north of Yarmouth. Five other Thunderbolts {{suffered}} battle damage. Johnson suffered shrapnel wounds and minor burns to his face, hands, and legs, and was awarded the Purple Heart.

25|$|The {{prototype}} of the Witch, serial J8596, was first flown on 30 January 1928 at RAF Andover, with Louis Paget at the controls. The type was praised for its stability as a bombing platform, and its 138mph maximum speed was good, although its 62mph landing speed was felt to be too fast. However, the Witch was judged unsuitable for service due to structural weaknesses, including a number of failures of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> and other components.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft, (the first all-metal glider {{designed and}} built in Hungary), was predominantly built from steel and light alloys {{due to the lack}} of high quality timber in Hungary, emerging as a shoulder winged cantilever monoplane with a retractable mainwheel. Other factors in the choice of materials were the experience gained during the war in producing aircraft for the Axis war machine, the intention to build a production series and the availability of war surplus light alloy stock. The paucity of high quality steel tubing necessitated manufacturing the fuselage structure steel tubing from a recovered Bell P-39 Airacobra <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut.</b> The design performance envelope allowed for cloud flying and spinning but not aerobatics.|$|E

5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{conducted}} a full {{investigation of the}} accident {{and concluded that the}} probable cause was the captain's over-control of the aircraft during the landing and his failure to go around after a destabilized flare. Beginning about 17 feet above the runway, the captain had let the nose lower, probably to achieve an earlier touchdown, then raised it and increased thrust to slow the plane's descent, then pushed the nose down again (around {{the time of the first}} touchdown) to try to keep the plane on the runway. These last control inputs were [...] "too late and too large" [...] to stabilize the landing, and the plane's high sink rate and rightward roll compressed the right <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> at the second touchdown, which broke the right wing rear spar and ruptured the right fuel tank.|$|E

5000|$|The XC-120 Packplane {{began as}} a C-119B {{fuselage}} (48-330, c/n 10312) which was cut off at a point just below the flight deck. The wings were angled upwards between the engines and the fuselage, raising the fuselage by several feet and giving the plane an inverted gull wing appearance. Smaller diameter [...] "twinned" [...] wheels were installed forward {{of each of the}} main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> to serve as nosewheels, while the main struts were extended backwards.|$|R
50|$|The <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{provided}} knee-action <b>struts</b> for {{absorbing the}} shock during landing.|$|R
5000|$|Pitch {{and roll}} control was {{provided}} by elevons, though Vought called these surfaces [...] "ailevators" [...] at the time. Slats were fitted to the entire span of the leading edge. All controls were hydraulically-powered. The very long nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> required for high angle of attack takeoffs was incredibly stout, however the high stresses of barrier engagements, and side-loads imposed during early deployment carrier landings caused failure of the retract cylinder's internal down-locks, causing nose gear failure and resultant spinal injuries to the pilot. The F7U was also largely let down by its underpowered Westinghouse J34 turbojets, an engine that some pilots liked to say [...] "put out less heat than Westinghouse's toasters." [...] Naval aviators called the F7U the [...] "Gutless Cutlass" [...] and/or the [...] "Ensign Eliminator" [...] or, in kinder moments, the [...] "Praying Mantis".|$|E

5000|$|Following STS-118 in August 2007, NASA {{managers}} {{decided to}} make modifications to the External tank to be used on STS-120, and modify the liquid oxygen feed-line brackets. The change involved a new low-density foam application, and thinner gaskets. Shuttle Program Managers decided {{to do this to}} reduce the foam loss from the area that had been noted since STS-114's [...] "Return to Flight" [...] mission in 2005. STS-118 had a small gouge on the belly of the orbiter due to a chunk of foam that impacted during launch in August 2007. The week of 17 September 2007, NASA managers decided to delay Discovery's rollover to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), due to a hydraulic fluid leak from the right main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>strut.</b> The strut repair was successfully completed on 19 September 2007.

25|$|To {{accommodate}} a folding wing the designers considered retracting the main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> rearward but, for the chord of wing that was chosen, {{it was difficult}} to make the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> long enough to provide ground clearance for the large propeller. Their solution was an inverted gull wing, which considerably shortened the required length of the main gear legs. The anhedral of the wing's center-section also permitted the wing and fuselage to meet at the optimum angle for minimizing drag, without using wing root fairings. The bent wing, however, was heavier and more difficult to construct, offsetting these benefits.|$|R
5000|$|One of Be-8 was {{equipped}} with hydrofoils, developed at TsAGI. These [...] "Underwater Wings" [...] were installed on <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> and raised the aircraft above the water, well before the aerodynamic lift could support the aircraft. As a result, takeoff was much easier and imposed less punishment on the hull from the waves. Despite being very effective during take-off, the hydrofoils resulted in increased drag {{and a reduction in}} maximum airspeed. Construction of retractable hydrofoils was not ready, and the concept did not find practical applications.|$|R
