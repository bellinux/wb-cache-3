5|$|Michigan <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> {{proposed}} {{naming the}} section of highway in Genesee County after University of Alabama tailback Mark Ingram. The state senate approved the measure on November 4, 2010, and the bill moved to the state house for approval. The bill failed to pass the state house during the session.|$|E
5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.|$|E
25|$|More {{problems}} and hard feelings arose from a Richmond-Chesterfield case {{which began in}} 1965; they were later used as prime examples of obstacles to regional cooperation as the state <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> considered changes.

25|$|Each elector casts a {{different}} number of votes. The general principle {{is that the}} total number of votes cast by Members of Parliament equals {{the total number of}} votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in a state matters; if a state <b>has</b> few <b>legislators,</b> then each <b>legislator</b> <b>has</b> more votes; if a state <b>has</b> many <b>legislators,</b> then each <b>legislator</b> <b>has</b> fewer votes.|$|R

25|$|Georgia state <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> {{claimed that}} in an 1818 survey, the state's border with Tennessee was erroneously placed one mile (1.6km) farther south than intended, and they {{proposed}} a correction in 2010. The state was then {{in the midst of}} a significant drought, and the new border would allow Georgia access to water from the Tennessee River.|$|E

A notable image of the shrine is the Japanese Imperial Chrysanthemum featured on the gate curtains leading into the shrine. More recently, the visitation of the shrine by active Japanese diplomats and <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> brought public controversy in global media. The current 11th High Priest incumbent of the shrine is Yasuhisa Tokugawa, who was appointed in 19 January 2013.|$|E

25|$|In the book, Manji {{says that}} Arabs {{have made a}} mistake by denying that Jews have a {{historical}} bond with Palestine. Manji writes that the Jews' historical roots stretch back to the land of Israel, and that {{they have a right to}} a Jewish state. She further argues that the allegation of apartheid in Israel is deeply misleading, noting that there are in Israel several Arab political parties, that Arab-Muslim <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> veto powers, and that Arab parties have overturned disqualifications. She also writes that Israel has a free Arab press, that road signs bear Arabic translations, and that Arabs live and study alongside Jews.|$|E
25|$|In Lopez, Thomas {{expressed}} his view that federal regulation of either manufacturing or agriculture is unconstitutional; he sees both as outside {{the scope of}} the Commerce Clause. He believes federal <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> overextended the Commerce Clause, while some of his critics argue that Thomas's position on congressional authority would invalidate much of the contemporary work of the federal government. According to Thomas, it is not the court's job to update the constitution. Proponents of broad national power such as Professor Michael Dorf deny that they are trying to update the constitution. Instead, they argue that they are merely addressing a set of economic facts that did not exist when the constitution was framed.|$|E

25|$|Attempting to {{restrict}} the distribution over the Internet of gun plans has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of DeCSS which enabled DVD ripping. After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans, they were still widely available via The Pirate Bay and other file sharing sites. Downloads of the plans from the UK, Germany, Spain, and Brazil were heavy. Some US <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> proposed regulations on 3D printers, to prevent them being used for printing guns. 3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile, could cripple the 3D printing industry, and could infringe on free speech rights, with early pioneer of 3D printing Professor Hod Lipson suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead.|$|E
500|$|Authors of an {{ethnological study}} of slavery at Kingsley Plantation {{characterized}} Kingsley {{as a man}} of complex paradoxes, defiantly proud of his success as a slaveholder, yet dedicated to his multiracial family. Kingsley published a defense of slavery in 1828, identifying himself only as [...] "An Inhabitant of Florida". [...] He rationalized the institution as a necessary condition for any society, beneficial to owner and slave alike, and to the overall economy. He did not consider race the only factor that should determine servitude status, writing, [...] "Few, I think will deny that color and condition, if properly considered, are two very separate qualities ... our <b>legislators</b> ... <b>have</b> mistaken the shadow for the substance, and confounded together two very different things; thereby substantiating by law a dangerous and inconvenient antipathy, which can have no better foundation than prejudice." [...] In 1823 President James Monroe appointed Kingsley to Florida's Territorial Council, where he tried to persuade them to define the rights of free people of color. When it became apparent to him that they could not, he resigned. The council passed laws that increasingly restricted the rights which free blacks enjoyed under Spanish control. The treatise was Kingsley's response to these restrictions; he favored the Spanish three-tier system of white landowners, black slaves, and freed blacks. The pamphlet was reprinted again in 1834, and Southerners used its arguments to defend slavery in debates leading to the Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|According to Texas State Representative Mike Villarreal, [...] "We have a {{responsibility}} to ensure that our children receive accurate information in the classroom, particularly when students' health is at stake," [...] Villarreal said. [...] "We're dealing with a myriad of problems in Texas {{as a result of our}} sky high teen pregnancy rates. We cannot allow our schools to provide erroneous information—the stakes are far too high."

2500|$|A {{number of}} Republican <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> {{proposed}} legislation and constitutional amendments {{at the state}} and federal levels to address issues raised by the birth certificate campaigners. Some Republicans are said to [...] "want the issue to go away", seeing it as a distraction. Democratic commentators have criticized the reluctance of some Republicans to distance themselves from the proponents of the conspiracy theories, suggesting that [...] "Republican officials are reluctant to denounce the birthers for fear of alienating an energetic part of their party's base". NBC News' [...] "First Read" [...] team commented: [...] "the real story {{in all of this is}} that Republican Party has a HUGE problem with its base right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2017, {{the state}} {{legislature}} considered several solutions. One bill would have added two judges in the 13th District, and one judge each in the 4th, 8th, and 11th Districts. The House passed a bill in mid-February which added two judges to the 13th District, and just one to the 4th and 11th. None of the proposals for adding judges would put a judge on the bench until 2019. Another proposal suggested shifting some counties with heavy workloads into districts with low workloads, but the vast distaances in the state discouraged this. Although some <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> suggested increasing the use of binding arbitration, even in criminal law, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in [...] that this would violate a citizen's fundamental rights to a jury trial, due process, and equal protection, among others.|$|E
40|$|In the US {{or in the}} UK, the {{presence}} of institutional investors in real estate markets is an old phenomenon. Specifically, Real Estate Investment Trusts are an old industry. Due to a difference in tax law, the market share of REITs in Germany has been minimal until very recently. Now the <b>legislator</b> <b>has</b> extended the tax privileges held by real estate funds to REITs, expecting that the change will make Germany an attractive place for international investors in these markets. While the effect on capital markets is planned, the German <b>legislator</b> <b>has</b> not been very attentive to likely side effects on the proper functioning of real estate law, landlord and tenant law, and zoning law. The paper analyses these effects, and points to potential legislative concerns...|$|R

2500|$|On March 20, 2014, the Florida House of Representatives Budget Committee {{passed the}} [...] "so-called Charlotte's Web measure (CS/HB 843)" [...] {{designed}} to limit prosecutors' ability to prosecute those {{in possession of}} low THC/high CBD marijuana ("0.5 percent or less of tetrahydrocannabinol and more than 15 percent of cannabidiol") used for treating seizures. The law took effect July 1, 2014. Since then, Florida <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> passed a bill with bipartisan support legalizing the use of Charlotte's Web, and Governor Rick Scott signed the [...] "Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014" [...] (SB 1030) into law on June 6, 2014.

According to Geneive Abdo, [...] "Muslim Zionist" [...] is a label which Manji [...] "would no doubt accept".|$|E
2500|$|Some American <b>legislators</b> <b>have</b> unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to provide {{financial incentives to}} women on welfare who agree to use Norplant. For example, in Kansas, Republican Kerry Patrick introduced legislation that would grant welfare recipients a one-time payment of $500 to use Norplant, followed by a $50 bonus each year the implants remained in place." [...] Some judges have offered Norplant implants as a voluntary alternative to jail time for certain women convicted of child abuse or drug abuse during pregnancy. Two days after the 1990 FDA approval of Norplant, an editorial in The Philadelphia Inquirer suggested reducing {{the size of the}} black underclass by offering welfare mothers increased benefits if they agreed to use Norplant. Eleven days later the Inquirer apologized for their [...] "misguided and wrongheaded" [...] editorial and for their suggestion of offering incentives for Norplant use. Critics such as the ACLU argued that such uses are coercive and discriminatory, and compared such uses to early 20th-century American eugenics. In Killing the Black Body, black feminist Dorothy Roberts links such uses of Norplant to a [...] "white mainstream" [...] that is allegedly determined to [...] "demonize, even criminalize" [...] poor black women's lives and reproductive choices.|$|E
