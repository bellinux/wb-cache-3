5|$|Progress M1-5 was {{launched}} by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. It was originally scheduled for launch on 16 January 2001, {{but by the}} first week of January, it was targeting 18 January. It was rolled out to the <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> on 16 January, with the rocket departing the MIK assembly facility at Site 2 of the cosmodrome at 02:00 GMT, and was erected at the <b>launch</b> <b>pad,</b> Site 1/5, within two hours of the start of rollout. Launch was set for 06:56:26 GMT on 18 January.|$|E

The use of Standard IEC 62305 "Protection against lightning" establishes the general framework for the Lightning Protection System (LPS). However, the specific activity of a <b>launching</b> <b>pad</b> requires special analysis on specific points of the LPS. Indeed, it is necessary {{to take into account the}} lightning conductor system particularity on the one hand, and the launcher electromagnetic susceptibility on the other hand. This paper presents the general methodology used to define the LPS of a <b>launching</b> <b>pad.</b> The analysis is based upon expertise, numerical simulation and experiments performed at <b>launching</b> <b>pad</b> sites...|$|R

5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it was}} mated to the external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of Atlantis to the <b>launch</b> <b>pad,</b> which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E

5|$|The first rollout to <b>Launch</b> <b>Pad</b> 39A {{occurred}} on 4 September 2008. On 27 September, the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling (SIC) Unit on the Hubble Space Telescope failed. Because of its {{importance to the}} telescope, NASA postponed the launch of STS-125 on 29 September until 2009 so the failed unit could be replaced as well. Atlantis was rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building on 20 October.|$|E
5|$|Neil Armstrong's {{personal}} preference kit carried {{a piece of}} wood from the Wright brothers' 1903 airplane's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing, along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Deke Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled for launch. Then on 10 February it {{was attached}} to the payload adaptor, and encapsulated in the payload fairing, to form a unit known as the Space Head Module. This was transported to the <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> by means of a vehicle known as the crocodile, and installed atop the carrier rocket. Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{identification}} of German missile sites by the PRU made Operation Crossbow possible in 1944. Coastal Command continually identified German V-1 launch ramps, despite the German camouflage efforts. This enabled British aircraft to bomb them and reduce their effectiveness by one-third. By June, 69 ramps had been located, {{although it was}} not until 26 February 1945, when Squadron Leader J.E.S. White actually spotted a V-2, on its <b>launch</b> <b>pad,</b> ready to fire, that it became clear how elusive a weapon of that size could be.|$|E
5|$|The three-member Expedition 1 crew {{successfully}} {{launched on}} 31 October 2000, at 07:52 UTC, atop a Soyuz-U rocket on Soyuz TM-31 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan; they used <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> Gagarin's Start, {{from which the}} first human to fly in space, Yuri Gagarin, was launched in 1961. After 33 orbits of the Earth, {{and a series of}} rendezvous maneuvers performed by Gidzenko, they docked the Soyuz capsule to the aft port of the Zvezda Service Module on 2 November 2000, at 09:21 UTC. Ninety minutes after docking, Shepherd opened the hatch to Zvezda and the crew members entered the complex.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October 2008, NASA {{announced}} that Atlantis would {{be removed from}} its solid rocket boosters and external tank stack and {{sent back to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to await a targeted launch time at 1:11pm EDT on 12 May 2009. The stack was turned over to be used on the STS-119 mission instead. On 23 March, Atlantis was mated to its new stack in the Vehicle Assembly Building, and rolled out to <b>Launch</b> <b>Pad</b> 39A on 31 March. On 24 April 2009, NASA managers issued a request to move the STS-125 launch up one day to 11 May at 2:01pm EDT. The change was made official at the flight readiness review on 30 April.|$|E

5|$|The launch had {{originally}} been scheduled for August 4, 1983, and was later rescheduled for August 20. The requirement to conduct testing with the TDRS system required a delay of ten days for the system to be ready, during which the stack remained on the <b>launch</b> <b>pad.</b> During the on-pad delay, Hurricane Barry (1983) hit the Florida coastline, making landfall {{just south of the}} Kennedy Space Center on the morning of August 25. The storm had only been identified two days earlier, and {{there was no time to}} roll Challenger back from the pad; the decision was made to secure the launch stack and ride out the storm.|$|E
5|$|Riya first {{appeared}} as a child artist in the film Vishkanya in 1991, where she {{played the role of}} the young Pooja Bedi. At the age of 19, she did National Film Awards winning director Bharathiraja's Tamil film, Taj Mahal (2000), which did not achieve commercial success. She was scheduled to make her Bollywood film debut in Love You Hamesha, opposite actor Akshaye Khanna; however, the film was stalled, and she finally made her debut in N. Chandra's Style in 2001. This low-budget sex comedy was the first commercial success in over a decade for the director. A <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> for Riya, cast in the female lead along with fellow-newcomers, Sharman Joshi, Sahil Khan and Shilpi Mudgal, the film pioneered a trend of commercial success for small budget films in India. Riya and the second female lead of the film were replaced by aspirant actresses Sonali Joshi and Jaya Seal in Xcuse Me'.|$|E
5|$|The Chronic is {{the debut}} studio album by American hip hop {{recording}} artist Dr. Dre. It {{was released on}} December 15, 1992, by his own record label Death Row Records and distributed by Interscope Records and Priority Records. Recording sessions for the album took place in June 1992 at Death Row Studios in Los Angeles and at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. The album is named after a slang term for high-grade cannabis, and its cover is a homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. It was Dr. Dre's first solo album after he had departed from hip hop group N.W.A and its label Ruthless Records over a financial dispute. On The Chronic, he included both subtle and direct insults at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A member Eazy-E. Although a solo album, it features many appearances by Snoop Dogg, who used the album as a <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> for his own solo career.|$|E
