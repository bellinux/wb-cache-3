Later, she tells the police that she found Ben after he hanged himself and that Violet must have run off with the baby.|$|E
5|$|Kapoor's {{personal}} {{life is the}} subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India. During the filming of Fida in 2004, he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship. They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when Mid Day published a set of pictures of them kissing in public. Despite claims by the couple that the pictures were fabricated, the newspaper denied any wrongdoing. The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of Jab We Met. Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his personal <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from media attention.

So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

5|$|Matthias {{was born}} in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) on 23 February 1443. He was the second son of John Hunyadi and his wife, Elisabeth Szilágyi. John Hunyadi was a {{pre-eminent}} military commander and political leader of the Kingdom of Hungary, who {{spent most of his}} <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from the family estates. Because of his father's absence, his mother managed Matthias's education. Many of the most learned men of Central Europeincluding Gregory of Sanok and John Vitézfrequented John Hunyadi's court when Matthias was a child. Gregory of Sanok, a former tutor of King Vladislaus III of Poland, was Matthias's only teacher whose name is known. Under these scholars' influences, Matthias became an enthusiastic supporter of Renaissance humanism.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{had five}} children, {{two of them}} illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate {{daughter}} was born– Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Møller (1893–1978), a medical doctor who became {{a professor at the}} University of Copenhagen and director of the polyclinic at the National Hospital. The younger daughter Anne Marie, who graduated from the Copenhagen Academy of Arts, married the Hungarian violinist Emil Telmányi (1892–1988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen's music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen's son, Hans Børge, was handicapped as a result of meningitis and spent most of his <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Parallels {{have been}} pointed out between Njörðr and the figure of Hadingus, attested in book I of Saxo Grammaticus' 13th century work Gesta Danorum. Some of these {{similarities}} include that, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Skáldskaparmál, Hadingus is chosen by his wife Regnhild after selecting him from other men at a banquet by his lower legs, and, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Gylfaginning, Hadingus complains in verse of his displeasure at his <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from the sea and how he is disturbed by the howls of wolves, while his wife Regnhild complains of life at the shore and states her annoyance at the screeching sea birds. Georges Dumézil theorized that in the tale Hadingus passes through all three functions of his trifunctional hypothesis, before ending as an Odinic hero, paralleling Njörðr's passing from the Vanir to the Æsir in the Æsir-Vanir War.|$|E

Nonetheless, Socrates did not lose his calm demeanor and, although during the trial he could propose to the jury his self-exile, he did not do it when his friends offered to help him flee afterward, since <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from his beloved city was pointless for him.|$|E

There have been many rumors regarding the cause of their divorce, but after World War II, Taylor had attempted to create a <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from Hollywood, and Stanwyck did not share that goal. Taylor had romantic affairs, and there were unsubstantiated rumors about Stanwyck having had affairs as well. After the divorce, they acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, The Night Walker (1964). She never remarried and cited Taylor as {{the love of her}} life, according to her friend and Big Valley co-star Linda Evans.

Macdonald, {{during a time when}} there was no formal legal education in the province. Macdonald had just turned 21. Early in their work relationship, Mowat and Macdonald were close friends, and worked successfully to build the legal practice. But they grew apart over time, as Mowat matured into a genuine rival of the older Macdonald. Mowat was mostly even-tempered and moderate in his behaviour, {{in sharp contrast to the}} firebrand Macdonald, who struggled with alcohol abuse for much of his life. As a young man, Mowat moved away from Kingston, eventually settling in Toronto, to develop his own career and <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from Macdonald's prominence.|$|E

Another witness identified as Turner testified that he had heard a member of parliament mention that the government had offered Doyle $16,000 and passage to anywhere in the world to restart his life, if he would make a sworn statement against Whelan. However Susan Wheatley later testified that she had heard Turner say he would swear his grandfather's <b>life</b> <b>away</b> for $10,000 or $20,000 and no mention was made of Doyle.

25|$|Despite reaffirming her {{commitment}} to UCLA in early 2000, Kaczmarski {{did not return to}} UCLA for her sophomore year, opting to stay in New York instead. She had been suffering from lyme disease, as well as plantar fasciitis due to an injury she suffered at trials for the USA Basketball World University Games team. In addition, Kaczmarski had also been experiencing difficulty adjusting to <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from home. It was also reported that Kaczmarski had enrolled at UCLA against her father's wishes. In December 2000, Kaczmarski formally requested a letter of release so she could transfer to another school. Copies of the letter were sent to Duke University, the University of Florida, the University of Georgia and the University of Virginia.

25|$|There {{are several}} reasons which had brought about this {{situation}} – most significantly in the early 20th century there was no firmly upheld legislation to protect what is now {{considered to be the}} nation's heritage. Additionally, public opinion did not have the sentiment and interest in national heritage that is evident in Britain today. When the loss of Britain's architectural heritage reached its height at the rate of one house every five days in 1955, few were particularly interested or bothered. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, to the British public still suffering from the deprivations of food rationing and restriction on building work the destruction of these great redundant houses was of little interest. From 1914 onwards there had been a huge exodus away from a life in domestic service; having experienced the less restricted and better paid <b>life</b> <b>away</b> from the great estates, few were anxious to return – this in itself was a further reason that life in the English country house was becoming near impossible to all but the very rich.|$|E
