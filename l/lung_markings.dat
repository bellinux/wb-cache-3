50|$|Hyperaeration or {{hyperinflation}} {{is where}} the lung volume is abnormally increased, with increased filling of the alveoli. This results in an increased radiolucency on X-ray, a reduction in <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> and depression of the diaphragm.

30|$|Chest radiographs are the {{cornerstone}} for diagnosing pneumothorax. If a pneumothorax is present, a white visceral pleural line separates the lung from the chest wall, with loss of normal <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> peripheral to this white line (Fig.  1 a, b).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a disease pattern with a distinctive clinico-radiological picture but of an undetermined pathology. The main features are quietening of the breath sounds and lessening of the radiographic <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> with persistently greater transradiancy over one lung, the condition being distinguishable from simple unilateral ob-structive emphysema {{by the small}} or normal size of the affected lung {{and the absence of}} evidence of bronchial obstruction. Bronchoscopy reveals no abnormality of the major bronchi, and broncho-graphy shows the contrast oil flowing freely into an almost normal bronchial tree. These observations are based on a study of nine well-developed cases. None of these showe...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 52 -year-old woman with a 1 -year history of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease referred to hospital because of aggravated pulmonary symptoms in spite of intensive treatment including prednisone, azathioprine and triptergium glycoside. We subsequently initiated treatment with 25 mg of etanercept, subcutaneously injected twice weekly. Following 6 months of therapy with this agent, sustained improvement in dyspnea, cough was reported by the patient and respiratory function test showed marked improvement. The improvement was confirmed by reduced middle and lower <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> on chest radiography and high-resolution CT scan.

Materials and methodsThis study was a retrospective view of the records of 29 adult renal transplant recipients developed pulmonary infection during December 2011 to July 2014 in our hospital. The chest radiographs and computer tomography (CT) examinations were interpreted by two radiologists independently. ResultsPulmonary infections after renal transplantation {{were more likely to}} occur within 6 months after transplantation, and the peak being at about 3 months. Mixed infections (18 cases, 62. 1 %) were the common types, followed by virus infection (7 cases, 24. 1 %) and bacterial infection (4 cases, 13. 8 %). In 10 patients taken chest radiographs with pulmonary infections after renal transplantation, patchy shadow and/or increased <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> were showed in 7 cases (70 %). CT manifestations of pulmonary infections after kidney transplantation were diverse and complex, lacking characteristic signs. Ground glass opacity (GGO) was the most common CT manifestation in cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections.

40|$|The authors {{reported}} a newborn female baby, 36 weeks gestational age, 2, 680 gms who developed respiratory distress at 2 hours after birth. Her chest roentgenograms showed a normal-sized heart, sparse <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> and bilateral masses involving the posterior 6 th to 8 th ribs. Thoracotomy with partial {{removal of the}} left chest mass was performed when she was 12 hours age. Postoperatively, the baby developed progressive respiratory distress and expired at 29 hours – age. Autopsy revealed bilateral nodular masses arising from the inner side of the posterior aspect of the 6 th to 8 th ribs, measuring 6 x 5 x 4 cm (right) and 7 x 6 x 4 cm (left). The cut surfaces showed multicystic spaces containing blood. Histologically, many blood filled spaces with walls of fibroblasts, cartilage and bone tissue were noted. The diagnosis was mesenchymal hamartoma of the chest wall. Mesenchymal hamartoma of the chest wall usually arises from the posterior or lateral portions of the rib and usually involves many ribs. Multi focal lesions and bilaterality are rare. The clinical presentation can be asymptomatic, mild or severe respiratory distress. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice...|$|E

40|$|A 40 -year-old Chinese woman {{presented}} with com-plaints of recurrent cough with wheezing. She {{had a history}} of bronchial asthma for 5 years for which she was receiving inhalers prescribed by her family physi-cian, but her symptoms worsened despite being com-pliant to medications. She had progressive decreased effort tolerance with increasing shortness of breath and increased frequency of wheezing episodes for which she had to seek treatment at the emergency depart-ment. She had no other medical conditions. She did not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. There was no occu-pational exposure to toxic substances. Family history was not significant. On physical examination, her vital signs were normal but she was dyspneic. Wheezing was heard on auscul-tation over both hemithoraces. The rest of the exami-nation was normal. Blood tests done showed a normal CBC count, but the renal panel showed elevated bicarbonate levels suggesting metabolic alkalosis. Arte-rial blood gas revealed compensated chronic hypercap-nic respiratory failure. She subsequently had severe bronchospasm that required intubation andmechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. A chest radiograph showed focal increased <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> over the right lower zone (Fig 1). CT scan of the thorax including a three-dimensional recon-struction showed marked thickening of the trachea from the level of the vocal cords extending inferiorly to the segmental bronchi with irregular calcification within the thickened tracheal and bronchial wall. There was also volume loss of the right middle lobe (Figs 2 – 4). Bronchoscopy was then performed, which showed patchy areas of erythema, mucosal irregularity especially on the posterior membranous wall, and splaying of the main carina (Fig 5) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effects of potato extract (PE) on cigarette smoke (CS) –induced {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Methods: PE was first prepared by frozen centrifugation, and its amino acid composition was detected. Toxicity of PE was analyzed by changes in morphology, behavior, routine blood indexes, and biochemical criteria of mice. Then, the COPD rat model was established by CS exposure, and PE, doxofylline, and prednisolone acetate were used to treat these rats. After 45 days of treatment, the morphology and behavior of rats were recorded. In addition, the histopathology of lung tissue was evaluated by chest x-ray and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of interleukine- 10 (IL- 10), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was detected in serum and lung tissue by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: Various amino acids were identified in PE, and no toxicity was exhibited in mice. The CS-induced COPD rat model was successfully established, which exhibited significant thickened and disordered <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> on 90 % of the rats. After administering doxofylline and prednisolone acetate, inflammation symptoms were improved. However, side effects such as emaciation, weakness, and loosening of teeth appeared. In the PE group, obviously improved histopathology was observed in lung tissues. Meanwhile, it was revealed that PE could increase the expression of IL- 10 and reduce the expression of TNF-α and G-CSF in COPD rats, and doxofylline and prednisolone acetate also elicited similar results. Conclusion: Our study suggests PE might be effective in the treatment of CS-induced COPD by inhibiting inflammation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Chest {{radiography}} {{accounts for}} {{a significant proportion of}} ionising radiation in children. The radiation dose of radiographs performed on the Lodox Statscan system {{has been shown to be}} lower than that of a computed radiography (CR) system. The role of the Lodox Statscan (hereafter referred to as the Statscan) in routine erect chest radiography in children has not been evaluated. Objective: To evaluate the image quality and diagnostic accuracy of erect paediatric chest radiographs obtained with the Statscan and compare this with conventional erect chest images obtained with a CR system. Materials and Methods: Thirty three children with suspected chest pathology were enrolled randomly over a period of three months. Erect chest radiographs were obtained with the Statscan, and a Shimadzu R- 20 J X-ray machine coupled with a Fuji FCR 5000 CR system. Image quality and diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic capability were evaluated between the two modalities. Results: The erect Statscan allowed superior visualisation of the three major airways. Statscan images however, demonstrated exposure and movement artifacts with hemidiaphragms and ribs most prone to movement. Bronchovascular clarity was also considered unsatisfactory on the Statscan images. Conclusion: The Statscan has limitations in erect chest radiography in terms of movement artefacts, exposure fluctuations, and poor definition of <b>lung</b> <b>markings.</b> Despite this, the Statscan allows better visualisation of the major airways, equivalent to a ‘high KV’ film at a fraction of the radiation dose. This supports the finding of an earlier study evaluating Statscan images in trauma cases, where the images were taken supine. Statscan has great potential in assisting in the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis where airway narrowing occurs as a result of nodal compression...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{appraise}} {{the role}} of chest radiography (CXR) in the clinical assessment of pulmonary complications occurring {{as a result of}} liver disease of any cause, a standardised reading of CXR was compared both with the results of lung function studies and with the severity of liver disease in 60 consecutive patients with cirrhosis candidates to liver transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXR were scored for signs of cardiomegaly, enlargement of central and or peripheral vessels, hyperkinetic circulatory and/or intravascular volume states, abnormally increased interstitial <b>lung</b> <b>markings,</b> and pleural effusion by three independent observers. RESULTS: The CXR score of this complete vascular-interstitial deficiency showed a high interobserver reproducibility and was significantly increased in those patients with a more decompensated liver cirrhosis. Moreover, a larger number of CXR signs of vascular and interstitial deficiency was present in those patients who had a more severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class 3). Functional indices of pulmonary gas exchange and diffusing capacity were worse in patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis, and for some indices the correlation was statistically significant. The comparison between lung function and CXR score showed that on average lung function impairment was significantly less severe in patients with lower CXR scores. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the information derived from a standardised reading of CXR is valuable in the clinical assessment of the pulmonary damage induced by liver cirrhosis as it allows discrimination of classes of severity of liver disease and of lung function impairment. When integrated with physiologic measurements and, if necessary, with high resolution tomographic studies, chest radiography helps to discriminate patients with advanced liver cirrhosis and progressing towards a hepatopulmonary syndrome, who need a proper therapeutic management...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} value of direct digital {{radiography}} (DR) and CT in the screening of tuberculosis. Methods: In a tuberculosis outbreak in May, 2014, both chest DR and CT were taken in the close contacts (n =  35 cases). The chi square test and ROC curve were used to evaluate and calculate the missed pulmonary lesions from DR and the natures of these lesions. Results: Abnormal shadow detection rates of chest DR and CT were 22. 9 % (8 / 35) and 40 % (14 / 35) respectively, the difference was statistically significant (χ 2  =  16. 154, P <  0. 01). In the 6 missed cases from chest DR, 3 cases showed with anatomical occult or overlap, such as local area between azygos vein and esophagus (1 case), <b>lung</b> <b>markings</b> in the lower lobe (1 case) and diaphragmatic occlusion(1 case); {{and in the other}} 3 missed cases, early signs of small nodules or tree-in-bud were the major signs. ROC analysis showed that when the axis of tree-in-bud is less than 22  mm, it was prone to produce misdiagnosis by using the chest DR. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0. 925 with the sensitivity of 90 % and specificity of 83. 3 %. In the 14 cases detected on CT, the lung was involved in 12 cases and the pleura was involved in 2 cases. For the 12 lung-involved cases, the lesions involving from one lung segment to five lung segments were occurred in 6 cases (50. 0 %), 2 cases (16. 7 %), 1 case (8. 3 %), 1 case (8. 3 %), and 2 cases (16. 7 %), respectively. Tree-in-bud signs were the main CT characteristics in close contacts, and accounted for about 91. 7 % (11 / 12). All the 4 pleura-involved cases showed pleural thickening and pleural tuberculoma after 3 – 4 months' anti-TB therapy. In the 14 cases detected by CT, 6 cases with micro-lesions were taken by anti-TB experimental treatment, only 2 cases was significantly absorbed of the lesions after 2 months, and all the lesions of the 6 cases absorbed after 6 months anti-TB treatment. Conclusion: CT is more valuable in the screen of TB outbreak in school compared with DR. Subclinical cases detected by CT is recommended to take a formal anti-TB treatment...|$|E
