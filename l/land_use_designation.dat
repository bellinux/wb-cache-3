50|$|A {{green belt}} or {{greenbelt}} {{is a policy}} and <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designation</b> used in land use planning to retain areas of largely undeveloped, wild, or agricultural land surrounding or neighbouring urban areas. Similar concepts are greenways or green wedges which have a linear character and may run through an urban area instead of around it. In essence, a green belt is an invisible line designating a border around a certain area, preventing development of the area and allowing wildlife to return and be established.|$|E

50|$|Many {{residential}} {{structures in}} Mission Beach {{were built in}} the 1930s and '40s as summer cottages and some date as early as the 1920s. The rare airplane bungalow on Manhattan Court was built in 1924. Because of problems to work out with developing on sand, Mission Beach developed later than the neighboring communities of Ocean Beach to the south and Pacific Beach to the north. As a result of a new official subdivision in 1914, encouraged by land sales in those next-door communities and a new wooden bridge linking Mission Beach with Ocean Beach, John D. Spreckels offered small lots for sale. As a result, Mission Beach is the most densely developed residential community in San Diego with a <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designation</b> across the majority of its land area of 36 dwelling units per acre. It also has the smallest lots in the city, ranging from 1250 sq ft to 2400 sq ft. Few have been consolidated to form larger lots. Many of the structures within the community have been redeveloped into two-story homes. The wooden bridge to Ocean Beach was closed to traffic in 1950 and demolished in 1951.|$|E

40|$|Arizona National Forest land {{managers}} have {{a multitude of}} tasks and priorities; historically, caves and karst management has not been amongst the priorities receiving any significant allocation of resources. When caves and karst management {{is not included in}} the Forest Plan, even when large and significant cave and karst areas exist, active cave and karst management often falls below the waterline of available manpower and resources. Additionally, there is entropy associated with normal changes in personnel assignments and new staff coming onboard. When combined with a general lack of written policies and guidelines, these personnel transitions lead to unnecessary degradation of the karst and caves. Three areas impacted by lack of caves and karst policy include timber management (sales and thinning), water recharge protection (buffer zones), and cave management (under the recreation department). This paper is intended for Forest managers whose units contain significant karst and caves, but have no allocated staff in these areas. The paper presents clear and acceptable guidelines and policies that can be implemented in a uniform manner. Integral to these guidelines is the inclusion of Karst and Cave Areas as a separate <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designation</b> in the Forest Plan. With karst listed as a <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designation</b> in the Forest Plan, references to a separate Cave and Karst Management Plan document can be made.

40|$|We examine {{inconsistencies}} {{in the application}} of environmental laws and policies to California's oak woodlands and associated resources. Specifically, large-scale vegetation removals receive different levels of environmental oversight depending on location, tree species, and the final <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designation.</b> Hence, situations arise where the scale of impacts to the ecosystem can be similar but are regulated differently depending on forest type. These inconsistencies can lead to environmental impacts, confusion, and inherent inequities among private landowners. The historical, institutional, and political climate under which the Forest Practice Act and California Environmental Quality Act were developed has resulted in the dichotomy that oak woodlands face. We use agricultural development in California’s North Coast watersheds and the potential impacts to anadromous fish conservation to illustrate the problem. Examining this scenario provides {{a better understanding of how}} and why oak woodland resources continue to diminish in some parts of California.

40|$|The Niagara Escarpment {{is one of}} Southern Ontario’s most {{important}} landscapes. Due {{to the nature of}} the landform and its location, the Escarpment is subject to various development pressures including urban expansion, mineral resource extraction, agricultural practices and recreation. In 1985, Canada’s first large scale environmentally based <b>land</b> <b>use</b> plan was put in place to ensure that only development that is compatible with the Escarpment occurred within the Niagara Escarpment Plan (NEP). The southern extent of the NEP is of particular interest in this study, since a portion of the Plan is located within the rapidly expanding Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The Plan area located in the Regional Municipalities of Hamilton and Halton represent both urban and rural geographical areas respectively, and are both experiencing development pressures and subsequent changes in land cover. Monitoring initiatives on the NEP have been established, but have done little to identify consistent techniques for monitoring land cover on the Niagara Escarpment. Land cover information is an important part of planning and environmental monitoring initiatives. Remote sensing has the potential to provide frequent and accurate land cover information over various spatial scales. The goal of this research was to examine land cover change in the Regional Municipalities of Hamilton and Halton portions of the NEP. This was achieved through the creation of land cover maps for each region using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) remotely sensed data. These maps aided in determining the qualitative and quantitative changes that had occurred in the Plan area over a 20 year time period from 1986 to 2006. Change was also examined based on the NEP’s <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designations,</b> to determine if the Plan policy has been effective in protecting the Escarpment. To obtain land cover maps, five different supervised classification methods were explored: Minimum Distance, Mahalanobis Distance, Maximum Likelihood, Object-oriented and Support Vector Machine. Seven land cover classes were mapped (forest, water, recreation, bare agricultural fields, vegetated agricultural fields, urban and mineral resource extraction areas) at a regional scale. SVM proved most successful at mapping land cover on the Escarpment, providing classification maps with an average accuracy of 86. 7 %. Land cover change analysis showed promising results with an increase in the forested class and only slight increases to the urban and mineral resource extraction classes. Negatively, there was a decrease in agricultural land overall. An examination of land cover change based on the NEP <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designations</b> showed little change, other than change that is regulated under Plan policies, proving the success of the NEP for protecting vital Escarpment lands insofar as this can be revealed through remote sensing. Land cover should be monitored in the NEP consistently over time to ensure changes in the Plan area are compatible with the Niagara Escarpment. Remote sensing is a tool that can provide this information to the Niagara Escarpment Commission (NEC) in a timely, comprehensive and cost-effective way.

40|$|Wilderness areas often {{cry out for}} {{ecological}} restoration. Decades of fire suppression, livestock grazing, invasions of exotic species, and recreational impacts have left many U. S. wilderness areas degraded (Cole and Landres, 1996). Frequently ecosystem processes alone are insufficient to ameliorate these problems. As a result, wilderness managers often engage in ecological restoration. Managers are guided by the aims of wilderness preservation ensconced in the U. S Wilderness Act of 1964. These aims {{are at odds with}} a movement in the restoration community to increase volunteer participation in projects and to emphasize the human contribution to ecosystem structures. While the Wilderness Act directs managers to minimize the human dimension of ecosystems, proponents of participatory restoration highlight these same elements. The resulting “participation paradox ” raises deep issues about the human role in nature, the standards for successful restoration and the traditional conception of wilderness.

This dissertation focuses on two rural villages located on either side of a wildlife-agriculture boundary in the Okavango Delta. This dissertation has three objectives: 1) investigate how 16 years of participation in the CBNRM program has shaped participants? knowledge of community-based conservation, 2) evaluate how livelihood strategies have affected human-predator relationships, and 3) assess the linkages between local human-predator relationships, national land-use policies, and the behavior of large predators in the Okavango Delta. To address the first objective, analysis was performed on qualitative interviews. Responses from interviews revealed participation in CBNRM has led to increased knowledge and sense of ownership of CBNRM as well as increased perceived benefits from the program. For the second objective, I asked residents about their attitudes towards and tolerance of lions and elephants in the village participating in CBNRM as well as residents in the neighboring village in the agricultural zone. I found significant differences in attitudes between residents in the wildlife zone and residents in the agricultural zone. The difference in tolerance to elephants and lions was less pronounced. Finally, I used a social-ecological approach to reveal how land-use policy influences relationships between local villagers and wildlife. I found that <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designations</b> have placed serious constraints on the livelihood options for people in both villages, while simultaneously giving people in both villages access to new international markets, namely safari tourism for the wildlife area and beef export for the agricultural side. In this context, lions have become important drivers of both markets.

40|$|Cities within California are {{beginning}} to incorporate urban agriculture into their <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designations.</b> Prompted by residents and local organizations, cities are hoping to capture the benefits that urban agriculture provides. Research has shown that urban agriculture renews and beautifies neighborhoods, provides healthy food choices, increases public health, {{has the potential to}} help with stormwater runoff, creates jobs, and fosters community. In the last few years, several California cities have made headlines as they have adopted new zoning codes that include urban agriculture. In reviewing these new zoning codes and exploring the topic of urban agriculture, it became evident that just because an urban farm was small, organic and provided certain benefits that it was not free from impacting its surroundings. As more urban agricultural ventures are established within cities, planners have to carefully consider their effect. One such impact could be stormwater pollution. There is insufficient research to determine whether there is a relationship between urban agriculture and stormwater, however, studies on conventional agriculture and urban landscaping (mainly urban lawns) show that each of these areas pollute the local water bodies with sediment, chemicals, and nutrients. Is urban agriculture different? This thesis utilizes two case studies within California, the City of Oakland and the City of San Diego, to examine the similarities and differences between each city’s urban agriculture ordinances and evaluate whether or not the cities have adjusted stormwater requirements in parallel with these ordinances.

Methods were developed to summarize dimensions of habitat value for six representative aquatic and terrestrial contaminated sites at the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) on the US Department of Energy Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, TN, USA. Several general valuation metrics were developed for three broad categories: site use by groups of organisms, site rarity, and use value added from spatial context. Examples of use value metrics are taxa richness, a direct measure of number of species that inhabit an area, complexity of habitat structure, an indirect measure of potential number of species that may use the area, and <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designation,</b> {{a measure of the}} length of time that the area will be available for use. Measures of rarity included presence of rare species or communities. Examples of metrics for habitat use value added from spatial context included similarity or complementarity of neighboring habitat patches and presence of habitat corridors. More specific metrics were developed for groups of organisms in contaminated streams, ponds, and terrestrial ecosystems. For each of these metrics, cutoff values for high, medium, and low habitat value were suggested, based o...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The Willamette River and its {{floodplain}} {{in northwest}} Oregon have changed dramatically since European settlement. At one time, {{the river was}} a vast complex system of braided channels with a broad floodplain forest; {{it has now been}} simplified by channelization and dams, and the forest has been removed to support agricultural and urban expansion. This thesis presents three research manuscripts, each of which uses remote sensing and Geographical Information System methods to capture the dynamic nature of land along the Willamette River. In the first article, the river and its floodplain were mapped at four time periods, ranging from pre-settlement to modern day. The paper reports that the river system has been greatly simplified, and the floodplain has lost much of its original forest. An overlay technique was used to identify potential floodplain restoration sites. The second paper details the creation of a landcover map for the Willamette Valley, which shows that the largest portion of the floodplain is now in agriculture, with a significant amount in a built condition. The third manuscript outlines a methodology for detecting land cover change along the river during a twenty-year period that coincides with the implementation of the Willamette River Greenway, a <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designation</b> designed to restrict riparian land conversion. It shows that regressive change is still occuring along the river, although not {{at the same rate as}} outside the greenway. The three papers lay the foundation for a future study to analyze the socioeconomic conditions which promote change...|$|E

30|$|Dry season grazing {{reserves}} {{compose a}} variable but {{significant proportion of}} the communal village lands throughout northern Tanzania's pastoralist areas. These grazing reserves function as de facto village-level conserved areas or, to use the IUCN (World Conservation Union) terminology, as Community Conserved Areas (Kothari 2006). The maintenance of reserved grazing areas in pastoralist villages, managed at the communal scale, is a key reason why extensive unfragmented savannah landscapes continue to exist in northern Tanzania, across vast areas with little formal governmental regulation of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> such as the Maasai steppe. Traditional pastoralist <b>land</b> <b>use</b> practices and <b>designations</b> give northern Tanzania much of its wild or wilderness character, which in turn is a central reason why this landscape both supports wildlife and attracts foreign tourists to the degree that it does.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to revitalize a Latino, urban, {{neighborhood}} in Irvington, {{on the east side}} of Indianapolis, Indiana, using three levels of design. The 350 -acre framework plan includes the area along Washington Street with Irvington Street as the western border, Kitley Avenue as the eastern boundary, University Avenue as the southern border, and Lowell Avenue as the northern boundary. The 84. 5 -acre master plan site extends from Bolton Avenue east to Kitley Avenue, and from University Avenue to half a block north of Washington Street. The I. 54 -acre site-scale plan includes the new Central Plaza and adjacent buildings that front Washington Street between Kenmore and Ridgeview Avenues. The project focuses on integrating the Latino population into the neighborhood and using the culture as design inspiration. This is accomplished by creating compact developments using sustainable development principles, providing affordable housing options, providing opportunities for educational and community services, and using characteristics of the Latino culture, such as the use of plazas and the importance of dance, to determine <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>designations.</b> The plans embrace the Latino culture and create an interesting place for all current and future residents of Irvington. Many elements of design accommodate Latino culture, but also provide a better quality of life for all residents. Case studies of mixed-use and sustainable developments in Indianapolis and across the United States provide insight on how to create a sustainable development that accommodates the Latino population. Research about Latino culture, urban revitalization methods, and how the topics can be inter-related guides the design principles for the Irvington neighborhood renewal. Latinos transform urban environments, and the plans build upon these transformations as a means to integrate the culture into the neighborhood. Latino culture also places emphasis on family values, social networks, and the use of public open space for large gatherings, and these elements of Latino culture are considered in all levels of design. Because of the adversity Latino immigrants face, the design also includes affordable housing, services, and organizations to facilitate upward mobility. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
