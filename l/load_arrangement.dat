40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{the performance of}} a modified large scale shear box apparatus, which is mainly used to execute full scale laboratory study of segmental retaining walls. A typical apparatus has already been adopted by the current ASTM and NCMA test protocols and by literature studying of those test protocols, it is found that protocols recommend a fixed vertical actuator with roller or airbag configuration as a proposed vertical loading assembly. Previous research study demonstrated that vertical <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement</b> greatly influences the interface shear capacity of block systems and fixed vertical actuator with flexible airbag shows better <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the blocks which have dilatant behavior. However, airbag arrangement is strenuous and time-consuming loading assembly compared to fixed vertical actuator which increases normal load with shear displacement due to bending of vertical actuator locked with the top block during shear loading. For the drawbacks of fixed vertical <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the apparatus used in this study was fully redesigned and modified in terms of normal <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement</b> specially. A moveable vertical loading assembly is used in the modified apparatus which allows the piston movement with the top blocks during shear testing. The results outlined in this paper report that normal load remains constant over the period of shear testing {{for a wide range of}} surcharge loading. It could easily be concluded that the modified apparatus might be a better alternative to the existing apparatus used in the test protocols. ...|$|R

Three types of blocks with {{different}} laminate directions in the middle/second layers were used: 0 / 30 / 0, 0 / 45 / 0 and 0 / 90 / 0. Simulations with three-dimensional quadratic orthotropic linear elastic finite elements were conducted. The {{goal was to}} compare tested in-plane shear stiffnesses for CLT blocks made from Norway Spruce (Picea abies) boards of C 24 quality with a finite element (FEM) simulated block stiffness. Three-layer CLT were studied with block dimensions of 600 x 600 x 45 mm. The first and last layer laminate directions were assumed to be 0 ○. The middle layer laminate directions were 30 ○, 45 ○ and 90 ○. A 1 mm gap was assumed between the side edges. The glued contact surfaces were assumed to be perfectly glued with rigid glue in the simulations. In the practically tested blocks a PVAc D 2 classified glue was used. All blocks were simulated and tested in the same <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement</b> as the practical test set-up. The blocks were compressed in the diagonal direction. Blocks of 0 / 30 / 0 and 0 / 45 / 0 were compressed twice, once over each diagonal. The 0 / 90 / 0 blocks were compressed over one diagonal. A total of 19 practical compression tests was performed; in all cases, the displacements were measured in the force- and orthogonal direction. The stiffest loading case, measured in the force direction, was the <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement</b> 0 / 45 / 0 -A.

In the Up-THERM heat converter, a constant temperature difference imposed by an external heat source and sink leads to periodic evaporation and condensation {{of the working}} fluid, which gives rise to sustained oscillations of pressure and volumetric displacement. These oscillations are converted in a <b>load</b> <b>arrangement</b> into a unidirectional flow, which passes through a hydraulic motor that extracts useful work from the device.

40|$|Three {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of the ultimate stress in external tendons are introduced and commented. They are bonded reduction methods, regression formulas related to reinforcement index and deformation-based methods. It is shown that deformation-based methods can reflect the characteristic of the coupling between the flexural strength and the entire deformation in prestressed concrete members with external tendons. In the deformation-based methods, two commonly adopted models for computing the length of equivalent plastic region are critically investigated. It is found the model based on the span-depth ratio together with loading type places much emphasis on the effects of loading type on the ultimate stress increment in external tendons. In addition, for the ultimate limit state of a highway bridge with moving traffic loads, it is difficult for designers to judge the coefficient which is related to the load type and <b>load</b> <b>arrangement.</b> In contrast, the key parameter in the model based on the neutral axis depth for computing the length of equivalent plastic region, is stable and consistent and can be treated as a constant.

40|$|U-section {{steel sheet}} piles {{are used for}} {{constructing}} retaining walls and they are connected together to form continuous walls using sliding joints located along their centerlines. Interpile movement along these joints can, in theory, reduce strength by 55 % and stiffness by 70 %, {{in comparison with the}} performance of piles in which no slip occurs (full composite action). This problem of interlock slippage is known as reduced modulus action (RMA). Despite the potential for this problem, it is common practice in many countries to ignore RMA in design, although the exact conditions governing when it becomes a design issue are not fully understood. This paper presents results from an investigation into this problem using experimental tests carried out using miniature piles. Unlike previous studies these tests were carried out using a similar <b>load</b> <b>arrangement</b> to that found in practice. The investigation indicates that the loading configuration affects the development of RMA and that friction between pile interlocks has the potential to mitigate much of the effect of RMA.

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the spring loaded rack and pinion. This spring <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement</b> consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The spring <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement</b> helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the spring loading can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in spring loading. The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R

40|$|Stringer-to-floor-beam {{connections}} in riveted railway bridges have {{in many cases}} shown to be critical details with respect to fatigue. These connections, while generally designed with respect to shear forces alone, are often subjected to repeated out-of-plane distortion as a re-sult of their rotational stiffness. Static and fatigue tests involving three full-scale bridge parts have been conducted in order to study the behavior and the fatigue performance of riveted double-angle connections. The bridge parts were taken from an old riveted railway bridge built in 1896 and demolished in 1993. Each test specimen consisted of three floor beams and four stringers connected to each other with riv-eted double angles. Fig. 1 shows the set-up of the test specimens and <b>loading</b> <b>arrangement,</b> to-gether with a detail of the double-angle connections. Finite element analysis of the tested specimens was also performed in order to more closely study the load-deformation characteris-tics of these connections...|$|R
40|$|Past {{earthquakes}} in Indonesia {{have caused}} {{loss of life}} and major damage to buildings and infrastructure. Most of the damage was experienced on non-engineered buildings, which were conventionally built with less consideration of earthquake resistant design. In this research, a precast system was introduced for non-engineered building structures to connect their practical beams and columns as a reinforced concrete frame. This paper presents experimental tests on precast reinforced concrete frames with and without infill masonry walls using local materials. All undamaged and repaired specimens were set {{up with the same}} <b>loading</b> <b>arrangements</b> where lateral <b>loads</b> were gradually applied {{to one side of the}} beam column joint until the ultimate load was reached. Simple retrofitting and strengthening techniques were applied to the damaged specimens were conducted. The results were compared based on the experimental tests, and showed that retrofitted and strengthened specimens significantly increased their strength, stiffness, and displacement ductility to improve the structural behaviour of non-engineered building structures. ...|$|R
