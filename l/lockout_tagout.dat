40|$|Thesis (MIng (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the risk(s) associated with lockout/tagout of hazardous energy and propose a new LOTO procedure which tracks the implementation of LOTO to mitigate against identified risks as a basis for promotion of safety. The study focuses on electrical personnel working in PHCN. Only electrical accident risks are examined, not other types of risk e. g. mechanical, chemical, and nuclear. To gather material for this study, a questionnaire was distributed amongst electrical workers in PHCN and their supervisors were interviewed. Relevant literature and publications were studied as reference. According to electrical personnel experience, electrocution, arc flash, arc blast, burns and <b>lockout</b> and <b>tagout</b> of the wrong electrical circuit are seen as the biggest electrical safety risk with regards to LOTO of hazardous energy. The research reveals new information about electrical accident risks. This information is used to create a procedure for tracking LOTO of hazardous energy. The procedure can be utilized in the mitigation of electrical risks and promotion ofMaster...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with energized circuit conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric arc exposes eyes and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. <b>Lockout</b> and <b>tagout</b> procedures are used {{to make sure that}} circuits are proven to be de-energized before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; grounding (earthing) clamps and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is de-energized. Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be de-energized, insulated tools are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.|$|R

40|$|Electrical arcing {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common form of electrical injury in mining. MSHA data show that 381 "non-contact electric arc burn" injuries occurred in the mining industry from 1996 - 2005. A more detailed study of data from 1990 - 2001 showed that five types of apparatus - circuit breakers, conductors, nonpowered hand tools, electrical meters and test leads, and connectors and plugs were involved in two-thirds of the lost workday injuries. Many of the protections from electrical arcing injury available to workers in other industries stem from the application of National Fire Protection Association Standard 70 E - Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace (NFPA 70 E). NFPA 70 E is a generally accepted industry guideline document, but excludes underground mining from its scope. Many of its practices and procedures, however, can be applied in the mining workplace to supplement the existing electrical safety requirements of Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations. This paper describes how NFPA 70 E can be applied to mining workplaces after an analysis of the mine power system electrical arcing hazards has been completed (and Hazard/Risk Categories determined) using the tables from NFPA 70 E or the calculation method as described in IEEE 1584. NFPA 70 E can then be used to determine the levels and types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect miners against burn injuries. Appropriate <b>lockout</b> and <b>tagout</b> (LOTO) procedures for use in the mining industry are also described. Suggestions for better selection of electrically-rated hand tools are included. Recommendations for electrical meter selection and use based on transient withstand capability are also discussed...|$|R
