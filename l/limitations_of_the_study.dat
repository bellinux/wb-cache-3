One of the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> {{was the use of}} subjective health performance indicators since {{there is a lack of}} definition on such indicators by current studies.|$|E
50|$|The Great Lakes {{have been}} {{polluted}} with industrial wastes (mainly PCBs and DDT) {{since the beginning}} of the 20th century. These compounds have accumulated in birds and sports fish. A study was designed to assess the impact of consumption of contaminated fish on pregnant women and their children. Concentrations of maternal serum PCB and DDE and their daughters' age at menarche were reviewed. In multivariate analysis, DDE but not PCB was linked with a lowered age of menarche. <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> included indirect measurement of the exposure and self reporting of menarche.|$|E

5000|$|One study {{looked at}} {{commercial}} buildings and their employees, comparing some environmental factors suspected of inducing SBS to a self-reported {{survey of the}} occupants, finding that the measured psycho-social circumstances appeared more influential than the tested environmental factors. [...] The list of environmental factors in the study can be found here. [...] <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> include that it only measured the indoor environment of commercial buildings, which have different building codes than residential buildings, and that the assessment of building environment was based on layman observation of {{a limited number of}} factors.|$|E
50|$|RESULTS: Primary {{outcome was}} a single rating that {{combined}} several indicators: restrictiveness of youth living situation, school attendance, job/job training attendance, and serious problem behaviors. Youths received ratings of “good” if {{they were living in}} regular community placements, attending school and/or working {{for the majority of the}} week, and had fewer than three days of serious behavior problems during the course of previous month. At 2-year follow-up, 47% of the wraparound groups received a rating of good, compared to 8% of youths in traditional MH services. <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> include study attrition and group non-equivalence at baseline.|$|E
5000|$|In early May it was {{reported}} that testing of more than 20,000 Chinese who had influenza-like illnesses in March and April turned up only six cases of H7N9 infection. [...] "We did not find evidence of widespread mild disease, suggesting that the reported cases reflect the true distribution of infection and not a surveillance artifact," [...] the researchers wrote. The study suggests that the reported mortality rate is accurate, however the researchers noted several <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> including that the testing was carried out in city hospitals only and therefore may not have detected cases in rural areas.|$|E
30|$|Main <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is {{that even}} if all known {{confounding}} factors were introduced in the model, unknown confounding factors {{might not have been}} considered.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> major <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is <b>the</b> {{retrospective}} <b>study</b> design, which renders randomization impossible. <b>The</b> non-randomized <b>study</b> design {{could explain}} the difference in previous treatments between the groups.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{athletes to}} define <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> diet {{followed}} in the 3  month period prior to the race.|$|R

5000|$|In 2011, The Ohio State University {{released}} {{the results of}} an independent scientific study stating that the Above the Influence campaign appears to have effectively reduced marijuana use by teenagers. [...] "Evidence for the success of Above the Influence is especially heartening because the primary independent evaluation of its predecessor campaign, 'My Anti-Drug', showed no evidence for success", said Michael Slater, principal investigator of the new study and professor of communication at Ohio State University.“The ‘Above the Influence’ campaign appears to be successful because it taps into the desire by teenagers to be independent and self-sufficient,” Slater said. He also mentioned the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> These include the fact that findings regarding the ONDCP campaign were based on survey results and not a randomized, experimental design in which some youth saw the ONDCP campaign and others did not. Another limitation was that the study, while taking place in 20 communities around the U.S., did not use a random sample of U.S. youth.|$|E
50|$|Messner and Lalakea studied {{speech in}} {{children}} with ankyloglossia. They noted that the phonemes likely to be affected due to ankyloglossia include sibilants and lingual sounds such as 'r'. In addition, the authors also state that it is uncertain as to which patients will have a speech disorder that {{can be linked to}} ankyloglossia and {{that there is no way}} to predict at a young age which patients will need treatment. The authors studied 30 children from one to 12 years of age with ankyloglossia, all of whom underwent frenuloplasty. Fifteen children underwent speech evaluation before and after surgery. Eleven patients were found to have abnormal articulation before surgery and nine of these patients were found to have improved articulation after surgery. Based on the findings, the authors concluded that it is possible for children with ankyloglossia to have normal speech in spite of decreased tongue mobility. However, according to their study, a large percentage of children with ankyloglossia will have articulation deficits that can be linked to tongue-tie and these deficits may be improved with surgery. The authors also note that ankyloglossia does not cause a delay in speech or language, but at the most, problems with enunciation. <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> include a small sample size as well as a lack of blinding of the speech-language pathologists who evaluated the subjects’ speech.|$|E
30|$|Another <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> {{quantitative}} data like absolute blood flow and cardiac flow reserve which could confirm <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>of</b> microvascular dysfunction better than SPECT can do.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> last <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is that {{we always}} {{have to keep in mind}} that any {{measurements}} done on dynamic MRI images of valsalva are dependent on the patient’s ability to push reproducibly.|$|R
30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> {{is that we}} did {{not measure}} <b>the</b> {{severity}} <b>of</b> headaches which would have influenced <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> lost productive time as shown in the working population (Manandhar et al. 2015).|$|R
5000|$|A {{study by}} Reis et Al. {{investigated}} {{the prevalence of}} fatigue {{on a group of}} Portuguese airline pilots. 1500 active airline pilots who had all flown within the past 6 months received a questionnaire. Out of the population, 456 reliable responses were received. A pretest was conducted to determine the viability of the fatigue scale adopted during the test, called Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The purpose of the validation survey was to set a benchmark (i.e. FSS=4) on an acceptable level of fatigue for the Portuguese culture. The scale ranged from 1 meaning no fatigue to 7 being high. Participants had one month and a half to respond to the inquiry. Results on physical fatigue found that 93% of short/medium haul pilots scored higher than 4 on the FSS while 84% of long-haul pilots scored greater than 4. Mental fatigue found short/medium haul at 96% and long haul at 92%. The Questionnaire also asked: [...] "Do you feel so tired that you shouldn’t be at the controls?". 13% of pilots said that this never happened. 51% of all participants said it happened a few times. <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> were: fatigue levels are subjective and research didn’t attempt to control a number of time pilots had available to respond to the questionnaires. Overall the study establishes that pilots are subject to high levels of fatigue on the job. Levels of fatigue collected were also compared with a validation test conducted on multiple sclerosis patients in Switzerland. These patients showed average fatigue levels of 4.6 while pilots in the Portuguese study scored an average of 5.3.|$|E

30|$|This section {{discusses}} {{the impacts of}} the finding and the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
30|$|We {{have studied}} only five samples {{in each group}}. The small number samples is a <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> However <b>the</b> uniform mode <b>of</b> failure in all samples in each group {{correlates}} with <b>the</b> statistical observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> main <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is <b>the</b> {{sample size}} with {{increased}} likelihood of type- 1 or type-II errors. <b>The</b> small number <b>of</b> patients in <b>the</b> treatment arm (n[*]=[*] 21) precludes strong conclusions on {{safety and efficacy}} of NRT.|$|R
30|$|The limited {{sample size}} {{represents}} one <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> and authors recommend encouraging similar <b>studies</b> in <b>the</b> field {{to provide a}} sufficient bank of evidences regarding predictors of response to first and second line biologics in refractory disease.|$|R
30|$|Although we {{carefully}} chose {{our study}} settings {{according to its}} population, {{we are aware of}} some <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
30|$|In this {{analysis}} we only focus on mathematics {{and on the}} cross-country analyses to illustrate the claims made and the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
30|$|The main <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> include {{relatively}} small sample used for case study. Second, though {{the sample is}} cross-cultural, business practices from the regions which have strong tradition on social entrepreneurship (for example, African countries besides South Africa) are underrepresented in the GEM sample and our case study data due to limited access to the data on these companies. Third, the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> are driven {{from the use of}} case method, which might lead to some distortion of theoretical findings.|$|E
30|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is that {{construct}} validity {{has only been}} tested against <b>the</b> expectation <b>of</b> outcome questions. It would have been useful to examine convergent and divergent validity by looking at correlations with other validated scales.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> main <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> {{was that}} more sectors across Kenya were not covered {{which would have}} {{facilitated}} comparative and a more broad-based analysis. Further, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> was not carried across all the stakeholders in the energy sectors to enable generalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> findings.|$|R
30|$|Finally, the {{proposed}} CSIT predictor is compared with nonpredictive CR in LTE-A {{in terms of}} five performance measures, i.e., spectrum utilization, sensing energy, channel switching rate, packet loss ratio (PLR), and average instantaneous throughput. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is also presented.|$|R
30|$|<b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> include its {{retrospective}} {{nature and}} {{the small number of}} subjects studied. However this could not be avoided considering the rarity of these findings.|$|E
30|$|<b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> {{includes}} {{that large}} number of patients can be included, longer time of follow-up, management strategy and drugs used for every patient, and social factors for every patient.|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{development}} of a more robust CIS access anomaly detection model, there are several <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> that we wish to point out to serve as a guidebook for future research on this topic.|$|E
30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> {{involves}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> {{only one}} CBCT model {{to capture the}} patient images. There exists <b>the</b> potential issue <b>of</b> variation between different CBCT models that may possibly possess varying image quality and gray value distributions for the aforementioned segmentation methods.|$|R
30|$|Second, for the {{widowhood}} method, {{though we}} were required to use information on <b>the</b> survivorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first spouse, the data we used was not detailed enough to determine whether respondents were in {{the first or second}} marriage. We recognise this as a <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{sample size}} was also a <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> In practice, {{although}} the sample includes only software testing professionals, its size is reduced in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real population. Perhaps the way the participation call was announced and {{the time it was}} available have limited the sample.|$|R
