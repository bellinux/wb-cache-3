5|$|Early in the Acadian orogeny, as the Acadian Mountains {{were rising}} up, {{the black and}} gray shales of the Hamilton Group began accumulating as erosion of the {{mountains}} deposited terrigenous sediments from the <b>land</b> <b>into</b> the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of Giffnock first appeared as Gisnock, in an atlas created by Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1654, the first atlas of Scotland. Giffnock {{was primarily a}} scattered farming community until the late 1780s, when Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton was forced to partition the <b>land</b> <b>into</b> {{a number of small}} properties for sale to raise finances.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-16thcentury Henry VIII of England {{dissolved}} the monasteries, {{resulting in}} the large areas of land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated. The Crown subsequently sold these large tracts of <b>land</b> <b>into</b> private ownership. Along with the land already belonging to lay owners, they formed some of the vast estate holdings which continued {{to exist in the}} Riding until the 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Remington and Innes later {{met with}} Menage and, in 1882, devised {{a plan to}} sell King's land to Menage for {{development}} without telling King. Menage also negotiated a separate deal with Innes (likely behind Remington's back) where he agreed to pay him one-third of the profits made from the land as a finder's fee and in exchange for Innes' help keeping Remington and King at bay. Menage proceeded to develop the <b>land</b> <b>into</b> housing and profited handsomely.|$|E
5|$|From the junction, M-86 and M-66 run {{concurrently}} to {{the north}} for about , at which point M-86 branches off to the east while M-66 continues on a northerly route. M-86 continues east through agricultural <b>land</b> <b>into</b> the village of Colon. The highway follows South Street and turns north on Blackstone Avenue between Sturgeon and Palmer lakes. Turning to follow State Street, the trunkline heads out of the village to the southeast. It continues eastward along Colon Road, passing north of Matteson Lake near Matteson and through Batavia Center. In Coldwater Township, M-86 experienced its lowest traffic level in 2009 at 1,872vehicles and 129trucks AADT. The highway terminates at US12 west of Coldwater near the Branch County Memorial Airport and Messenger Lake. No segment of M-86 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|In February 1926 William Matheson {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with D. P. Davis (a land developer, not related to Waters Davis) to develop and re-sell the northern half of Key Biscayne, including all {{of what is now}} Crandon Park and about half the present Village of Key Biscayne. Davis had experience with turning submerged or partially submerged <b>land</b> <b>into</b> prime real estate, having created the Davis Islands in Tampa and Davis Shores near St. Augustine. Later in 1926, the City of Coral Gables incorporated with Key Biscayne, which was included in its boundaries. There were dreams of a bridge to the island, making Key Biscayne the seaside resort for Coral Gables, as Miami Beach had become for Miami.|$|E

5|$|Interior Secretary Carl Schurz {{carried out}} Hayes's American Indian policy, {{beginning}} with preventing the War Department from {{taking over the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hayes and Schurz carried out a policy that included assimilation into white culture, educational training, and dividing Indian <b>land</b> <b>into</b> individual household allotments. Hayes believed that his policies would lead to self-sufficiency and peace between Indians and whites. The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, including Schurz, but instead proved detrimental to American Indians. They lost much of their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators. Hayes and Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations.|$|E
5|$|Support for the Provisional Government {{began to}} be tested when the issue of land reform and corvées was again brought to the forefront. Aside from the {{important}} conservative forces, opponents of the measure were to be found inside the leadership body itself, and included the moderates Heliade Rădulescu and Ioan Odobescu. Revolutionaries who favored passing <b>land</b> <b>into</b> the property of peasants were divided over the amount {{that was to be}} ceded, as well as over the issue of compensation to be paid to boyars. A compromise was reached through postponing, with a decision taken to submit all proposals to the vote of the Assembly, which was yet to be convened, instead of drafting a decree. Nevertheless, a Proclamation to estate-holders was issued (June 28, 1848), indicating that the reform was to be eventually enforced in exchange for unspecified sums, and calling on peasants to fulfill their corvées until autumn of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{took the}} form of a motte and bailey design, and a dam was {{probably}} constructed to turn the surrounding marshy, low-lying <b>land</b> <b>into</b> an artificial lake, called Skipsea Mere, in turn connected the channel leading to the sea. The complex had its own private harbour, and probably a boat yard and a fresh-water fishery. By the end of the 11th century a church had been built to the east of the castle across the mere, and the village of Skipsea soon grew up alongside the church. Drogo settled 10 knights on lands near the castle in an arrangement known as a castlery or castle-guard system, under which the knights helped to guard the castle in return for their estates, and one of them probably built his own smaller fortification at nearby Aldborough.|$|E

5|$|The {{landscape}} {{around the}} castle was carefully {{designed in the}} 14th century as a deer park or planned borough, and would have looked similar to those at the contemporary castles of Framlingham, Kenilworth, Leeds and Whittington; in particular, Kenilworth {{may have been a}} specific model for Dunstanburgh. The area around the castle was dominated by three shallow artificial lakes, called meres, and accessed by three gates on the north, west and south sides. The meres were fed from a fresh water spring 2,000 feet (600 m) inland, linked to the meres by an underground stone channel. The meres were originally bounded by a sod-cast boundary bank and ditch; today this is heavily eroded, and up to 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high. The main route by <b>land</b> <b>into</b> the castle would have been from the village of Embleton, through the West Gate.|$|E
5|$|Waller was {{involved}} in the process of mining anthracite and owned large tracts of coal-containing land. In 1837, he invested jointly in an area of coal-containing land in Plymouth Township (now Larksville) with his uncle, Oristus Collins. He and Collins divided the <b>land</b> <b>into</b> their own parcels in 1840. He and several of his siblings also bought a piece of coal-mining land from his father for $10,000 in 1857. Waller gradually bought the coal-containing lots of his siblings until he had close to 250 acres of land with coal in 1872. In 1878, he purchased 28 acres of coal-mining land in Plymouth Township from Joseph Jaquish's heirs. Altogether his coal-mining lands outputted 50,000 tons (45,454 tonnes) per year, although this was {{only a small portion of}} the total coal output of the Wyoming Valley. After retiring as a minister he also purchased 2000 acres of coal-mining land near Chattanooga.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1937, Danville {{resident}} Emma Weisiger {{donated the}} land that comprises Constitution Square Historic Site to the Commonwealth of Kentucky in memory of her brother, John. The state made the <b>land</b> <b>into</b> a state park; it was originally called Old Public Square, then Constitutional Square. Using a combination {{of state and local}} funds, the Danville Chamber of Commerce and the local chapter of the American Legion began constructing replicas of the jail, courthouse, and meetinghouse that originally occupied the square. At the time of the park's dedication on April 20, 1942, it was dubbed the John G. Weisiger Memorial State Park. Later, the name was changed to Constitution Square State Shrine. At the time of the dedication ceremony, all non-essential construction projects in the U.S. had been halted by the War Production Board due to the country's entry into World War II, and renovations to the park's attractions had consequently ceased. Dedication speeches by Governor Keen Johnson and Centre College president Robert L. McLeod, Jr. contained reminders of the ongoing war and praise for the ideals of democracy. In addition, a plaque honoring the framers of the first Kentucky Constitution was dedicated by Louisville judge Lafon Allen and unveiled by Johnson's daughter, Judith, and Louise McDowell, a descendent of Judge Samuel McDowell, who presided over all ten constitutional conventions {{that took place in the}} original Constitution Square courthouse.|$|E
