Following {{the end of the}} series they were hopeful to be involved in a future animated series based on the premise, which Orci saw <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> reboot of the show and more of a continuation in a different guise. He felt that while Prime was sophisticated, there were concerns that it was leaving younger viewers behind because of its complexity and intensity.|$|E
5|$|Norreis was {{appointed}} to the abbacy of Evesham Abbey in 1190 and was blessed as abbot on 13 January 1190. He owed his appointment to King Richard and to Baldwin's attempts to make the dismissal from Christ Church look <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> defeat for the archbishop. Norreis also claimed that he received the office in return for unspecified services he rendered to Richard. There was no attempt at an election by the monks, a lack which went against canon law. During his tenure of office, his monks accused him of fornication, excessive drinking, gluttony, setting up favourites, starving the monks, and appropriating monastic property for his own use. A further offence was his habit of wearing secular clothing rather than the monastic habit prescribed by the Benedictine Rule. All these charges come from one of his monks, the historian Thomas of Marlborough, who wrote much of the history of Evesham known as the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham. Thomas's account of Norreis's rule is biased against the abbot and is a self-aggrandising account of how Thomas single-handedly triumphed over both his and his abbey's foes. Norreis did manage some good for the abbey, as it was while he was abbot that the crossing tower of the monastic church was completed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century {{it seems that}} a middle ground between the mother and sister culture {{positions}} may be emerging. Pool (2007) thus concludes that while San Lorenzo emerged early as the largest the most developed polity of Mesoamerica and the earliest evidence {{of several of the}} defining traits of Mesoamerican culture is found there, the Olmecs emerge looking <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mother culture than as a promiscuous father culture spawning offspring generously with many different mothercultures all over mesoamerica. This formulation emphasises the viewpoint that influence from the Olmec heartland merged with many local traditions creating local expressions with both Olmec and non-Olmec roots. it follows from this approach that the type and degree of Olmec influence varies greatly from location to location within Mesoamerica.|$|E

Commuter rail has been restored along the Greenbush Line through Hingham. Trains stop at two stations in town; West Hingham and Nantasket Junction. As part of the MBTA's agreement to restore train service, a tunnel has been built to carry the commuter trains under historic Hingham Square. There were disputes in Hingham about whether to allow the train {{to pass through the}} town. Some people felt that Hingham is becoming <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> town and more like a small city. Others felt that the line will benefit the town. Ferries also run from Hingham Shipyard to several islands in Boston Harbor during the summer as well as to Pemberton Point, Hull. There is no air service in the town; the nearest airport is Logan International Airport in Boston as well as smaller public airports in Norwood and Marshfield.|$|E

Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various Watchmen characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, [...] "By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page.

He added that the people involved were not [...] "so uninformed that they mistake science fiction for simulated murder", a notion which he stated was present in gamers' reactions and implied in Sony's apology. He elaborated that the controversy came from the use of assault weaponry in a place of worship, one that plays host to a yearly candlelight vigil for victims of gun violence. He wrote that the [...] "jarring image of an American supersoldier spraying their church with bullets may indeed seem <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> meaningless violation of 'whiny dogma' than a sick joke."

Silencefeels <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> feat of adaptation than an act of artistic submission". Mark Kermode writing for The Guardian indicated exemplary performances by the range of Japanese supporting actors in the cast stating: [...] "The real stars however, are the Japanese cast, from Yōsuke Kubozuka’s enigmatic wretch, Kichijiro... to Yoshi Oida’s devout elder Ichizo, to whose village these priests bring both salvation and suffering. As a smiling, silver-tongued interpreter, Tadanobu Asano is a superb foil to the inquisitor, Inoue, played with fly-swatting menace by a wheedling Issey Ogata".|$|E

[...] Joseph Dilworth Jr. of Pop Culture Zoo praised the premiere of Stargate Universe, stating that it [...] "feels <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> weekly TV series and much more like {{the beginning of a}} twenty part long form story," [...] and is also described as a cross between , Battlestar Galactica and Firefly, though the series seems to be a spiritual successor to Battlestar. Dilworth also praised the cast, stating it as [...] "one of the finest ensemble casts I've seen in a long time." [...] Curt Wagner of Chicago Now rated the episode 4 stars out of four, stating that it shares the optimism of Star Trek: Voyager, and the grimness of Battlestar Galactica, as well as playing homage to its franchise forebears SG-1 and Atlantis, but looks and feels new. IGN reviewer Ramsey Isler gave the episode 8.8 out of 10, starting his review with [...] "Yes, it's another Stargate show. But this might become the best of them all."

[...] He continued: [...] "There’s something half-jokey about his manner that makes me think he’s about to break up laughing, as in a blooper reel." [...] In contrast, Poniewozik felt that [...] "for {{the first time in}} a while, I’m really interested to see what happens on Entourage next." [...] Dan Philips of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Philips praised [...] "Lose Yourself", opining that it was an [...] "excellent, extremely entertaining climax to this season's two main plot lines." [...] He added, [...] "Even though the episode never got around to providing any resolution, the overall journey was engaging enough to make its cliffhanger feel <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cheap trick to get us to tune in for season eight." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Josh Wagler of MTV, who praised Grenier's performance, opining that it was his best performance to date. The A.V. Club writer Kyle Ryan gave the episode a 'B-' grade. Ryan wrote, [...] "The last episode teed up tonight’s many confrontations [...] For a show that has specialized in spinning its wheels, these were surprisingly high stakes." [...] He was critical with the development of Vincent Chase, as well as his storyline with Sasha Grey, commenting that [...] "Vincent and his coterie just aren’t that interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Early scenes {{animated}} by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio's design was exactly {{like that of}} a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands. Walt Disney, however, was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel. Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston and Moore were [...] "rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet" [...] and felt that they should [...] "forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards". Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence. Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves on them. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.|$|E

500|$|Dipayan Pal of Mumbai Boss was {{disappointed}} {{in the book and}} theorized a number of reasons for it. He felt that the solid plot and the unambiguous storytelling of The Immortals of Meluha was missing in The Secret of the Nagas, whose ending failed to live up the curiosity. Pal particularly criticized Tripathi's language, saying [...] "It seems that while writing The Secret of the Nagas, much of Amish’s attention was upon language. There are obvious and woefully inept attempts at literary flair that make the novel a tiresome read. The book suffers from a rash of exclamation marks and unnecessary italics. Sentences have been sliced to create weak, dangling fragments ('Parashuram charged. Followed by his vicious horde'). Instead of simply talking, people bellow, scream, whisper and fall silent. They are flabbergasted, they pirouette {{in the middle of a}} fight, and use words like 'exponentially', 'gargantuan' and 'plethora' in their speech. The net result is text that is labored, trite and awkward." [...] Kishwar Desai from Asian Age felt that in The Secret of the Nagas, the characterization of Shiva lost some of the fervor in it from the first book, and is cast more as a Bollywood hero, comparable to the likes of actor Salman Khan. Desai also noticed that there were too many characters in the book, most of them remaining unexplored. Likening the book with a computer game, the reviewer concluded that [...] "one of the remarkable qualities of [...] is that it is a very visual tale and <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> literary exercise." [...] Some critics like Sandipan Deb of Outlook though favored the visual style more and felt that Tripathi stayed true to the fantasy genre.|$|E
500|$|Both {{feminist and}} Muslim critics have accused Jasmine of being [...] "an {{offensive}} role model unworthy of showcasing to impressionable young girls." [...] According to Meghan O'Keefe of Overthinking It, Jasmine possesses [...] "tremendous" [...] yet [...] "ineffectual... {{potential to be}} a feminist heroine" [...] due to her lack of interest in books, music, social interaction and [...] "thirst for learning" [...] that Ariel and Belle share. O'Keefe concluded, [...] "Jasmine's complaints to Aladdin about palace life sound <b>less</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> budding feminist finding her voice, and more like the spoiled muse of Pulp's 'Common People'". Charles I. Schuster, author of Speculations: Readings in Culture, Identity, and Values, agreed that the character offers very little feminism apart from her [...] "defiance of an arbitrary law". Busts Sholeh Hajmiragha began by praising Jasmine's progressiveness: [...] "she challenges her ascribed life as a princess, is skeptical of marriage, and, by falling in love with poor Aladdin, upsets the class system." [...] However, in the end the author criticized the character for being [...] "very sexualized", explaining, [...] "While female sexuality is something to be proud and in control of, it maybe isn't the best message for young girls." [...] Opining that Jasmine's role lacks significance, Feminist Fiction deemed her an example of how [...] "Disney treats its female characters when they're not the protagonist of the story", elaborating, [...] "it looks like Disney put a lot of effort into giving Jasmine girl power and independence, at least in her dialogue and attitude" [...] but [...] "didn't follow through and give her strength in the plot itself." [...] The website also observed that the character's feminism does not appear to extend beyond [...] "lipservice", ultimately criticizing Jasmine of using her sexuality instead of her intelligence to [...] "save the day" [...] before finally reverting to the role of a damsel in distress awaiting rescue. The Routledge Companion to Media & Gender author Cynthia Carter believes that Jasmine becomes [...] "the possession of [...] husband".|$|E
