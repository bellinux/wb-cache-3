500|$|In June 2007, The Stage {{reported}} that Moffat and Sawalha {{are interested in}} reviving Press Gang. He said: [...] "I would revive that <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> I {{would love to do}} a reunion episode—a grown-up version. I know Julia Sawalha is interested—every time I see her she asks me when {{we are going to do}} it. Maybe it will happen—I would like it to." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair {{called the}} album [...] "filler-free" [...] and praised the album's {{positive}} messages. The Village Voices Robert Christgau praised the songwriting and lyrics, {{which he called}} [...] "lovable" [...] despite their [...] "paucity of meaning." [...] Writing for WXPN, Bruce Warren remarked that the album's lyrics, with Alexander complaining about the commercialisation of Western society, media and religion, aren't clichéd because they are [...] "insightful" [...] and truthful. In a mixed review, NMEs Kitty Empire felt that the album is occasionally interesting but then [...] "freefalls <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> duck." ...|$|E

[...] The Guardian advocated the show's revival, arguing that [...] "a revamped Press Gang with Moffat at the helm could turn the show from a cult into a national institution - a petri dish for young acting and writing talent to thrive. It's part of our TV heritage and definitely worthy of resuscitation." ...|$|E

500|$|Jill {{is known}} for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), which took place over four decades. BuddyTV wrote that, [...] "Nothing spells rivalry like the {{on-going}} feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor." [...] In 1993, Katherine {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by." [...] Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: [...] "I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> in the arm when you see her in the morning. [...] She is funny and sharp and I love her." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Last {{season when}} Stoke played Arsenal at Plumstead, I watched the Reds swoop down on Roose like a whirlwind. There was a {{scrimmage}} in goal and Roose {{was down on}} the ball <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> with a heap of Arsenal and Stoke players on top of him. It was all Lombard Street [...] to a penny orange that the Reds would score. Presently {{from out of the}} ruck emerged Roose clinging to the ball, which he promptly threw away up the field. I'll bet that the thrill of triumph which went through him was ample compensation for any hard knocks he received." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{many fans}} and historians, [...] "The Drifters" [...] means Clyde McPhatter, {{although}} {{he was with the}} group for only one year. McPhatter was lead tenor for Billy Ward and His Dominoes for three years, starting in 1950. It was McPhatter's high-pitched tenor that was mostly responsible for the Dominoes' success. In 1953, Ahmet Ertegün of Atlantic Records attended a Dominoes performance at Birdland and noticed McPhatter wasn't present, only to learn that McPhatter was no longer with the group. As Jerry Wexler recalls, [...] "Ahmet exited Birdland <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> and headed directly uptown. He raced from bar to bar looking for Clyde and finally found him in a furnished room. That very night, Ahmet reached an agreement with McPhatter under which Clyde would assemble a group of his own. They became known as the Drifters." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the second}} half, Michigan played a {{defensive}} strategy. [...] The {{highlight of the}} second half came in the third quarter, after Craig intercepted a pass at midfield. [...] On the ensuing drive, Craig ran 20 yards to the 27-yard line. [...] On third down, the Wolverines set up in kick formation with Paterson lined up for an attempted field goal. [...] Instead, Hughitt took the snap and ran 27 yards for an apparent touchdown. E. A. Batchelor described the play:"The ball came back straight and true to Hughitt and Paterson advanced and kicked. [...] But he kicked the empty air, for Tommy rose the minute he got his hands on the leather, and was off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> around Pennsy's right end[...] [...] [...] Michigan's rooting section proceeded to do things which would cause an insane patient to get the straightjacket and padded cell, but the demonstration was premature." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E

60|$|For {{some moments}} after this there was dead silence, but nobody confessed, {{and they all}} {{looked at each other}} as if they {{expected}} some one to go off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cannon <b>shot</b> through the roof suddenly, and were somewhat disappointed that no one did.|$|R
50|$|Extrinsic emotion {{regulation}} remains {{important to}} emotional development in toddlerhood. Toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers {{to control their}} emotions and behaviors.
