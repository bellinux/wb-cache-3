He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report.

The {{main body of the}} 304th Division and the 3rd Regiment, 324th Division, had assembled in Nong Son and Thường Đức to attack Da Nang from the west. In Military Region 5, the 2nd Division had established its positions in Tiên Phước, Tra My and Trà Bồng in Quảng Ngãi Province, and Đắk Tô and Tân Cảnh in Kon Tum Province.|$|E

5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor escapement mechanism in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39inches) <b>long</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> center of the bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E

Thus, the first testimonies about Romanian traditional port are set in stone, on Tropaeum Traiani monument in Adamclisi and Trajan's Column in Rome. For example, women portraits carved on Trajan's Column after the Dacian wars provide information about their clothing. Dacian women wore shirts rippled at the neck related to the Romanian ie. Sleeves were either long and wide or short. The dress was <b>long</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, over which sometimes was attached a wide draped mantle.

25|$|Burnand {{graduated}} in 1858. His family had expected {{that he would}} study for the bar, but the Burnands held the right to appoint the incumbent of a Church of England parish that became vacant, and {{it was agreed that}} he should train for the priesthood. He enrolled at Cuddesdon theological college, where his studies of divinity led him to leave the Anglican church and become a Roman Catholic. This caused a breach between Burnand and his father, but the estrangement did not last <b>long.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> disappointment of Cardinal Manning, leader of the English Catholics, Burnand announced that his vocation was not for the church but for the theatre. Father and son were reconciled, and Burnand returned to his original plan of reading for the bar at Lincoln's Inn.|$|E
25|$|Athlone is {{a popular}} stop for {{pleasure}} craft along the River Shannon. Lough Ree, the largest lake on the Shannon, is a short distance upstream from Athlone, and many boat companies are based out of the town. For craft to pass through Athlone, {{it is necessary to}} use a lock in the river, which beside the weir and downstream of the current road bridge. The lock, weir, and bridge were all constructed by the Shannon navigation commissioners in the 1840s. Before then, boats used a canal, about {{a mile and a half}} <b>long,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of the river. The canal was built by Thomas Omer for the Commissioners of Inland Navigation. Work started in 1757 and involved the work of over 300 men. Omer built a single lock, 120′ X 19′ with a rise of 4.5′, but there was also a guard lock, further upstream, with a single set of gates to protect the canal against floods. There were also two lay-bys, or harbours, one above the lock and another at the upstream end. The old canal is no longer navigable.|$|E

The district, which has jurisdiction over about 95 villages, borders Muang <b>Long</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and Muang Namtha to the east and Yunnan, China to the north. The district covers an area of 1650km², has a population of about 23,500 as of 2000 and a population density of 14.2 persons per km². The terrain ranges in altitude between 540 in the lowlands to 2,094 metres in the highlands. Muang Namtha forms a valley of the same name with dramatic mountain scenery. Roughly half of the district lies within the Namtha National Biodiversity Conservation Area, also known as Nam Ha National Protected Area, a heavily forested area under national protection which extends much further to the southwest and includes the Pha Yueng Waterfall, about 17 kilometres south {{of the town of}} Mueang Sing. The confluence of Nam Dai, Nam Sing and Nam Yuan is just to the northeast of the town of Mueang Sing.|$|E
