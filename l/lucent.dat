5|$|At {{the end of}} 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, {{and former}} EVP Jack Pogge was {{appointed}} President and Chief Operating Officer in his place. In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives. In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of <b>Lucent</b> Technologies for $260 million. The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent. 200 <b>Lucent</b> employees were laid off {{as a result of}} the acquisition. An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.|$|E

5000|$|The Nortel DMS-250, {{a larger}} {{variant of the}} DMS-100, is a popular {{competitor}} to <b>Lucent's</b> 4ESS, especially among telephone companies that were not previously a part of AT&T. Other DMS switches {{can also be used}} as tandems.|$|R
5|$|The period {{also saw}} an {{expansion}} of the technology industry in the region, centered around Unicamp, with Motorola, IBM, Solectron, <b>Lucent</b> Technologies and many others set up research labs and production centers in the region driven by the large number of highly qualified students graduating every year, culminating in the opening of the Institute of Computing in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Borislow founded Tel-Save {{when he was}} in his 20s to resell {{access to}} AT long-distance lines. The company was based in New Hope, Pennsylvania, and its primary market was toward small and {{medium-sized}} businesses. Borislow took the company public in 1995 and had an initial public offering of three million shares. He then invested in his own long distance network by deploying five <b>Lucent</b> 5ESS-2000 switches throughout the United States. By 1997, Tel-Save was making $20 million a year.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Cisco {{introduced}} {{a suite of}} router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share. According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products. Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as <b>Lucent,</b> Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.|$|E

25|$|Under the 1996 {{restructuring}} of AT, AT Technologies became <b>Lucent</b> Technologies. The <b>Lucent</b> Technologies Reading, Pennsylvania, facility became both a <b>Lucent</b> Microelectronics and a <b>Lucent</b> Optoelectronics facility, designing and manufacturing optoelectronic and integrated circuit components for {{applications in the}} telecommunications and computing industries.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to serving the traditional communications markets, the <b>Lucent</b> Optoelectronics {{portion of the}} facility provided a family of transmitters and receivers for use in network computing applications. <b>Lucent</b> was also a leading player in the cable TV and hybrid fiber coaxial markets. In {{addition to}} Reading, Pennsylvania, other <b>Lucent</b> Optoelectronics facilities were located in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania; Murray Hill, New Jersey; Alhambra, California; and Matamoros, Mexico.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 the Reading Works' {{work force}} stood at 2,450 {{including}} AT Microelectronics and Bell Labs as {{it made the}} transition from AT into <b>Lucent</b> Technologies. The spin off of AT manufacturing units as <b>Lucent</b> Technologies became necessary as these units increasingly found that their prospective customers were AT competitors. The divestiture of the manufacturing units made them suppliers rather than competitors, opening up new markets to <b>Lucent</b> and to the Reading Works. At {{the same time it}} caused the anxiety that comes with change. On October 1, 1996, <b>Lucent</b> Technologies became independent of AT The Reading Works became <b>Lucent</b> Technologies Reading Facility. It employed 2,177 people, down considerably from 4,900 in 1985. By the end of 1997, the Reading Facility workforce had declined and remained stable at 2,000. By the end of 1998, the Reading Facility workforce had rebounded to 2,177. In 1999 a pickup in Lightwave business caused expansion of both the Reading Facility and the Breinigsville plant.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the process used to {{transition from a}} legacy intranet to a modern Internet access architecture. During {{the period of the}} Lucent/AT&T/NCR tri-vestiture, much care was given to re-engineer and re-design <b>Lucent's</b> data networking infrastructure with a modern and flexible design. As a part of this re-structuring, the existing Internet access architecture was viewed as archaic and in desperate need of redesign. The legacy intranet was isolated from the Internet in many ways including separate root name servers, a complete lack of routing information to or from the Internet, and everything was passed through home-grown application-layer proxy software. To remedy this, a project was created to provide transparent proxyless access to Internet hosts and applications. This project entailed designing a routing architecture that provided connectivity, redundancy, and manageability. In addition to routing issues, <b>Lucent's</b> DNS infrastructure would also need a redesign to handle new responsibilities given to it...|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, most {{employer}} {{health insurance}} polices denied coverage for sex reassignment surgery (SRS) or anything related to it. Horton advocated {{for the inclusion}} of transgender health benefits (THBs) in these policies.

40|$|Abstract—Collecting {{network traffic}} traces from {{deployed}} networks {{is one of}} the basic steps in network research. These traces can be used to study real users, traffic engineering, packet classification, web performance, security application or more general network measurement and simulation. However for security and privacy reason monitored traffic traces have to be modified before they are published. This is known as trace anonymization process[1]. Many tools and techniques have been implemented for anonymization purposes [2]. To name few of these tools are Crypto-PAn, Anontool, ip 2 anonip, <b>Lucent’s</b> extensions to Crypto-PAn, FLAIM, IP-Anonymous, TCPdprive [3]. Different tools uses different anonymization algorithm. Few of these algorithms are: black-marker, random permutations, truncation, pseudonymization, and prefix-preserving pseudonymization. The goal of anonymization is to preserve the structure of the network {{while at the same time}} preserve privacy policies. This paper intends to compare the Crypto-PAn, <b>Lucent’s</b> extensions to Crypto-PAn, Anontool, and FLAIM [4]. More specifically we will compare the cumulative distribution function of the anonymized data. I...|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} AirPort Base Station (known as Graphite, model M5757, {{part number}} M7601LL/B) features a dial-up modem and an Ethernet port. It employs a <b>Lucent</b> WaveLAN Silver PC Card as the Radio, and uses an embedded AMD Elan processor. It was released July 21, 1999. The Graphite AirPort Base Station is functionally {{identical to the}} <b>Lucent</b> RG-1000 wireless base station and can run the same firmware. Due to the original firmware-locked limitations of the Silver card, the unit can only accept 40-bit WEP encryption. Later aftermarket tweaks can enable 128-bit WEP on the Silver card. Aftermarket Linux firmware has been developed for these units to extend their useful service life.|$|E
50|$|Other discussions {{focused on}} her {{well-documented}} public record, including coverage of risky vendor financing programs that Fiorina {{was said to have}} supported during her time as <b>Lucent's</b> president of consumer products. The programs, which allegedly inflated the company's revenue figures to the benefit of Fiorina's bonus payout, were said to have contributed to the downfall of the company, formerly part of the iconic AT&T Bell Labs organization.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{accounting}} discretion to window dress financial statements {{seems to be}} eroding {{public confidence in the}} financial reporting process. Critics argue that some managers are intentionally abusing GAAP’s afforded discretion to manage earnings. This can reduce the quality of the financial reporting process and ultimately bring adverse effects on resource allocation in the economy. Not surprisingly, market participants, legislators, regulators, and academics are concerned with the need to control financial reporting abuses. In this paper we briefly review the recent literature on earnings management and show the incentives as well as the mechanics used by <b>Lucent’s</b> managers to manipulate earnings. We found strong incentives for <b>Lucent’s</b> managers to report smooth and increasing earnings to: a) increase the firm’s market capitalization; b) enhance management compensation and job security; and c) reduce the company’s cost of capital. The evidence we found suggests that the managers used: a) big bath restructuring charges; b) miscellaneous cookie jar reserves; c) premature and aggressive revenue recognition; and d) creative acquisition accounting and purchased R&D to manage earnings.
