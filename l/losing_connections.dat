40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of iPhone in 2007, many location-based services (LBSs) have been created and new LBSs are found every day. This research proposes yet another LBS, which is practical and was not found before {{to the best of}} authors' knowledge. The problem is described as follows. It happens all the times while several groups of people are traveling towards a destination, they lose contact from each other on the way. This research tries to have the groups travel as closely as possible until they reach the destination. It uses a method of minimum covering ellipses to find whether the groups are separated by more than a threshold/distance. If they are, the system will find a convenient rendezvous for all groups by using a method of geometric median. After meeting at the rendezvous, the groups reset the service and continue their journey. By using this LBS, travelers do not need to worry about <b>losing</b> <b>connections</b> with others. This method can also be applied to the problem of finding a convenient meeting place for mobile users...|$|E

40|$|Networks are {{important}} storage data structures now used to store personal information of individuals around the globe. With {{the advent of}} personal genome sequencing, networks {{are going to be}} used to store personal genomic sequencing of people. In contrast to social media networks, the importance of relationships in this genomic network is extremely significant. <b>Losing</b> <b>connections</b> between individuals thus implies losing relationship information (E. g. father or son etc.). There currently exists a considerably serious problem in the current approach to storing network data. Simply stated, network data is not tamper-evident. In other words, if some links or nodes were changed/removed/added by a malicious attacker, it would be impossible for the administrator to detect such changes. While, in the current age of social media networks, change in node characteristics and links can be bad in terms of relationships, in the case of networks for storing personal genomes, the results could be truly devastating. Here we present a scheme for building tamper-evident networks using a combination of Cryptographic and Ego-based Network analytic methods. Using actual published data-sets, we also demonstrate the utility and validity of the scheme besides demonstrating its working in various possible scenarios of usage. Results from the extensive experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|Late life {{suicide is}} a major public health problem in the U. S. with elderly white men at highest risk of {{completed}} suicide. This grounded theory study explored individual perspectives of suicidality with men aged 67 to 83 years. A basic social psychological process, <b>Losing</b> <b>Connections,</b> was identified from interviews. Three stages of this process were identified during which the effect of cumulative losses culminated in depression, prompted suicidal ideation, {{and led to a}} decision point for the individual. Loss was the key theme in stage one. Relationship, health, and role losses were identified with professional role loss being the most prominent. The second stage was characterized by depression and despair during which suicidal ideation was prominent. Progressive alienation and the resolution to die characterized this phase. In stage three, the struggle between wanting to die and deciding to do so presented a decision point. The decision point was surrounded by a balance of triggers and barriers, which was modulated by ambivalence. The informant perceived they had reasons to die (triggers), but made the decision not to die because of perceived consequences (barriers). Triggers prompting the decision point were thoughts of a deceased spouse, emotional pain, health problems, and feelings of uselessness and/or hopelessness. The most common barrier to suicide was consequences to family members. Religion was not a significant barrier. Instead, there was a general lack of religious connections among informants. Likewise, social isolation was not prominent, as informants retained connections with family members, friends, and community...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in sequencing technologies {{have brought a}} renewed impetus {{to the development of}} bioinformatics tools necessary for sequence processing and analysis. Along with the constant requirement to be able to assemble more complex genomes from ever evolving sequencing experiments and technologies there also exists a lack in visually accessible representations of information generated by analysis tools. Most of the novel algorithms, specifically for de novo genome assembly of next generation sequencing (NGS) data, are not able to efficiently handle data generated on large populations. We have assessed the common methods for genome assembly used today both from a theoretical point of view and their practical implementations. In this dissertation we present StarK (stands for k�), a novel assembly algorithm with a new data structure designed to overcome some of the limitations that we observed in established methods enabling higher quality NGS data processing. The StarK approach structurally combines de Brujin graphs for all possible dimensions in one supergraph. Although the technique to join reads remains in concept the same, the dimension k is no longer fixed. StarK is designed {{in such a way that}} it allows the assembler to dynamically adjust the de Brujin graph dimension k on the fly and at any given nucleotide position without <b>losing</b> <b>connections</b> between graph vertices or doing complicated calculations. The new graph uses localised coverage difference evaluation to create connected sub graphs which allows higher resolution of genomic differences and helps differentiate errors from potential variants within the sequencing sample. In addition to this we present a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for high-variation viral population analysis (including transmission studies), which, using both new and established methods, creates easily interpretable visual representations of the underlying data analysis. Together we provide a solid framework for biologists for extracting more information from sequencing data with less effort and faster than before...|$|E

40|$|Communication speed {{by radio}} wave has been enhanced, and wired {{communications}} {{have been replaced}} by wireless communications because of their convenience. We often hear someone talk “Why are high speed communications needed?”. He or she thinks that present wireless communications are sufficiently speedy, however, higher speed is still needed. When we consider how informations are efficiently transfered in the limited frequency resources, speeding up is equivalent to high-efficiency. Of course, speeding up is needed for transferring movie, music and image quickly, however, the needs of the speeding up also can be discussed in the view of high-efficiency. In LTE-Advanced, it is considered that “Heterogeneous network” will be configured. “Heterogeneous network” indicates the combinational network of pico, femto, macrocell, and relay base station. Among them, femtocell base station (BS) is an attractive technology. In femtocell, the coverage area is tens of meter radius, and the BS is located in indoor environments. Since the number of mobile terminals (MTs) accessing femtocell BS is small, comfortable communications without reduction of the speed and without <b>losing</b> <b>connections</b> are achieved. On the other hand, since line capacity is not sufficient for the increase of users in urban area, cellular phone operators want to disperse loads of 3 G lines on public W-LAN, which is available in station, airport, cafe and fast food restaurants. Thus, to configure future wireless networks, small-area wireless communications in indoor environments attract much attention. Then, in LTE and LTE-Advanced, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology. MIMO technology can enhance communication speed by using multiple antennas on transmitting and receiving sides without expanding frequency band. Hence, it can transmit data efficiently with narrow frequency band. The study of MIMO has been shifted to MU-MIMO, MIMO mesh network, and multihop. However, those researches seem to be at the initiative of software and system, and then {{it is also important to}} look toward hardware such as antennas and circuits. This dissertation targets hardware applied to multi-antenna systems, and discussions are focused on single user’s communi cations, which are the basis for develop researches. As mentioned before, since communications in indoor environments typified by femtocell and W-LAN is an indispensable way to disperse traffic, this dissertation deals with such scenario. Among them, this dissertation specially focuses on indoor base stations and describes the multi-antenna technologies using radiation patterns wisely to improve the performance without increasing the number of streams. In Chapter 3, channel capacity is introduced as a evaluation factor of MIMO performance, and the relationship between channel capacity, spatial correlation, SNR, received power imbalance, and eigenvalues of spatial correlation matrix are discussed by theory, simulation and measurement. Then, as one example, spatial correlation reduction and channel capacity enhancement by multi-polarization is described. Moreover, just a concept of channel capacity enhancement by SNR increment is shown in this chapter, and the discussion is connected to chapter 4. Chapter 4 describes the MIMO antenna configuration methodology by using radiation patterns effectively. The discussion is mainly focused on indoor BSs, and the target is enhancement of MIMO performance using fixed radiation patterns. Here, two types of BS positions are assumed, which are BS mounted in the vicinity of wall and at the center of the ceiling. For the former, this dissertation reveals that narrow HPBW of 60 ?- 80 ? pointed to the corner of the room is effective to obtain large channel capacity by ray-tracing propagation analysis. Based on the design guidelines, a patch antenna array with dual-feeds is fabricated, and then the measurement is conducted in the small room of 6. 2 m × 5. 8 m × 2. 7 m. The results shows that the 4 × 4 MIMO channel capacity is enhanced by about 20 % at two out of three typical MT positions, compared to that for sleeve antenna configurations. On the other hand, for the latter, this dissertation presents a low-profile dual-polarized directional MIMO antenna with a thickness of 0. 24 λ. The antenna is also designed based on guidelines by ray-tracing propagation analysis, and is configured by four cavity-backed slot and four printed dipole antenna elements. Slot and dipole elements radiate vertical and horizontal polarizations, and uni-directional radiation patterns with downward tilt angles are obtained in each polarization. By channel measurements in an actual environment, the SNR and channel capacity are compared with those of the sleeve antenna configuration. The place averaged SNR of the proposed antenna is 14. 1 dB, and the improvement factor is 2. 6 dB. The place averaged channel capacity of the proposed antenna is 7. 1 bits/s/Hz, and improvement factor is 16. 2 %. The results of this study reveal that the MIMO capacity performance is the same or better than that of the sleeve antenna configuration. Chapter 5 proposes a novel feeding circuit with switching function of shapes and directions of radiation patterns. First, a technique to realize cardioid and figure of eight radiation patterns is presented. Then, as the modified version, techniques to realize omni-directional and directive radiation patterns are presented. Those techniques are based on array antenna theory, and multi-radiation pattern is generated by switch of feed elements and phase difference feeding (0 ?, 180 ?, - 90 ? and 90 ?). For the former circuit, the array factors derived from the output signals at 2 GHz shows that two cardioid and two figure of eight radiation patterns are achieved when mutual coupling effects are ignored. When mutual coupling effects are considered, uni-directional with more than 10 dB F/B ratio and bi-directional radiation patterns are obtained. Moreover, the measurement results show that the averaged losses between 1. 85 and 2. 21 GHz are less than 1. 8 dB, and the phase differences agree with simulation data in the vicinity of 2 GHz in the proposed feeding circuit. For the latter, the proposed circuit has five operation modes, and can switch feed to two elements with the phase differences of 0 ?, 180 ?, - 90 ? and 90 ? and feed to a single element. The simulation results show that in all the modes, mismatch losses are less than 0. 5 dB, and desired phase differences are obtained at 2 GHz. The output signals lead to the array factor of two cardioid, two figure of eight, and omni-directional radiation patterns. Then, this dissertation reveals that uni-, biand omni-directional radiation patterns are obtained in consideration of a combination with a three-element linear monopole array. The variations in the radiation patterns as a function of the frequency are small at 1. 88, 2 and 2. 06 GHz. Then, since the effect of switching circuits has not been considered in the above simulation and measurement, the design procedures are showed, and the measurement results of the fabricated switching circuit is evaluated. Although frequency shift is caused, good insertion loss and isolation characteristics are observed. Chapter 6 presents an antenna selection criterion that is suitable for indoor LOS scenarios for two-stream MIMO systems. Since the selection criterion can be applied to algorithm for switching the appropriate radiation patterns, this section is ranked as the system level consideration of chapter 5. In chapter 6, this dissertation demonstrates that the criterion using the square of the absolute value of the determinant of the channel matrix is the most effective one for both BER performance and computational load in an indoor LOS scenario. The investigations of this chapter employ ray-tracing propagation analysis taking into consideration variations in both the amplitude and phase of the channel matrix depending on the selected antenna subsets. The criterion based on the determinant of the channel matrix can be applied to various scenarios, and the effectiveness of the criterion for BER performance is also empirically verified in an actual environment. The computational complexity is lower than criterion based on second eigenvalue, which is target for comparison, and the BER performance is comparable to that. 横浜国立大学, 平成 24 年 3 月 23 日, 博士(工学), 甲第 1459...|$|E
