5|$|With few exceptions, Hendrix played {{right-handed}} guitars {{that were}} {{turned upside down}} and restrung for left-hand playing. This had an important effect on {{the sound of his}} guitar; because of the slant of the bridge pickup, his <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound, which was the opposite of the Stratocaster's intended design. In addition to Stratocasters, Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters, Duosonics, two different Gibson Flying Vs, a Gibson Les Paul, three Gibson SGs, a Gretsch Corvette, and a Fender Jaguar. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on The Dick Cavett Show in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.|$|E

25|$|Modern six-string {{bluegrass}} banjos {{have been}} made. These add a bass string between the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> and the drone string on a five-string banjo, {{and are usually}} tuned G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4. Sonny Osborne played one of these instruments for several years. It was modified by luthier Rual Yarbrough from a Vega five-string model. A picture of Sonny with this banjo appears in Pete Wernick's Bluegrass Banjo method book.|$|E

25|$|A violin is {{tuned in}} fifths, in the notes G3, D4, A4, E5. The lowest note of a violin, tuned normally, is G3, or G below middle C. (On rare occasions, the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> may be tuned down {{by as much}} as a fourth, to D3.) The highest note is less well defined: E7, the E two octaves above the open string (which is tuned to E5) may be {{considered}} a practical limit for orchestral violin parts, but it is often possible to play higher, depending on the length of the fingerboard and the skill of the violinist. Yet higher notes (up to C8) can be sounded using artificial harmonics.|$|E
2500|$|Joni Mitchell {{developed}} a shorthand descriptive method of noting guitar tuning wherein {{the first letter}} documents the note of the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> and {{is followed by the}} relative fret (half step) offsets required to obtain the pitch of the next [...] string [...] This scheme highlights pitch relationships and simplifies the process of comparing different tuning schemes.|$|E
2500|$|Architects {{have made}} various stylistic {{transitions}} and evolutions throughout their career, {{with the band}} citing their belief that each album should be distinct. On their second album Ruin, the band's sound was heavier and darker sound than on Nightmares. Hollow Crown maintains the aggression and technical proficiency of Ruin while incorporating more melody, catchy riffs and use of singing. The band also used synthesised instruments such as keyboards and drum machines. The guitars were tuned to Drop B with the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> at Ab, giving the [...] "ability to create a really heavy low end sound on the bottom but still give a comfortable degree of tension on the higher strings." [...] A prime example of their signature style is the song 'We're All Alone', with its technical, progressive guitar riffs and heavy, hardcore punk-influenced rhythmic breakdowns.|$|E

2500|$|A {{break in}} touring during 1967–1968 allowed Richards {{to focus on}} open tunings. Richards {{primarily}} used open tunings for fingered chording developing a distinctive style of syncopated and ringing I-IV chording heard on [...] "Street Fighting Man" [...] and [...] "Start Me Up". Richards' favoured—but not exclusively used—open tuning is a five-string open G tuning: GDGBD. Richards often removes the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> from his guitar, playing with only five strings, as the lower string just [...] "gets in the way" [...] of Richards' own playing, letting the band's bass player pick up those notes. Several of his Telecasters are tuned this way (see the [...] "Guitars" [...] section below). This tuning is prominent on Rolling Stones' recordings including [...] "Honky Tonk Women", [...] "Brown Sugar" [...] and [...] "Start Me Up". Richards has stated that banjo tuning was the inspiration for this tuning.|$|E
50|$|Seven-string guitars achieve B and B♭ tuning {{because they}} have a lower B string below the E string, which is the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> on a {{conventional}} guitar.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{class of}} {{alternative}} tunings are called drop tunings, because the tuning drops down the <b>lowest</b> <b>string.</b> Dropping down the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> a whole tone {{results in the}} [...] "drop-D" [...] (or [...] "dropped D") tuning. Its open-string notes DADGBE (from low to high) allow for a deep bass D note, {{which can be used}} in keys such as D major, d minor and G major. It simplifies the playing of simple fifths (powerchords). Many contemporary rock bands re-tune all strings down, making, for example, Drop-C or Drop-B tunings.|$|E

5000|$|In Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 60 in C (Il Distratto), {{the first}} and second violins start the finale of this unusual six-movement symphony with the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> tuned to F, but tune up to G {{in the course of the}} music to create a comical effect. The title of the symphony means [...] "the {{absent-minded}} man" [...] - so it is as if the violins have [...] "forgotten" [...] to tune their strings. The music fully pauses for the violins to re-tune before continuing. Haydn also uses a violin with the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> tuned to F in the trio of his Symphony No. 67 in F.|$|E
5000|$|Dropped A tuning is an {{alternate}} tuning for a 7 string guitar where the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> is tuned down ("dropped") {{from the standard}} B by one whole step to A as follows A1-E2-A2-D3-G3-B3-E4. Also, for a 6 string guitar, dropped A tuning is achieved by tuning all strings down a 4th with the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> tuned 1 additional step down as follows A1-E2-A2-D3-F#3-B3. This is a [...] "drop 1" [...] tuning in the key of B (i.e. tune the whole guitar down a perfect fourth from standard tuning, then tune the 6th string a whole step down). As a result, it uses the same fingering as drop D tuning and drop C tuning.|$|E

5000|$|In Britain, the USA and Canada, most {{professional}} orchestral players use four-string double basses with a C extension. This is an extra section of fingerboard {{mounted on the}} head of the bass. It extends the fingerboard under the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> and gives an additional four semitones of downward range. The <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> is typically tuned down to C1, an octave below the lowest note on the cello. More rarely this string may be tuned to a low B0, as a few works in the orchestral repertoire call for such a B, such as Respighi's The Pines of Rome. In rare cases, some players have a low B extension, which has B as its lowest note. There are several varieties of extensions: ...|$|E
50|$|While {{the most}} common type of {{extension}} is the C extension, in rare cases, owners of five-string basses, in which the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> is normally a low B, may use either a two semitone extension, providing a low A, or the very rare low G extension.|$|E
50|$|The viola's four strings are {{normally}} tuned in fifths: the <b>lowest</b> <b>string</b> is C (an octave below middle C), with G, D and A above it.
