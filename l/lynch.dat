5|$|After WrestleMania 32, <b>Lynch</b> began a {{feud with}} Emma, being {{defeated}} by {{her on the}} 2 May episode of Raw, but she gained revenge on her along with Natalya by defeating her and Charlotte three days later on SmackDown. On the 9 May episode of Raw, Emma's NXT's tag team partner Dana Brooke made her in-main roster debut by assaulting and attacking <b>Lynch</b> during a backstage segment. Three days later on the 12 May episode of SmackDown, <b>Lynch</b> lost to Brooke after being distracted by Emma, and repeated the event on the 16 May episode of Raw. On 19 June at Money in the Bank, <b>Lynch</b> and Natalya were defeated by Brooke and Charlotte, after which <b>Lynch</b> was attacked by Natalya, who turned villainous in the process. Followed by multiple continuous attacks between both women, {{it was announced that}} they would face off on 24 July at Battleground, where <b>Lynch</b> was defeated by Natalya.|$|E
5|$|Although born in Missoula, Montana, <b>Lynch</b> {{spend his}} youth {{traveling}} across the United States {{due to his}} father Donald's job for the Department of Agriculture; as a result, <b>Lynch</b> attended school across several states. Raised in a contented, happy family, the young <b>Lynch</b> {{was a member of}} the Boy Scouts of America, reaching the highest rank of Eagle Scout. However, <b>Lynch</b> took to building fireworks and playing the bongos in a Beat Generation nightclub as acts of rebellion, before discovering that he could translate his childhood fascination with drawing and painting into a career in fine art. <b>Lynch</b> and his close friend Jack Fisk travelled to Austria hoping to study under Oskar Kokoschka, but the artist was not present at the time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lynch</b> dated Margaret Shaughnessy for 10 {{years before}} the two married in 1992. Shaughnessy, an aide to state Senator Marian Walsh, was from another South Boston family, one of seven children, and majored in graphic design at the Massachusetts College of Art.

40|$|This study {{examines}} an 1887 <b>lynching</b> in Pickens County, South Carolina, {{in which a}} black mob <b>lynched</b> a white man for the {{rape and murder of}} a black girl. Two members of the mob, both African American, were eventually convicted, but a massive petition campaign led the goernor to pardon them. The study relies largely on coroner’s inquests for the murder victim and the <b>lynching</b> victim, court records, and newspaper articles. It suggests that the anomalous nature of this <b>lynching</b> prompted many people to consider and debate exactly what justified <b>lynching</b> and what role race was to play in those justifications. Since the <b>lynching</b> occurred at the very point when <b>lynching</b> victims were becoming overwhelmingly African American men, the insights provided into contemporary views on <b>lynching</b> are all the more valuable...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lynching</b> {{photographs}} {{and images of}} spectacle <b>lynching</b> were originally produced to commemorate and celebrate <b>lynching.</b> Through processes of rhetorical re-circulation and repurposing of <b>lynching</b> photographs by those in the anti-lynching movement, <b>lynching</b> and visual representations of it became socially unacceptable. The rhetorical strategies concerning the display of images of violence toward African Americans developed in the anti-lynching movement {{became one of the}} most important means of protesting civil rights violations in the United States. This study examines three cases of repurposing <b>lynching</b> photographs during the peak of the anti-lynching movement in the 1930 ’s. The first is the NAACP sponsored Art Commentary on <b>Lynching.</b> I examine four pieces of art in this exhibition that violate the conventions of <b>lynching</b> photography by representing the <b>lynching</b> in other visual mediums that allow the artists to manipulate the <b>lynching</b> scene. The second chapter examines the generation and circulation of an anti-lynching pamphlet featuring a photograph of the <b>lynching</b> of Rubin Stacy. The photograph is repurposed through the interaction of text and image in the pamphlet in a series of rhetorical questions, details of the case, and general information about <b>lynching.</b> The third case is the song, “Strange Fruit. ” The song conjures an image through its use of ekphrasis, and suggests a particular reading of that image throughout the performance of the song. I focus on Billie Holiday’s rendition of the song, but draw conclusions about the song and its various performances and recordings. I argue that the use and manipulation of <b>lynching</b> photographs raised social consciousness and public awareness in opposition to spectacle <b>lynching,</b> and re-articulated the meaning of violence, and representations of violence, toward African Americans in the public sphere...|$|R
50|$|The <b>lynching</b> of Claude Neal had a {{major impact}} on the American people and their {{reaction}} helped to bring about an end to the practice of <b>lynching</b> altogether. Although Claude Neal's <b>lynching</b> did not act as the sole event that led to an end to lynchings in America, it created feelings of strong opposition to the practice across the nation. These feelings were brought about {{in large part because of}} the extensive national coverage the media had given the <b>lynching.</b> Some would-be lynchers were also deterred as many southerners increasingly began to see lynchings as evil. The horrific <b>lynching</b> of Claude Neal helped convince many southerners that federal law against <b>lynching</b> was necessary. The <b>lynching</b> also showed people how ineffective the policies and measures were on both the local and federal levels for preventing lynchings in the United States. The anger of many Americans over the Claude Neal <b>lynching</b> brought on a determination to bring an end to similar practices throughout the country.|$|R

In 2002 <b>Lynch</b> began producing two series of shorts released through his official website—the Flash-animated DumbLand, and Rabbits. Having begun acting in his 1972 short The Amputee, <b>Lynch</b> went on to appear on-camera in Twin Peaks, Zelly and Me and Dune.

On the 23 October episode of NXT, after being told to make herself relevant, <b>Lynch</b> aligned herself with Sasha Banks by attacking Bayley, turning into a villainess in the process.

5|$|After {{being drafted}} to the SmackDown brand {{as part of}} the 2016 WWE draft which took place on 19 July, <b>Lynch</b> made her first {{appearance}} for the brand on 26 July, defeating Natalya before being confronted by the brand female talents. On the 16 August episode of SmackDown Live, <b>Lynch</b> teamed with Carmella in a successful victory against Alexa Bliss and Natalya, after a distraction provided by Eva Marie and Naomi. It was later announced a six-woman tag team match for SummerSlam between <b>Lynch,</b> Carmella and Naomi against Bliss, Marie and Natalya, but following Marie's suspension on 18 August, her place was taken by the returning Nikki Bella, and Lynch's team would ultimately lose the match at evet on 21 August. At Backlash on 11 September, <b>Lynch</b> won a six-pack elimination challenge by last eliminating Carmella to become the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion, marking her first title victory in WWE. Lynch's first title defense against Alexa Bliss was scheduled for No Mercy on 9 October, but the match was postponed due to <b>Lynch</b> suffering a legitimate out-of-ring injury. The match was rescheduled for the 8 November episode of SmackDown Live, where <b>Lynch</b> successfully defended the title, albeit in controversial fashion (the referee did not see Bliss' foot on the rope when she submitted to her finishing maneuver, the Dis-arm-her). <b>Lynch</b> was a part of Team SmackDown at Survivor Series on 20 November, where she was the last woman from the team to be eliminated during the traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match.|$|E

5|$|At least 150 {{black women}} were <b>lynched</b> between 1880 and 1965 in the American South. Historian Kerry Segrave {{highlights}} 115 recorded cases between 1851 and 1946.

Women were usually not <b>lynched</b> alone, but {{tended to be}} treated as accomplices of men who were being <b>lynched.</b> Of 97 incidents examined by Segrave, 36 were of women <b>lynched</b> alone.|$|R
5|$|As Morgan and {{his allies}} on the Assembly of Jamaica {{continued}} to deal with privateers and pirates, criticism of their action in London was fomented by two former governors of Jamaica, Carbery and <b>Lynch.</b> After <b>Lynch</b> paid £50,000 to Charles II, Morgan's commissions as lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general were revoked and <b>Lynch</b> was appointed as the island's governor; Morgan still retained {{his position on the}} Assembly of Jamaica. Morgan had been a heavy drinker for several years; he received the news of the revocation of his positions badly and increased his intake of alcohol to the point where his health began to suffer. <b>Lynch</b> removed Morgan's supporters from the Assembly of Jamaica by 1683, and in October that year he removed Morgan and his brother-in-law, leaving the assembly packed with men loyal to him. In 1684 <b>Lynch</b> died, and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend, the lieutenant-general, Hender Molesworth.|$|E
5|$|Back in New Zealand, <b>Lynch</b> {{did well}} in the premier women's road stage race in 1991 and 1992, and won bronze in the 1991 New Zealand National Road Race Championships, yet was not picked for the 1992 Olympic road cycling team. Her biographer speculates that the {{selectors}} were possibly influenced in their decision by Lynch's failure to get Harris into a medal position at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. She competed hard in the 1992 Tour Cycliste Féminin – the Tour de France for women. The ten-stage race was the most challenging event on the women's road racing calendar that year, and many big names entered. New Zealand had six competitors. <b>Lynch</b> {{set the tone for}} the team by coming fourth in the prologue in Paris. Jacqui Nelson and <b>Lynch</b> were the only New Zealanders remaining in the final stage, and <b>Lynch</b> came sixth ascending into Alpe d'Huez.

5000|$|The <b>lynching</b> of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the Southwest {{has long}} been {{overlooked}} in American history. This {{may be due to}} the fact that most historical records categorized Mexicans, Italians, Native Americans, and sometimes Chinese <b>lynching</b> victims as white. It is estimated that at least 597 Mexican Americans were <b>lynched</b> between 1848 and 1928. Mexicans were <b>lynched</b> at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 of population between 1880 and 1930. This statistic is second only to that of the African American community during that period, which suffered an average of 37.1 per 100,000 population. Between 1848 and 1879, Mexicans were <b>lynched</b> at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 of population. Most of these lynchings were not instances of [...] "frontier justice"—of the 597 total victims, only 64 were <b>lynched</b> in areas which lacked a formal judicial system.

5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. <b>Lynch</b> syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with <b>Lynch</b> syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in <b>Lynch</b> syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in <b>Lynch</b> syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with <b>Lynch</b> syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with <b>Lynch</b> syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E
