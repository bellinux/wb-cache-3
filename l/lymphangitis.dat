25|$|The {{secondary}} stage most often occurs 10–30 days later, but can present {{up to six}} months later. The infection spreads to the lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. The most frequent presenting clinical manifestation of LGV among males whose primary exposure was genital is unilateral (in 2/3 of cases) lymphadenitis and <b>lymphangitis,</b> often with tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy because of the drainage pathway for their likely infected areas. <b>Lymphangitis</b> of the dorsal penis may also occur and resembles a string or cord. If the route was anal sex the infected person may experience lymphadenitis and <b>lymphangitis</b> noted above. They may instead develop proctitis, inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal 10–12cm) that may be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, and rectal discharge, or proctocolitis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12cm above the anus and associated with symptoms of proctitis plus diarrhea or abdominal cramps.|$|E
25|$|Non-measurable lesions – {{all other}} lesions, {{including}} small lesions (longest diameter <20nbsp&mm with conventional techniques or <10nbsp&mm with spiral CT scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, <b>lymphangitis</b> cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses {{that are not}} confirmed and followed by imaging techniques.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{symptoms}} {{may include}} inflammatory {{involvement of the}} perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues. In females, cervicitis, perimetritis, or salpingitis may occur as well as <b>lymphangitis</b> and lymphadenitis in deeper nodes. Because of lymphatic drainage pathways, some patients develop an abdominal mass which seldom suppurates, and 20–30% develop inguinal lymphadenopathy. Systemic signs which can appear include fever, decreased appetite, and malaise. Diagnosis is more difficult in {{women and men who}} have sex with men (MSM) who may not have the inguinal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|When the lymphatic {{impairment}} {{becomes so}} great that the lymph fluid exceeds the lymphatic system's ability to transport it, an abnormal amount of protein-rich fluid collects in the tissues. Left untreated, this stagnant, protein-rich fluid causes tissue channels to increase in size and number, reducing oxygen availability. This interferes with wound healing and provides a rich culture medium for bacterial growth that can result in infections: cellulitis, <b>lymphangitis,</b> lymphadenitis and in severe cases, skin ulcers. It is vital for lymphedema patients {{to be aware of the}} symptoms of infection and to seek immediate treatment, since recurrent infections or cellulitis, in addition to their inherent danger, further damage the lymphatic system and set up a vicious circle.|$|E
500|$|In 1911 Southard and his {{laboratory}} assistant, Emma Mooers, contracted a streptococcal infection during an autopsy. Mooers died and Southard developed <b>lymphangitis</b> in his arm, undergoing aggressive surgery and recovering over several months. Although he wrote {{an outline of}} his autobiography and traveled extensively in Europe during his convalescence, he felt unable to concentrate on research and referred to this period as [...] "the wasted year". Southard led the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, which had opened as a department of Boston State Hospital, from 1912 until his death.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lymphangitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} or {{an infection}} of the lymphatic channels that {{occurs as a result}} of infection at a site distal to the channel.
