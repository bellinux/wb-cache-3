40|$|Effective {{management}} of critically endangered sawfishes {{can be a}} difficult task, {{in part due to}} interspecies misidentification. Current methods for identifying sawfishes can be impractical as they are based on morphological features that are often unobservable. Further exploration is required to develop a more reliable means of identification. This study explored the utility of sawfish rostra in determining the species, size and sex of sawfishes, as rostra are commonly the only feature of a sawfish observed by fishers or present in public and private collections. A morphometric and meristic database consisting of over 1100 narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), dwarf <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis clavata), <b>largetooth</b> (or freshwater) <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis pristis; formerly Pristis microdon) and green sawfish (Pristis zijsron) rostra from Australian waters, was statistically analysed. Identification of sawfishes was found to be possible through the use of the variables: inter-tooth spacing, standard rostrum width/standard rostrum length, standard rostrum length/total rostrum length, rostrum tip width/standard rostrum length, and/or rostral tooth count range, although the distinguishing variables were species-dependent. The relationship between standard rostrum length and total length was also observed to vary substantially between most species. Models for estimating total length from standard rostrum length are provided. This study has provided a tool {{that can be used to}} identify accurately the species and size of sawfishes by their rostra, and therefore can assist in clarifying historical and contemporary sawfish records, nomenclature and distributions. A better understanding of these issues should allow sawfish conservation strategies to become more focused, and thus more effective. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Sawfishes are {{generally}} a tropical marine and estuarine elasmobranch (shark and ray relative). All modern sawfishes {{appear to be}} more shark-like than ray-like, with only the trunk and especially the head ventrally flattened. The presence of a rostrum having laterally protruding teeth separates sawfishes from skates and rays (Figure 1). The rostrum has a saw-like appearance and hence the name of sawfish. The <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> and the smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) are similar in appearance. The two species can usually be differentiated by noting the number of teeth {{on one side of the}} rostrum. <b>Largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> can have between 14 and 21 rostral teeth on one edge of the saw whereas smalltooth sawfish usually have 23 to 34 (McEachran and Fechhelm 1998, Compagno and Last 1999). These two species can also be distinguished by observing that in <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> the first dorsal fin originates anterior to the pelvic fins, while in smalltooth sawfish the first dorsal fin originates along the same axis as the pelvic fins. The pectoral fins of <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> are proportionally larger than those of smalltooth sawfish. Furthermore, only <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> has a distinct lower lobe on its caudal fin (McEachran and Fechhelm 1998, Compagno and Last 1999).

40|$|Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a {{relatively}} new tool for the detection of rare, threatened and invasive species in water bodies. In this study we investigated the utility of an eDNA approach in detecting the Critically Endangered <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis pristis in freshwater habitats in northern Australia. Water samples were collected from large aquaria mesocosms containing <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> and other aquatic species, and floodplain waterholes and the main river channel of the Daly River, Northern Territory. Water samples were filtered using a 20 mu m nylon filter. DNA was extracted from filters and analysed with PCR using species-specific mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primers designed to amplify only <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> DNA. PCR products were cleaned and the COI gene sequenced to confirm the species identity. Using 3 aquaria, with one containing a <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish,</b> this method positively identified sawfish only in the correct aquarium. In the field water samples, 7 of 8 floodplain waterholes produced a sawfish eDNA PCR product, while eDNA was not detected in the main river channel. Based on gillnet sampling and traditional ecological knowledge, <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> were known to occur at half of the waterhole and floodplain sites that tested positive for sawfish eDNA.

40|$|This status review {{summarizes}} the biological information gathered for an Endangered Species Act (ESA) {{assessment of the}} status of the <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis perotteti). Species are added to a Species of Concern list as a notification to the public that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has concerns about a species or population which may lead to listing under the ESA. The purpose of this list is to facilitate and encourage outside voluntary conservation efforts that act to prevent species from an ESA listing. It is the policy of NMFS to highlight these species before they are listed so that Federal and state agencies, Native American tribes, and the private sector are aware of unlisted species that could benefit from proactive conservation efforts. The following text explains the chronological history {{of the status of}} the species starting with its listing as candidate species. The <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> was listed as a candidate species by the NMFS on June 11, 1991 (56 FR 26797), along with the smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata). Both species were removed from the candidates list on July, 14 1997 (62 FR 37560), but were subsequently added to the revised list published on June 23, 1999 (64 FR 33466). On November 30, 1999, the Center for Marine Conservation (currently called Ocean Conservancy) petitioned NMFS to list North American populations of largetooth and smalltooth sawfish as endangered under the ESA.

40|$|Increasing {{exploitation}} {{effort and}} efficiency have been leading to population declines and extinctions among large marine animals. Understanding {{the magnitude of}} such losses is challenging because current baselines about species' abundances and distributions in the sea were mostly established after humans had started affecting marine populations. For artisanal fisheries, from which written historical records are rarely, if ever, available, approaches based on gathering anecdotal information from fishers' knowledge are a promising method to know the past environmental conditions. We interviewed coastal artisanal fishers, with ages varying from 15 to 85 years, to detect temporal changes in the catch abundance of large fish species, particularly the <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis pristis and the goliath grouper Epinephelus itajara within Abrolhos Bank, Brazil. Most fishers considered that fishing has led to species depletion. However, older fishers reported significantly more species and larger species as depleted than young fishers. Older fishers caught significantly larger <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> and goliath grouper in the past than younger fishers. The <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> has not been caught or sought for more than 10 years. Probabilistic tests provided no definitive evidence for local extinction, although the past record of sightings indicates a population decline close to the threshold level for extinction probability. We provide evidence that small-scale artisanal fisheries can decimate the abundance of large coastal fishes, one of those almost close to local extinction. Finally, our {{results suggest that the}} younger generation is not aware of past ecological conditions, indicating the occurrence of a shifting baseline syndrome among the fishing community. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Class Elasmobranchii {{represents}} {{a family of}} fishes which have developed {{a wide array of}} adaptations which have allowed the family to survive {{over the course of the}} last 400 million years. Within Class Elasmobranchii, the sawfish (Family Pristidae) represent a family of highly adapted, unique organisms. Family Pristidae, however, also {{represents a}} family of fishes placed in peril, when adaptations which allow for greater hunting capabilities and broader range of habitat place them at significant risk when faced with increased fishing pressure and anthropogenic effects within their natural habitat. Of the six to seven currently recognized extant species of sawfish, the smalltooth sawfish, P. pectinata, and the <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish,</b> P. perotteti, are the only two species of sawfish native to North American waters. Their historical ranges extended throughout North America, with areas of greatest abundance in parts of the United States and most of the Caribbean coast of Central America. However, both species have undergone dramatic transitions in population abundance and range over the course of the last century. Incidental capture as bycatch, overexploitation by directed fisheries, increased demand in local and international trade, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic influences have led to severe declines in population abundance and loss of critical nursery habitat, leading both species to be extirpated from the majority of their native habitat and facing the threat of extinction. While essential steps have been taken to protect P. pectinata in U. S. waters, critical protections are yet to be in place to prevent the possible extinction of P. perotteti, as well as further degradation and possible extinction of P. pectinata. This paper will serve as a comprehensive collection of known scientific literature to date for the smalltooth sawfish, Pristis pectinata, and <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish,</b> Pristis perotteti, in North American waters. This paper will focus on the anatomy, physiology, biology and life history of both species, as well as provide a comprehensive review of shifts in population size and range throughout North America, and the threats facing both species, both historically and in present day...|$|E
40|$|Sawfishes (Pristidae) were {{formerly}} {{abundant in}} the western Indian Ocean, but current data on sawfish presence and distribution are lacking {{for most of the}} region. This paper summarises historical records of sawfishes in Mozambican waters and presents the findings of the first assessment of the presence and status of sawfishes in Mozambique. A countrywide baseline assessment was undertaken between May and July 2014, using interviews with artisanal, semi-industrial and industrial fishers, fish traders and fisheries monitoring staff as the primary source of information on sawfish distribution, recent catches, socio-economic value and cultural importance. Additional interviews were conducted via email or telephone with individuals running sport fishing operations or who otherwise had considerable experience interacting with the fishing sectors or the marine environment in Mozambique. Where encountered, sawfish rostra were photographed and a series of measurements and associated data were collected. In total, 200 questionnaire surveys and seven interviews with recreational fishing and dive operators were conducted, and 19 rostra were documented from museum archives and private collections, belonging to two sawfish species, the <b>Largetooth</b> <b>Sawfish</b> (Pristis pristis) and Green Sawfish (P. zijsron). The most recent captures of sawfishes were reported to have occurred in 2014. Two key sites were identified where both recent encounters were reported and numerous <b>Largetooth</b> <b>Sawfish</b> rostra were documented. Gill nets were the fishing gear most commonly attributed to sawfish catches. Sawfishes did not hold any cultural importance in Mozambique, but they have at least some socio-economic importance to artisanal fishers, primarily through the sale of their fins. The meat {{did not appear to be}} held in high regard and was usually consumed locally. Sampling and further research is now required to confirm the presence of sawfishes and to assess the primary threats to sawfishes in those areas. At one site where a number of rostra were present and where fishers stated that they still catch sawfish, gill nets are being provided to fishers as an alternative to beach seining. This may have a serious impact on the local sawfish population and more broadly for other elasmobranchs in the area. Immediate action is required to develop a landings monitoring programme in this and other key habitats, and to encourage fishers to release sawfishes alive...|$|E

40|$|New {{characters}} {{based on}} the arrangement and morphology of dermal denticles show that sawfishes {{can be divided into}} two distinctive groups. The first group, comprising the knifetooth sawfish Anoxypristis cuspidata, is characterized by tricuspid denticles variably located on both dorsal and ventral parts of the body. The second group is represented by species of the genus Pristis, showing an uniform and homogenous dermal covering of monocuspidate denticles on both dorsal and ventral sides of the body and within the buccopharyngeal cavity. Pristis is further divided into two subgroups: the first comprises species with denticles lacking any keels and furrows (the smalltooth sawfish Pristis pectinata, the green sawfish Pristis zijsron and the dwarf sawfish Pristis clavata); the second comprises species with denticles presenting keels and furrows well differentiated on their anterior part (the common sawfish Pristis pristis, the <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis perotteti and the greattooth sawfish Pristis microdon).

The parasite has 2 juxtaposed testes and differs from other microbothriids in possessing a unique and unusual terminal male reproductive tract comprising a proximal and a distal tube, the latter with a conspicuous opening on the ventral surface and lacking a recognisable male copulatory organ. The smalltooth sawfish, P. pectinata, also has a skin-parasitic microbothriid, Dermophthirioides pristidis Cheung et Nigrelli, 1983, but this parasite species has a prominent copulatory papilla.

40|$|The <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis pristis (Linnaeus, 1758) is {{a highly}} {{threatened}} euryhaline elasmobranch that in recent times has undergone a significant range contraction. It now only remains in a few areas, with northern Australia being the main stronghold. Previous work using a single mitochondrial gene approach suggested the existence of regional barriers to gene flow in northern Australia. In this study, whole mitochondrial sequences of 92 P. pristis from 7 river drainages across northern Australia were used to refine the population structure. This approach revealed barriers to gene flow at a scale as fine as between adjacent river drainages. Except for those flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria, all river drainages appeared to host a genetically distinct population. The apparent genetic homogeneity in the Gulf is probably due to freshwater connectivity between river drainages, either during the last glaciation event when the Gulf was a freshwater lake or through contemporary wet season flooding. These results suggest that each river drainage across the species' range {{should be considered a}} discrete management unit unless there is evidence of freshwater connectivity. More broadly, the improved resolution of population structure obtained with whole mitogenome analysis compared to single mitochondrial gene approaches suggests that female reproductive philopatry may have been overlooked in previous studies of some elasmobranch species...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of how {{an animal}} uses its habitat is a {{fundamental}} component of effective conservation strategies. The Critically Endangered <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis pristis uses rivers and their estuaries as nursery habitats, where {{it is likely to}} be exposed to elevated pressures from anthropogenic-induced stresses including fishing (e. g. bycatch or direct harvest) and instream habitat modification and degradation (e. g. barriers, water extraction, and mining). With a paucity of data available on habitat use of P. pristis, we monitored the movements of 32 juveniles (952 to 2510 mm total length; mean +/- SE = 1919 +/- 64 mm) using acoustic telemetry to explore correlations between sawfish movement and abiotic as well as biotic variables over an 8 yr period (2008 to 2015) in the freshwater reaches of the Fitzroy River, Western Australia. Monitored juveniles were least active when they occupied deeper runs and pools in proximity to large woody debris by day and were most active during night-time and twilight hours when inhabiting shallow water such as glides, pool edges, and shallow runs. These shifts in activity and habitat use were primarily mediated by foraging and refuging behaviours, which were coupled to day-night cycling of light availability. Protection of these instream habitats and the understanding of their use by P. pristis are important for aiding in the management of intermittently flowing rivers that are used as nurseries for this species...|$|E
40|$|Northern Australia {{has been}} {{identified}} as the last stronghold for the dwarf sawfish Pristis clavata, green sawfish P. zijsron, and <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> P. pristis, making these populations key in global conservation efforts for each species. This research assesses the levels of genetic diversity in these 3 sawfishes in Australian waters, testing for the presence of population bottlenecks using data at microsatellite loci. Levels of observed heterozygosity in each species from the west coast of Australia and the north-eastern Gulf of Carpentaria were generally high. M ratio tests suggest that assemblages of P. zijsron and P. pristis on the west coast and P. clavata and P. zijsron in the Gulf of Carpentaria may have experienced population bottlenecks. The bottlenecks are especially pronounced in P. zijsron populations and in P. clavata from the Gulf of Carpentaria. Demographic analyses, based on mtDNA data, indicate relatively recent (evolutionarily) range expansions in Pristis sawfishes in northern Australian waters, which could account for the population bottlenecks. A more recent range expansion in each of P. clavata and P. zijsron, as evidenced by more recent population divergence and more recent/higher rates of historic maternal gene flow, could account for the more pronounced bottlenecks in these species when compared to P. pristis. Given that Pristis sawfishes in Australian waters have experienced population bottlenecks, whether they be historic, contemporary or both, the preservation of remaining genetic diversity should be a high conservation priority...|$|E
40|$|Temperature affects most {{physiological}} processes {{which in}} turn impact animal behaviour and ecology. In ectotherms, both short- and long-term variations in temperature impact physiological (i. e. locomotor and metabolic capacity) and ecological (i. e. body condition and growth) performance and thus affect survival. It is therefore critical to understand the mechanisms driving these relationships. Here, we investigated the impact of seasonally changing temperature on the ecological and physiological performance of juvenile free-ranging <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis pristis) in its riverine nursery in North Western Australia. Animal-attached accelerometers, revealed that despite a 10 °C increase in temperature, sawfish were active and displayed substantial burst-swimming capacity. Physiological performance, as ascertained by locomotory capacity, increased in the warmer late dry season conditions, whereas timing and duration of activity did not. Contrary to the physiological performance, late season sawfish were poorer condition that those in the early season. Activity was primarily crepuscular, irrespective of the season. This suggests that even though locomotory performance of juvenile sawfish increased at greater temperature, foraging activity and thus energy intake was not sufficient to maintain body condition, resulting in declining growth. Contrary to popular belief, seeking warmer temperatures can represent a disadvantage for juveniles under certain scenarios. Especially for individuals that are intake limited, greater temperatures and associated metabolic rates are disadvantageous and can result in lower growth rates and potentially starvation. Physiological and ecological performances may thus respond differently to warming temperatures, emphasizing that ‘optimal’ temperatures may be highly context dependent. Ecological scenarios responsible for mediating growth performance are discussed and integrated into a classic bio-energetics framework...|$|E
40|$|Major {{transitions}} between {{marine and}} freshwater habitats are relatively infrequent, {{primarily as a}} result of major physiological and ecological challenges. Few species of cartilaginous fish have evolved to occupy freshwater habitats. Current thought suggests that the metabolic physiology of sharks has remained a barrier to the diversification of this taxon in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we demonstrate that the physical properties of water provide an additional constraint for this species-rich group to occupy freshwater systems. Using hydromechanical modeling, we show that occurrence in fresh water results in a two- to three-fold increase in negative buoyancy for sharks and rays. This carries the energetic cost of lift production and results in increased buoyancy-dependent mechanical power requirements for swimming and increased optimal swim speeds. The primary source of buoyancy, the lipidrich liver, offers only limited compensation for increased negative buoyancy {{as a result of}} decreasing water density; maintaining the same submerged weight would involve increasing the liver volume by very large amounts: 3 - to 4 -fold in scenarios where liver density is also reduced to currently observed minimal levels and 8 -fold without any changes in liver density. The first data on body density from two species of elasmobranch occurring in freshwater (the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, Muller and Henle 1839, and the <b>largetooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis pristis, Linnaeus 1758) support this hypothesis, showing similar liver sizes as marine forms but lower liver densities, but the greatest negative buoyancies of any elasmobranch studied to date. Our data suggest that the mechanical challenges associated with buoyancy control may have hampered the invasion of freshwater habitats in elasmobranchs, highlighting an additional key factor that may govern the predisposition of marine organisms to successfully establish in freshwater habitats...|$|E
