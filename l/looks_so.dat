500|$|In 1966, Norman {{recorded}} several tracks with Jimi Hendrix on {{session at}} Abtone Studio in New York: [...] "You're Only Hurting Yourself", [...] "Little Groovemaker" [...] and [...] "On You Girlie It <b>Looks</b> <b>so</b> Good". The second {{of these songs}} was retooled under the title [...] "Groove Maker" [...] and has been included {{on a number of}} Hendrix releases. According to Black Gold: The Lost Archives of Jimi Hendrix, Norman—not Lonnie Youngblood as popularly supposed—was the primary performer besides Hendrix on this song. Jimi Hendrix– From the Benjamin Franklin Studios 3rd Edition Part 1: The Complete Guide to the Recorded Work of Jimi Hendrix posits Youngblood on saxophone, but gives writing credit to Norman. Jimi Hendrix: Musician documents the confusion surrounding this and other Hendrix sessions of the time, including the difficulty in tracking contributions when they also rose from later manipulation of the material as Hendrix became famous. [...] "You're Only Hurting Yourself" [...] and [...] "Little Groovemaker" [...] were first released under Norman's name as Samar records single 112 in 1966 and never again released in original form. [...] "On You Girlie It <b>Looks</b> <b>so</b> Good" [...] remains unreleased.|$|E

She <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> good in it." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy opined that the music video is Clarkson's best video to date. The music video had a successful run at Total Request Live where it topped the chart for 33 days, a record that Clarkson holds for the longest stay by a female artist at {{number one on the}} chart.|$|E

GameSpot remarked that in a higher resolution, [...] " [...] textures of the landscapes, the ships, the lighting effectseverything <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> much better," [...] while IGN's Peer Schneider said, [...] "After playing {{the game in the}} optional high resolution mode (640×480) once, it's impossible {{to go back to the}} still respectable standard resolution." [...] Citing details such as decals, Rebel markings, R2 units, cockpit views and exhaust flames, Schneider described the game's 3D ship models as [...] "gorgeous". IGN's Matt Casamassina said that the game was the best-looking Nintendo 64 game to date.|$|E

500|$|Brooks {{included}} two nude studies {{in this first}} exhibitiona provocative choice for a woman artist in 1910. In The Red Jacket, a young woman {{stands in front of}} a large folding screen, wearing only a small open jacket, with her hands behind her back. She is so frail, and her downcast face <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> forlorn that one contemporary reviewer referred to her as a consumptive; Brooks described her simply as [...] "a poor girl who was cold". The other, White Azaleas, is a more sexually charged nude study of a woman reclining on a couch. [...] Contemporary reviews compared it to Francisco de Goya's La maja desnuda and Édouard Manet's Olympia. Unlike the women in those paintings, the subject of White Azaleas looks away from the viewer; in the background above her is a series of Japanese prints which Brooks loved.|$|E

The family goes to the car wash {{to get rid of the}} dust, and when Homer is there, he sees that Ned Flanders gets a senior discount. Homer thinks Ned is lying and tries to expose him at church, but Ned proves he really is sixty years old. People are impressed that Ned <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> young for his age and remark that he must take exceptional care of himself, but when Ned says that he follows the three [...] "c"s of success—clean living, chewing thoroughly, and [...] "a daily dose of vitamin Church!"—they start to pity him for having never, in their view, truly lived at all.|$|E

500|$|Although Verlaine {{was against}} drug use after Television formed, {{he once had}} a {{short-lived}} phase using psychedelic drugs, to which he makes reference in similes on songs such as [...] "Venus". The vignette-like lyrics follow an ostensibly drug-induced, revelatory experience: [...] "You know it's all like some new kind of drug / my senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves / Broadway <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> medieval, it seems to flap like little pages / I fell sideways laughing, with a friend from many stages." [...] According to Waterman, although psychedelic trips informed the experiences of many artists in lower Manhattan at the time, [...] "Venus" [...] contributed to the impression of Marquee Moon as a transcendental work in the vein of 19th-century Romanticism: [...] "Verlaine is into perception, and sometimes the perception he represents is as intense as a mind-altering substance." [...] Christgau said the lyric about Broadway lent the album its association among critics to the East Village, as it [...] "situates this philosophical action in the downtown night".|$|E
500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{young soldier}} is {{unaware of what}} is happening, at first – he asks why the bugles are blowing, and why the Sergeant <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> pale, but is told that Deever is being hanged, and that the {{regiment}} is drawn up in [...] "ollow square" [...] to see it. He presses the Sergeant further, in the second verse – why are people breathing so hard? why are some men collapsing? These signs of the effect that watching the hanging has upon {{the men of the}} regiment are explained away by the Sergeant as being due to the cold weather or the bright sun. The voice is reassuring, keeping the young soldier calm in the sight of death, just as the Sergeant will calm him with his voice in combat. In the third verse, Files thinks of Deever, saying that he slept alongside him, and drank with him, but the Sergeant reminds him that Deever is now alone, that he sleeps [...] "out an' far to-night", and reminds the soldier of the magnitude of Deever's crime – ...|$|E

Sabi rap's also {{alludes to the}} theme of the song, with lines such as [...] "I think I like you/Boy, boy, look at you/I want to get next to you/Got me kind of hot but I ain't {{sweating}} you/Steaming like a pot full of vegetables". Spears references The Notorious B.I.G.'s hit [...] "Hypnotize" [...] in [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] in the line [...] "You must be B.I.G. because you got me Hypnotized". Spears' vocals on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] were deemed as [...] "robotic", but similar to the ones of [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] (2000). Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted the singer uses her deep vocals in lines such as [...] "And, yeah, your body <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> sick, I think I caught the flu" [...] and [...] "You must be B.I.G. 'cause you got me hypnotized".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E
500|$|Pinocchio was a {{groundbreaking}} {{achievement in the}} area of effects animation. In contrast to the character animators who concentrate on the acting of the characters, effects animators create everything that moves other than the characters. This includes vehicles, machinery and natural effects such as rain, lightning, snow, smoke, shadows and water, as well as the fantasy or science-fiction type effects like Fairy Dust. The influential abstract animator Oskar Fischinger, who mainly worked on Fantasia contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy's wand. Effects animator Sandy Strother kept a diary about his year-long animation of the water effects, which included splashes, ripples, bubbles, waves and the illusion of being underwater. To help give depth to the ocean, the animators put more detail into the waves on the water surface in the foreground, and put in less detail as the surface moved further back. After the animation was traced onto cels, the animators would trace it once more with blue and black pencil leads to give the waves a sculptured look. To save time and money, the splashes were kept impressionistic. These techniques enabled Pinocchio {{to be one of the}} first animated films to have highly realistic effects animation. Ollie Johnston remarked [...] "I think that's one of the finest things the studio's ever done, as Frank [...] said, 'The water <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> real a person can drown in it, and they do.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Determined {{not to use}} any big Hollywood names, King {{looked at}} many European actors before {{settling}} on British actor Rupert Friend. They were aware of him from the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice. Vallée noted, [...] "I had an image of Albert in my mind, before we cast Rupert, and how the actor might play him and when Rupert came on board he was just right. He {{had a very good}} understanding of the character and he did a lot of research to get him right, with the accent and his deportment. He really looks the part, he <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> romantic!" [...] Co-producer Dennis O'Sullivan called Friend [...] "our Scarlett O'Hara search". They believed the actor had the most chemistry with Blunt after selecting several to play chess with her. Friend's height (6ft 1in) also played a factor in their choice. Friend believed [...] "Albert was a true unsung hero. A great reformer, a doting husband and father, a hard worker and man of real integrity and modesty." [...] The actor also thought their relationship was not [...] "a gooey love story"; rather, their arguments showed it [...] "wasn't an easy road by any means". Friend strove to immerse himself in the role, and learned the prince's particular characteristics, such as the way he rode a horse, walked, and played the piano. He worked with a voice coach and German instructor to perfect his accent, with the intention of [...] "put in as much German as possible, because Victoria and Albert did speak German to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The diaries {{of writers}} and journalists such as William Camden, Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe, John Byng and William Cobbett {{illustrate}} {{the decline of}} Ely after the 14th century plague and the 16th century reformation {{which led to the}} dissolution of the monastery in 1539. In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… and its a shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> like a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis likely will be thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is mean, to the extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean. Everything seems to be on the decline, as, indeed, is the case everywhere, where the clergy are the masters".|$|E
500|$|Initial {{critical}} response towards Aurora {{was generally}} unfavorable. During the 1950s, Disney received [...] "harsh criticism" [...] for depicting both Cinderella and Aurora as [...] "naïve and malleable" [...] characters, {{and failing to}} acknowledge {{the ways in which}} women's roles in society had evolved since Snow White's debut in 1937. Critics agree that Aurora represents [...] "the classic damsel in distress" [...] by being depicted as a beautiful young woman who is rescued by a stranger. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times felt that the character was too similar to Snow White, writing, [...] "The princess <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> much like Snow White they could be a couple of Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years." [...] Time Out dismissed Aurora as a [...] "delicate" [...] and [...] "vapid" [...] character. Bustle's Mary Grace Garis wrote that the character [...] "suffers from having very little definable personality and ... serious Damsel-in-Distress syndrome". Sonia Saraiya of Jezebel echoed this sentiment, criticizing Aurora for lacking [...] "interesting qualities"; Saraiya also ranked Aurora Disney's least feminist princess. Similarly, Bustle also ranked Aurora the least feminist Disney Princess, with author Chelsea Mize expounding, [...] "Aurora literally sleeps for like three quarters of the movie ... Aurora just straight-up has no agency, and really isn't doing {{much in the way of}} feminine progress." [...] Dismissing the character as [...] "barely more than a cipher", Leigh Butler of Tor.com panned Aurora as [...] "a Barbie doll knockoff who does nothing the whole film but sing wistfully about Finding Her Man, before becoming the ultimate passive Damsel in Distress". However, Butler went on to defend the character somewhat, writing, [...] "Aurora’s cipher-ness in Sleeping Beauty would be infuriating if she were the only female character in it, but the presence of the Fairies and Maleficent allow her to be what she is without it being a subconscious statement on what all women are." [...] Similarly, Refinery29 ranked Aurora the fourth most feminist Disney Princess because [...] "Her aunts have essentially raised her in a place where women run the game." ...|$|E
