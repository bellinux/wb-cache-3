5000|$|In [...] "World Peace - The Transition", Author Edward Tilley {{presents}} {{research to}} suggest that these economic booms and depressions are the natural result of climbing inequity and normal Capitalism. As opportunity wains {{near the end of}} a <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>cycle,</b> deep recessions and depressions are created which in history have resulted in either a war or revolution in approximately 20% of cases; 80% of the time, however, depressions were ended when inequity was reset by government policy and wealth distributions. The Great Depression of 1935 for example, was ended by the California Gold Rush; an event which multiplied the gold reserves of the U.S. by 10-times. Perhaps a dozen Depressions were averted by the Hammurabi Code's Economic Control of 50-year Jubilees in history, but this tool worked within a Monarchy. In a Democracy, all voters would have to be trained to insist on and vote for these economic controls that reset inequity, or depressions must be inevitable. Tilley composed a Civics Course designed to give Grade 10 students this training as well.|$|E

40|$|M. Com. This {{is a study}} {{about the}} Long Wave in the South African economy in {{particular}} and the world economy in general. The study is both theoretical and empirical in its nature. In chapter two the study looks at the four main cycles starting with the phases of a cycle in general. A true cycle must show some regular pattern of fluctuation, which may be endogenous or exogenous. The Kitchin 'inventory' cycle of three to four years, peak to peak, which appears due to overshoots and undershoots of business inventories. Another cycle, the Juglar or investment cycle has a length of seven to eleven years, and {{appears to have been}} driven by investment in fixed assets rather than stocks. The next cycle to be investigated is the Kuznets or building cycle and is driven by some exogenous factor (migration) and is some fifteen to twenty five years long. The last cycle to be briefly studied in chapter two is the Kondratieff cycle or the Long Wave of some forty five to sixty years in duration. In chapter three the author gives a critical overview of some recent Long Wave theories, which, although not complete, does seek to diminish the present confusion in literature and to emphasize the complementary nature of the different approaches. A classification is made of the theories based on production factors. In this way the theories have been classified as: those which consider the role of the innovation (i. e. entrepreneurship) as crucial (Schumpeter and Mensch); the capital theories (Mandel and Forrester); the labour theory of Freeman; and Rostow's theory of development and the importance of raw materials; finally the integrated theory of Van Duijn which does not focus on any specific production factor. In chapter four the author does an empirical study in four categories into the existence of the Long Wave in South Africa. The categories are: Prices; Growth; Unemployment and Technology. South African and international data series are used to see where on the <b>Long</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>cycle</b> South Africa finds it's self. Prices of commodities in the world market place are presented in both nominal and real price series. South African consumer and production prices are analysed. South African growth is studied from 1806 and categorised into Kondratieff cycles. Unemployment is emphasised and data from five sectors has been obtained from 1920 to analyse. The sectors manufacturing, mining, transport, electricity and construction. Technology is presented in a wider sense as South Africa does not have much to present in this field. The worlds technology is discussed as are its effects and then presented in graphical form for the last three Kondratieff cycles including the fifth Kondratieff. Chapter five attempts a graphical model of the South African Long Wave. It presents a short summary of the empirical evidence for South Africa. The basic conclusion is that South Africa has a <b>Long</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|E
40|$|Economists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} with the economic fluctuations that occur more-orless regularly in all capitalist economies. (Sherman 1991; Wolfson 1994) To be sure, there are different kinds of economic fluctuations—ranging from the Kitchin cycle (tied to inventory swings and lasting on average 39 months) to the Juglar cycle (lasting {{about seven or eight}} years and linked to investment in plant and equipment) to the Kuznets cycle of twenty years (associated with demographic changes) and finally to the Kondratieff <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>cycles</b> attributed to major innovations (electrification, the automobile). (Kindleberger 1989) Financial factors might play only a small role in some of these fluctuations. Generally, economists studying financial instability have tended to focus on periodic financial crises that frequently coincide with the peak of the common business cycle, although financial crises (especially in recent years) can occur at other times during the cycle. Furthermore, an economy might be financially unstable but manage to avoid a financial crisis. It is best to think of financial instability as a tendency rather than as a specific event, although the typical financial crisis might be the result of unstable financial processes generated {{over the course of a}} business cycle expansion.

40|$|Recent {{economic}} {{events have}} revived {{interest in the}} economic <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> or Kondratiev <b>cycle,</b> a cycle of economic expansion and depression lasting about fifty years. Since 1975 the System Dynamics National Model has provided an increasingly rich theory of the <b>long</b> <b>wave.</b> The theory revolves around "self-ordering" of capital, the dependence of the capital-producing sectors of the economy, in the aggregate, on their own output. The long-wave theory growing out of the National Model relates capital investment, employment and workforce participation, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, productivity and innovation, and even political values. The advantage of the National Model is the rich detail in which economic behavior is represented.

The behavior of the model is analyzed, and the role of self-ordering in generating the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> is determined.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to develop a new {{perspective}} of large-scale educational reform as <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> or <b>long</b> <b>cycles</b> in the history of Western industrialized countries (specifically the US). Kondratieff cycles refer to a “law of motion ” in the capitalist mode of production: Since the establishment of the industrial capitalism in the late 18 th century, capitalism has moved through <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> of upswings followed by <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> of downswings, each complete cycle comprising about 50 to 60 years intervals.

The historical evidence provided in this article demonstrate that large scale educational reforms in the history of Western industrialized countries have coincided with the downswing phase of each Kondratieff cycle.

The central focus of this dissertation is on the world economy. Consequently, it is argued that recent economic instability cannot be properly understood except from global perspective. The structure of the world economy, in particular its division into a developed center and a less-developed periphery, is considered to be {{an essential part of the}} long-term dynamics of the world system, here considered in the context of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> or Kondratieff <b>cycles.</b> The author reviews, synthesizes and reformulates some of the recent <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> theories. The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of a conceptual framework and the theoretical links between long-term oscillations inherent in the industrial economies and the periodic surges in the industrialization of peripheral areas. The essence of the author's hypothesis is that late in a <b>long</b> <b>wave's</b> expansion phase, factors that other authors have suggested would cause a tendency towards rationalizing, labor-saving innovations also tend to cause an increase in center-to-periphery capital flows and a surge in industrialization in the periphery areas. The recent surges in industrialization in some undeveloped countries that coincide with a slower economic growth in many developed countries confirms this. Factors that contribute to this development are, for instance, congestion in the labor market of the center, diffusion of key technologies of the preceding Kondratieff upswing and saturation of center markets. In addition, various other factors that influence the center-periphery relationship are discussed. The author sees the center-periphery structure of the world economy as inherently unstable, and his analysis is a step towards the ultimate goal of developing an evolutionary model capable of describing the periodic transformations of this structure as an endogenous process. The theoretical analysis is followed by discussions of some statistical and descriptive evidence. While the evidence does not allow for strong conclusions, it shows interesting patterns that might be worth further exploration. The author emphasizes a historical, rather than purely empirical, approach to the Kondratieff cycle. Primarily, however, the acceptability of the hypothesis will depend on the identification of a convincing mechanism that can explain the phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} {{laboratory}} data sets on surf beat is presented, {{with a focus}} on the dissipation of <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> energy in the surf zone. It is frequently assumed that incident forced <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> or "bound" <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> are released from short wave groups when the short waves break, subsequently propagating to the shore as a free <b>wave.</b> Free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> may additionally be generated by the moving short wave breakpoint Convincing evidence of the release of forced <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> as a result of short wave breaking is lacking, while there appears to be strong evidence to the contrary from a range of recent laboratory experiments. The data from the laboratory experiments are also consistent with field observations of strong nearshore dissipation of <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> These data are also consistent with Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962), who suggest that the forced <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> may reduce in amplitude following short wave breaking, not that it might be released as a free wave. In contrast, forced <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> can be progressively "released" from the groups when the short waves are in shallow water, since these conditions correspond to those where the forced <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> satisfies the free wave dispersion relationship. This frequently occurs prior to short wave breaking for mild wave conditions, but here it is shown that these conditions are not usually satisfied at the short wave breakpoint for storm conditions. Energy transfers between free and forced waves are also discussed with regard the data. A surf beat similarity parameter that incorporates both relative beach slope and short wave steepness is suggested, which distinguishes between different <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> forcing regimes inside the surf zone.

40|$|New {{laboratory}} {{data are}} presented on {{the influence of}} free <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups on sediment transport in the surf and swash zones. As a result of the very significant difficulties in isolating and identifying the morphodynamic influences of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups in field conditions, a laboratory study was designed specifically to enable measurements of sediment transport that resolve these influences. The evolution of model sand beaches, each with the same initial plane slope, was measured for a range of wave conditions, firstly using monochromatic short waves. Subsequently, the monochromatic conditions were perturbed with free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and then substituted with bichromatic wave groups with the same mean energy flux. The beach profile changes and net cross-shore transport rates were extracted and compared for the different wave conditions, with and without <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups. The experiments include a range of wave conditions, e. g. high-energy, moderate-energy, low-energy waves, which induce both spilling and plunging breakers and different turbulent intensities, and the beaches evolve to form classical accretive, erosive, and intermediate beach states. The data clearly demonstrate that free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> influence surf zone morphodynamics and promote increased onshore sediment transport during accretive conditions and decreased offshore transport under erosive conditions. In contrast, wave groups, which can generate both forced and free <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> generally reduce onshore transport during accretive conditions and increase offshore transport under erosive conditions. The influence of the free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups is consistent with the concept of the relative fall velocity, H/w(s) T, as a dominant parameter controlling net beach erosion or accretion. Free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> tend to reduce H/w(s) T, promoting accretion, while wave groups tend to increase the effective H/w(s) T, promoting erosion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|New {{laboratory}} {{data are}} presented on {{the influence of}} <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> on sediment transport in the surf zone. Due to the very significant difficulties in isolating the morphodynamic processes induced by <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> in field conditions, the laboratory study was designed practically to measure the net sediment transport rates, and gradients in sediment transport, arising from the interaction between <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and short waves in the surf zone. The bathymetric evolution of model sand beaches, with dB 50 B = 0. 2 mm, was observed under monochromatic short waves, long-wave short-wave combinations (free <b>long</b> <b>waves),</b> and bichromatic <b>wave</b> groups (forced <b>long</b> <b>waves).</b> The beach profile change and net cross-shore transport rates, Q(x), were extracted and compared for conditions with and without <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> The experiments include a range of wave conditions, e. g. high-energy, moderate-energy, low-energy waves, and the beaches evolve to form accretionary, erosive, and intermediate beach states. Hydrodynamic measurements were made to identify the influence of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> on short waves and to determine the correlation between surf zone bars and standing <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> A shallow water wave model was modified for this application to surf zone morphodynamics and compared to both hydrodynamics and measured sediment transport. This data clearly demonstrate that free large-amplitude <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> influence surf zone morphodynamics not only under accretive conditions, by promoting onshore sediment transport, but also under erosive conditions, by decreasing offshore transport. For the dominant berm-bar feature, the strong surf beat induces offshore transport in the inner surf zone and onshore transport around the outer surf zone and throughout the shoaling zone. In contrast, forced (bound) <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups correlated with bichromatic short wave groups play a pronounced role under erosive conditions, increasing offshore sediment transport across the whole beach profile. For accretionary conditions, only a very narrowbanded wave group promotes onshore sediment transport across the whole beach profile, while broader banded wave groups again promote offshore transport. The modified numerical model of Li et al. (2002) provides good predictions of the standing <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> pattern for the long-wave short-wave combinations, but generally poor agreement for the bichromatic wave groups. Similarly, this model performs poorly in terms of predicting the net sediment transport for all waves, even after optimising the sediment transport coefficients. This is because the model cannot predict the correct hydrodynamics around the breakpoint position and does not correctly represent net sediment transport mechanics. Overall, the model does not correctly predict the trends in beach profile evolution induced by the <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups. Further, {{there is little evidence that}} the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> nodal structure plays a dominant role. The influence of the free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups is consistent with the concept of the Gourlay parameter, H/wBsBT, as a dominant parameter controlling net erosion or accretion.

The total surf zone width was varied via changes in both wave height and the water level over the bar crest.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a stock-flow consistent macroeconomic {{model in which}} fi- nancial fragility in firm and household sectors evolves endogenously through the interaction between real and financial sectors. Changes in firms’ and households’ financial practices produce <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> The Hopf bifurcation theorem is applied to clarify the conditions {{for the existence of}} limit cycles, and simulations illustrate stable limit <b>cycles.</b> The <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> are characterized by periodic economic crises following long expansions. Short cycles, generated by the interaction between effective demand and labor market dynamics, fluctuate around the <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> JEL Categories: E 12, E 32, E 44 <b>cycles,</b> <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> financial fragility, stock-flow consistency...|$|R
40|$|<b>Long</b> <b>waves</b> {{of roughly}} fifty years in {{economic}} and social life have intrigued many scholars because they offer an alternative perspectiv e from which to view history and the present situation – an alternative to either static or linear projections of the future. Past empirica l studies of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> have agreed on the dating of <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> s historically {{but not on the}} scope of those waves in terms of variables encompassed, relevant time-periods, or causal mechanisms (see re-view in Goldstein, 1988 : ch. 3). I have sought to advance the empiri-cal evidence relevant to <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> by sorting and testing conflictin g hypotheses in the long-wave debate against about fifty historica l time-series (Goldstein, 1988). Based on the most salient lagged correlations among variables found in my empirical analysis, I ad-duced a set of causal dynamics among variables that could accoun t for the sequence of phenomena making up the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> – as best that sequence could be inferred from spotty empirical data. The adduced theory is a tentative one, with many remaining loose ends and anomalies. But it is better-grounded empirically than past long-wave theories. My theory of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> centres on the relationship between war and economic growth in the world system. Periods of severe war follow phases of robust economic growth and lead to phases o f stagnant growth. The empirical evidence that war plays a central rol e in <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> is quite strong. <b>Long</b> <b>waves</b> in prices can he explaine d largely by the inflationary effects of recurrent wars. Economic inno-vations, capital investment, and real wages also play reinforcing role s in generating <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> in my view – and all are also affected b...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an effort to dissect 19 th century economic growth in the Netherlands into two principal long run components: the domain of the trend and the domain of <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> Spectral and cross-spectral analysis is used to identify Kondratieffs in volume series. It appears that the long term pattern of development is composed of an inverse S-shaped trend and a Kondratieff wave that is superimposed upon it. Contrary to the British case, <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> in Dutch volume series appear to run contrary to the corresponding <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> in price series. This finding is at variance with the received view on <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> This typical result is explained by so-called 'Keynes effect' in combination with the characteristics of a small open economy that has to dance to the tune of the dominant British economy. <b>Long</b> <b>waves</b> Economic history Structural change Fourier analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} A-shape of the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> {{generated by}} a single short wave pulse is explained qualitatively by including the free waves which are generated along with the well known bowl-shaped forced wave. Free waves of complicated shapes are generally formed as the wave group encounters gradual depth changes. However, the main qualitative feature, which has so far lacked a simple explanation, namely the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> being M-shaped rather than a single bowl, can be explained through the simple free wave configuration which results from an abrupt onset of forcing at constant depth. M-shaped transient stages then occur between the initial flat surface and the final stage where free and forced waves have become completely separated from the forcing due to their different speeds. The M-shape is however also {{the shape of the}} gradually growing, resonant <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> due to a single short wave pulse, which travels with phase speed c and group velocity c(g) close to the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> speed root gh. The latter result is derived and compared with detailed laboratory experiments. It may explain the lack of observed H- 2 -dependence observed for some incident <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> as well as the qualitative shapes of the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> and of the cross correlation function between short <b>wave</b> envelope and <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> elevation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} mechanically-generated <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> on wind-generated waves of shorter scales are {{investigated}} in laboratory as {{function of the}} different wind and <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> parameters. The modulation of short waves both in energy and scales along the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> profiles is estimated respectively {{by means of the}} wavelet decomposition and the classical windowed Fourier transform methods, and the results are analysed {{within the framework of the}} recent coupled air-flow theories. The noticeable damping of the dominant waves in presence of a <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> is then quantified at the different stages of the wind wave field development. The relevant nonlinear mechanisms at the origin of these phenomena are discussed in the light of these observations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Long</b> <b>waves,</b> or Surf beat, in {{the coastal}} zone, have long been {{proposed}} {{to be important in}} influencing coastal morphology, but direct evidence is limited. This paper will present the results of novel experiments to investigate the influence of <b>wave</b> groups and <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> on coastal sediment transport. The data from two different experiments in small and large scale wave facilities will be compared, and both data sets show consistent results. The different influence of free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups is very evident, and they have opposite effects. The role of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups on beach response is discussed with an equilibrium state model. Considering the functional form for such a model suggests values for the effective relative fall velocity that produces the maximum rate of shoreward transport, or the maximum rate of beach accretion...|$|R
40|$|Wind wave {{development}} {{in the presence of}} a <b>long</b> mechanically-generated <b>wave</b> was investigated in the large IRPHE wind wave tank, for different wind speeds and <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> parameters. Wind and wave observations with and without <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> were made simultaneously at various fetches and compared. At short fetches, the wind wave field observed in presence of mechanical waves exhibits a broadened dominant spectral peak shifted towards low frequencies. At large fetches, the main effect of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> on wind wave fields consists in a noticeable damping of the dominant waves. The damping factor increases rapidly with <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> steepness akL at small akL but no longer varies at large akL. Moreover, this factor is strongly wind dependent, increasing first up to 6 m/s, then decreasing significantly before reaching a saturation value at high wind speeds. Consistently, the wind-generated wave fields observed in presence of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> are characterized by much lower equilibrium dominant wave steepness. Finally, the relevant mechanisms at the origin of these phenomena and their implications for ocean wave fields are discussed...|$|R
