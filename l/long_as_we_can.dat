500|$|With {{the entry}} of the United States into World War II in late 1941, Landis wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, inquiring as to the wartime status of {{baseball}}. The President responded urging Landis to keep baseball open, foreseeing that even those fully engaged in war work would benefit from inexpensive diversions such as attending baseball games. [...] Many major leaguers enlisted or were drafted; even so Landis repeatedly stated, [...] "We'll play as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> put nine men on the field." [...] Although many of the teams practiced at their normal spring training sites in 1942, beginning the following year {{they were required to}} train near their home cities or in the Northeast. [...] Landis was as virulently opposed to the Axis Powers as he had been towards the Kaiser, writing that peace would not be possible until [...] "about fifteen thousand little Hitler, Himmlers and Hirohitos" [...] were killed.|$|E

[...] Paul Meany also responded to a fan question via Twitter in January 2014 asking about the amount of music the band had written saying, [...] "I can tell [...] we've written more songs for this record than for the past 3 combined." ...|$|E
2500|$|The idea of handle {{trading is}} to create a {{cancelling}} pair of (k+1)- and (k+2)-handles so that a given k-handle cancels with the (k+1)-handle leaving behind the (k+2)-handle. To do this, consider the core of the k-handle which is an element in [...] This group is trivial since W is an h-cobordism. Thus, there is a disk [...] which we can fatten to a cancelling pair as desired, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> embed this disk into the boundary of W. This embedding exists if [...] Since we are assuming n is at least 5 this means that k is either 0 or 1. Finally, by considering the negative of the given Morse function, −f, we can turn the handle decomposition upside down and also remove the n- and (n+1)-handles as desired.|$|E

Although long vowels are only found in loan words, not all loan words contain <b>long</b> vowels, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> see in the first minimal pair. The word tin, ‘corrugated iron’ is an English loan without long vowel, which {{contrasts}} phonologically with the Indic loan word tīn, ‘three’, which does contain a long vowel.|$|R

60|$|It {{is evident}} that the {{evolutionary}} process is a hereditary one, or, to put it less drily, that human life is continuous and immortal. The Evolutionists took heredity for granted. So did everybody. The human mind has been soaked in heredity <b>as</b> <b>long</b> back <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> trace its thought. Hereditary peers, hereditary monarchs, hereditary castes and trades and classes were {{the best known of}} social institutions, and in some cases of public nuisances. Pedigree men counted pedigree dogs and pedigree horses among their most cherished possessions. Far from being unconscious of heredity, or sceptical, men were insanely credulous about it: they not only believed in the transmission of qualities and habits from generation to generation, but expected the son to begin mentally where the father left off.|$|R
6000|$|After {{a day of}} sight-seeing we returned, at sunset, to the Springs, {{with all}} of the pomp of railway magnates en tour, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were about to part at the railway station, the General in curt, off-hand way, asked, [...] "Why not join my camping party at Sierra Blanca? We're going down there for a week or two, and I shall be very glad to have you with us.

6000|$|... "Lovers {{and ladies}} never bore each other, {{because they never}} speak of {{anything}} but themselves." [...] Do husbands and wives often bore {{each other for the}} same reason? Who said: [...] "To know all is to forgive all"? It is rather like [...] "On pardonne tant que l'on aime"--"As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> love <b>we</b> <b>can</b> forgive," [...] a comfortable saying, and these are rare in Rochefoucauld. [...] "Women do not quite know what flirts they are" [...] is also, let us hope, not incorrect. The maxim that [...] "There is a love so excessive that it kills jealousy" [...] is only a corollary from [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> love, we forgive." [...] You remember the classical example, Manon Lescaut and the Chevalier des Grieux; not an honourable precedent.|$|R

This time our luck was not so good. The passage out was well enough, but homeward-bound we {{had a hard time}} of it. While in Havre, too, we had a narrow escape. Christmas night, a fire broke out in the cabin, and came near smothering us all, forward, before we knew {{anything}} about it. Our chief mate, whose name was Everdy,[16] saved the vessel by his caution and exertions; the captain not getting on board until the fire had come to a head. We kept everything closed until an engine was ready, then cut away the deck, and sent down the hose This expedient, with a free use of water, saved the ship. It is not known how the fire originated. A good deal of damage was done, and some property was lost.|$|R

40|$|Today {{we have a}} great {{technological}} development in many fields and this have made an impact on computer systems and their design. For my thesis I am interested to see a concrete example of how anorganization prepares and developtheir computer system. I will evaluate the requirement specification for the Svenska Kärnbränslehantering AB to see how it was created. I analyzed the process of creating new requirements for the new computer system GADD with autonomous analysis, the analysis is made by the tool EthXpert. The conclusion I can make from this thesis is autonomous analysis gave us a good understanding of how a computer system should be like, how decisions are made for designing them. Even do we analyze a part of a whole network of stakeholders we received useful answers. I think autonomous analysis works for design decisions <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> verify our answers we received. Our analysis is built on the knowledge from among other things the requirement specification andthe requirement specification is based and made of interviews from the stakeholders. Regarding the major difference I discovered between Design rationaleand autonomy analysis is where and when the argument for a design is presented and discovered. With Design rationalethe argument is already presented while in autonomy analysis the argument will be found in the analysis and therefore new solution is possible to be found. ...|$|R

Rather famously, one of his most financially prolific deeds for the State was during negotiations with the British Petroleum Company in 1925. Through a pure stroke of genius and foresight, Sir Sassoon demanded that Iraq’s oil revenue be remunerated in gold rather than sterling; at the time, this request seemed bizarre since sterling was backed by the gold standard. Nevertheless, his demand was reluctantly accepted. Later this concession benefited Iraq’s treasury during World War II, when the gold standard was abandoned and sterling plummeted. He thus secured countless additional millions of Iraqi dinars for the State. This is something that the Iraqi nation remembers with appreciation and admiration.|$|R
