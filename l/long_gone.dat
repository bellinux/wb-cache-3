The two largest milling companies, General Mills and the Pillsbury Company, now merged under the General Mills name, still remain {{prominent in the}} Twin Cities area. The city has rediscovered the riverfront, which now hosts parkland, the Mill City Museum, and the Guthrie Theater.|$|E
5|$|Burial 195 {{was flooded}} with mud in antiquity. This flood had covered wooden objects that had {{completely}} rotted away {{by the time the}} tomb was excavated, leaving hollows in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K'awiil, the wooden originals <b>long</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the street}} was mainly {{inhabited}} by merchants and craftspeople. Although they are <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> due to the sweeping demographic changes in Kiev during times of the late Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, the street is once again thriving thanks to its unique topology, architecture, rich history and also many gift shops and small art galleries showcasing various paintings and sculptures by Ukrainian artists. The descent {{is one of the}} favorite spots for tourists. It is also notable for the many festivals it holds, including various art festivals and the Kiev Day celebrations on the last weekend of May.|$|E

She was nearing forty now, her friends were <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. Scott was increasingly embittered by his own failures and his old friend Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} blacksmith shop on {{the site}} is <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> however, in 1962 an archaeological team made of students from the University of Illinois approached the Deere Company about excavating {{the site where the}} shop once stood.

The site is surrounded by museum exhibits which include artifacts, news clippings, and photographs.|$|E
5|$|High Street {{contains}} two Grade II listed public houses: Ye Olde George Inne, once a coach house, and the Ship Inn {{which has the}} oldest licence in Christchurch. A known haunt of smugglers, the Ship Inn's history {{can be traced back}} to 1688. At the end of High Street is Church Street which contains Church Hatch, a Grade II* listed Georgian residence. Once the home of Sir Owen Tudor Burne, it was saved from demolition in 1929 by public appeal. Ye Olde Eight Bells, a Grade II listed gift shop in Church Street, was once another alehouse frequented by smugglers and central to a number of local legends. Close by in Castle Street is the Perfumery, a 14th-century thatched property often referred to as the old courthouse; although some local historians maintain that this was next door and <b>long</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the foundry, Joule is able {{to analyze}} the {{prismatic}} core. She can make out voices coming from the core – including her father's – thus deducing {{that it is a}} transmission of sorts. Heading to Eden Tower to decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai there. Once reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had manipulated the other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden Tower to activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, are <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a hologram of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In the end, it becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E
5|$|Looking for a {{near term}} solution, McNamara once again turned to ARPA, asking it to {{consider}} the Zeus system in depth. The agency returned a new report in April 1962 that contained four basic concepts. First was the Zeus system in its current form, outlining what sort of role it might play in various war fighting scenarios. Zeus could, for instance, be used to protect SAC bases, thereby requiring the Soviets to expend more of their ICBMs to attack the bases. This would presumably mean less damage to other targets. Another considered the addition of new passive electronically scanned array radars and computers to the Zeus, which would allow it to attack dozens of targets at once over a wider area. Finally, in its last concept, ARPA replaced Zeus with a new very high speed, short range missile designed to intercept the warhead at altitudes as low as , by which time any decoys or fireballs would be <b>long</b> <b>gone.</b> This last concept became Nike-X, an ad hoc name suggested by Jack Ruina while describing the ARPA report to PSAC.|$|E
