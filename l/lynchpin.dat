25|$|Around 1670, {{two events}} caused {{the growth of}} VOC trade to stall. In the first place, the highly {{profitable}} trade with Japan started to decline. The loss of the outpost on Formosa to Koxinga in the 1662 Siege of Fort Zeelandia and related internal turmoil in China (where the Ming dynasty was being replaced with the Qing dynasty) brought {{an end to the}} silk trade after 1666. Though the VOC substituted Bengali for Chinese silk other forces affected the supply of Japanese silver and gold. The shogunate enacted a number of measures to limit the export of these precious metals, in the process limiting VOC opportunities for trade, and severely worsening the terms of trade. Therefore, Japan ceased to function as the <b>lynchpin</b> of the intra-Asiatic trade of the VOC by 1685.|$|E

25|$|The President of the European Council is {{appointed}} for a {{two and a}} {{half year}} term in a qualified majority vote of the European Council. A president can be reappointed once, and be removed by the same voting procedure. Unlike the post of President of the European Commission, the appointment of the President of the European Council does not have to reflect the composition of the European Parliament. The president's work involves coordinating the work of the European Council, hosting its meetings and reporting its activities to the European Parliament after each meeting. This makes the president the <b>lynchpin</b> of negotiations to find agreement at European Council meetings, which has become a more onerous task with successive enlargement of the EU to 28 Member States. The president also chairs informal summits of the 19 Member States which use the euro as their currency. Additionally, the president provides external representation to the Union on foreign policy and security matters when such representation is required at the level of heads of state or government (bilateral summits and G8/G20).|$|E
25|$|The Japanese had {{captured}} {{the island of}} New Britain in February 1942 after overwhelming the small Australian garrison stationed around Rabaul. The Japanese subsequently built up a large garrison on the island, consisting of around 93,000 men from General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army. This became a <b>lynchpin</b> in the defensive barrier that they established following the failure of attempts to capture Port Moresby in late 1942. In December 1943, as part of Operation Cartwheel, US forces landed around Cape Gloucester and Arawe to capture vital airfields and to provide the Allies with access through the sea passage between the straits separating New Britain from New Guinea, where during late 1943 the Allies had fought to secure the Huon Peninsula. This formed part of the overarching Allied strategy of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul, {{as it had been}} decided that rather than destroying the base with a costly direct assault, a more prudent strategy would be to surround the base and therefore nullify it as a threat.|$|E
25|$|Grenache {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{varieties}} to be introduced to Australia in the 18th century and eventually became the country's most widely planted red wine grape variety until it was surpassed by Shiraz in the mid 1960s. Early Australian Grenache was a main component in the sweet fortified wines that was the <b>lynchpin</b> of the early Australian wine industry. In the 19th century, California wine growers prized the vine's ability to produce high yields and withstand heat and drought conditions. The grape was extensively planted throughout the hot San Joaquin Valley where it was mainly used as a blending component for pale, sweet jug wines. In the late 20th century, the Rhone Rangers movement brought attention to the production of premium varietal Grenache and Rhone style blends modeled after the Grenache dominate wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. In the early 20th century, Grenache {{was one of the}} first Vitis vinifera grapes to be successfully vinified during the early development of the Washington wine industry with a 1966 Yakima Valley rosé earning mention in wine historian Leon Adams treatise The Wines of America.|$|E
40|$|As {{a network}} of {{affiliate}} groups, Al Qaeda's more diffuse structure, {{since the end of}} 2001, is described as one of its greatest strengths. Certainly, after losing its territorial base in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda as “network” has gained in tactical agility and global reach. This article argues, however, that Osama bin Laden's ceding of command-and-control to autonomous Al Qaeda “franchises” represents an important source of weakness in the battle for hearts and minds in the Muslim world. As Al Qaeda's global jihad is increasingly imported by its affiliates into local and sectarian conflicts, the death toll is largely Muslim and civilian. The targeting of Muslim civilians is exceptionally difficult to justify, morally, theologically, and by bin Laden's own standards of legitimate jihad. This article will show how the killing of Muslim civilians undermines the crucial <b>lynchpins</b> of bin Laden's ideology and alienates the popular support that “Al Qaeda central” see as indispensable to Al Qaeda's success...|$|R
40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} unicellular pathogen Plasmodium falciparum tightly regulates gene expression, both during {{development and}} in adaptation to dynamic host environments. This regulation {{is evident in}} the mutually exclusive expression of members of clonally variant virulence multigene families. While epigenetic regulators have been selectively identified at active or repressed virulence genes, their specific recruitment remains a mystery. In recent years, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as <b>lynchpins</b> of eukaryotic gene regulation; by binding to epigenetic regulators, they provide target specificity to otherwise non-specific enzyme complexes. Not surprisingly, there is great interest in understanding the role of ncRNA in P. falciparum, in particular, their contribution to the mutually exclusive expression of virulence genes. The current repertoire of P. falciparum ncRNAs includes, but is not limited to, subtelomeric ncRNAs, virulence gene-associated ncRNAs and natural antisense RNA transcripts. Continued improvement in high-throughput sequencing methods is sure to expand this repertoire. Here, we summarize recent advances in P. falciparum ncRNA biology, with an emphasis on ncRNA-mediated epigenetic modes of gene regulation...|$|R

25|$|The Pacers {{started the}} 2002–03 season well, winning 14 {{of their first}} 16 games, and had {{the best record in}} the East by the time the All-Star break arrived. The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most {{versatile}} players. Defensive <b>lynchpin</b> Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, who could only finish the season 48–34. On his part, O'Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10. He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season's end. With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row. Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems. Brad Miller's father-in-law and Tinsley's mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O'Neal's stepfather attempted suicide. When the season ended, O'Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent. The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA Champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired. Much as it was tempting for O'Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers. Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O'Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings. Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again.|$|E

40|$|Revenue {{management}} (RM) uses {{differential pricing}} and other techniques to manage customer {{demand for a}} company's products and services. It judiciously trades off yield and spoilage, and brings rational approaches to pricing {{for goods and services}} with a limited shelf life. Because many types of businesses find that growing revenue has a disproportionate impact on operating profits, firms that know and manage their customer base often achieve better bottom-line results by growing revenue rather than by cost-cutting. Initially developed as a marketing tool for pricing airline tickets, today's numerous RM applications can benefit from accounting tools that help assess whether applications will enhance operating profit and monitor their success in doing so. Knowledge of a firm's cost structure, operating leverage in particular, and when to treat RM adjustments as special orders, are the principal accounting <b>lynchpins.</b> Opportunity cost variances and insights from the theory of constraints contribute to effective revenue management/profit enhancement programs. Use of proper accounting information and analytic techniques can help a tolerated union of necessity between RM programs and firm strategy become a desirable marriage of mutual choice. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the Eurozone crisis, European Union leaders have undertaken a number of dramatic reforms, including {{the imposition of a}} new regime for fiscal governance of Eurozone Member States. The 2012 Fiscal Compact Treaty, one of the <b>lynchpins</b> of this package of reforms, requires states to incorporate judicially enforceable balanced-budget rules into national law. This article explores this effort to judicialize austerity in the European Union, focusing on two interrelated sets of questions. First, why did EU leaders turn to the courts and ask them to become the stewards of fiscal discipline, and second, should we expect the effort to judicialize fiscal discipline through the Fiscal Compact to work? I argue that after the failure of the Maastricht Eurozone governance regime, Member State governments concluded that the enforcement of fiscal rules must be shielded from political interference and entrenched at the national level, where national courts could assure that EU rules were respected by reluctant governments. Nevertheless, I conclude that these efforts will fail because they are based on a misunderstanding of when and how fiscal rules are actually enforced. The vague character of the balanced budget rules adopted in the Fiscal Compact Treaty along with other background conditions {{in the structure of the}} Eurozone mean that the rules are unlikely to be enforced...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: As renewed {{interest}} in {{the operations of the}} IMF, World Bank, and the GATT/WTO have been stimulated, especially during the past decade, the system of global economic governance has captured the attention of both rich and poor countries. The justice of the global economic order is increasingly being questioned, mainly due to perceived inequities in its systemic operation. Viewed as <b>lynchpins</b> of that order, the IMF, World Bank, and GATT/WTO have lost a disturbing degree of credibility by not practicing what they preach: they expect good governance and transparency from their members while shunning the same advice for themselves. It is developing countries, in particular, that have striven through IMF conditions, World Bank strictures, and GATT/WTO agreements. With concerns among the developing countries that globalisation will continue to lead to an unequal sharing of global costs and benefits, their confidence in these institutions – as executors of fair governance – is at a distressingly low level. In their own governance, critics argue, these central international institutions have violated democratic precepts. These, among other criticism, paint a relatively dark picture of how a growing majority perceive these institutions. Even developed nations are also concerned about the inherent global instability that may arise from markets that function freely within fragile and/or inappropriate institutional frameworks – as manifested by the financial crises during the past two decades. The paper concerns an investigation into the criticism leveled against the IMF, World Bank and the GATT/WTO as central pillars in global economic governance...|$|R
