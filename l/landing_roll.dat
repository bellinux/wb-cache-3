5|$|Since the crash, {{there have}} been several other {{accidents}} involving reverse thrust. A Douglas DC-8 operating United Airlines Flight 859 crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the <b>landing</b> <b>roll.</b> The left engines remained in forward thrust, while the right engines went into reverse, causing the aircraft to veer rapidly to the right and collide with airport construction vehicles, killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The KCAB's {{investigation}} {{determined that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} captain's misuse of the thrust reverser during the <b>landing</b> <b>roll</b> and his confusion over crosswind conditions.|$|E
25|$|The pilot not flying did {{not make}} the {{standard}} callouts concerning the spoilers and thrust reversers during the <b>landing</b> <b>roll.</b> This contributed to the delay in the pilot flying selecting the thrust reversers.|$|E

25|$|On January 21, 1998 a Continental Express ATR-42, N15827, had an {{emergency}} during roll on landing. During the <b>landing</b> <b>roll,</b> a fire {{erupted in the}} right engine. The airplane was stopped on the runway, the engines were shut down and the occupants evacuated. The fire handles for both engines were pulled and both fire bottles on the right engine discharged. However, {{the fire in the}} right engine continued to burn. The airport fire services attended shortly afterward and extinguished the fire.|$|E

50|$|Reverse thrust mode is {{used only}} for a {{fraction}} of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of design, weight, maintenance, performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during <b>landing</b> <b>rolls,</b> and aids in rejected take-offs and ground operations on contaminated runways where normal braking effectiveness is diminished. Airlines consider thrust reverser systems a vital part of reaching a maximum level of aircraft operating safety.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} 13 YP-43s was {{delivered}} in September 1940, {{the last in}} April 1941. Early testing revealed a strong tendency to yaw during takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>rolls,</b> fixed by redesigning the tailwheel. Although the aircraft exceeded the initial USAAC performance requirements, by 1941 it was clearly obsolete, lacking maneuverability, armor, or self-sealing fuel tanks. The USAAC felt the basic P-35/P-43 design had exhausted its reserves for further improvement in performance and shifted its interest to the promising P-47.|$|R
50|$|The Aero A.42 was a Czechoslovakian bomber {{aircraft}} of 1929 {{that was}} only ever produced in prototype form. For its day, it was an advanced design, with a sleek monoplane configuration. However, the Czech Air Force was not satisfied with it {{for a number of}} reasons. In particular, the aircraft's take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>rolls</b> were felt to be excessively long, and crew complained about the cramped cabin. The air force suggested a set of modifications to Aero, including replacing the wooden wing with a metal one, but Aero discontinued development.|$|R

25|$|The G.II {{prototype}} first flew in March 1916, {{and testing}} revealed several shortcomings. The most significant {{problem was that}} the aircraft was not capable of carrying the bombload that was specified by the Idflieg. This was solved by a redesign of the wing cellule to extend its span. At the same time, it was changed from a two-bay to a three-bay structure. The second issue was that the undercarriage arrangement made for very long and uncontrollable <b>landing</b> <b>rolls.</b> This was solved by changing it to a conventional tailskid configuration. Other revisions included horn-balanced ailerons and a triangular vertical fin. In this configuration, production commenced in April 1916.|$|R

Across the water, the <b>land</b> <b>rolled</b> away in bright hillsides, so warm and undulating that they seemed almost to palpitate in the sun. On we swept, past bluff and grove, wooded glen and valley, and dark ravines lighted up far inland with wild falls of water.
