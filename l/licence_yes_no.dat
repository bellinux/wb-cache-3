For purposes of univariate and multivariate analysis, a few variables are modified/ merged into lesser categories for better understanding of results. Wealth index (poorest, poorer, middle, richer and richest) is recoded as poorest and poor, middle and richer and richest. Mother’s and father’s education is coded as no formal education and primary, secondary and greater than higher secondary. Father’s occupation (non-working, service and agriculture) is taken as part of the definition of the socio-economic status of the family. Size of child at birth (very large, larger than average, smaller than average and very small) are recoded as larger than average, average and smaller than average. All these variables are taken as independent variables and child’s status (live or dead) as dependent variable in the study.

In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions based on depletion (<b>yes,</b> <b>no)</b> and security priming (<b>yes,</b> <b>no)</b> manipulations, and their behaviors were videotaped while they interacted with their romantic partner who was exploring personal goals. In both studies, independent judges rated participants’ responsiveness to their partner’s needs during the videotaped interaction.

40|$|We analyze what {{functions}} as a YES response and a NO response for different yes/no questions. This problem is surprisingly complex: respondents do not always produce overt <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> lexical items {{in response to a}} yes/no question. In addition, when respondents don't include a clear <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> word, they may mean to communicate a clear <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b> meaning, or something else. We find that the classification of yes/no questions described in (Carletta et al., 1995) for the Edinburgh map task corpus correlates well with whether a response will be a bare <b>yes</b> or <b>no,</b> a <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> plus additional speech, or just speech without an overt <b>yes</b> or <b>no.</b> Correlation with responses described simply as as "direct" or "indirect" is less good. We also find that, under the three-way categorization, the strength of a question's expectation for a YES response predicts the form of the response. 1 Introduction In order to model dialogue, it is necessary to understand what kinds of utterances are likely to occur in [...] ...|$|R
