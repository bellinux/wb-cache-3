5|$|As San Miguel {{lost her}} {{composure}} in giving her answer, the audience reacted with jeers and applause, {{as well as}} <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the panel of judges and other contestants. Midway through her answer, pageant host Paolo Bediones encouraged her off-microphone to continue in Tagalog, though she proceeded with her response in English.|$|E
5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|Ken Levine {{remarked that}} the whole {{audience}} laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter {{at the end of}} the episode. It was reshot but the audience still laughed. Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the office scene, so it is not heard in the final cut. Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E

5|$|Tokyopop's {{localized}} volumes {{appeared on}} ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The Rozen Maiden manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always {{being able to}} evoke excitement or <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> its readers but was critical about Rozen Maidens lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while Rozen Maiden was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology and emotion was something American comics should follow to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual esthetics of the images and characters; and a broadness that extends towards teens and adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying {{dark side of the}} plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and the abrupt ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote they were surprised by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.|$|E

25|$|George Devine's 1953 Shakespeare Memorial Theatre production, {{starring}} Yvonne Mitchell and Marius Goring. This {{production is}} regarded {{by some as}} {{the first to use}} the Sly character as more than a vehicle to elicit <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> his reactions to the taming.|$|E
25|$|At {{the close}} of one show, the {{chairman}} asked the teams to read the cuttings that they had brought along with them, {{in the manner of}} fellow Radio 4 show The News Quiz. The teams proceeded to read their cuttings, but only to themselves, followed some interested murmurs from the teams and much <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the audience.|$|E
25|$|In {{the full}} {{recording}} broadcast on BBC 7, the cast are then heard saying their thank-you's to the audience, with Milligan coming close to abusing them, again something {{for which he}} was known in the years after The Goon Show. There follow some minutes of silence after this, then a dirty limerick can be heard, recited by Sellers and accompanied by <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> Secombe and Milligan.|$|E

25|$|Many drum dances are {{competitive}} in nature, featuring two song cousins who humorously sing and dance, while {{pointing out the}} flaws in the other. This is generally a light-hearted, convivial event, but is also sometimes used to settle serious duels between warring families or individuals; the jokes are prepared {{ahead of time and}} the person who evokes the most <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the audience is considered the victor.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} was largely met with disbelief and <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the passengers {{and some of}} the flight attendants, as they thought it was an exercise. Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E
25|$|Roy's Top Ten – Roy Bellamy {{performs}} {{this list}} {{on a regular}} basis, and the humor of the segment is multi-faceted. Part of it is derived from Bellamy's sometime mangling of the delivery, part is the often uproarious <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> Stugotz, but the underlying, veiled theme is that nine of the ten {{on the list is}} Afrocentric in nature, and the number one answer is always Caucasian in nature. Written by Roy and producer Mike Ryan, and previously former producer and co-host Marc Hochman, the list is always subject to being misconstrued by a casual listener as racist, but the show's (and Le Batard's) racial color-blindness allows for a lot of latitude in this regard.|$|E

500|$|For {{a reason}} {{which was not}} specified, the sound of Lois's {{footsteps}} when going down the basement stairs during her dream of killing Stewie, had to be overcome by Stewie talking more often. This line of Stewie making general conversation in the same scene, was altered several times {{due to lack of}} <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the audience. MacFarlane comments that the scene of Peter standing up to his teacher who was giving the class a test, is a reference to [...] "80's TV bullshit".|$|E
500|$|According to Furtado, {{instead of}} [...] "pristine stuff", the album {{features}} [...] "really raw" [...] {{elements such as}} distorted bass lines, <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> studio outtakes and general [...] "room for error". Furtado has said Loose is not {{as much about the}} lyrics, which are not included in the liner notes, as it is about [...] "indulging in pleasures—whether it's dancing or lovemaking." [...] According to her, she wasn't trying to be sexy with the album—"I think I just am sexy now", she said.|$|E
500|$|Wogan {{introduced}} the 1991 segment with [...] "The {{world as we}} know it is about to end". Amid <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the audience, Icke prevaricated when asked if {{he was the son of}} God, replying that Jesus would have been laughed at too, and repeating that Britain would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes. Without these, [...] "the Earth will cease to exist". When Icke said laughter was the best way to remove negativity, Wogan replied of the audience: [...] "But they're laughing at you. They're not laughing with you." ...|$|E

500|$|The Earl of Essex accused Lopez {{of conspiring}} to poison the Queen in January 1594. Insisting on his innocence, {{the doctor was}} convicted of high treason in February and hanged, drawn and {{quartered}} in June, reportedly after averring from the scaffold that [...] "he loved the Queen {{as well as he}} loved Jesus Christ"—a statement that, from a man of Jewish background, prompted mocking <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the crowd. Elizabeth's three-month delay signing Lopez's death warrant is sometimes interpreted as evidence that she doubted the case against him. In any case she returned almost all of his estate to his widow and children.|$|E
500|$|At the October 30, 2007 {{debate in}} Philadelphia and the November 15 debate in Las Vegas, Biden was noted for some one-liners that drew some <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the audience. First, when {{speaking}} about Rudy Giuliani at the Philadelphia debate, Biden stated, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated, [...] "I know there's more to say, Campbell. I appreciate {{you asking me}} the question and I'm sorry I answered it. I know you're not supposed to answer questions, based on what I've heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Lopez {{arrived on}} the red carpet of the 42nd Grammy Awards in the company of then-boyfriend Sean Combs; he was dressed in a gray suit. Although the fashion house Versace had only loaned the dress, it {{subsequently}} decided to give it away as a token of gratitude for the enormous publicity generated. The singer immediately monopolized the attention and curiosity of the public and photographers at the event. Actor David Duchovny appeared on stage with Lopez to present the award for Best R Album and declared to the audience, [...] "This {{is the first time in}} five or six years that I'm sure that nobody is looking at me", eliciting <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> the audience and Lopez.|$|E
