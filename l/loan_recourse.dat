50|$|The Court {{specifically}} {{noted that}} the fair {{market value of the}} property at the time of disposition is irrelevant. Further, the nature of the <b>loan</b> (<b>recourse</b> or non-recourse) is also insignificant for purposes of determining basis. The Court defended its position by observing that the stated requirements force a taxpayer to account for the proceeds of obligations he has received tax-free and included in the property’s basis. A finding otherwise would allow a mortgagee to recognize a tax loss without suffering a corresponding economic loss.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the text of}} the 1992 Presidential Address for the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. A {{comparative}} evaluation of mortgage default research finds that both the residential and commercial markets evolved from informal underwriting rules, to formalized (though unvalidated) ratios and rules of thumb, to early risk ratings based upon empirical evidence, to gener-alizable econometric models of default, to option-based pricing models. The commercial market lagged the residential market by about 10 to 20 years at first but is now only about five years behind. The survey finds that research and progress in understanding mortgage credit risk has been precipitated by a public policy need or mandate, data availability, and adequate technology. The absence of any one of these factors has hindered progress in the past. Finally, six emerging issues in default research are identified and discussed: (1) the degree of "ruth-lessness" with which default is exercised, (2) <b>loan</b> <b>recourse,</b> (3) the magnitude and timing of revenues and losses associated with default, (4) loan modification, (5) default in a portfolio context, and (6) leasehold default. Progress in these areas will enhance the efficiency of both the residential and commercial markets. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|E

50|$|Recourse debt is a {{debt that}} {{is backed by}} {{collateral}} from the borrower. Also known as a <b>recourse</b> <b>loan,</b> this type of debt allows the lender to collect from the debtor and the debtor's assets {{in the case of}} default as opposed to foreclosing on a particular property or asset as with a home loan or auto <b>loan.</b> Nonpayment of <b>recourse</b> debt allows the lender the right to collect assets or pursue legal action. While mortgages in the US are typically nonrecourse debt, a foreclosure or bankruptcy can trigger the <b>loan</b> to become <b>recourse</b> debt {{at the request of the}} lending institution.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{mortgages}} in the United States are non-recourse loans, while mortgages {{in countries}} such as Canada are generally <b>recourse</b> <b>loans.</b> [...] "Nonrecourse debt or a nonrecourse loan is a secured loan (debt) that is secured by a pledge of collateral, typically real property, but for which the borrower is not personally liable." [...] A HELOC may be a <b>recourse</b> <b>loan</b> for which the borrower is personally liable. This distinction becomes important in foreclosure since the borrower may remain personally liable for a recourse debt on a foreclosed property.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions, varying by American state, refinanced {{mortgage}} <b>loans</b> {{are considered}} <b>recourse</b> debt, {{meaning that the}} borrower is liable in case of default, while un-refinanced mortgages are non-recourse debt.|$|R

Final date to obtain a loan was May 7, 1999. The producer-owned honey was required to be merchantable and stored in acceptable containers. Loans carried an administrative fee of $0.009 per pound, bore an interest rate 1% higher than the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrowing interest rate, and matured not later than nine months following disbursement.|$|R
5000|$|The Mohair <b>Recourse</b> <b>Loan</b> Program is {{a program}} {{authorized}} by the emergency provisions of the FY1999 USDA appropriations act (P.L. 105-277) that made interest-free <b>recourse</b> <b>loans</b> of $2.00 per pound on mohair produced prior to October 1, 1998. Final date to obtain a loan was September 30, 1999. The producer-owned mohair used as loan security had to be stored in approved bonded warehouses. Loans matured not later than 1 year following disbursement. Under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1201-1205), mohair was designated a “loan commodity” and made eligible for marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments (LDPs).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: How should loan {{contracts}} to finance projects {{in countries with}} high political risk be designed? We argue that limited <b>recourse</b> <b>loans</b> and the participation of development banks in the loan syndicate help to mitigate political risk. We test these arguments {{in a sample of}} 4, 978 loans made to borrowers in 64 coun-tries. Our results show that if investment related political risk is higher, the use of limited <b>recourse</b> <b>loans</b> and the participation of development banks are more likely. For general political risk the participation of development banks is most useful. We demonstrate that the terms of the loan contract depend on political risk as well as the legal and institutional environment...|$|R

40|$|PublisherTokyoThis paper {{draws on}} five waves of Japanese {{household}} longitudinal data (Keio Household Panel Survey, KHPS) and estimates a conditional fixed effects logit model {{to investigate the}} effects of housing equity constraints and income shocks on owner-to-owner residential moves in Japan. By looking at contemporaneous extended Loan-to-Value (ELTV) and extended Debt-to-Income (EDTI) ratios under the <b>recourse</b> <b>loan</b> system, we examine whether housing equity constraints and negative income shocks deter owner-to-owner residential mobility and whether government policy aimed at addressing equity constraints under the <b>recourse</b> <b>loan</b> system {{has an impact on}} residential moves. The specific policy we examine is the implementation of the income tax deduction system that permits the carrying over of capital losses for owner-occupied households. These tax policies were devised to cope with the severe equity constraints that followed the bursting of Japan's asset Bubble in the early 1990 s. Simulation analysis of relaxing tax deduction conditions shows that changing the required years the household must live in the residence to qualify for the tax break before selling from 5 years to 1 year greatly enhances the mobility for both positive and negative equity households. Finally, simulation analysis of switching from the present <b>recourse</b> <b>loan</b> system to the non-recourse loan system shows an increase in the owners' mobility to another owner-occupied housing, especially for positive equity households...|$|R
50|$|SMSF {{property}} {{investment has}} gained considerable momentum since the amendment of borrowing provisions {{to allow for}} the purchase of residential real estate.

50|$|The {{incentives}} for {{the parties are}} at an intermediate position between those of a full <b>recourse</b> secured <b>loan</b> and a totally unsecured loan. While the borrower is in first loss position, the lender also assumes significant risk, so the lender must underwrite the loan with much more care than in a full <b>recourse</b> <b>loan.</b> This typically requires that the lender have significant domain expertise and financial modeling expertise.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions {{mainly in}} the United States, {{mortgage}} loans are non-recourse loans: if the funds recouped from sale of the mortgaged property are insufficient to cover the outstanding debt, the lender may not have recourse to the borrower after foreclosure. In other jurisdictions, the borrower remains responsible for any remaining debt, through a deficiency judgment. In some jurisdictions, first mortgages are non-recourse loans, but second and subsequent ones are <b>recourse</b> <b>loans.</b>|$|R
50|$|High {{moisture}} {{feed grains}} — In United States agricultural policy, corn and grain sorghum must have moisture content below Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) standards {{in order to}} qualify for marketing assistance loans. Higher moisture feed grains do not serve as suitable collateral for nonrecourse loans. However, the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) first made, and the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1209) continued, the policy of making <b>recourse</b> <b>loans</b> available to producers of high moisture corn and grain sorghum.|$|R
5000|$|A {{deficiency}} {{judgment is}} an unsecured money judgment against a borrower whose mortgage foreclosure sale {{did not produce}} sufficient funds to pay the underlying promissory note, or loan, in full. [...] The availability of a deficiency judgment depends on whether the lender has a <b>recourse</b> or nonrecourse <b>loan,</b> which is largely a matter of state law. In some jurisdictions, the original loan(s) obtained to purchase property is/are non-recourse, but subsequent refinancing of a first mortgage and/or acquisition of a 2nd (3rd, etc.) are <b>recourse</b> <b>loans.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{financial}} institution involved in commercial lending makes a short-term loan (for example, 90 days) to a borrower under a long-term credit commitment (for example, 5 years). The {{financial institution}} transfers the short-term <b>loan,</b> without <b>recourse,</b> to a third-party purchaser {{for the remaining}} term of the loan. The risk of loss relating to the short-term loan is legally transferred to the purchaser, and the financial institution has no contractual obligation to repurchase the shortterm loan. Under the long-term credit commitment, the financial institution may, at the maturity of the short-term loan, relend to the borrower. However, the financial institution may refuse to relend to the borrower based on a current credit evaluation or if any covenant under the long-term commitment is not satisfied. The issue is whether {{the transfer of the}} short-term loan should be accounted for as a sale or as a financing. Copyright © 2010, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistributio...|$|R
50|$|Honey program — In the United States, non-recourse {{marketing}} loans {{had long}} been available to support honey prices until FY1994, when the funding was suspended by provisions in annual appropriations legislation. The 1990 farm bill (P.L. 101-624) had set honey loan rates at $0.538 per pound and permitted deficiency payments. The 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) repealed the statutory authority for the honey program. A Honey <b>Recourse</b> <b>Loan</b> Program was made available for the 1998 crop only through broader emergency spending authority in the FY1999 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 105-277). The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1201) made honey eligible for marketing assistance loans (and loan deficiency payments, LDPs) from 2002 through 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{creditor}} forecloses {{on the property}} and that the $20,000 excess of the debt over the property's fair market value ($100,000 less $80,000) is contractually discharged (for didactic symmetry with the nonrecourse example, let's assume, contrary to the commercial point of a <b>recourse</b> <b>loan,</b> that the debt is outright forgiven by the creditor, with no actual payment), the taxpayer would realize the $20,000 amount as income from the discharge of indebtedness. That $20,000 of forgiveness would be taxable to the taxpayer as ordinary income even though the taxpayer received no cash {{at the time of}} the discharge.

40|$|Project finance is a {{financing}} arrangement for projects, {{and it is}} characterised by the creation of a legally independent project company financed with non- or limited <b>recourse</b> <b>loans.</b> It is observed that the popularity of project finance is increasing in the recent decades, despite of the impact of Asian financial crisis. Especially in emerging markets, project finance is very common among the public-private partnership projects. It is possible that project finance yields some benefits in project management that other forms of funding are not able to provide. This research aims to explore the impacts of project finance on the risk management of projects, as well as the mechanisms of the effects of various factors on project risk management. The research starts with a quantitative analysis which consists of project data from 32 projects in recent years. The regression analysis on these quantitative data reveals that factors such as the separation of legal entity and existence of third-party guarantees can effectively reduce the borrowing rates of the projects. The borrowing rates, expressed in terms of credit spreads over LIBOR, are regarded as a proxy for the overall risk level of the projects. The qualitative section which involves five structured interviews further explores the relationships of the attributes of project finance on project risk management. The interviewees largely agrees on the effects of the separation of legal entity, non- or limited <b>recourse</b> <b>loans,</b> and the existence of third-party guarantees in managing political and country risks, business risks, and principal-agency risks. The involvement of a larger number of stakeholders in the projects enable the project to enhance its risk management ability by gaining external expertise and knowledge, influences on government policies, and more importantly, closer supervisions on project activities. Apart from revealing the important features of project finance, and the potential benefits it may yield on project risk management, the effectiveness of these features are also discussed. The study also examines the relationships between these features and the common risk factors which may affect all projects. Some recommendations to enhance the benefits of project finance and reduce the associated transaction costs are made based on this study...|$|R
40|$|For the {{new round}} of WTO {{multilateral}} trade liberalisation negotiations to be successful, the world {{will need to be}} more enthusiastic and flexible about opening markets. Partisans will need to submerge their self-interests, and the U. S. will need to take the initiative for more open markets. This paper makes the case that only modest changes in the U. S. domestic grain, oilseed, and cotton programmes are needed for compatibility with global free trade. The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 and related policy changes in the 1990 s brought fundamental reforms compatible with freer domestic and foreign markets. Chief among these were a shift from coupled deficiency payments to decoupled direct payments, an end to supply management, and less engagement of government in commodity stock accumulation and export subsidies. Converting commodity price support to <b>recourse</b> <b>loans</b> while ending all but administrative cost subsidies to crop insurance would go far to liberalise grain, oilseed, and cotton policies. Unilateral termination of commodity programmes including direct payments totalling 42 percent of net cash farm income in year 2000 would appear to be traumatic to producers. However, reduction of direct payments could be offset (for farm income) by rising farm commodity prices and receipts resulting from (1) less farm output attending lower loan rates and crop insurance subsidies, and (2) world farm commodity price-enhancement from freer global trade. ...|$|R
