40|$|The {{review of}} final {{decisions}} {{is regarded as}} an unusual means of appeal aimed at countering a final decision that is considered adjudicated (res judicata). This means of appeal has been provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights, the Constitution of Albania, and the national laws of the Albanian state. Thus, at first sight, the review {{seems to be in}} contravention of Article 4 and 34 of the Constitution, the principle of legal certainty. But, in essence, this extraordinary means of appeal attempts to establish effective justice by overturning a wrong decision, despite the fact that this decision has been executed, suspended or terminated. To combat dangerous criminal activities Albania has adopted the Anti-mafia Law, which provides the confiscation of proceeds that are obtained from some of the most dangerous criminal activities such as organized crime, terrorist acts, trafficking, corruption and laundering of crime proceeds. This kind of civil confiscation constituted a novelty in the procedural law and it was imposed when the person was not able to prove the <b>lawful</b> <b>origin</b> of these proceeds obtained from criminal activities. But can these confiscation decisions about the final transfer of property to the state be reviewed? If so, which law shall be applied, the civil or criminal one? This and other answers will be provided in this paper...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Lynk {{says that}} article 2 of the Charter {{embodied}} a prevailing legal principle {{that there could}} be [...] "no title by conquest". He says that principle had been expressed through numerous international conferences, doctrines and treaties since the late 19th Century. Lynk cites the examples of the First International Conference of American States in 1890; the United States Stimson Doctrine of 1932; the 1932 League of Nations resolution on Japanese aggression in China; the Buenos Aires Declaration of 1936; and the Atlantic Charter of 1941. Surya Sharma says that a war in self-defense cannot result in acquisition of title by conquest. He says that even if a war is <b>lawful</b> in <b>origin</b> it cannot exceed the limits of legitimate self-defense.|$|R
