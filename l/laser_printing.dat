25|$|Founded in 1970 as a {{division}} of Xerox Corporation, PARC has been in large part responsible for such developments as <b>laser</b> <b>printing,</b> Ethernet, the modern personal computer, graphical user interface (GUI) and desktop paradigm, object-oriented programming, ubiquitous computing, amorphous silicon (a-Si) applications, and advancing very-large-scale integration (VLSI) for semiconductors.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some truth that Xerox {{management}} failed to see the potential of many of PARC's inventions, this was mostly a problem with its computing research, a relatively small part of PARC's operations. A number of GUI engineers left to join Apple Computer. Technologies pioneered by its materials scientists such as liquid-crystal display (LCD), optical disc innovations, and <b>laser</b> <b>printing</b> were actively and successfully introduced by Xerox to the business and consumer markets.|$|E

25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, typefaces {{intended}} to be printed small contained ink traps, small indentations at the junctions of strokes that would be filled up with ink spreading out, maintaining the intended appearance of the type design. Without ink traps, the excess ink would blob and ruin the crisp edge. At larger sizes, these ink traps were not necessary, so display faces did not have them. They have also been removed from most digital fonts, as these will normally be viewed on screen or printed through inkjet printing, <b>laser</b> <b>printing,</b> offset lithography, electrophotographic printing or other processes that do not show the ink spread of letterpress. Ink traps have remained common on designs {{intended to be}} printed on low-quality, absorbent paper, especially newsprint and telephone directories.|$|E

Daniels returns and is asked {{to confirm that the}} bodies are linked to one organization. He tells Burrell that Marlo Stanfield's drug organization is their prime focus and is then asked what they have on Stanfield. He explains that Major Crimes was building a case against Stanfield until three months ago when their wiretaps were pulled by Lieutenant Marimow. Burrell offers Daniels whatever support he needs. Daniels tells Burrell that he needs the patrol division to begin searching for houses. Daniels leaves to begin organizing a citywide search.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{sublimation}} printing, where {{a special}} ink is printed onto the keycap {{surface and the}} application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard clear coating was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish keycaps to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or <b>laser</b> <b>printing</b> was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or [...] "keycaps", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the plastic material that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop plastic material.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>printing</b> is an {{electrostatic}} {{digital printing}} process. It produces high-quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing {{a laser beam}} {{back and forth over}} a negatively charged cylinder called a [...] "drum" [...] to define a differentially charged image. The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated in order to permanently fuse the text and/or imagery. As with digital photocopiers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process. However, <b>laser</b> <b>printing</b> differs from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of the medium across the printer's photoreceptor. This enables <b>laser</b> <b>printing</b> to copy images more quickly than most photocopiers.|$|E

40|$|Time-of-flight {{secondary}} ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) chemical mapping {{was used to}} investigate the order of deposition of natural latent fingerprints and <b>laser</b> <b>printed</b> ink on paper. This feasibility study shows that sodium, potassium and C 3 H 5 positive ions were particularly abundant endogenous components of the natural fingerprints and also present in the paper examined, but were mostly absent in the <b>laser</b> <b>printed</b> ink. Mapping of these ions enables the observation of friction ridges from latent prints on the ink surface, only when a fingerprint was deposited above the layer of ink. As a demonstration of proof of concept, blind testing of 21 samples from three donors resulted in a 100 % success rate. The sensitivity of this technique was investigated within this trial through the examination of up to fifth depletion fingerprints and ageing of up to 28 days. Migration of fingerprint and paper components to the ink surface, although observed with increased ageing time, was not found to compromise determination of the deposition sequence...|$|R
