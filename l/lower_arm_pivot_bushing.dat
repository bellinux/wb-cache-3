50|$|The front {{suspension}} {{was closely}} derived from {{that on the}} Morris Minor, using longitudinal torsion bars for springing. The rest of the front suspension consisted of <b>lower</b> <b>arms</b> <b>pivoting</b> on trunnions with upper ball joints supporting the wheel and acting on hydraulic lever arm dampers. These provided superior ride comfort over rough roads when compared to early telescopic dampers, {{at the expense of}} 'sloppy' handling and body control at high speeds. Improvements in road surfaces, the development of the motorway network, the huge increase in the performance of even standard family cars and advances in the design of telescopic dampers since Minor was launched in 1948 made this type of damper wholly obsolete by 1971. Nonetheless this setup was adopted to keep development and tooling costs to a minimum.|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} front suspension setup received <b>lower</b> control <b>arm</b> <b>pivot</b> points. The Series II update {{featured the}} addition of a new rear cross member, revised rear control arm assemblies with new style bushing and toe-control links to the semi-trailing arm rear suspension to better maintain the toe settings during suspension movements, resulting in more predictable car handling, noticeably over uneven surfaces, and improved tyre wear.|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the <b>lower</b> link <b>arm</b> inner <b>pivots,</b> it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|R

50|$|Needle {{bearings}} {{are heavily}} used in automobile components such as rocker <b>arm</b> <b>pivots,</b> pumps, compressors, and transmissions. The drive shaft of a rear-wheel drive vehicle typically {{has at least}} eight needle bearings (four in each U joint) and often more if it is particularly long, or operates on steep slopes.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1993, all GL1500 rocker <b>arms</b> <b>pivoted</b> on needle bearings, and {{the cruise}} control was updated to {{directly}} read crankshaft speed for enhanced precision; the GL1500 '93 cost $12,400. 1994 was the seventh year of GL1500 production (longer {{than any of}} its forerunners) and nothing significant changed except the asking price: GL1500A '94, $13,000.|$|R

5000|$|When in motion, the arm swings {{until it}} makes a {{complete}} loop; however, the riders never become inverted (upside-down). This is because ride has two [...] "twists" [...] the older version didn't. First, the <b>arm</b> <b>pivots</b> while the ride is in motion.

5000|$|The Weissach axle is {{a variant}} of the {{semi-trailing}} arm suspension. The tendency of a vehicle to oversteer when decelerating is compounded by the compliant bushings found in most trailing arm suspensions. When the vehicle is decelerating, the trailing <b>arm</b> <b>pivots</b> towards the rear as the wheel is [...] "pulled" [...] backwards relative to the chassis. This results in toe out, which makes the vehicle unstable.|$|R
2500|$|The {{caliper brake}} is {{a class of}} cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel, {{theoretically}} allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim. [...] Arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim. [...] While some designs incorporate dual pivot points [...] the <b>arms</b> <b>pivot</b> on a sub-frame [...] the entire assembly still mounts to a single point.|$|R
50|$|A simple kingpin {{suspension}} {{requires that}} the upper and <b>lower</b> control <b>arms</b> (wishbones) have <b>pivot</b> axes that are parallel, and in strict geometric relationship to the kingpin, or {{the top and bottom}} trunnions, which connect the kingpin to the control arms, would be severely stressed and the bearings would suffer severe wear. In practice, many vehicles had elastomeric bearings in the horizontal pivots of the trunnions, which allowed some small amount of flexibility, however this was insufficient to allow much adjustment of caster to be made, and also introduced compliance where the suspension designer may not have desired it in his quest for optimum handling. camber angle could generally be adjusted by moving both inner pivots of either the upper or <b>lower</b> control <b>arm</b> inwards or outwards by an exactly equal amount. But compliance of the control <b>arm</b> inner <b>pivots,</b> typically due to the use of elastomeric bearings, would again cause the trunnions to be stressed. The suspension designer's freedom was severely limited, it was necessary to have some compliance where it might not be wanted, and very little where more would have been useful in absorbing the fore and aft impact loading from bumps.|$|R
25|$|The older, {{traditional}} {{pattern has}} two <b>arms</b> that <b>pivot,</b> {{and one that}} slides to accommodate varying sizes of drum. This is satisfactory for a tilted drum; The drum is tilted away from the sliding arm and rests on the two <b>pivoting</b> <b>arms.</b> If it is horizontal, or tilted the wrong way by inexpert players, then the drum is insecure.|$|R
50|$|A three-piece {{version of}} the above uses a tiny <b>pivoting</b> <b>arm</b> held under tension inside the hinge. Pulling on the handle from any {{direction}} lifts the <b>pivoting</b> <b>arm's</b> pins out of the zipper teeth so that the slider can move.|$|R
50|$|With an offset {{slider-crank}} mechanism, an {{offset distance}} is introduced. This offset distance {{is referred to}} as L1 and is the fixed distance between the crank <b>arm</b> <b>pivot</b> point and the slider axis. This offset distance means that the slider-crank motion is no longer symmetrical about the sliding axis. In addition, the required crank angles of the forward and reverse strokes are no longer equivalent. An offset slider-crank provides a quick return when a slower working stroke is desired.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Golding Bird's {{original}} {{sketch of}} his interrupter circuit. Description: The prongs {{at the end}} of the <b>pivoted</b> <b>arm</b> dip into mercury filled recesses. This completes a circuit which energises a coil around the iron <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> and functions as an electromagnet. The magnetic polarity is so arranged that a permanent magnet underneath the arm then repels the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> and causes the circuit to break, but the prongs at the other end of the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> then close an identical circuit at that end and the procedure repeats endlessly. The output of the interrupter is fed to an induction coil which greatly increases the voltage applied to the patient by transformer action.|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} brake is a {{class of}} brake in which each arm {{is attached to a}} separate pivot point {{on one side of the}} seat stay or fork. Thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot. Both first- and second-class lever designs exist; second-class is by far the most common. In the second-class lever design, the <b>arm</b> <b>pivots</b> below the rim.

The brake shoe is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart.Due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes. Because the arms move only in their designed arcs, the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes. Thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust. As the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever brake wears, they ride lower on the rim. Eventually, one may go underneath the rim, so that the brake does not function.|$|R

5000|$|The {{semaphore}} arm {{consists of two}} parts: A wooden or metal arm (or [...] "blade") which pivots at different angles, and a spectacle holding coloured lenses which move {{in front of a}} lamp in order to provide indications at night. Usually these were combined into a single frame, though in some types (e.g. [...] "somersault" [...] signals in which the <b>arm</b> <b>pivoted</b> in the centre), the arm was separate from the spectacle.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} suspension system and its <b>lower</b> <b>arm.</b> These analyses were specifically applied on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> to determine its vibration and stress behaviour during its operation. The suspension system {{is one of the}} most important components of vehicle, which directly affects the safety, performance, noise level and style of it. The main objectives are to have less stress on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system as well as to reduce imposed load by optimization. The optimization of imposed load on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system is directly related to imposed force on the vehicle created by the road. This load has a direct effect on the value of imposed force on <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> where the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> force will be minimized by reducing the applied load. Hence, genetic algorithms for optimization and MATLAB optimization toolbar are used, as well as, specific M-file codes have been developed into MATLAB for optimization. By determining optimized design values of suspension system for reducing road force, it is possible to survey vibration condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> according to frequency respond of suspension system and its natural frequency. Therefore, frequency response of its acceleration has been determined according to the whole mass of suspension system. Using FFT technique and making transfer function for frequency response of suspension system, will present responded frequency of suspension system which is using for vibration analysis. For stress analysis, load condition of <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system must be determined in advance. Hence, a typical model of McPherson suspension system has been selected for analysis. According to the road profile considered for analysis and the velocity of vehicle, it is possible to obtain both velocity and acceleration equations for whole components of McPherson suspension system. These values are used to determine dynamic force condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> suspension system during its operation. By using dynamic forces which are governing on <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> of suspension system, in ABAQUS, the stress condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> can be determined during its operation...|$|R
