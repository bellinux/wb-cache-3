40|$|Eight {{polymorphic}} microsatellite loci {{were isolated}} and characterized from a microsatellite DNA-enriched DNA library for the <b>leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> (Plectropomus leopardus Lacepede, 1802), a popular food {{fish in the}} East Indies. These loci showed polymorphism information content ranging from 0. 493 to 0. 854, allele numbers ranging from 3 to 10, effective allele numbers ranging from 2. 2 to 7. 6, and observed and expected heterozygosities from 0. 375 to 0. 906 and 0. 544 to 0. 868 respectively. Thus, we expect that these markers will be useful for population genetic and breeding studies of the <b>leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper.</b> Science and Technology Department Foundation of Fujian Province [2007 N 0050...|$|E
40|$|Two {{new species}} of Phyllodistomum Braun, 1899 are {{described}} from the urinary bladder of fishes of the Great Barrier Reef. Phyllodistomum hoggettae n. sp. is described from Plectropomus leopardus (<b>leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper)</b> (Serranidae) and P. vaili n. sp. is described from Mulloidichthys vanicolensis (yellowfin goatfish) and M. flavolineatus (yellowstripe goat-fish) (Mullidae). These species are compared with 26 previously described marine Phyllodistomum species and found to be distinct in combinations of body shape, sucker ratio {{and shape of the}} gonads. Preliminary molecular data also demon-strate that they are distinct from each other and for those other species for which data are available...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the biological and}} ecological aspects {{of members of the}} globally exploited Epinephilidae with reference to fisheries management and in particular the use of closures. The <b>leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> Plectropomus leopardus is a common reef fish throughout the Indo-Pacific region and a major target of both commercial and recreational fisheries. There has been limited research on this species in the eastern Indian Ocean, where there are only two populations. An examination of the species found a number of significant biological differences to their eastern Australian con-specifics. Most noticeable was the strong size-related cue over their protogynous sex change. The lack of the typical social mechanisms regulating sex change for this family ultimately resulted on a spatially explicit pattern in spawning omission. After an assessment of a number of anthropogenic and environmental parameters, fishing pressure was found to be the likely cause behind spawning omission. Spawning was restricted to areas where fishing pressure was light (i. e. within protected areas), and fish were able to attain a size where they could become male. The strong link between spawning sites and males, coupled with historical samples of spawning fish at locations where current extensive sampling revealed none, re-affirms the hypothesis of fishing pressure causing spawning omission. Histology, underwater visual census and acoustic tracking were used to determine the spawning aggregation dynamics of <b>leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> at some of these spawning sites. Results yielded interesting differences from the GBR population {{and a number of other}} epinephelids. At the Abrolhos Islands, spawning was not limited to the new moon, but also encompassed the full moon, with a distinct difference between male and female attendances at aggregation sites. Females only attended aggregations during these lunar phases, while males moved to the aggregations almost daily during the spawning season. The formation of aggregations in the morning and their cessation by the afternoon provided a major departure from almost all other examples of spawning aggregations in Epinephelidae, which are considered to undertake a dusk spawning. Acoustic telemetry of <b>leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> at the Abrolhos Islands indicated the species is generally sedentary, which is consistent with the suite of epinephelids that were tracked at Ningaloo Reef. Twenty fish from six species of Epinephelidae were tracked for up to two years revealing highly sedentary, habitat attached movement patterns. There was limited movement between habitats, with channels bisecting the reef slope, providing a natural barrier to fish movement. The findings of the thesis are all discussed with reference to fisheries management and in particular spatial and temporal closures. They all provide evidence toward a common finding that management measures must take into account local species-specific biological and ecological characteristics...|$|E
30|$|Grouper is a {{high value}} cultured marine fish {{especially}} in the Southeast Asia countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines (Liao et al., 2001; Yashiro, 2008). The major cultured species are giant grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus (Yashiro, 2008), tiger grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (Sugama et al., 2008), malabar grouper, Epinephelus malabaricus (Yashiro, 2008), orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (Toledo et al. 1996), humpback grouper, Cromileptes altivelis (Marte, 2003), <b>leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper,</b> Plectropomus leopardus (De Silva, 1998) and hybrid grouper, (Epinephelus lanceolatus X Epinephelus fuscoguttatus). Heemstra and Randall (1993) estimated that 90 % of the world’s harvest on marine food is derived from artisanal fisheries, which groupers are the major component. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (2013), world aqu of (2880 saculture production of groupers was around 6000 – 7000 tones per annum, valued at about USD 60 million and the bulk of this production came from wild seed stock {{due to lack of}} reared seed that suffered disease problems.|$|E
40|$|Leopard coral grouper, Plectropomus leopardus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important finfish fish in Indonesia and the demand for the grouper is rapidly increasing in Asia and the Pacific. Grouper exports from Bali were 1, 613 mt in 2001, 2, 082 mt in 2002 and 2, 861 mt in 2003. Understanding the reproductive biology of fishes is an important component in developing mariculture and in the management of capture fisheries. This study reports on the reproductive biology of 86 coral groupers collected from various locations in Indonesia. The length and weight of these fish were recorded and related to gonad development. There was a strong relationship between length and weight; weight being proportional to the length raised to the power (b value) 3. 2. As the value of b was greater than 3, this suggests that growth is allometric. Histological analysis 73 % of the fish were immature, 19 % were in transition from females to males, only 4 % were male, and only 2 fish (2 %) had mature gonads: these were female. The sex of 2 fish could not be determined. From these data it can be seen that the <b>leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> has asynchronous gonad development. The two fish that were mature contained 343, 980 and 429, 259 oocytes and three distinct sizes of oocytes could be found. This suggests that the grouper is a multiple spawner. If fish are required for brood stock, this study has shown that only those with a length greater than 35 cm in standard length should be taken from the wild...|$|E
40|$|Understanding fish {{movements}} {{can help}} define the seasonal importance of different habitats and isolate {{spatial and temporal}} vulnerability to exploitation. <b>Leopard</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> Plectropomus leopardus {{is one of the}} main targeted fishery species in the Great Barrier Reef; however, there is no information on long-term movement patterns based on continuous and frequent data points. The objective of this study was to determine long-term space use of P. leopardus and identify any seasonal variation in movement trends. A total of 124 P. leopardus were implanted with V 13 P acoustic transmitters between 2010 and 2012 and passively tracked. Forty-five VR 2 W receivers were deployed at 2 reefs to track the movements of tagged individuals. The influence of time of day, season, tagging year, location, and water temperature on several movement measures was investigated. Of the 124 fish tagged, 74 individuals had sufficient detections to be included in analysis of horizontal movement, and 55 were used to analyse vertical movements. Results showed increased horizontal movements and higher activity in deeper water during the day in the austral summer. Movement patterns, both vertically and horizontally, appeared to be influenced by water temperature, but also corresponded with spawning season. Despite increased movements during summer, individuals typically remained in a small area ~ 0. 5 km 2 throughout detection periods, indicating that long-range spawning-related movements are rare and that adequate resources are obtained within a small section of habitat year-round. This study provides long-term (~ 3 yr) movement data for an economically significant reef fish and increases knowledge of spatial and temporal space use patterns...|$|E
