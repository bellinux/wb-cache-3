The East Village Other introduction to Burroughs' piece notes that the open letter [...] "is Mr. Burroughs' final answer to his critics and to Mister Gorden Mustain who attacked him for his position on Scientology {{in the pages of}} the L.A.

5000|$|The oozlum bird, also spelt ouzelum, is {{a legendary}} {{creature}} found in Australian and British folk tales and legends. Some versions have it that, when startled, the bird will {{take off and}} fly around in ever-decreasing circles until it manages to fly up its own backside, disappearing completely, which adds to its rarity. Other sources state that the bird flies backwards {{so that it can}} admire its own beautiful tail feathers, or because while it does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it is going, it <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it has been.|$|R

6000|$|DEAR JOE,--It is {{ten days}} since Susy [Twichell] wrote {{that you were}} laid up with a sprained shoulder, since which time we have had no news about it.

You have reached a time of life when it is not wise to take these risks. You would better jump around. We all have to change our methods as the infirmities of age creep upon us. Jumping around will be impressive now, whereas before you were gray it would have excited remark.|$|R
