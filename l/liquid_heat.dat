50|$|The {{process of}} forming steam bubbles within liquid in micro {{cavities}} {{adjacent to the}} wall if the wall temperature at the heat transfer surface rises above the saturation temperature while {{the bulk of the}} <b>liquid</b> (<b>heat</b> exchanger) is subcooled. The bubbles grow until they reach some critical size, at which point they separate from the wall and are carried into the main fluid stream. There the bubbles collapse because the temperature of bulk fluid is not as high as at the heat transfer surface, where the bubbles were created. This collapsing is also responsible for the sound a water kettle produces during heat up but before the temperature at which bulk boiling is reached.|$|E
50|$|An {{uncommon}} {{practice is}} to submerge the computer's components in a thermally, but not electrically, conductive liquid. Although rarely {{used for the}} cooling of personal computers, liquid submersion is a routine method of cooling large power distribution components such as transformers. It is also becoming popular with data centers. Personal computers cooled in this manner may not require either fans or pumps, and may be cooled exclusively by passive heat exchange between the computer hardware and the plastic box it is placed in. A heat exchanger (i.e. heater core or radiator) might still be needed though, and the piping {{also needs to be}} placed correctly. Extreme component density supercomputers such as the Cray-2 and Cray T90 used additional large liquid-to-chilled <b>liquid</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers for heat removal.|$|E

The nerds approach the campus police for help, but {{are bound by}} the fraternities' Greek Council that adjudicates all such pranks; {{the only way to}} appeal the Greek Council's inaction is to join a national fraternity. A black fraternity Lambda Lambda Lambda (Tri-Lambs) considers an Adams College chapter. The fraternity president, U.N. Jefferson, is not enthusiastic about a predominantly white group becoming a chapter, but is forced to grant an automatic 60-day probationary membership due to bylaws. The nerds invite Jefferson to a Lambda party with the Omega Mu sorority, which contain similar nerdy women including Gilbert's girlfriend Judy; their party is livened up when Booger supplies joints with high quality marijuana. The Alpha Betas, along with the Pi Delta Pis, to which Stan's head cheerleader girlfriend Betty Childs belongs, disrupt the party with a herd of pigs. U.N. Jefferson's attitude changes when he sees the discrimination the nerds face. The nerds later take their revenge on both groups by staging a panty raid on the Pi Delta Pis and pouring <b>liquid</b> <b>heat</b> into the Alpha Betas' jock straps.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{a liquid}} {{undergoes}} boiling by homogeneous nucleation during non-equilibrium heating {{is very important}} as {{the characteristics of the}} system before and after the occurrence of homogeneous boiling explosion is significantly different. In the present study, we studied homogeneous boiling explosion condition from an energy point of view: how much energy is required to boil the liquid by homogeneous nucleation from a given initial temperature. As a representative one, water heating at atmospheric pressure has been considered under three different heating conditions namely; i) linear heating at the boundary ii) high heat flux pulse <b>heating</b> and iii) <b>liquid</b> contact with high temperature surface. The analytical formulations for cumulative energy distribution in the liquid under various <b>liquid</b> <b>heating</b> conditions have been derived and the cumulative energy density within the liquid are calculated. It has been found that the instantaneous cumulative energy density very near to the liquid boundary is several times higher than that corresponding to the thermal penetration depth for all <b>liquid</b> <b>heating</b> cases. The present study shows that, the cumulative energy density at the boiling explosion over a characteristic liquid cluster being equal {{to the size of a}} critical embryo is independent of the heating parameter and for a given initial condition, it has been found to be almost constant for all <b>liquid</b> <b>heating</b> conditions. However, the cumulative energy density at the boiling explosion decreases as the liquid initial temperature increases for all <b>liquid</b> <b>heating</b> cases. The obtained results are compared with other numerical results reported in the literature for water subjected to uniform volumetric heating at atmospheric pressure...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Diesel engine {{generators}} are {{the major}} power source for small communities in cold regions. Diesel generators waste about 1 / 3 of their fuel {{energy in the form}} of heat through exhaust gas. The primary goal of this work is to capture part of the heat from the exhaust and improve the efficiency of the system. A gas to <b>liquid</b> <b>heat</b> transfer performance of a concentric tube heat exchanger with corrugated tubes and twisted tape inserts is investigated by considering its effects on engine performance and economics. This type of heat exchanger is expected to be inexpensive to install and effective in heat transfer, with minimal effect on exhaust emissions of diesel engines. Most previous research has investigated liquid to <b>liquid</b> <b>heat</b> transfer in corrugated tubes at low Reynolds, not gas to <b>liquid</b> <b>heat</b> transfer. The SolidWorks Flow Simulation computer program was used to perform these studies. The program is first validated by comparing simulation results with renowned correlations and field measurements. Simulations are then conducted for a concentric tube heat exchanger with corrugated tubes and twisted tapes of different configurations to determine the optimal design. The maximum enhancement in the rate of heat transfer was found in an annularly corrugated tube heat exchanger with twisted tape inserts. This exchanger transfers about 235. 3 % and 67. 26 % more heat compared to plain tube and annularly corrugated tube heat exchangers without twisted tapes, respectively. Based on optimal results, for a 120 kWe diesel generator, the application of an annularly corrugated tube heat exchanger with twisted tape inserts can save 2, 250 gallons of fuel annually (a cost of approximately $ 11, 330) expected payback of initial cost in one month. In addition, saving heating fuel also reduces CO₂ emissions by 23 metric tons per year...|$|E
