The lakes stretched {{from east to west}} and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from Capital Hill—the future location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial (although a casino was originally planned in its place). This was {{designed so that}} <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak.|$|E

25|$|In {{languages}} {{written from}} left to right, such as English, books are bound {{on the left side}} of the cover; <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> on top, the pages increase counter-clockwise. In right-to-left languages, books are bound on the right. In both cases, this is so the end of a page coincides with where it is turned. Many translations of Japanese comic books retain the binding on the right, which allows the art, laid out to be read right-to-left, to be published without mirror-imaging it.|$|E

From 1972 until 1983 he made pink films for the Shochiku subsidiary, Tōkatsu. L'ambition dans le miroir (1972), his first film for the studio, {{was one of}} Kobayashi's largest productions. Other titles Kobayashi made for Tōkatsu include Pervert's Pitfall and The High School Girl Who Likes to Be Watched (both 1976), Peeping Assault (1977) and <b>Looking</b> <b>from</b> Below (1981).|$|E
25|$|Kuala Lumpur’s central {{business}} district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur City Center (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with Late Modernism and Postmodern architecture fill the skyline. The 452 meter Petronas Twin Towers, designed by César Pelli, when seen from above, resembles the Islamic geometric motifs. While <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> street level, the all-glass shell of the building gives a post-modern take on the more traditional motif. The Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, {{next door to the}} towers follows the same theme. The convention center will have the shape of an eagle if viewed from above, while the all-glass shell of the building gives a more post-modern look.|$|E

Beside the main (Sun) installation, <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> the west side, above the Sea organ, are placed similar smaller installations representing other planets of the solar system. Sheet size of the Sun and planets are proportional, as well as the distance from the center of each plate for themselves, but not both at the same time because the planet installations would have to be from a few hundred meters to several tens of kilometers away from the Sun. Beneath the glass are photo-voltage solar modules with lighting elements which turn on at night, and produce show of light.|$|E
25|$|On {{the flat}} ceiling he painted an allegory of the Apotheosis of S. Ignatius, in breathtaking perspective. The painting, 17 m in diameter, is devised {{to make an}} observer, <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> a spot marked by a brass disc set into {{the floor of the}} nave, seem to see a lofty vaulted roof {{decorated}} by statues, while in fact the ceiling is flat. The painting celebrates the apostolic goals of Jesuit missionaries, eager to expand the reach of Roman Catholicism in other continents. The Counter-Reformation also encouraged a combative Catholicism. For example, rather than placing the usual evangelists or scholarly pillars of doctrine in the pendentives, Pozzo depicted the victorious warriors of the old testament: Judith and Holofernes; David and Goliath; Jael and Sisera; and Samson and the Philistines. It is said that when completed, some said (sic)Sant'Ignazio was a good place to buy meat, since four new butchers are now there.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E

500|$|Some {{individual}} scenes involved several jump cuts repeated {{several times}} in fast succession. Another unusual stylistic element used throughout the season involved sudden changes in jump-screen direction; a shot with an actor <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> left to right might immediately jump to another shot of the same actor <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> right to left. This process came from Levinson's insistence that the footage be edited together to include the actor's best performances. While editing [...] "Gone for Goode", Tony Black cut together two shots that did not match and began looking for a cutaway shot he could use to disguise the edit. Levinson liked the technique that came from cutting the two conflicting shots together and insisted it stay in. This technique became commonly used throughout the series, although it was toned down in future seasons {{at the insistence of}} NBC executives who found it too unconventional.|$|E
500|$|While {{filming the}} episode, Levinson {{said he would}} simply allow the actors to perform while he {{switched}} {{back and forth between}} them with the hand-held camera instead of filming carefully planned shots and individual scenes from multiple angles. This camera style largely persisted {{through the end of the}} series in 1999. Some individual scenes involved a number of jump cuts repeated several times in fast succession. Another unusual stylistic element used in the episode involved sudden changes in jump-screen direction; a shot with an actor <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> left to right might immediately jump to another shot of the same actor <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> right to left. This process was born during the editing sessions for [...] "Gone for Goode", where Levinson insisted that the footage be edited to include the actor's best performances. During editing, Tony Black cut together two shots that did not match and began looking for a cutaway shot he could use to disguise the edit. Levinson, however, liked the technique that came from cutting the two conflicting shots together and insisted it stay in.|$|E

[...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E
