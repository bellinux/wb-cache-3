5|$|On July 3, 1888, Mattie Blaylock, who {{had always}} {{considered}} herself Wyatt's wife, committed suicide in Pinal, Arizona Territory, by taking an overdose of <b>laudanum.</b>|$|E
5|$|When George III died in 1820, the Prince Regent, then aged 57, {{ascended the}} throne as George IV, {{with no real}} change in his powers. By {{the time of his}} accession, he was obese and {{possibly}} addicted to <b>laudanum.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 7, {{the morning}} of Beauchamp's {{scheduled}} execution, Anna requested that the guard allow her privacy while she dressed. Anna tried another overdose on <b>laudanum,</b> {{but was unable to}} keep it down. She had smuggled a knife into the cell, and the couple attempted another double suicide by stabbing themselves with it. When they were discovered, Anna was taken to the jailer's home and tended to by doctors.|$|E
5|$|The Beauchamps {{were accused}} of trying to bribe a guard to let them escape, but this effort failed. They also tried to get a letter to Senator Beauchamp, asking for his help in escaping. A final plea to Governor Desha for another stay of {{execution}} was denied on July 5. Later that day, the couple attempted a double suicide by taking large doses of <b>laudanum,</b> but both survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} the execution, Anna took a second dose of <b>laudanum</b> {{but was unable to}} keep it down. On July 7, 1826, the morning of the {{scheduled}} execution, Anna asked the guard to give her privacy to dress. Once the guard left, Anna revealed to Beauchamp that she had smuggled in a knife, and she and her husband stabbed themselves. Anna was taken to a nearby house to be treated by doctors.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp {{was still}} living with his common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as {{his wife in the}} 1880 census, but she had a growing {{addiction}} to the opiate <b>laudanum.</b> There are no contemporary Tombstone records that indicate a relationship between Marcus and Earp, but Earp certainly knew her, because both Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E
5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, {{if they ever}} existed. The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers have addressed the issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of <b>laudanum,</b> readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer. Though it is unclear {{if this was a}} true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it did not lead to Poe's death a year later.|$|E
5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of <b>laudanum</b> which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with <b>laudanum,</b> tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1881, Marcus found Behan in {{bed with}} the wife of a friend and kicked him out, {{although}} she still used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as his wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to <b>laudanum,</b> a commonly used opiate and painkiller. There are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrived at}} the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had {{originally}} intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment {{that something was wrong}} at home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from Oldham were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided to remain in the vicarage.) Huskisson was moved to the sofa, and given <b>laudanum</b> and brandy. At about 2.00pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were baffled {{by the nature of the}} damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, {{and he was}} apprehended at {{his home}} in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking <b>laudanum</b> shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.|$|E
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with <b>laudanum</b> without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
25|$|Several {{historical}} {{varieties of}} <b>laudanum</b> exist, including Paracelsus' <b>laudanum,</b> Sydenham's <b>Laudanum</b> (also known as tinctura opii crocata), benzoic <b>laudanum</b> (tinctura opii benzoica), and deodorized tincture of opium (the most common contemporary formulation), among others. Depending on the version, additional {{amounts of the}} substances and additional active ingredients (e.g. saffron, sugar, eugenol) are added, modifying its effects (e.g., amount of sedation, or anti-tussive properties).|$|E
25|$|Reddish-brown and {{extremely}} bitter, <b>laudanum</b> contains {{almost all of}} the opium alkaloids, including morphine and codeine, and its high morphine concentration makes it a potent narcotic. <b>Laudanum</b> was historically used to treat a variety of ailments, but its principal use was as an analgesic and cough suppressant. Until the early 20th century, <b>laudanum</b> was sold without a prescription and was a constituent of many patent medicines. Today, <b>laudanum</b> is recognized as addictive and is strictly regulated and controlled as such throughout most of the world. The United States Uniform Controlled Substances Act, for one example, lists it on Schedule II.|$|E
25|$|In the HBO series Deadwood Alma Garrett, {{played by}} Molly Parker. is {{addicted}} to <b>laudanum.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Laudanum</b> is a {{tincture}} {{of opium}} containing approximately 10% powdered opium by weight (the equivalent of 1% morphine).|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} Interview with the Vampire <b>laudanum</b> {{was used to}} kill the boys who Lestat {{subsequently}} drank from, incapacitating him.|$|E
25|$|The terms <b>laudanum</b> and {{tincture}} {{of opium}} are generally interchangeable, but in contemporary medical practice {{the latter is}} used almost exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Dr Stephen Maturin, one of {{the main}} {{characters}} in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series of novels about the Napoleonic wars, is a sometime <b>laudanum</b> addict.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} Tombstone, Wyatt Earp's first wife {{frequently}} speaks of her need for <b>laudanum.</b> Although {{she is not}} described as such in the film, she is clearly an addict.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the US {{adopted the}} Uniform Controlled Substances Act, which {{regulated}} opium tincture (<b>Laudanum)</b> as a Schedule II substance (currently DEA #9630), placing even tighter {{controls on the}} drug.|$|E
25|$|In Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist, Nancy gives Bill Sykes {{a dose of}} <b>laudanum</b> to put him {{to sleep}} so that she may sneak out one evening in search of Rose Maylie.|$|E
25|$|In Uncle Tom's Cabin, the anti-slavery {{novel by}} Harriet Beecher Stowe, a slave named Cassy {{talks about how}} she killed her newborn by <b>laudanum</b> {{overdose}} to spare him from experiencing the horrors of slavery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} From Hell (2001), Johnny Depp's {{character}} Inspector Abberline adds {{a few drops}} of <b>laudanum</b> to a glass of absinthe to induce visions that include Jack the Ripper's victims as they are murdered.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of opium}} as a cure-all was {{reflected}} in the formulation of mithridatium described in the 1728 Chambers Cyclopedia, which included true opium in the mixture. Subsequently, <b>laudanum</b> became the basis of many popular patent medicines of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Patrick Branwell {{was born}} in Thornton on 26 June 1817. Known as Branwell, he was a painter, writer and casual worker. He became {{addicted}} to alcohol and <b>laudanum</b> and died at Haworth on 24 September 1848 {{at the age of}} 31.|$|E
25|$|<b>Laudanum</b> {{is portrayed}} as the {{surgical}} drug of choice for fifteenth-century physicians in Lawrence Schoonover's novel The Burnished Blade (1948), the plot of which deals in part with the smuggling of expensive raw opium into France from the Empire of Trebizond.|$|E
25|$|Holliday {{spent his}} {{remaining}} days in Colorado. After {{a stay in}} Leadville, he suffered from the high altitude. He increasingly depended on alcohol and <b>laudanum</b> to ease the symptoms of tuberculosis, and his health and his skills as a gambler began to deteriorate.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is used {{to treat}} mild to {{moderate}} pain and to relieve cough. Codeine {{is also used to}} treat diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, although loperamide (which is available without a prescription for milder diarrhea), diphenoxylate, paregoric or even <b>laudanum</b> are more frequently used to treat severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|In William Faulkner's novel Requiem for a Nun (1951), Compson, Doctor Peabody, and Ratcliffe give whiskey tainted with <b>laudanum</b> to a {{group of}} rowdy lynchers and a militia band that had joined together. Upon their falling asleep, they were {{gathered}} up and locked in jail while still unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{trying to}} make a name as an artist, he left for London but in several days used up in cafés of ill-repute the {{allowance}} provided by his father. His attempts to obtain low paid work failed, and very quickly he foundered in alcohol and <b>laudanum</b> and was unable to regain his stability.|$|E
25|$|In Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein takes <b>laudanum</b> as {{his only}} means of {{sleeping}} and thus preserving his life while in recovery from months of fever {{and a series of}} horrible events. Oppressed by his various misfortunes he doubles his dose and falls into a deep sleep only to be tormented by his dreams.|$|E
25|$|A further victim, a {{boy named}} Cunningham, was found {{sleeping}} in the pig-market at Smithfield on Friday, 21 October; again lodging was promised. He was drugged {{with a mixture of}} warm beer, sugar, rum and <b>laudanum,</b> and murdered in the well. He was undressed, bagged, then sold for eight guineas to a Mr Smith at St Bartholomew's Hospital.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern culture, opium is more {{commonly}} used {{in the form of}} paregoric to treat diarrhea. This is a weaker solution than <b>laudanum,</b> an alcoholic tincture which was prevalently used as a pain medication and sleeping aid. Tincture of opium has been prescribed for, among other things, severe diarrhea. Taken thirty minutes prior to meals, it significantly slows intestinal motility, giving the intestines greater time to absorb fluid in the stool.|$|E
25|$|She {{began to}} take opiates for the pain, <b>laudanum</b> (an opium concoction) {{followed}} by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She would become dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use {{from an early age}} may well have contributed to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter have suggested this may also have contributed to the wild vividness of her imagination and the poetry that it produced.|$|E
