The “Million Step March” was designed to focus on encouraging walking and fitness as opposed to weight loss. Marino and BCBSNC Vice President Kathy Higgins kicked off the campaign April 1, 2008 in Asheville, North Carolina. Promoted as a “mountains to the coast” statewide campaign, the “Million Step March” moved 12 -15 miles per day through eight media markets including Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Durham, Greenville, Fayetteville and ending in coastal Wilmington. Marino and Higgins appeared at nearly 60 live events during the 75-day walk. Over 800 people turned out for the ½ point “Rally In Raleigh” event and 600 showed up to cheer the walkers at the finish <b>line</b> <b>event</b> in Wilmington’s Riverfront Park [...] Over all, more than 6400 walkers joined the Million Step March walking over half a billion steps.|$|E

40|$|This study {{illustrates}} the convectively generated gravity wave generation mechanisms during {{the passage of}} thunderstorms and squall line using Indian MST radar. For the first time, {{it has been shown}} that all three generation mechanisms have been involved in the generation of gravity waves during the passage of squall <b>line</b> <b>event.</b> It is observed that the periodicities in the range of 8 – 80 min in the tropospheric and 8 – 32 min in the lower stratospheric regions and vertical wavelengths in the range of 3. 2 – 4. 8 km in the tropospheric and 1. 2 – 1. 92 km in the lower stratospheric regions are found to be dominant in the present study and are distinctly different during initial, mature and dissipative phases of convection. Amplitude of vertical wind has been weakened (from ~ 4 – 6 m s − 1 to ~ 1 m s − 1) considerably after 10 – 30 min of a convection event. It appears that the wind shear associated with the convective clouds acted like an obstacle to the mean background flow during the squall line passage generated gravity waves. The phase profiles corresponding to the dominant period show both downward and upward propagation of waves. The vertical extent of heating is found to be deeper during squall <b>line</b> <b>event</b> compared with thunderstorm event. From the phase profiles, during 27 September 2004, two peaks of constant phase region are observed. One is due to convective elements and the other is due to strong background wind shear; however, only one peak is observed on 29 September 2004, which is only due to convective processes...|$|E

We also test hypotheses on the relation between loss severity and the decline in the market value of the announcing firm and whether or not the decline in market value is greater if the loss results from internal fraud.

40|$|Abstract Background Schwannomatosis is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by multiple non-vestibular schwannomas. Although biallelic NF 2 mutations are found in schwannomas, no germ <b>line</b> <b>event</b> is detected in schwannomatosis patients. In contrast, germline mutations of the SMARCB 1 (INI 1) tumor suppressor gene were described in familial and sporadic schwannomatosis patients. Methods To delineate the SMARCB 1 gene contribution, the nine coding exons were sequenced {{in a series of}} 56 patients affected with a variable number of non-vestibular schwannomas. Results Nine variants scattered along the sequence of SMARCB 1 were identified. Five of them were classified as deleterious. All five patients carrying a SMARCB 1 mutation had more multiple schwannomas, corresponding to 10. 2 % of patients with schwannomatosis. They were also diagnosed before 35 years of age. Conclusions These results suggest that patients with schwannomas have a significant probability of carrying a SMARCB 1 mutation. Combined with data available from other studies, they confirm the clinical indications for genetic screening of the SMARCB 1 gene. </p...|$|E
40|$|Windthrows change forest {{structure}} and species composition in central Amazon forests. However, {{the effects of}} widespread tree mortality associated with wind disturbances on soil properties {{have not yet been}} described in this vast region. We investigated short-term effects (7 years after disturbance) of widespread tree mortality caused by a squall <b>line</b> <b>event</b> from mid-January of 2005 on soil carbon stocks and concentrations in a central Amazon terra firme forest. The soil carbon stock (averaged over a 0 – 30  cm depth profile) in disturbed plots (61. 4  ±  8. 2  Mg ha − 1, mean ± 95  % confidence interval) was marginally higher (p [*]=[*]  0. 09) than that from undisturbed plots (47. 7  ±  13. 6  Mg ha − 1). The soil organic carbon concentration in disturbed plots (2. 0  ±  0. 17  %) was significantly higher (p  <  0. 001) than that from undisturbed plots (1. 36  ±  0. 24  %). Moreover, soil carbon stocks were positively correlated with soil clay content (r 2 [*]=[*]  0. 332, r [*]=[*]  0. 575 and p [*]=[*]  0. 019) and with tree mortality intensity (r 2 [*]=[*]  0. 257, r [*]=[*]  0. 506 and p [*]=[*]  0. 045). Our results indicate that large inputs of plant litter associated with large windthrow events cause a short-term increase in soil carbon content, and the degree of increase is related to soil clay content and tree mortality intensity. The higher carbon content and potentially higher nutrient availability in soils from areas recovering from windthrows may favor forest regrowth and increase vegetation resilience...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to increase the intensity of extreme precipitation events in Amazonia that in turn might produce more forest blowdowns associated with convective storms. Yet quantitative tree mortality associated with convective storms has never been reported across Amazonia, representing an important additional source of carbon to the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that a single squall line (aligned cluster of convective storm cells) propagating across Amazonia in January, 2005, caused widespread forest tree mortality and {{may have contributed to the}} elevated mortality observed that year. Forest plot data demonstrated that the same year represented the second highest mortality rate over a 15 -year annual monitoring interval. Over the Manaus region, disturbed forest patches generated by the squall followed a power-law distribution (scaling exponent alpha = 1. 48) and produced a mortality of 0. 3 - 0. 5 million trees, equivalent to 30 % of the observed annual deforestation reported in 2005 over the same area. Basin-wide, potential tree mortality from this one event was estimated at 542 +/- 121 million trees, equivalent to 23 % of the mean annual biomass accumulation estimated for these forests. Our results highlight the vulnerability of Amazon trees to wind-driven mortality associated with convective storms. Storm intensity {{is expected to}} increase with a warming climate, which would result in additional tree mortality and carbon release to the atmosphere, with the potential to further warm the climate system.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Agonistic {{behavior}} among three species of Microtus live-trapped near Corvallis, Oregon {{was recorded in}} order to interpret habitat segregation by the species in areas of syrnpatry. The method used to measure agonistic interaction {{was similar to that}} of Colvin (1970). Agonistic behavior was recorded under red light in a neutral circular arena. Two observers recorded the frequency and duration of 14 behavioral components on an Ester <b>line</b> <b>event</b> recorder for a ten minute trial. To be classified a winner in an agonistic encounter, an individual had to show more exploration, and display more approaches, attacks, and offense than its opponent. Based on these criteria, a trial could be termed fraternal, dominant-subordinate, no decision, or mutual avoidance, the last occurring when species remained separated approximately 180 ° and moved only to counter the others movements. In interspecific contests in which a winner could be determined, M. oregoni and M. canicaudus males were dominant to M. townsendii males (P 0. 05). The frequency of mutual avoidance by the three species in interand intraspecific encounters was greater when M. townsendii was involved and suggested that habitat spacing by the three species may depend on mutual avoidance as well as aggressive interaction. In a behavioral experiment performed in the laboratory to measure effects of agonistic interaction on habitat segregation, it was found that M. townsendii and M. oregoni were more gregarious than M. canicaudus. Log records indicated that males of all three species displayed more solitary behavioral patterns than females. Movement was significantly restricted when two species were paired in comparison to their controls (P < 0. 05). M. canicaudus males tended to be least restricted in their explorations and were most aggressive or intolerant toward other species, inflicting heavy casualties on M. oregoni in particular. Few instances of long-term interspecific associations developed. Those which did occur often involved labeled subordinate members of either species...|$|E
40|$|Variability in the {{convective}} {{boundary layer}} moisture, wind and temperature fields and their {{importance in the}} forecasting and understanding of storms have been discussed in the literature. These variations {{have been reported in}} relation to frontal zones, stationary boundaries and during horizontal convective rolls. While all three vary substantially in the convective boundary layer, moisture poses a particular challenge. Moisture or water vapor concentration (expressed as a mass mixing ratio, g/kg), is conserved in all meteorological processes except condensation and evaporation. The water vapor mixing ratio often remains distinct across an air -mass boundary even when the temperature difference is indistinct. These properties make it an ideal choice in visualizing and understanding many of the atmosphere's dynamic features. However, it also presents a unique measurement challenge because water vapor content can vary by more than three orders of magnitude in the troposphere. Characterization of the 3 D-distribution of water vapor is also difficult as water vapor observations can suffer from large sampling errors and substantial variability both in the vertical and horizontal. This study presents groundbased measurements of wind, boundary layer structure and water vapor mixing ratio measurements observed by three co-located lidars. This presentation will focus on the evolution and variability of moisture and wind in the boundary layer during a dry <b>line</b> <b>event</b> that occurred on 22 May 2002. These data sets and analyses are unique in that they combine simultaneous measurements of wind, moisture and CBL structure to study the detailed thermal variability in and around clear air updrafts during a dryline event. It will quantify the variation caused by, in and around buoyant plumes and across a dryline. The data presented here were collected in the panhandle of Oklahoma as part of the International BO Project (IHOP- 2002), a field experiment that took place over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States from 13 May to 30 June 2002.
