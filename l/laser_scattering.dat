We {{observed}} that the <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> and autofluorescent properties of newborn macrophages were {{different from those of}} adult cells. Relative to the adult AM, the forward-angle <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> obtained with the newborn AM was reduced; this optical measurement ap-peared to correlate with the smaller mean size, as determined by ultrastructural and electronic volume measurements. The diminished right-angle <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> (90 #{ 176 }angle) correlated with the presence of fewer small, irregularly shaped lysosomal structures in the newborn AM, compared with AM from adult ani-mals. AM from 1 - 2 -day-old rats displayed large vacuoles containing multila-mellar structures, which proved to be less effective at scattering light. Cells from newborn rats were less autofluorescent, a finding that appeared to corre-late best with the numbers of secondary lysosomes. Flow cytometry may be used to discern structural alterations that occur during the maturation of AM. These changes correlate well with quantitative ultrastructural analyses of these cells.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} novel non-contact {{methods for}} detecting faults in heat seals of food packages. Two alternative imaging technologies are investigated; <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> imaging and polarised light stress images. After segmenting the seal {{area from the}} rest of the respective image, a classifier is trained to detect faults in different regions of the seal area using features extracted from the pixels in the respective region. A very large set of candidate features, based on statistical information relating to the colour and texture of each region, is first extracted. Then an adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) is used to automatically select the best features for discriminating faults from non-faults. With this approach, different features can be selected and optimised for the different imaging methods. In experiments we compare the performance of classifiers trained using features extracted from <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> images only, polarised light stress images only, and a combination of both image types. The results show that the polarised light and <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> classifiers achieved accuracies of 96 % and 90 %, respectively, while the combination of both sensors achieved an accuracy of 95 %. These figures suggest that both systems have potential for commercial development...|$|R

40|$|Scleroderma, a chronic, {{progressive}} disorder, {{is characterized}} by dermal fibrosis with collagen bundles orientated parallel to the epidermis. Simple objective parameters to evaluate disease progression and therapies are needed. We describe two methods, the <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> method and the fast Fourier transform (FFT), to measure collagen bundle orientation and spacing. Lesional sclerodermic skin (LS), nonlesional sclerodermic skin (nonLS), and control skin (CS) sections were evaluated for orientation ratio using the <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> method. The FFT was used to calculate orientation ratio, variation, and spacing of collagen bundles. Parameters were correlated with local and mean skin score measurements, {{on a scale of}} 0 (normal) to 3 (severely sclerotic). With both the <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> method and the FFT, orientation ratios of LS (respectively, 2. 16 +/- 0. 33 and 1. 83 +/- 0. 62) were significantly higher than CS (respectively, 1. 70 +/- 0. 35 and 1. 38 +/- 0. 15). NonLS orientation ratios (respectively, 1. 92 +/- 0. 15 and 1. 48 +/- 0. 44) were between LS and CS ratios. Orientation variation and bundle spacing of LS (respectively, 57. 3 +/- 19. 4 and 15. 7 +/- 5. 6 microm) were significantly reduced compared to CS (respectively, 73. 8 +/- 15. 0 and 18. 9 +/- 1. 9 microm). NonLS orientation ratios (respectively, 57. 2 +/- 29. 0 and 15. 6 +/- 6. 1 microm) were similar to LS. Bundles in LS are more parallel, show less variation in orientation, and are more densely packed than in CS. There was a linear correlation between mean skin score and orientation ratio. Local skin score was not linearly correlated to orientation ratio. Our findings suggest that nonLS dermis without clinical sclerosis already shows fibrotic characteristics. Both techniques were easy to use and suitable for objectifying dermal fibrosis in scleroderma lesions. FFT is more accurate and reproducible than the <b>laser</b> <b>scatter</b> method and allows simultaneous pathological evaluation of the location of the analyzed tissue sections. Future studies will need to focus on the correlation between clinical disease severity and collagen bundle characteristic...|$|R

50|$|Each {{instrument}} comprises {{a scientific}} camera, a microscope, and a sample viewing unit (LM12 or LM14).

50|$|In optical interferometry, {{homodyne}} signifies {{that the}} reference radiation (i.e. the local oscillator) {{is derived from}} the same source as the signal before the modulating process. For example, in a <b>laser</b> <b>scattering</b> measurement, the laser beam is split into two parts. One is the local oscillator and the other is sent to the system to be probed. The scattered light is then mixed with the local oscillator on the detector. This arrangement has the advantage of being insensitive to fluctuations in the frequency of the laser. Usually the scattered beam will be weak, in which case the (nearly) steady component of the detector output is a good measure of the instantaneous local oscillator intensity and therefore can be used to compensate for any fluctuations in the intensity of the laser.|$|E

50|$|Typically the eluent of the SEC {{column is}} allowed to pass through both a {{refractive}} index detector (that gives measures for the concentration in the solution as a function time) and through a <b>laser</b> <b>scattering</b> cell. The scattered intensity is measured {{as a function of}} time under a small angle with respect to the laser beam. The low-angle light scattering data can be analyzed if one assumes that the low-angle data {{is the same as the}} scattering at zero angle. For the relevant equations, see the article on static light scattering. Under these conditions the laser signal together with the concentration data can be translated into a curve that yields both the Mn and the Mw, the molar mass weighted by number and by weight respectively. The combination of those two data gives information on the linearity of the polymer.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{detectors}} used for {{size exclusion chromatography}} include online methods similar to the bench methods used above. By far the most common is the differential refractive index detector that measures the change in refractive index of the solvent. This detector is concentration-sensitive and very molecular-mass-insensitive, so it is ideal for a single-detector GPC system, as it allows the generation of mass v's molecular mass curves. Less common but more accurate and reliable is a molecular-mass-sensitive detector using multi-angle laser-light scattering - see Static Light Scattering. These detectors directly measure the molecular mass of the polymer and are most often {{used in conjunction with}} differential refractive index detectors. A further alternative is either low-angle light scattering, which uses a single low angle to determine the molar mass, or Right-Angle-Light <b>Laser</b> <b>scattering</b> in combination with a viscometer, although this latter technique does not give an absolute measure of molar mass but one relative to the structural model used.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the number}} of uses of bubbles has begun to {{increase}} dramatically, with medicine, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment {{just some of the}} industries taking advantage of bubble properties, such as high mass transfer. As a result, more and more focus is being placed on the understanding and control of bubble formation processes and there are currently numerous techniques utilized to facilitate this understanding. Acoustic bubble sizing (ABS) and <b>laser</b> <b>scattering</b> techniques are able to provide information regarding bubble size and size distribution with minimal data processing, a major advantage over current optical-based direct imaging approaches.

40|$|Cold {{atmospheric}} plasmas (CAPs) are a {{topic of}} growing interest nowadays, especially due to their applicability in material processing and biomedical applications. The <b>laser</b> <b>scattering</b> techniques of Thomson, Rayleigh and Raman provide precise measurements of the electron temperature, electron density, and the gas temperature. These <b>laser</b> <b>scattering</b> diagnostic methods are advantageous due to the high spatial and temporal resolution that they can achieve. In this contribution we aim to address the possibilities of <b>laser</b> <b>scattering</b> techniques {{as well as the}} main complications that come into play when they are applied to cold atmospheric discharges. A classical problem for Thomson scattering experiments is the false stray light, which might deteriorate the detection limit. As a consequence of their low gas temperature and open air operation, CAPs present high concentrations of molecules. This implies that the Thomson and Raman spectra will overlap, and therefore the two signals must be precisely disentangled. Another characteristic of CAPs is the low ionization degree which can induce deviations in the electron energy distribution function (EEDF). These deviations mainly affect the tail of the EEDF. An energy region that is not easy to measure by Thomson scattering. Finally, the laser heating of the electron gas is another issue which has to be considered. In the case of CAPs the contribution to the laser-heating intermediated by electron-atom collisions cannot be neglected. To place the specific features of <b>laser</b> <b>scattering</b> techniques in a broader perspective we will compare the CAP results to those obtained on low pressure plasmas...|$|E
