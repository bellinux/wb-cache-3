5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
500|$|James Reed of The Boston Globe {{described}} [...] "Radio" [...] as fun, bouncy, {{and ideal}} {{for a night}} at the club. Similarly, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the [...] "spiky, Europop throb" [...] of [...] "Radio" [...] expertly taunt the boys and fill the dance floor. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! was surprised by the new musical direction of Beyoncé but concluded that [...] "... you better believe it ... it kinda works". Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix described [...] "Radio" [...] as the most believable song on the album, and complimented its [...] "amid bland testaments to love's timeless endurance and the smut and thuggin of the 'Sasha Fierce' persona, [...] is one with sensual overtones sung to an electronic device that, unlike men, 'never <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> down'". Echoing Brockman's sentiments, Amy Linden of Vibe magazine, who wrote that 1980's electropop and the sleek Valentine music of [...] "Radio" [...] tells the story of Beyoncé's alter ego. Similarly, Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond of The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Radio" [...] "show [...] Sasha [...] just a good girl playing fierce". By contrast, Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Radio" [...] sounds like [...] "shameless target-marketing" [...] aiming at programming directors. On The Village Voice 2008 year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, [...] "Radio" [...] was ranked at number 443.|$|E
2500|$|In The New York Times on April 3, 1966, Moyers {{offered this}} insight on his stint as press {{secretary}} to President Johnson: [...] "I {{work for him}} despite his faults and he <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> work for him despite my deficiencies." [...] On October 17, 1967, he told an audience in Cambridge that Johnson saw the war in Vietnam as his major legacy and, as a result, was insisting on victory at all costs, {{even in the face}} of public opposition. Moyers felt such a continuation of the conflict would tear the country apart. [...] "I never thought the situation could arise when I would wish for the defeat of LBJ, and that makes my current state of mind all the more painful to me," [...] he told them. [...] "I would have to say now: It would depend on who his opponent is." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1928, Robeson played [...] "Joe" [...] in the London {{production}} of the American musical Show Boat, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. His rendition of [...] "Ol' Man River" [...] became the benchmark for all future performers of the song. Some black critics were not pleased with the play due to its usage of the word nigger. It was, nonetheless, immensely popular with white audiences. He was summoned for a Royal Command Performance at Buckingham Palace and Robeson was befriended by MPs from the House of Commons. Show Boat continued for 350 performances and, as of 2001, it remained the Royal's most profitable venture. The Robesons bought a home in Hampstead. He reflected on his life in his diary and wrote {{that it was all}} part of a [...] "higher plan" [...] and [...] "God watches over me and guides me. He's with me and <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> fight my own battles and hopes I'll win." [...] However, an incident at the Savoy Grill, in which he was refused seating, sparked him to issue a press release describing the insult which subsequently became a matter of public debate.|$|E
2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E
