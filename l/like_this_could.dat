Ruediger called it an episode [...] "for the new millennium" [...] as he thought it [...] "could never exist {{under the banner of}} the old series." [...] He called it a [...] "thought-provoking piece", and wrote that episodes <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> not be broadcast every week since it [...] "would be too taxing on the average viewer's brain". IGN's Matt Wales ranked [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace" [...] the third best Tennant Doctor Who story, calling it [...] "one of Doctor Whos most touching adventures".|$|E

They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|Multiple {{commentators}} have described Inchon {{as the worst}} film ever made, including The Washington Post, [...] Newsweek, TV Guide, and the Canadian Press. Inchon was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film, including The Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael Medved, and The Worst Movies of All Time by Michael Sauter. In 2000, Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley, writing in the libertarian magazine Reason, said about a proposed film on Stalinism: [...] "A film <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> easily have turned out as big a didactic dud as the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's 1982 bomb, Inchon, with Laurence Olivier as Gen. Douglas MacArthur." [...] A 2009 review by Phil Hall for Film Threat was less negative, and he disagreed with the characterization of the film as the worst ever made, [...] "I was genuinely surprised — this is hardly among the very worst films of all time. That's not {{to say it is}} a good film. It is a dull and forgettable movie, and I would never recommend it. However, its reputation for being among the bottom of the cinematic barrel is wholly undeserved." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{believing that the}} film [...] "leaves you breathless with curiosity, as it teases itself with the {{directions}} it might take. To watch the film is {{to be actively involved}} in the challenge of its creation." [...] He later added the film to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] collection. At the end of 2009, Ebert named the film one of the best of the decade. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film a four star rating, and praised Kaufman's writing, stating [...] "Screenwriting this smart, inventive, passionate and rip-roaringly funny is a rare species. So all praise to Charlie Kaufman, working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on Being John Malkovich, in 1999." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking. And the climax, the portion that either sinks the entire movie or self-critically explains how so many others derail, is bananas." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek felt Meryl Streep had not [...] "been this much fun to watch in years", while Mike Clark of USA Today gave a largely negative review, mainly criticizing the ending: [...] "Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to <b>like,</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot." ...|$|E

The class discussion, however, helped students make the desired connection with accuracy of measurement. Further, on the post-activity assessment questions, many students were able to define variation and demonstrate justifications typical of the level 4 developmental hierarchy.|$|R

500|$|The Guardian in 2013 cited Mughal-e-Azam as a [...] "landmark of cinema" [...] {{despite its}} {{historical}} inaccuracies, and the BBC stated in 2005 {{that it is}} [...] "widely considered one of Bollywood's most iconic films". Imtiaz Ali of The Times of India in 2010 called it the [...] "most proto-typical, high involvement, expensive, passionate piece of work that Hindi cinema has ever produced", one that [...] "set the standard for everything that will ever come after it". It continues to be regarded by critics as the Indian equivalent of Gone with the Wind. Filmmaker Subhash Ghai was quoted in 2010 as saying that a film <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> never be repeated: [...] "Mughal-e-Azam is an all-time classic and has been the ultimate love story in Hindi cinema at all levels. So it will always remain alive for generations to come." [...] To commemorate the film's anniversary, Asif's friend the actor and producer Shah Rukh Khan had his company Red Chillies Entertainment produce a documentary video titled Mughal-E-Azam– A Tribute by a son to his father. Hosted by Khan, it includes interviews with Asif's family and Bollywood stars. Artist M. F. Husain created a series of paintings for the video, in which he re-imagined some memorable scenes. Interested in preserving the film for future generations, Khan noted {{that his father was}} originally cast in the film but did not complete it. When asked if Mughal-e-Azam should be remade, he retorted: [...] "It is the mother of all films; mothers cannot be remade". No sequels have been made, but Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam (2008) paid tribute with its title and by including in its plot part of the original stage play; it received very poor ratings from critics. In October 2016, producer Feroz Abbas Khan premiered a stage play based on the film with a cast of over 70 actors and dancers at Mumbai's NCPA theatre.|$|E

2500|$|A {{foundation}} of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concern about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who {{accused them of}} creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal {{right to bear arms}} as a potential check against tyranny. Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is [...] "a chimerical idea to suppose that a country <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?" [...] Noah Webster similarly argued: ...|$|E
2500|$|Torvalds {{describes}} himself as [...] "completely a-religious—atheist", adding that [...] "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible that something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> {{have happened in the}} first place.'" [...] He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in America it has become very politicized. When discussing the issue of church and state separation, Torvalds also said, [...] "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding {{between the state and the}} state religion." ...|$|E

He is called upon for his defence, and contents himself with a little declamation about the jurymen and his country—asserts that all the witnesses have committed perjury, and hints that the police force generally have entered into a conspiracy ‘again’ him. However probable this statement may be, it fails to convince the Court, and some such scene as the following then takes place: ...|$|E
