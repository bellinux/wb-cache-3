I will <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> eyes and tell you that I'm not dumb enough or moronic enough to think that you are dumb or moronic enough not to see that I would have stolen a melody. If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only {{similarities}} are the chord progression. It's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist, it means I'm fucking smart. Sorry." ...|$|E

She returns {{to the store and}} finds the owner waiting for her. The store owner tells her that the [...] "mask" [...] is {{actually}} a real living face. All the masks in the back room are deformed, monstrous, living faces. The store owner made them, but they started out beautiful but then became hideous. Every so often, a person puts one on and the mask possesses them. It can only be removed by a [...] "symbol of love", but if it attaches itself to her or another person again, it will be forever. Carly Beth screams in horror, and the other masks begin to pursue her. While running away from the masks, she realizes that the mold her mother made is a symbol of love. Carly Beth finds the mold and uses it to deter the masks and remove the mask from her face. She returns home to her mother, tossing the mask away. Noah later bursts in and asks her, [...] "How do I <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mask?" ...|$|E
