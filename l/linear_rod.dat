The four essential septins form {{a complex}} containing {{two copies of}} each, but their arrangement was not known. Single-particle analysis by EM confirmed that the heterooligomer is octameric and revealed that the subunits are arrayed in a <b>linear</b> <b>rod.</b> Identity of each subunit was determined by examining complexes lacking a given septin, by antibody decoration, and by fusion to marker proteins (GFP or maltose binding protein). The rod has the order Cdc 11 –Cdc 12 –Cdc 3 –Cdc 10 –Cdc 10 –Cdc 3 –Cdc 12 –Cdc 11 and, hence, lacks polarity. At low ionic strength, rods assemble end-to-end to form filaments but not when Cdc 11 is absent or its N terminus is altered. Filaments invariably pair into long parallel “railroad tracks. ” Lateral association seems to be mediated by heterotetrameric coiled coils between the paired C-terminal extensions of Cdc 3 and Cdc 12 projecting orthogonally from each filament.

Mono-methyl alkanes {{can be found}} on the cuticles of insects and are believed to act as recognition pheromones in some social species, e. g. ants, wasps etc. The molecules were synthesized as pure S enantiomers and are (S) - 9 -methylpentacosane, C 26 H 54; (S) - 9 -methylheptacosane and (S) - 11 -methylheptacosane, C 28 H 58; (S) - 7 -methylnonacosane, (S) - 9 -methylnonacosane, (S) - 11 -methylnonacosane and (S) - 13 -methylnonacosane, C 30 H 62; and (S) - 9 -methylhentriacontane, C 32 H 66.

40|$|Septins are {{a family}} of {{eukaryotic}} GTP-binding proteins that associate into <b>linear</b> <b>rods,</b> which, in turn, polymerize end-on-end into filaments and further assemble into other, more elaborate super-structures at discrete subcellular locations. Hence, septin-based ensembles are considered elements of the cytoskeleton. One function of these structures that has been well-documented in studies conducted in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{to serve as a}} scaffold that recruits regulatory proteins, which dictate the spatial and temporal control of certain aspects of the cell division cycle. In particular, septin-associated protein kinases couple cell cycle progression with cellular morphogenesis. Thus, septin-containing structures serve as signaling platforms that integrate a multitude of signals and coordinate key downstream networks required for cell cycle passage. This review summarizes what we currently understand about how the action of septin-associated protein kinases and their substrates control information flow to drive the cell cycle into and out of mitosis, to regulate bud growth, and especially to direct timely and efficient execution of cytokinesis and cell abscission. Thus, septin structures represent a regulatory node at the intersection of many signaling pathways. In addition, and importantly, the activities of certain septin-associated protein kinases also regulate the state of organization of the septins themselves, creating a complex feedback loop...|$|R
40|$|Driven by the {{progress}} in nanotechnology, imaging and spectroscopy tools with nanometer spatial resolution {{are needed for}} in situ material characterizations. Near-field optics provides a unique way to selectively excite and detect elementary electronic and vibrational interactions at the nanometer scale, through interactions of light with matter in the near-field region. This dissertation discusses the development and applications of near-field optical imaging techniques, including plasmonic material characterization, optical spectral nano-imaging and magnetic field detection using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), and exploring new modalities of optical spectroscopy based on optical gradient force detection. Firstly, the optical dielectric functions {{of one of the}} most common plasmonic materials – silver is measured with ellipsometry, and analyzed with the Drude model over a broad spectral range from visible to mid-infrared. This work was motivated by the conflicting results of previous measurements, and the need for accurate values for a wide range of applications of silver in plasmonics, optical antennas, and metamaterials. This measurement provides a reference for dielectric functions of silver used in metamaterials, plasmonics, and nanophotonics. Secondly, I implemented an infrared s-SNOM instrument for spectroscopic nano-imaging at both room temperature and low temperature. As one of the first cryogenic s-SNOM instruments, the novel design concept and key specifications are discussed. Initial low-temperature and high-temperature performances of the instrument are examined by imaging of optical conductivity of vanadium oxides (VO 2 and V 2 O 3) across their phase transitions. The spectroscopic imaging capability is demonstrated on chemical vibrational resonances of Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and other samples. The third part of this dissertation explores imaging of optical magnetic fields. As a proof- of-principle, the magnetic near-field response of a <b>linear</b> <b>rod</b> antenna is studied with Babinet’s principle. Babinet’s principle connects the magnetic field of a structure to the electric field of its complement structure. Using combined far- and near-field spectroscopy, imaging, and theory, I identify magnetic dipole and higher order bright and dark magnetic resonances at mid-infrared frequencies. From resonant length scaling and spatial field distributions, I confirm that the theoretical requirement of Babinet’s principle for a structure to be infinitely thin and perfectly conducting is still fulfilled to a good approximation in the mid-infrared. Thus Babinet’s principle provides access to spatial and spectral magnetic field properties, leading to targeted design and control of magnetic optical antennas. Lastly, a novel form of nanoscale optical spectroscopy based on mechanical detection of optical gradient force is explored. It is to measure the optical gradient force between induced dipole moments of a sample and an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. My study provides the theoretical basis in terms of spectral behavior, resonant enhancement, and distance dependence of the optical gradient force from numerical simulations for a coupled nanoparticle model geometry. I show that the optical gradient force is dispersive for local electronic and vibrational resonances, yet can be absorptive for collective polaronic excitations. This spectral behavior together with the distance dependence scaling provides the key characteristics for its measurement and distinction from competing processes such as thermal expansion. Furthermore, I provide a perspective for resonant enhancement and control of optical forces in general...|$|E
40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) prepared from electroactive materials show great potential for multicolor display and white light source applications. Unfortunately, the commercialization of multilayer OLEDs has been slow. This can be attributed {{in part to the}} vapor deposition technique used to assemble small molecule thin films. The process is not amenable to large area displays and is relatively costly. An attractive alternative solution to this problem is to replace small molecules with organic polymers, which could be solution processed in an efficient and economical manner. Polymeric materials also offer the unique potential to achieve nanoscale self-assembled structures through their functional architecture. These materials can be solution processed and mimic multilayered small molecule devices to achieve improved performance and/or balanced color. Design and synthesis and OLED testing of functional polymers which can achieve defined multilayer or nanostructured film characteristics through simple solution processing is the focus of this thesis. 	In Chapter 1, the history of OLED materials as well as the device mechanism and key organic electronic characteristics necessary for high performance devices is introduced. There is also a discussion on the methods for device testing and characterization. 	The design and synthesis of novel dendronized linear polymer host materials is presented in Chapter 2. These polymers should possess a rigid <b>linear</b> <b>rod</b> like architecture which had not been investigated for its potential to order a thin film in an assembly of cylindrical structures. This host material was desired in order to optimize the interface of hole and electron transporting material to achieve improved recombination in the thin film. 	Similarly, in Chapter 3 a diblock copolymer architecture is studied as host material in OLED devices. In this work the differences between nanoscale self assembled diblock copolymers of hole and electron transporting units and random copolymers of the same composition are studied. These materials show a high external quantum efficiency of 5. 6 % for a simply prepared single layer device which is enabled by the self-assembly of the functional diblock copolymer architecture. 	In Chapter 4, these diblock copolymers are exploited not only to create nanoscale domains of hole and electron transporting domains but also to organize the site isolation of two different colored phosphorescent emitters. Polymerizable heteroleptic iridium complexes of different color were developed and covalently incorporated into separate blocks of the diblock copolymer. Following the self assembly of thin film morphology through simple spin coating, the energy transfer from blue to red emitters was greatly reduced enabling synergistic dual emission for white electroluminescence. 	Chapter 5 discusses the design and synthesis of electroactive crosslinked polymer nanoparticles with nanoscale size that can achieve the site isolation of emitters. Using different polymerizable iridium complexes, batches of different colored polymer nanoparticles can be simply prepared and mixed at the device preparation stage in any ratio to yield tunable colored devices. These nanoparticles dispersions behave as {{light emitting}} inks which can be simply solution processed with predictable and stable electroluminescent color. 	In Chapter 6, difunctional polymerizable iridium complexes are used to achieve multilayer structures of electron blocking layers and phosphorescent emissive layers. These small molecules can be solution processed to yield thin films which can be crosslinked through simple heating step. A subsequent layer can then be deposited on top to build up all solution processed multilayered devices. A select high triplet energy crosslinkable iridium complex was shown to perform well as an electron blocker and hole transporting layer in OLEDs with improved performance over the standard water soluble hole transporting layer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) ...|$|E

40|$|In certain {{industrial}} processes, such as undersea cable laying, a {{very long}} rod subject to remote axial tension and torque can form a self-contacting loop. An increase in remote tension under a fixed torque can draw the loop down in size until it becomes very small and then pulls apart. The very large local strains of the small loop can permanently damage the rod (e. g. through plastic deformation). In the cable laying industry, this process is known as hockling. This study uses the theory of <b>linear</b> elastic <b>rods</b> which can undergo shear and extensional deformations in addition to bending and twisting curvatures in order to solve approximately for the shape, force, and moments that occur during hockling. A new closed-form solution to the rod theory equations is developed and used to predict (at least approximately) the loops sizes and remote tensions that occur at the formation and pull apart of the contacting loop.
