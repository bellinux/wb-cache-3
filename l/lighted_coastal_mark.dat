50|$|When Finland gained its {{independence}} from Russia In 1917 dozens of QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt cannons were stationed in Finland. After the Finnish Civil War in 1918 around 35 - 40 Nordenfelt cannons became available to the Finnish army. These guns were later used as a standard <b>light</b> <b>coastal</b> gun of the Finnish coastal artillery and were in service until the 1950s. During World War II some of these guns were also used as fortification artillery and bunker guns in the Mannerheim Line.|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the older}} <b>light</b> <b>coastal</b> defenses, mainly {{consisting}} of old naval artillery, had been hastily built during World War II to meet an immediate need for short-range coastal defense but were past their useful age and had not been designed with nuclear weapons in mind. The 105 mm fully automatic gun system (105 mm tapj m/50) that was under construction {{at the time was}} plagued by manufacturer delays and other problems, so {{the decision was made to}} go for a lighter, simpler system that would be deployed for short-range defense of important points, while studying which alternative (conventional artillery, rocket artillery or missiles) would suit the need for heavier firepower.|$|R

25|$|By 1873, {{the year}} of the inaugural Intercolonial Coast Lighthouse Conference in Sydney, Queensland had 39 lights along its coastline. The conference was the first attempt to {{coordinate}} <b>coastal</b> <b>lights</b> and signals around Australia. Recommendations included the need for more <b>coastal</b> <b>lights</b> in Queensland. Although there was general agreement on the recommendations, there were no moves by any of the colonies to cede their control of lighthouses and other coastal signals to a centralised body or to adopt standardised designs for <b>coastal</b> <b>lights.</b> Lighthouse design continued to take into account local conditions and readily available building materials. Often the local materials were augmented with specialised fittings such as stairways, lantern rooms, lenses, and clock work mechanisms from overseas companies.|$|R

5000|$|From his {{collection}} {{stored in the}} Hidalgo Trading Company warehouse Doc uses a fast, silenced Motorboat, capable of self-righting itself after capsizing with a pop-up gun and tripod. The boat is described as being considered by the navy for the basis of [...] "a fleet of <b>light</b> <b>coastal</b> defense speedsters" [...] (similar to an armed Motor life boat in description). Last, and also from the warehouse, Doc again uses the Helldiver submarine (first seen in The Polar Treasure, June 1933). The Helldiver has many gadgets and experimental devices built into it. In this story the principle modifications are a mechanism to release a chemical similar to squid ink, external-viewing television screens and dial-based sonic devices allowing it to successfully navigate through New York harbor, and its traffic, while submerged.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1940, {{with many}} British field guns {{lost in the}} Battle of France, 895 M1897 field guns and a million rounds of {{ammunition}} were purchased from the US Army. For political purposes, the sale to the British Purchasing Commission was made through the US Steel Corporation. The basic, unmodified gun was known in British service as [...] "Ordnance, QF, 75mm Mk 1", {{although many of the}} guns were issued to units on converted or updated mountings. They were operated by field artillery and anti-tank units. Some of the guns had their wheels and part of their carriages cut away so that they could be mounted on a pedestal called a [...] "Mounting, 75mm Mk 1". These weapons were employed as <b>light</b> <b>coastal</b> artillery and were not declared obsolete until March 1945.|$|R

50|$|New coastal {{guns were}} {{developed}} with 100 TK turret gun replacing older <b>light</b> <b>coastal</b> guns and 130 TK medium turret gun complementing the older 152/50 T. Anti-ship missile battery {{was formed in}} the regiment in 1995 and anti-aircraft weaponry was also improved. A major change for signalling equipment was the adoption of digital messaging system. Training organization was changed when Gyltö became a conscript training center in 1967 and Utö and Örö were delegated to NCO and specialist training. The name of the regiment was changed to Turku Coastal Regiment (Turun Rannikkorykmentti) in 1990, and this name was used until the regiment was disbanded in 1998. Conscript training in Kuuskajaskari fort ended in 1997. Regiment received new ships to replace the old ones {{with the addition of}} supply ship Parainen in 1980 and minelayer Pyhäranta in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Bright {{city lights}} {{made it easier}} for German U-boats to spot targets at night, but local {{officials}} resisted suggestions that they follow London's lead and blackout the <b>lights</b> of <b>coastal</b> cities.

50|$|In 1930 the French Navy {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for a <b>light</b> <b>coastal</b> patrol seaplane mainly {{for use in the}} French colonies. Gourdou-Leseurre built and designed a prototype GL-831 HY which was a modification of the companies earlier GL-830 HY with a smaller Hispano-Suiza radial engine. The GL-831 HY first flew on 23 December 1931. In 1933 the French Navy ordered 22 aircraft designated GL-832 HY, this had a less powerful engine than the prototype. The GL-832 HY was a metal construction low-wing monoplane with fabric covered wings and twin floats. The aircraft had a large wing to take the stresses of a catapult launch, the wings also folded to allow stowage on board a ship. Unusually the braced-horizontal tailplane was attached to the underside of the rear fuselage. Two open cockpits in tandem were provided for the two crew, each cockpit having a windscreen. The first production aircraft flew on 17 December 1934 and the last on 12 February 1936.|$|R
