25|$|The {{transverse}} {{shuttle is}} a method to drive a bobbin on a sewing machine so as to create the <b>lockstitch</b> technique. Transverse shuttles carry the bobbin in a boat-shaped shuttle, and reciprocate the shuttle along a straight horizontal shaft. As the earliest of bobbin drivers, the transverse shuttle was patented by Elias Howe on September 10, 1846.|$|E
25|$|A rotary hook is a bobbin driver design used in <b>lockstitch</b> sewing {{machines}} of the 19th and 20th century and beyond. It triumphed over competing designs {{because it could}} run at higher speeds with less vibration. Rotary hook machines hold their bobbin stationary, and continuously rotate the thread hook around it. The rotary hook was co-invented by American cabinetmaker Allen B. Wilson and Nathaniel Wheeler in 1851. U.S. Patent # 8,296 was issued to Wilson on August 12, 1851.|$|E
25|$|A {{vibrating}} {{shuttle is}} a bobbin driver design used in home <b>lockstitch</b> sewing machines {{during the second}} half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. It supplanted the earlier transverse shuttle design invented by Elias Howe in 1846, but was itself supplanted by the rotary hook later on. American cabinetmaker Allen B. Wilson of Willet, New York invented the vibrating shuttle design in 1850. The owners of the 1848 Bradshaw patent claimed infringement by Wilson. However, it was without justication. In order to avoid a lawsuit, Wilson relinquished his interest in U.S. Patent #7,776 that was issued to him on November 12, 1850. A.P. Kline and Edward Lee took ownership.|$|E

50|$|Cable lacing uses a thin cord, {{traditionally}} made of waxed linen, to bind {{together a}} group of cables using a series of running <b>lockstitches.</b> Flat lacing tapes made of modern materials such as nylon, polyester, Teflon, fiberglass, and Nomex are also available {{with a variety of}} coatings to improve knot holding.|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard <b>lockstitching,</b> which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R
25|$|Most modern sewing {{machines}} use the <b>lockstitch</b> technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt, {{which consists of}} two threads, an upper and a lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a take-up arm, and finally {{through the hole in}} the needle. The lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine. Walter Hunt invented the first lock-stitch sewing machine in 1833. Hunt lost interest and did not patent his invention. In 1846, Elias Howe secured a patent on an original lock-stitch machine, and failed to manufacture and market it. Isaac Singer infringed on Howe's patent to make his own machine, making him wealthy. Elias Howe filed a lawsuit, alleging patent infringement. On July 1, 1854, a federal commission ruled in favor of Howe, ordering Isaac Singer as well as all sewing machine makers to pay Elias Howe royalties.|$|E
2500|$|The Singer Model 27 {{and later}} model 127 were {{a series of}} <b>lockstitch</b> sewing {{machines}} produced by the Singer Manufacturing Company from the 1880s to the 1960s. [...] (The 27 and the 127 were full-size versions of the Singer 28 and later model 128 which were three-quarter size). [...] They were Singer's first sewing machines {{to make use of}} [...] "vibrating shuttle" [...] technology. [...] Millions were produced. [...] They are all steel and were built before the advent of planned obsolescence, and so they were designed to be repaired rather than replaced. [...] Consequently many remain today, some in collections and others still in service. [...] In company literature they were called [...] "the woman's faithful friend the world over".|$|E
50|$|Throughout history, <b>lockstitch</b> sewing {{machines}} {{have used a}} variety of methods to drive their bobbins so as to create the <b>lockstitch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>lockstitch</b> is {{the most}} common {{mechanical}} stitch made by a sewing machine. The term [...] "single needle stitching", often found on dress shirt labels, refers to <b>lockstitch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plain {{stitches}} {{fall into}} four general categories: chainstitch, <b>lockstitch,</b> overlock, and coverstitch.|$|E

50|$|Most home sewing {{machines}} are <b>lockstitch</b> machines, although overlockers (aka sergers) {{have entered the}} home market {{in the past ten}} years or so.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lockstitch</b> is the {{familiar}} stitch performed by most household sewing machines and most industrial [...] "single needle" [...] sewing machines from two threads, one {{passed through a}} needle and one coming from a bobbin or shuttle. Each thread stays {{on the same side}} of the material being sewn, interlacing with the other thread at each needle hole by means of a bobbin driver. As a result, a <b>lockstitch</b> can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn; it does not need to be near an edge.|$|E
50|$|Of {{a typical}} garment factory's sewing {{machines}}, half might be <b>lockstitch</b> machines {{and the other}} half divided between overlock machines, chain stitch machines, and various other specialized machines.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial <b>lockstitch</b> {{machines}} with two needles, each forming an independent <b>lockstitch</b> {{with their own}} bobbin, are also very common. There are different types of <b>lockstitch</b> industrial machines. The most commonly used are the drop feed for light and medium duty, and walking foot for medium and heavy duty like the Class 7 with an impressive 3/4" [...] foot lift. This makes the Class 7 able to stitch through heavy materials up to 3/4" [...] with threads as strong as 57 lbs. Originally made by Singer in the US and Europe for supplying the demand of heavy duty clothing for the troops, for many {{years after the war}} this class was not available as new because the market was filled. With the outsourcing of many sewing manufacturing jobs, nowadays many Chinese Class 7 machines are available and built by Federal Specifications giving them equal performance to the original ones (FSN:3530-3111-1556, FSN: 3530-3111-3675, FSN: 3530-311-1556, FSN: 3530-3111-3075).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal <b>lockstitch,</b> construction stitches include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching. Seam types include the plain seam, zigzag seam, flat fell seam, French seam, and many others.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lockstitch</b> uses two threads, {{an upper}} and a lower. <b>Lockstitch</b> is {{so named because}} the two threads, upper and lower, [...] "lock" [...] (entwine) {{together}} in {{the hole in the}} fabric which they pass through. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, through the take-up arm, and finally {{through the hole in the}} needle. Meanwhile the lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine below the material.|$|E
50|$|A better stitch {{was found}} in the <b>lockstitch.</b> The chainstitch is still used today in {{clothing}} manufacture, though due to its major drawback it is generally paired with an overlock stitch along the same seam.|$|E
50|$|A zigzag stitch is variant {{geometry}} of the <b>lockstitch.</b> It is a back-and-forth stitch used where a straight stitch will not suffice, such as in reinforcing buttonholes, in stitching stretchable fabrics, and in temporarily joining two work pieces edge-to-edge.|$|E
50|$|The rotary hook (aka {{rotating}} hook) is a bobbin driver design used in <b>lockstitch</b> {{sewing machines}} of the 19th and 20th century and beyond. It triumphed over competing designs {{because it can}} run at higher speeds with less vibration.|$|E
50|$|The Singer Featherweight {{is a model}} {{series of}} <b>lockstitch</b> {{domestic}} sewing machines produced by the Singer Manufacturing Company from 1933 to 1968. They are significant among vintage sewing machines for their continuing popularity, active use by quilters, and high collector's value.|$|E
50|$|A zigzag stitch is {{a variant}} {{geometry}} of the <b>lockstitch.</b> It is a back-and-forth stitch used where a straight stitch will not suffice, such as in preventing raveling of a fabric, in stitching stretchable fabrics, and in temporarily joining two work pieces edge-to-edge.|$|E
50|$|A {{vibrating}} {{shuttle is}} a bobbin driver design used in home <b>lockstitch</b> sewing machines {{during the second}} half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. It supplanted earlier transverse shuttle designs, but was itself supplanted by rotating shuttle designs.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the nine}} patents pooled, three were {{particularly}} crucial: the <b>lockstitch,</b> the four-motion feed, {{and the combination}} of a vertical needle with horizontal sewing surface. In addition to its four member companies, dozens of other companies licensed its patents, for which they paid royalties and submitted annual production reports.|$|E
5000|$|Allen Benjamin Wilson (1824-1888) was an American {{inventor}} {{famous for}} designing, building and patenting {{some of the}} first successful sewing machines. [...] He invented both the vibrating and the rotating shuttle designs which, in turns, dominated all home <b>lockstitch</b> sewing machines. With various partners in the 19th century he manufactured reliable sewing machines using the latter shuttle type.|$|E
50|$|Chain stitch was the stitch used {{by early}} sewing machines; however, {{as it is}} easily unravelled from fabric, this was soon {{replaced}} with the more secure <b>lockstitch.</b> This ease of unraveling of the single-thread chain stitch, more specifically known as ISO 4915:1991 stitch 101, continues to be exploited for industrial purposes in the closure of bags for bulk products.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, the <b>lockstitch</b> {{is formed}} {{in the center of}} the {{thickness}} of the material—that is to say: ideally the upper thread entwines the lower thread in the middle of the material. The thread tension mechanisms, one for the upper thread and one for the lower thread, prevent either thread from pulling the entwine point from out of the middle of the material.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} create a <b>lockstitch</b> a sewing machine intertwines two threads: an upper thread (descending with the needle into the {{workpiece}} from above) and a lower thread (ascending into the workpiece from the bobbin below). To intertwine them, the machine must pass its shuttle (containing the bobbin and the lower thread) through a loop temporarily created from the upper thread.|$|E
5000|$|Zigzag stitch {{geometry}} {{is produced}} when the needle moves rhythmically {{side to side}} while stitching, while the feed dogs are following only in the normal forward [...] "four motion" [...] movement. Most <b>lockstitch</b> machines made after the 1960s {{are capable of doing}} this; older machines achieve the same stitch with a specialist presser foot which moves the fabric beneath the stationary needle.|$|E
5000|$|The Singer {{sewing machine}} {{was the first}} complex {{standardized}} technology to be mass marketed. It {{was not the first}} sewing machine, and its patent in 1851 led to a patent battle with Elias Howe, inventor of the <b>lockstitch</b> machine. This eventually resulted in a patent sharing accord among the major firms. [...] Marketing strategies included focusing on the manufacturing industry, gender identity, credit plans, and “hire purchases.” ...|$|E
50|$|Walter Hunt (July 29, 1796 - June 8, 1859) was an American mechanic. He {{was born}} in Martinsburg, New York. Through {{the course of his}} work he became renowned for being a {{prolific}} inventor, notably of the <b>lockstitch</b> sewing machine (1833), safety pin (1849), a forerunner of the Winchester repeating rifle, a successful flax spinner, knife sharpener, streetcar bell, hard-coal-burning stove, artificial stone, street sweeping machinery, and the ice plough.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vibrating}} shuttle was {{a significant}} innovation towards {{the goal of a}} simple, fast, and reliable <b>lockstitch</b> sewing machine, and the design remained popular for decades. Indeed, even twenty-five years later, on 10 October 1910, Singer was awarded US patent 1005177 for a new shuttle-ejector mechanism for it. (The improvement is one of those incorporated into the 'modernized' models 127 and 128 that replaced the 27 and 28.) ...|$|E
50|$|It was {{actually}} invented by Allen B. Wilson in 1850, {{just one year}} before he would invent the rotary hook design that would eventually prevail over all other <b>lockstitch</b> bobbin driver designs. Wilson's original patent is US patent 7776, granted 12 November 1850, with reissues RE345 on 22 January 1856 and RE414 on 9 December 1856. The second page of his patent, showing the shuttle in its arc, is shown at left.|$|E
