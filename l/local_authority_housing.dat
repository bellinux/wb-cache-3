5|$|In the 1930s and 1950s however massive {{programmes}} of state-sponsored {{house building}} saw {{thousands of new}} homes built in Coatbridge {{and some of the}} worst examples of slum housing were cleared away. By the early 1980s 85% of homes in Coatbridge were part of <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>housing</b> stock.|$|E
5|$|The built {{environment}} around Coatbridge's town centre is characterised by its mixture of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sandstone buildings and late twentieth-century precast concrete shops. The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>housing</b> buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E
25|$|In the South, most <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>housing</b> {{was sold}} {{off in the}} 1980s-90s under RTB (Right to buy scheme), so the {{remaining}} stock is small. Much social housing has also been transferred to housing associations.|$|E

25|$|The London Boroughs of Harrow and Brent contain {{significant}} Irish Traveller populations. In {{addition to}} those on various official sites {{there are a number}} who are settled in <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>housing.</b> These are mostly women who wish their children to have a chance at a good education. They and the children may or may not travel in the summer but remain in close contact with the wider Traveller community.|$|E
25|$|A large house-building {{programme}} {{was carried}} out {{with the intention of}} providing millions of people with high-quality homes. A housing bill passed in 1946 increased Treasury subsidies for the construction of <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>housing</b> in England and Wales. Four out of five houses constructed under Labour were council properties built to more generous specifications than before the Second World War, and subsidies kept down council rents. Altogether, these policies provided public-sector housing with its biggest-ever boost up until that point, while low-wage earners particularly benefited from these developments. Although the Attlee Government failed to meet its targets, primarily due to economic constraints, over a million new homes were built between 1945 and 1951 (a significant achievement under the circumstances) which ensured that decent, affordable housing was available to many low-income families for the first time ever.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the town}} is a planned 19th-century development. In 1906, a new Royal National Lifeboat Institution {{boathouse}} and slipway was inaugurated near Scrabster Harbour. A fire on 10 December 1956 destroyed the building and its 47ft Watson-class lifeboat and a new building and boat was built, launched the following year. A new lifeboat, named [...] "The Three Sisters" [...] was inaugurated in 1971 by The Queen Mother. A major expansion occurred in the mid-20th century when the Dounreay nuclear power plant was established at Dounreay in 1955, [...] to the west {{of the town}}. The arrival of workers related to the power station caused a three-fold increase in the population of Thurso; the 1951 census gave a figure of 3,000 but this had swelled to 9,000 by 1971. This led to around 1,700 new houses being built in Thurso and nearby Castletown, a mixture of <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>housing</b> blended with private houses and flats built by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Decommissioned at the end of the 20th century, it is estimated the site will not be cleared of all the waste until the 2070s, so will continue to provide employment.|$|E

[...] Only {{two miles from the}} coast, Broughton Moor is situated on a ridge overlooking the Solway Firth to the north with superb views and spectacular sunsets over the Galloway Hills, while to the south there is the incomparable vista of the Lakeland Fells. There is a mix of privately owned and <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>housing</b> and a blend of social groups. Nowadays the local coal mines have closed, and after extensive opencast mining in recent years the land has reverted to its former agricultural state. The majority of the workforce are employed outside the village in surrounding towns and industries.|$|E
