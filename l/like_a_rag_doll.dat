5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While they go through the area on their own, Gary is lifted off the ground and shaken <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E

60|$|The {{carriage}} {{itself was}} {{of the kind that}} are sold in toy shops, and it was drawn by two horses standing upon wooden platforms with rollers underneath, so that instead of the horses themselves running, the wheels of the platforms whirled around, taking the carriage wherever the driver might direct. This driver looked for all the world <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> dressed in a coachman's uniform. His neck was rather weak, and that caused his head to lean slightly to one side, giving him a somewhat broken-down appearance; but he held the reins firmly in his stuffed hands and looked straight ahead, like a well-trained servant.|$|E
50|$|The term ragdoll {{comes from}} the problem that the {{articulated}} systems, due {{to the limits of}} the solvers used, tend to have little or zero joint/skeletal muscle stiffness, leading to a character collapsing much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> toy <b>rag</b> <b>doll,</b> often into comically improbable or compromising positions.|$|R
60|$|The {{first time}} I {{came down the}} trail and peeked through the oval frame of bushes, I saw him; and the very first glimpse made me jump {{at the thought of}} what a {{wonderful}} discovery I had made, namely, that little herons play with dolls, as children do. But I was mistaken. Quoskh had been catching frogs and hiding them, one by one, as I came along. He heard me before I knew he was there, and jumped for his last frog, a big fat one, with which he slanted up heavily on broad vans--with a hump on his back and a crook in his neck and his long legs trailing below and behind--towards his nest in the hemlock, beyond the beaver pond. When I saw him plainly he was just crossing the oval frame through which I looked. He had gripped the frog across the middle in his long beak, much as one would hold it with a pair of blunt shears, swelling it out at either side, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> string tied tight about a pillow. The head and short arms were forced up at one side, the limp legs dangled down on the other, looking for all the world <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stuffed <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> that Quoskh was carrying home for his babies to play with.|$|R

5000|$|The Saint has {{demonstrated}} {{a degree of}} superhuman strength. For example, when hit by the vampire Cassidy in a speeding truck the Saint did not budge and the truck was flipped. When Jesse Custer tried to {{put his hand on}} the Saint's shoulder the Saint of Killers flung him several feet <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll.</b> While possessing these abilities, he apparently has the power to enter and leave Heaven at will, although it is not known whether or not he could similarly travel to Hell. Several other transportation abilities have been suggested in his possession, due to him threatening to [...] "Kill his way across half Creation"; albeit he had to commandeer a ship to travel from America to France.|$|E
50|$|Ragamuffin can {{at first}} sight look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> with worms for hair and {{polyester}} filling, {{but he has a}} very interesting background story and personality.Ragamuffin was a 400-year-old (as mentioned in issue #13) immortal vampire who fed upon the flesh of the living. One night he attacked a young woman and ate her, but unfortunately, her sister, who happened to be a powerful witch, witnessed the scene. The witch cursed him and transformed him into a doll. A drop of Lenore's blood eventually returned him to consciousness, but since her blood was mixed with embalming fluid the curse was only partially lifted: he will never cease to be a doll. (He was briefly transformed back into his body at the end of issue #11, but returned to his rag doll form in the last frame of issue #12).|$|E
5000|$|Most reviews {{have been}} negative: for example, the {{president}} of the Australian Medical Association, Steve Hambleton, said: [...] "Last time I saw a kid with measles with the rash they were carried into the surgery and the child looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll.</b> The mother was terrified. It's still fatal. About one in 10,000 children will die because of encephalitis". [...] "Even in 'industrialized countries', measles can cause encephalitis, seizures, blindness, heart and nervous system disorders, and (rarely) death". Dr. David Gorski, a renowned doctor, writes: [...] "I'm sure children with whooping cough who are coughing so hard that they can't catch their breath for hours on end, with haemophilus influenzae type B who develop pneumonia or meningitis, with polio who develop paralysis, or with measles who develop pneumonia or subacute sclerosing panencephalitis will feel happy to 'embrace childhood disease', at least those who don't end up dead, who can't embrace anything other than the grave." [...] William Sears says: [...] "Complications of the disease include pneumonia and encephalitis, swelling of the brain, that can result in deafness or mental retardation. I've seen a case of measles encephalitis and it's not pretty. There's nothing awesome about it at all".|$|E

5000|$|On Halloween, Red {{shows up}} at the Coslaws with some fortuitous news: He has won a romantic getaway to New York, but since he {{separated}} from his wife, he gives the tickets to Nan and Bob. Questioned by Marty and Jane, Red reveals that he bought the tickets as a ruse to get their parents to safety. With the now full moon in the sky, they head inside to wait for the werewolf. Despite their best efforts, the three fall asleep and are startled awake when Red (who has fallen asleep with a lit cigarette in his fingers), burns himself, jumps up and drops the gun, nearly setting it off. Red begins to doubt that the werewolf is real, much less going to show up, and orders Marty and Jane to bed. Jane suddenly screams in horror as she sees the werewolf looking at her from the living room window, although when Red looks he finds nothing. Red starts to think that he is being fooled by the children and unloads the pistol. At that moment the werewolf tears the power cables out of the box and cuts the power to the house, leaving the trio with only the light from the fireplace. The werewolf then smashes through the wall of the house, attacking them. Despite Red's best efforts he is tossed around <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> and Jane is suspended in midair. Marty manages to retrieve the cartridge (which was tossed around in the melee and had fallen through a heating vent in the floor) and shoots the werewolf in the right eye with the silver bullet. The corpse turns back into Reverend Lowe and has one last spasm before dying. Afterwards Marty and Jane both say, [...] "I love you" [...] and the narrator then says that she too can now say it.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> is <b>a</b> children's toy. It is a cloth figure, a doll {{traditionally}} home-made from (and stuffed with) spare {{scraps of}} material. They {{are one of}} the most ancient children's toys in existence; the British Museum has <b>a</b> Roman <b>rag</b> <b>doll,</b> found in <b>a</b> child's grave dating from the 1st-5th century AD. Amish dolls are a type of traditional American <b>rag</b> <b>dolls</b> which originated as children's toys among the Old Order Amish people. The best-known type have no facial features. Today, many <b>rag</b> <b>dolls</b> are commercially produced to simulate the features of the original home-made dolls, such as simple features, soft cloth bodies, and patchwork clothing.|$|R

At the time, Strawberry Shortcake resembled <b>a</b> typical <b>rag</b> <b>doll,</b> complete with freckles, a mop of red yarn curls, and a bonnet with strawberry prints on it. Cindy Mayer Patton and Janet Jones designed the other later characters of the classic Strawberry Shortcake line.
