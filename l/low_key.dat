As there were no international matches during the summer, the Test players were available for the whole campaign.

5|$|Catholic worship was {{deliberately}} <b>low</b> <b>key,</b> {{usually in the}} private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.|$|E

5|$|The Kirk had {{considerable}} {{control over the}} lives of the people, with {{a major role in the}} Poor Law and schools and over the morals of the population. Strict Sabbatarianism was vital to Presbyterianism. The sermon was seen as central and the only participation by the congregation the singing of the psalms. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals as part of a communion season. In the second half of the century there were a series of reforms of church music connected to a choir movement. Episcopalians installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches. Catholic worship was deliberately <b>low</b> <b>key,</b> with musical accompaniment prohibited.|$|E

Johnston bowled four wicketless overs in the second innings as Australia {{completed}} victory without needing to bat for a second time. In the second match, he signed off on his tour in a <b>low</b> <b>key</b> manner, taking a wicket in each innings to end with a match total of 2/48 as Australia completed another innings triumph.|$|E
50|$|A spinet built c.1700 whose <b>lowest</b> <b>key</b> {{is marked}} “C.A.” has been {{attributed}} to Aston; this instrument is currently part of the Richard Burnett Heritage Collection. It has the range GG/BB-d΄΄΄ (4½ octaves), with a broken octave. This compass is very common in spinets made between 1690 and 1710. The natural keys are covered with ebony, while the sharps are solid ivory. Overall the instrument is similar to those made by John Player.|$|R

5|$|Filming began October 2000. From {{the onset}} of filming, {{difficulties}} with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter Tony Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. A particular point of contention {{with regard to the}} original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were <b>low</b> <b>key,</b> they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.|$|E

50|$|A {{transitional}} stage {{toward the}} final adoption of chromatic keyboards {{was seen in}} certain English virginals of the later 17th century.

50|$|The master crook and coupler system {{presented}} some problems. In high keys {{the instrument}} was uncomfortably close to the face, while in <b>low</b> <b>keys,</b> so many pieces needed to be added that the instrument could become unstable, adversely affecting {{the accuracy of the}} playing. Moreover, the instrument became so long that it was sometimes difficult to reach the bell for hand-stopping, a technique for lowering the pitch of individual notes a semitone or more. This important innovation had been introduced around 1720, and codified by Anton Hampel of Dresden in about 1750, so that the horn could be played chromatically.|$|R

However, O'Sullivan is not deterred from performing them, commenting that she sings them in the <b>lowest</b> <b>key</b> possible for her voice to retain the drama and tone of the originals, while finding a character within the song that she can inhabit, such as the prostitute and sailor in 'Amsterdam'.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rationale}} behind this system {{was that the}} low notes F and G are seldom needed in early music. Deep bass notes typically form {{the root of the}} chord, and F and G chords were seldom used at this time. In contrast, low C and D, both roots of very common chords, are sorely missed if a harpsichord with <b>lowest</b> <b>key</b> E is tuned to match the keyboard layout. When scholars specify the pitch range of instruments with this kind of short octave, they write [...] "C/E", meaning that the lowest note is a C, played on a key that normally would sound E.|$|R

The application of a set of macroalgal morpho-functional parameters and indices gives grounds to rank the investigated sites by their eutrophication status as follows: the Channel area and cape Gala with the highest eutrophication level, and the Traka transect with the <b>lowest.</b> <b>Key</b> words: active surface parameters, eutrophication, macrophytobentho...|$|R
