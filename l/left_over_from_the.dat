5|$|It was {{formerly}} {{thought that the}} dust was <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> formation of the cluster, but {{at the age of}} about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by radiation pressure. Instead, it seems that the cluster is simply passing through a particularly dusty region of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The Epsilon Eridani {{system also}} {{includes}} two belts of rocky asteroids: at about 3AU and 20AU from the star. The orbital structure could be maintained by a hypothetical second planet, which if confirmed would be Epsilon Eridani c.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E
50|$|Siamese was {{released}} in Sweden by Vertigo. Vertigo followed up with a translation of Sauermugg in April 2007. This edition, however, was different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian original. It included some of the later published Sauermugg-monologues, together with <b>left</b> <b>overs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> time the book was written, about 50 pages of new material all together. The expanded edition was entitled Sauermugg Redux. Siamese has since been translated into Danish, Czech and English.|$|R

5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall {{was a result of}} unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E

Albania {{did not end}} its state of war with Greece, <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania (known to Greeks as Northern Epirus) as well as Greece's status as a NATO member state.|$|E
50|$|The Super 9‘s {{were the}} first Triumphs to use 12-volt {{electrics}} (early Southern Cross’s still used 6-volt for a short period) {{and the first to}} be fitted with a Coventry Climax engine, which was made under licence by Triumph. Two 6-volt batteries were housed under the rear passenger floor, while the prototype had a single 12-volt battery on the bulk head.

5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the faith of both services in ASDIC proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a refocusing on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> First World War, due in part to a wish to economise and the fact no order had been given to dispose of them.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the loss of}} life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in Southeast Asia. Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post-Cold War years. <b>Left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cold War are numbers stations, which are shortwave radio stations thought to be used to broadcast covert messages, some of which can still be heard today.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E

5|$|Krueger {{retired to}} San Antonio, Texas, where, in February 1946, {{he bought a}} house for the first time. Because of a large income tax bill <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war, {{he was unable to}} buy it {{outright}} and so some of his friends established the Krueger Fund Committee, which paid for much of the house. In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and Bexar County.|$|E

There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.|$|E

5|$|The Sweet Escape is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Gwen Stefani, {{released}} on December 1, 2006 by Interscope Records. Having originally intended to return to No Doubt after her debut solo album, Love. Angel. Music. Baby.

The album musically resembles its predecessor while exploring more modern pop sounds. It was released to generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, receiving criticism for its strong similarities to Love. Angel. Music. Baby.|$|E
5|$|The various {{planets are}} thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the {{disc-shaped}} cloud of gas and dust <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun's formation. The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar. Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of ~10kilometres (km) in size. These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year {{over the course of the}} next few million years.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, and with the dissolution of her third marriage, Kalep began a new business venture in the American toy market. She designed a doll named Patsie Parachute which, when thrown into the air, would fall down slowly as a parachutist would. The dolls were produced in a New York factory where Kalep herself was forced to work to sustain the business. Her health deteriorated, however, and her profits from the business were spent almost entirely on medical costs; {{she was forced to}} close the factory in 1946. She had recovered by 1950 and made a living by selling patents for toy designs to larger businesses. One of her successful designs was Scribbles Dolls—toy dolls with blank faces that could be individually decorated by children—which was inspired by the 50,000 doll heads she had <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> closure of the Patsie Parachute factory.|$|E
50|$|When Changampuzha {{joined the}} preparatory {{class in the}} primary school at Edappally, Raghavan Pillai was {{studying}} in the second form. Because of this seniority he did not mingle with Changampuzha. Changampuzha also had started writing small poems by this time. Ragavan Pillai {{did not want to}} recognise this talent of Changampuzha. Thus he started ridiculing him through poems. Changampuzha's grand mother was a maid servant at the Edappally Palace. So naturally she used to bring home <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>overs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Palace. This issue was highlighted in the poems written by Raghavan Pillai, which made Changampuzha uneasy. Both behaved as enemies and used every situation to defeat each other.|$|R

5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E
5|$|Since Innogy plc {{was taken}} over by RWE in 2002, the site has been owned by RWE Npower. The only {{substantial}} structures remaining are the National Grid and NEDL substations.

The site of the main station buildings is currently covered in crushed concrete, <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> demolition process. Underground workings, such as tunnels and culverts, also still exist on the site. The coal storage area to the north has been tarmaced and ash settling ponds have been filled with concrete.

5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer overflow.|$|E
