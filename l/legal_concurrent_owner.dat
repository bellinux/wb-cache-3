The {{possession}} of luxury counterfeits {{is due to}} a number of factors extensively assessed by the extant literature (i. e. products attributes, socio-demographic factors, personality traits). This paper investigates how the conceptualization of luxury value (social, functional, and identity value) affects the {{possession of}} counterfeits. The empirical study compares original <b>owners</b> and <b>concurrent</b> <b>owners</b> (i. e. consumer who own both original and counterfeits). The results show that <b>concurrent</b> <b>owners</b> – unlike original owners – appreciate the social value of luxury and they do not search for a functional value in luxury.

40|$|AbstractManipulation of {{pointers}} in {{shared data}} structures {{is an important}} communication mechanism used in many parallel algorithms. Indeed, many fundamental algorithms do essentially nothing else. Aparallel pointer machine(or PPM) is a parallel model having pointers as its principal data type. PPMs have been characterized as PRAMs obeying two restrictions—first, restricted arithmetic capabilities and, second, the CROW memory access restriction (<b>concurrent</b> read, <b>owner</b> write, a commonly occurring special case of CREW). We present results concerning the relative power of PPMs (and other arithmetically restricted PRAMs) versus CROW PRAMs having ordinary arithmetic capabilities. First, we prove lower bounds separating PPMs from CROW PRAMs. For example, any step-by-step simulation of ann-processor CROW PRAM by a PPM requires timeΩ(loglogn) per step. Second, we show that this lower bound is tight— we give such a step-by-step simulation using O(loglogn) time per step. As a corollary, we obtain sharply improved PPM algorithms {{for a variety of}} problems, including deterministic context-free language recognition...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} evaluating a Boolean function on PRAMs. We exhibit a Boolean function f: { 0, 1 } n → { 0, 1 } that can be evaluated in time O(log log n) on a deterministic CROW (<b>Concurrent</b> Read <b>Owner</b> Write) PRAM, but requires time Ω(log n) on EROW (Exclusive Read Owner Write) PRAMs. Our lower bound also holds for randomized Monte Carlo EROW PRAMs. This Boolean function {{is derived from the}} well-known pointer chasing problem, and was first defined by Nisan and Bar-Yossef [11]. Our lower bound improves a special case of the previous result of Nisan and Bar-Yossef, who proved Ω (√ log n) lower bound for this function on deterministic EREW PRAMs (and hence for EROW PRAMs). Our result is the first to achieve the best possible separation between the computational power of CROW and EROW PRAMs for functions on complete domains (Boolean or non-Boolean), improving previous results [7, 6, 11]. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a variant}} of the CREW PRAM model introduced by Dymond and Ruzzo called CROW (<b>Concurrent</b> Read <b>Owner</b> Write) PRAM. in which each global memory location may only be written by its assigned owner processor. We show that CROW PRAMs can sort in O(log n) parallel time using O(n log n) processors. 1 Introduction The PRAM (Parallel Random Access Machine) model for parallel computation was introduced as "a collection of synchronous processors executing in parallel and communicating via a global shared memory" by Fortune and Wyllie [FW 78]. Their model satisfies the CREW (Concurrent-Read, Exclusive Write) convention for accesses to global memory. Dymond and Ruzzo proposed a natural and frequently occurring restriction of the CREW PRAM, called CROW (Concurrent Read Owner-Write) PRAM machines, for which each global memory location is assigned a unique owner processor and the owner is the only processor allowed to write into that cell throughout the course of a computation [D [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{identify}} and study {{a natural and}} frequently occurring subclass of Concurrent Read, Exclusive Write Parallel Random Access Machines (CREW-PRAMs). Called <b>Concurrent</b> Read, <b>Owner</b> Write, or CROW-PRAMs, these are machines in which each global memory location is assigned a unique “owner ” processor, {{which is the only}} processor allowed to write into it. Considering the difficulties that would be involved in physically realizing a full CREW-PRAM model, it is interesting to observe that in fact, most known CREW-PRAM algorithms satisfy the CROW restriction or can be easily modified to do so. This paper makes three main contributions. First, we formally define the CROW-PRAM model and demonstrate its stability under several definitional changes. Second, we precisely characterize the power of the CROW-PRAM by showing that the class of languages recognizable by it in time O(log n) (and implicitly with a polynomial number of processors) is exactly the class LOGDCFL of languages log space reducible to deterministic context-free languages. Third, using the same basic machinery, we show that the recognition problem for deterministic context-free languages can be solved quickly on a deterministic auxiliary pushdown automaton having random access to its input tape, a log n space work tape, and pushdown store of small maximum height. For example, time O(n 11 e) is achievable with pushdown height O(log 2 n) ...|$|R

As the product life cycle becomes shortened, high product quality becomes necessary for survival. Markets become highly diversified and global, and continuous and unexpected change become the key factors for success. The need for a method of rapidly and cost-effectively developing products, production facilities and supporting software, including design, process planning and shop ¯ oor control system {{has led to the}} concept of agile manufacturing. Agile manufacturing can be defined as the capability to survive and prosper in a competitive environment of continuous and unpredictable change by reacting quickly and effectively to changing markets, driven by customer-designed products and services. This article details the key concepts and enablers of agile manufacturing. The key enablers of agile manufacturing include: (i) virtual enterprise formation tools/metrics; (ii) physically distributed manufacturing architecture and teams; (iii) rapid partnership formation tools/metrics; (iv) concurrent engineering; (v) integrated product/production/business information system; (vi) rapid prototyping tools; and (vii) electronic commerce. A conceptual framework for the development of an agile manufacturing system and future research directions are presented in this paper.

40|$|Workflow {{has become}} an {{important}} paradigm for distributed data and computing systems {{in a wide range}} of application areas. An important challenge in workflow management is the scheduling of actions of concurrent tasks. This requires specifying the <b>legal</b> schedules of <b>concurrent</b> actions, and generating control mechanisms to ensure correct, efficient executions. Workflow scheduling is particularly difficult because the constraints between tasks are application-specific, and task autonomy may place certain actions outside the control or observation of the scheduler. We use techniques from supervisory control theory of discrete event systems to generate workow scheduling controllers automatically. We specify tasks and intertask constraints as finite state automata, characterizing some transitions as outside the control or observation of the workflow scheduler. Applying the techniques of supervisory control theory to these specifications, we can automatically determine the existence of schedulers. In ca [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The way we consume media {{today is}} vastly {{different}} from the way media was consumed in 1976, when the Copyright Act created the compulsory license for cable systems. The compulsory license allowed cable systems, as defined by the Copyright Act, to pay a set fee for the right to air television programming rather than working out individual deals with each group that owned the copyright in the programming, and helped make television more widely accessible to the viewing public.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the case of}} indigenous privatization of the important fodder tree samata (Euphorbia stenoclada) and <b>concurrent</b> <b>legal</b> curtailment of this privatization among the Tanalana people of southwest Madagascar from a long-term perspective. Applying a framework for institutional change to empirical data derived from interviews conducted in 20 villages in the Mahafaly Plateau region, the study explores the process and mechanisms involved in creating and asserting private property rights to this common pool resource on the one hand, {{and the process of}} curtailment on the other. Implementation of the curtailing institutions is hampered by (1) the low bargaining power of village communities versus privatizers, which stems from the users’ preference for avoiding open conflicts and laissez faire ideology, (2) the low social acceptance and internalization of new curtailment rules, which are perceived as contradictory to customary resource privatization rights and the ideology of personal freedom restricted only by ancestral rules-in-use, and (3) ineffective self-governance and enforcement mechanisms based on pro-active monitoring of local users. Stressing the interplay between ideology and bargaining power in the context-specific constellation of actors, this paper contributes {{to the understanding of the}} transformation of property rights and institutional change in self-organized, traditional societies...|$|R
40|$|When Congress {{passed the}} Visual Artists Rights Act (2 ̆ 2 VARA 2 ̆ 2) in 1990, it {{introduced}} into our federal law concepts {{that had been}} shut out of Anglo-American intellectual property law for over 200 years. VARA gives visual artists the right of attribution, i. e., {{the right to have}} their work properly attributed to them, and the right of integrity, i. e., the right to not have their work altered or destroyed without their permission. While others have studied the history of Anglo-American copyright from the advent of the printing press, they make few references to the type of rights granted by VARA. To fill that gap, this article retraces the history of Anglo-American intellectual property law, analyzing how VARA rights fit into it. In particular, while analyzing the key Eighteenth Century English statutes and cases, this article pinpoints the moment in the evolution of Anglo-American law when the English judges effectively lopped off the branch of intellectual property law that soon after bloomed in France into the droit moral or 2 ̆ 2 moral rights. 2 ̆ 2 The timing of this <b>legal</b> development (and <b>concurrent</b> political developments) ensured that the intellectual property laws of the new United States would contain the English emphasis on economic protection and ignore the protection for the creative process that developed soon after in France.

It first appeared at [URL] The majority of dogs with diabetes mellitus develop blinding mature cataracts through {{the action of the}} enzyme aldose reductase producing sorbitol with osmotic action drawing water into the lens thus causing opacification. Here we evaluate the use of OcuGLO™ a formulation including the aldose reductase inhibitor alpha lipoic acid, grapeseed extract, carotenoids, omega- 3 -fatty acids, and coenzyme Q 10 in the prevention of canine diabetic cataract in a prospective placebo-controlled double-masked study. Materials and methods: Dogs with diabetes mellitus but as yet without the development of blinding diabetic cataracts were given either OcuGLO™ or a placebo containing antioxidant vitamins. Dogs were examined monthly and their degree of lens opacification documented photographically using a Genesis D fundus camera at + 10 D. Time to progression of lens opacification was documented and compared between the OcuGLO™ group and the placebo group, using Kaplan Meier survival curve statistics Results: Mean time without change in lens opacification was 278 ± 184 days with OcuGLO Rx™ and 77 ± 40 days in the placebo group this difference being statistically significant at p= 0. 0005. Twelve of 15 dogs taking the placebo developed significantly increased lens opacification while 5 of 15 dogs taking OcuGLO Rx™ developed significant cataract. of these five dogs four animals did not receive daily OcuGLO Rx™ as directed due to unrelated <b>concurrent</b> illness or <b>owner</b> non-compliance. The remaining dog progressed despite Ocu-GLO Rx™ administration. In two dogs, diabetic cataract was reversed with regained vision on Ocu-GLO Rx™. Discussion: This small preliminary study demonstrates that oral Ocu-GLO Rx™ has beneficial effects in delaying cataract formation in dogs with diabetes mellitus. We look forward to further studies with larger case populations but note that the statistical significance reached between placebo and supplement-treated group, even with a small study population, demonstrates the efficacy of this commercially available dietary supplement...|$|R
40|$|In this book, Ellen Vos {{analyses}} {{the emergence}} of EC product safety regulation, which is explained as a reaction both to spill-over effects of the internal market policy, and to growing societal concerns regarding health and safety protection. Due to factors such as mutual distrust between the Member States, the 'post-Maastricht' Community is increasingly required to play a direct role in health and safety regulation. This has confronted the Community with regulatory problems relating to the assessment and management of risks. This book seeks to identify {{the principles of the}} resulting Community approach to risk regulation. It first elaborates the fundamental EU law concepts of competence, institutional balance, subsidiarity, and delegation of powers in relation to health and safety. These legal concepts are then used to appraise the legality and the legitimacy of the three basic regulatory patterns typical of the Community approach to science-based decision-making: resorting to committees (in the food sector), to agencies (pharmaceuticals), and to private bodies (standardisation). Ellen Vos concludes that, to date, Community risk regulation is pragmatic but lacks a coherent regulatory model. •	Introduction: regulating risk; dealing with risk under community law; regulatory models - committees, agencies and private bodies. •	Part 1 The community's involvement in health and safety regulations: {{the emergence of}} community health and safety regulation; community competence and its <b>legal</b> basis; <b>concurrent</b> powers between the community and the member states. •	Part 2 Deepening of community health and safety regulation: deepening of community involvement in health and safety regulation - towards community implementation; the relationship between community legislation and implementation; the implications of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality for the deepening of community activities in health and safety regulation; the institutional balance of powers; difficulties flowing from the increasing reliance on the commission in health and safety regulation. •	Part 3 Health and safety regulation through committees - the case of foodstuffs: the rise of committees within the community's institutional structure; the competence of the community to create committees; committees and the institutional balance of powers; health and safety regulation through committees - the case of foodstuffs. •	Part 4 Health and safety regulation through agencies - the case of pharmaceuticals: the rise of agencies within the community's institutional structure; the competence to establish agencies under the treaty provisions; health and safety regulation through agencies - the case of pharmaceuticals; delegation of powers to the European standardisation bodies?; legitimacy of decision-making and standard-setting. •	Part 5 Health and safety regulation through private bodies - the case of technical product standards: health and safety regulation through private bodies - the case of technical product standards. •	Conclusion; community health and safety regulation through committees, agencies and private bodies; in search of legitimate community health and safety regulation; towards a theoretical conceptualisation of community risk regulation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to examine three inter-connected themes which have emerged in the evolutionary development of the Union as an international actor. The first theme relates {{to the relationship between}} internal and external powers and policies. The degree to which the Union’s external powers reflect or mirror internal competence is not only a question of their extent; it extends to the objectives and content of the policies pursued by the Union internally and externally; the nature or fundamental legal characteristics of the external dimension to the Union legal order. To what extent are external powers an extension of internal powers and objectives? The expansion of the scope and extent of the Union’s external powers (whether express or implied) has of course reflected not only the expansion of areas of activity internally but also the changing preoccupations of the Union, in particular as regards its place in the world. It is also true that external commitments and activity are having an increasing impact on the development of internal policies. As always within the Community and Union systems, issues of competence are intimately connected with both the inter-institutional and the institution–Member State balance of power. The second theme of this chapter traces how the classic approach to pre-emption, whereby the occupation of a field of legislative activity by the Community <b>legal</b> order excludes <b>concurrent</b> Member State competence, has given way to a wide acceptance of shared powers in external and internal spheres of competence, as well as the legal principles and structural solutions by which shared competence is managed. The emergent international identity of the Union and the factors that shape it form the third theme. A number of factors are at play here, including constitutional constraints on Union competence, the essential autonomy of the Union legal order within the wider context of international law and legal relations, the raised profile (and raised expectations) of the Union especially through the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the complexity of relations between the ‘Pillars’ between 1993 and 2009 and the legacy of the Pillars present in the Union’s constitutional structure following the Treaty of Lisbon. The evolution of the Union as an effective international actor will depend on the emergence of sufficiently flexible and robust internal constitutional structures. Amid the angst over policy fragmentation, the failure of the Constitutional Treaty, and the lack of institutional cohesion, it is possible to see a process of integration in the formation of an international identity for the Union. The terms ‘integration’ and ‘identity’ are not, however, intended to imply a monolithic structure. Highly diverse patterns of decision-making, different power-structures between the actors involved (Member States, Commission, Council, European Council, European Parliament), the wide variety of (formal and informal, binding and non-binding) instruments used, the connections between external policies and between internal and external aspects of policies, are all elements of a complex multi-dimensional construction. The complexity and diversity are necessary but need to operate within a framework which manages to be both flexible and coherent, and this chapter will end by assessing some {{of the ways in which}} the most recent Treaty reform process responds to this need...|$|R
