50|$|Hence {{by means}} of such {{impressive}} literally 'lateral thinking', rather than the dynamics of pendulum motion being conceived of as the bob inexplicably somehow falling downwards compared to the vertical to a gravitationally lowest point and then inexplicably being pulled back up again on the same upper side of that point, rather it was its lateral horizontal motion that was conceived of as a case of gravitational free-fall followed by violent motion in a recurring cycle, with the bob repeatedly travelling through and beyond the motion's vertically lowest but horizontally middle point that stood proxy for {{the centre of the}} Earth in the tunnel pendulum. So on this imaginative <b>lateral</b> gravitational <b>thinking</b> outside the box the lateral motions of the bob first towards and then away from the normal in the downswing and upswing become lateral downward and upward motions in relation to the horizontal rather than to the vertical.|$|R

For the effective use of such group decision‐making situations, management must go beyond the assumptions and rational decision models of accountants and economists. While rationality, decision process steps, programmable decisions and statistical approaches can be most usefully considered, also important are the role of personal values in the decision‐making process, occupational identification, bias in thinking, rationalisation instead of rationality, the role of independent critical thinking, the problems of “group think”, <b>lateral</b> versus vertical <b>thinking</b> and the required conditions for group creativity...|$|R

40|$|BrainMining is {{a theory}} of {{creative}} thinking that shows how we should exploit the mind’s spontaneous natural disposition to use old solutions to address new problems – our Anchoring Cognitive Bias. BrainMining develops a simple and straightforward method to transform recalcitrant problems into types of problems which we have solved before, and then apply an old type of solution to them. The transformation makes the <b>thinking</b> <b>lateral</b> by matching up disparate types of problem and solution. It emphasises the role of emotive judgements that the agent makes, when she discerns whether a change of the values or the emotions and feelings in a situation, which would expand the space of solutions available for the problem at hand, would be acceptable or appropriate in the situation. A lateral solution for an intractable problem is thus spontaneously brainmined from the agent’s old solutions, to solve a transformed version of the intractable problem, possibly involving changes in the value system or the emotional profile of the situation, which the agent judges, emotively, will be acceptable, and even appropriate in the circumstances...|$|R

40|$|De Rijke {{was one of}} ten ‘Explorers’ out of 500 {{applicants}} the British Council {{selected to}} take part in a funded research project. Each Explorer had to find case studies of design practice that addressed pressing global problems, to be exhibited at the British Pavilion at the 13 th Venice Architecture Biennale (‘Venice Takeaway: Ideas to Change British Architecture’, 2012), and the Royal Institute of British Architects (‘Venice Takeaway’, 2013). De Rijke had previously researched floating developments on the Thames, and the current random development of waterside London sites led him to research collective ways of inhabiting waterscapes. The Biennale brief was an opportunity to test his ideas against best practice in the Netherlands. De Rijke's case study was IJberg, a prototype floating community in Amsterdam. The aim was to understand what constitutes 'the Dutch way': a unique combination of <b>lateral</b> strategic <b>thinking,</b> and a collective commitment to high-quality architecture for keeping a country below sea level habitable in the face of global warming. De Rijke and his team researched the technology, policies and design that enabled IJberg to be built, and interviewed residents, financiers, policymakers and architects. A study of the ABC Arkenbouw factory, which makes the prefabricated floating units, gave insight into the design, construction methods and economics behind mass production of floating buildings. De Rijke intends using his exhibit as a springboard for discussions with the Greater London Authority to encourage the activation of some of the most underused areas of London – the waterways – and to cope with increased flooding from climate change, and the acute housing shortage.

50|$|Florida’s {{work has}} been criticized by {{scholars}} such as Jamie Peck as, “working quietly with the grain of extant ‘neoliberal’ development agendas, framed around interurban competition, gentriﬁcation, middle-class consumption and place-marketing”. In other words, Florida’s prescriptions in favor of fostering a creative class are, rather than being revolutionary, simply a way of bolstering the conventional economic model of the city. The idea of the creative class serves to create a cultural hierarchy, and as such reproduce inequalities; indeed, even Florida himself has even acknowledged that the areas he himself touts as hotspots of the creative class are {{at the same time}} home to shocking disparities in economic status among their residents. In order to explain this, he points to the inflation of housing prices that an influx of creatives can bring to an area, {{as well as to the}} creative class’ reliance on service industries that typically pay their employees low wages. Critics also argue that the creative city idea has now become a catch-all phrase in danger of losing its meaning. Cities also tend to restrict its meaning to the arts and activities within the creative economy professions, calling any cultural plan a creative city plan, when such activities are only one aspect of a community's creativity. There is a tendency for cities to adopt the term without thinking through its real organizational consequences and the need to change their mindset. The creativity implied in the term, the creative city, is about <b>lateral</b> and integrative <b>thinking</b> in all aspects of city planning and urban development, placing people, not infrastructure, at the centre of planning processes.|$|R
40|$|Place {{is said to}} be {{constantly}} in motion, and open to the circulation of ideas (Massey, 2005), changing in ‘an actualisation of times and spaces that uses the fluctuating conditions to assemble itself’ (Kwon 2004). This paper investigates how the process of making a City of Culture bid – “East Kent: A City Imagined” - has influenced placemaking in the region, remapping a new model of connectivity and a sense of creative space. “East Kent: A City Imagined” accords with the concept of Lefebvre’s (1991) ‘conceived space’, or Second Space (Soja, 1999, p. 266); conceptual, idealised, utopian, or birds-eye visions (De Certeau, 1984) used by placemakers to reflect changing ideologies. The underlying rationale for embarking on the bid was that Kent is diversifying its core heritage tourism product by emphasising its contemporary attractions (KCC, 2013; Stuart-Hoyle and Lovell, 2007). The long-term cultural policy intention is to foster the creative industries and attract the ‘creative class’ (Florida, 2002; Zukin, 1995) and to this end, cultural destination management plans have been developed in Canterbury, Margate and Folkestone which, it could be argued, ultimately intend to support gentrification and the creation of Neo-Bohemias (Lloyd, 2002). The East Kent City of Culture bid is suggestive of gentrification’s cultural agency, reframing places in a way designed to create ‘spatial narratives’ (Meethan 1996). Richards and Wilson (2007, p. 12 - 13) detail the process of ‘heritage mining’ and the fixed cultural assets of East Kent aligned for the bid included festivals such as Whitstable Biennale and Folkestone Triennial and national portfolio holders, for example Canterbury Festival and Turner Contemporary. Whilst previously loosely linked in geographical ‘throwntogetherness’ (Massey, 2005) the process of bidding has been a uniting force for those involved, which has re-anchored and reshaped knowledge, schema, and imagination, resulting in reprioritisation and new meaning-making. Drawing on participant observation, a series of semi-structured interviews with key cultural policy-makers and bid documents, the paper investigates how bidding has engendered connectivity by reframing the geographical area with a softer, metaphysical city of imagination. The paper traces the bid’s evolution from a top-down, conceptual desire to “grow” East Kent in order to attract the creative classes, into an emergent, living network, designed to reinforce the resilience of the arts {{in the context of the}} ‘Transformation Agenda’ of Public Sector cuts. The process resulted in an unexpected transformative, performed “ThirdSpace” (Soja, 1996) of emergent, simultaneous, multi-layered co-operation, resistance and reinterpreted boundaries, where the focus moved from competitiveness to survival. Whilst embarking on bidding was the result of cultural agency; simply getting people “in the same room” has caused <b>lateral,</b> inter-genre <b>thinking</b> spaces and new channels and linkages between the culture, tourism and heritage industries have been forged. The key findings examine the dynamic nature placemaking, indicating that the creative and cultural industries of East Kent have been united by the symbolic creation of a regional city. Although the bid was not successful, in addition to the idealised metaphorical city, cities operate at pedestrian level and the creative sense of place has been permanently remapped...|$|R

40|$|DAMON MULLER {{outlines}} {{new techniques}} {{for reducing the}} threat of arson BUSHFIRES are {{a fact of life}} in Australia, and have long been an essential part of our ecosystem. Research conducted by the Australian Institute of Criminology shows that, of the 20, 000 to 30, 000 vegetation fires experienced in Australia each year, about half are deliberately lit or suspicious. Deliberately lit bushfires constitute a considerable proportion of the fire suppression activities of Australian fire agencies. Responding to these unnecessary fires can unduly burden fire agencies. High numbers of deliberate bushfires occur where the bush meets the suburbs. Given the expansion of Australia’s urban centres and residential movement from the suburbs to semi-rural areas, fire control and prevention along the rural-urban interface has become increasingly important. The prevention of these acts of bushfire arson has enormous potential to reduce damage to life and property, and free up fire services to attend to other fires. Australian fire agencies {{have a long history of}} running programs and promoting community safety to reduce the incidence and potential damage of fires. Programs in schools, promotion of devices such as smoke alarms, advice on the preparation and defence of property and other community education activities are well-established. Most bushfire programs, however, have been concerned with protecting against a fire rather than preventing fires from starting. Much of the public commentary around bushfire arson focuses on sentencing of offenders. Bushfire arson is a crime in each Australian state and territory and commonly carries severe prison sentences for those convicted. Due to the difficulty of catching and convicting bushfire arsonists, however, such charges are laid only rarely. It is difficult for many people to comprehend why someone would deliberately light a fire that potentially puts property and lives at risk. Some attention has been paid to the topic of the motivations of arsonists in the international literature but little of this has focused explicitly on bushfire arson. We don’t know very much about bushfire arsonists because very few are ever caught. Many deliberate fires are not identified as arson and, among those that are, in only a small proportion will an offender be identified. Some of those offenders will not be charged or prosecuted because proving they caused the fire can be difficult. What we do know about arsonists suggests that the majority are young men, although that does not distinguish them from typical perpetrators of other crimes. Recent research in New South Wales indicated that half of all arson defendants, and one third of bushfire arsonists, had a prior criminal conviction. Most had not previously been convicted of arson, suggesting that most firesetters are not exclusively arsonists. While setting fire to buildings or cars is often motivated by financial gain or revenge, bushfire arsons tend to be motivated more by psychological rewards, such as excitement or attention. This generally makes it difficult for us to comprehend what someone would get out of setting a bushfire. Simply relying on the criminal justice system to prevent bushfire arson is a mistake, because many arsonists will never be identified or brought before the courts. Situational and community crime prevention approaches that address the local environment are most likely to have an impact, while offender-based approaches need to focus on the treatment of known offenders, both adults and juveniles. For this reason Australian fire services are developing strategies for preventing arson using many of the same principles as situational and community crime prevention programs that target more common street crimes. Situational crime prevention involves preventing crime by changing some aspect of the physical world to make crime more difficult, and hence less likely to occur. The approach arose from recognition that, contrary to previous pessimism that nothing actually worked to reduce crime, simple modifications, often at a local level, could be effective. Programs focusing on the community are primarily concerned with educating the community and raising awareness about the dangers of deliberate fires. They are generally targeted at a particular component of the community, either those likely to set fires or those who are in a position to prevent them. They act primarily to reinforce guardianship in fire-prone areas. While presented as distinct, community and environment-focused programs are likely to be complementary, and should not be regarded as mutually exclusive. Primary prevention techniques to reduce deliberate bushfires rely on an understanding of the situations in which such fires occur and either changing something about the environment or the community in order to prevent it happening in the future. For example, available evidence suggests that the risk of deliberate fires is higher during certain times of the year and week and that there are hotspots, most notably on the edge of urban areas. Operational data collected by fire agencies and police, or local knowledge, can be used to identify arson hotspots. Once an understanding of the features of bushfires is established, appropriate crime prevention techniques can be applied in order to reduce opportunities for setting them. Other strategies attempt to reduce bushfire arson by making it more difficult for deliberately lit fires to grow large or do damage. A number of fire agencies throughout Australia are looking at where arson attacks are occurring and using prescribed burns in areas at high risk of arson to reduce the effects of any illegal firesetting. Another strategy involves multiple government agencies working together to promptly remove abandoned cars from bushland areas so they are not set alight. Focusing on areas where there is a greater risk of bushfire arson and raising community awareness of the issues is a strategy that could build on existing bushfire prevention initiatives. In Western Australia, for example, the Fire and Emergency Services Authority has been running a targeted education program through schools, in shopping malls and by door knocking, in areas where there have been high numbers of fires. Another approach is to ensure there are interventions available for juveniles and adults caught deliberately lighting fires, to reduce the likelihood they will continue to do so. There are programs targeting young people who have shown a tendency for fire-setting now being run by fire agencies in all states and territories. There are, however, no specific programs for known adult offenders and more research is required to ascertain whether such programs are warranted or likely to be effective. Due to the very specific nature of bushfire arson, it is likely that arson prevention programs will require <b>lateral</b> and creative <b>thinking,</b> informed by the principles of crime prevention, by those with a good understanding of the local problem. Although there are a number of crime prevention approaches for preventing bushfire arson around Australia, these programs are often locality specific and have had little exposure beyond the local area. Also, many of these arson prevention strategies are quite new, and have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Early signs are promising, however. Evaluation of prevention programs is important as it will allow other fire agencies to see what works and adapt the key elements to their own jurisdictions. Media and public attention to bushfire arson typically only occurs during the fire season, however bushfire arson is a year-round problem for Australia. Ongoing data collection through a national arson monitoring program would help us better understand the problem and formulate appropriate preventative responses. Arson prevention programs do not replace a criminal justice response to bushfire arson but rather complement it. Reducing the overall number of deliberate bushfires not only reduces the amount of damage they cause, it frees up resources to fight and investigate the most serious fires. • ReferencesUnderstanding bushfire: trends in deliberate vegetation fires in Australia.
