Tischendorf made {{a new and more}} accurate collation for the Latin text and edited in 1855. Tischendorf used abbreviations for the nomina sacra, he did not leave any <b>lacunae.</b>|$|E

5|$|Codex Boreelianus, Codex Boreelianus Rheno-Trajectinus (full name), {{designated}} by Fe or 09 in the Gregory-Aland numbering and ε 86 in von Soden numbering, is a 9th (or 10th) century uncial manuscript {{of the four}} Gospels in Greek. The manuscript, written on parchment, is full of <b>lacunae</b> (or gaps), many of which arose between 1751 and 1830. The codex was named Boreelianus after Johannes Boreel (1577–1629), who brought it from the East.|$|E
50|$|There {{are a few}} classifications of <b>lacunas</b> in existence.

5|$|For the Shakkanakkus, {{the lists}} are {{incomplete}} and after Hanun-Dagan who ruled {{at the end}} of the Ur era c. 2008 BC (c. 1920 BC Short chronology), they become full of <b>lacunae.</b> Roughly 13 more Shakkanakkus succeeded Hanun-Dagan but only few are known, with the last known one reigning not too long before the reign of Yaggid-Lim who founded the Lim dynasty in c. 1830 BC.|$|E
5|$|Much of our {{evidence}} for 4th century army unit deployments {{is contained in}} a single document, the Notitia Dignitatum, compiled c. 395–420, a manual of all late Roman public offices, military and civil. The main deficiency with the Notitia is that it lacks any personnel figures so as to render estimates of army size impossible. Also, it was compiled {{at the very end}} of the 4th century; it is thus difficult to reconstruct the position earlier. However, the Notitia remains the central source on the late Army's structure due to the dearth of other evidence. The Notitia also suffers from significant <b>lacunae</b> and numerous errors accumulated from centuries of copying.|$|E
5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or <b>lacunae.</b> On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E

5|$|A {{manuscript}} {{of the first}} quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (Codex Palatinus), known as P, and its direct and indirect copies. P was written at Lorsch in Caroline minuscule. The text in this manuscript has several <b>lacunae</b> marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between Verus and Alexander, and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in Carus. P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.|$|E
5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of <b>lacunae)</b> is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E

25|$|P. IV and V – Two manuscripts {{that contain}} {{portions}} of Genesis, one dated {{to the late}} 3rd century, and one the early 4th century. These manuscripts are significant because the next oldest Greek Old Testament texts of Vaticanus and Sinaiticus have extensive <b>lacunae</b> in Genesis.|$|E
25|$|Fragments of {{parchment}} scrolls with Hebrew texts {{have also been}} unearthed; they resisted meaningful translation until J.L.

25|$|The Notitia {{has many}} {{sections}} missing and <b>lacunae</b> ("gaps") within sections. This is doubtless due to accumulated textual losses and copying errors, {{because it was}} repeatedly copied over the centuries: the earliest manuscript possessed today dates from the 15th century. The Notitia cannot therefore provide a comprehensive list of all units that existed.|$|E

25|$|Osteocytes {{are mostly}} {{inactive}} osteoblasts.

Mary, the <b>Lacuna</b> receptionist, is dating the other memory-erasing technician, Stan, but has feelings for Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor and head of <b>Lacuna.</b> During Joel's memory wipe, Mary discovers she had previously {{had an affair with}} Dr. Mierzwiak, agreed to have this erased from her memory when Dr. Mierzwiak's wife found out. On learning this, she asks Stan whether he knew about this, to which he claims that he didn't. Mary then quits her job and steals the company's records, mailing them to all of <b>Lacuna's</b> customers out of revenge.|$|R

Its foot is elongated, with a double-edged anterior margin and two short, white, metapodial tentacles projecting from below the operculum.
