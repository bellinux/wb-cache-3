25|$|Following {{the end of}} the American Civil War, Chicago {{emerged as}} a major railway center, making it an ideal point for the {{distribution}} of livestock raised on the Great Plains to Eastern markets. Getting the animals to market required herds to be driven distances of up to twelve hundred miles to railheads in Kansas City, MO, whereupon they were loaded into specialized stock cars and transported live (on the hoof) to regional processing centers. Driving cattle across the plains also led to tremendous weight loss, and a number of animals were typically lost along the way. Upon arrival at the <b>local</b> <b>processing</b> facility, livestock were either slaughtered by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt.|$|E
25|$|One's first {{impressions}} {{are affected by}} {{whether he or she}} is alone or with any number of people. Joint experiences are more globally processed (see global precedence for more on processing), as in collectivist cultures. Global processing emphasizes {{first impressions}} more because the collective first impression tends to remain stable over time. Solo experiences tend to facilitate <b>local</b> <b>processing,</b> causing the viewer to take a more critical look at the target. Thus, individuals {{are more likely to have}} negative first impressions than groups of two or more viewers of the same target. At the same time, individuals are more likely to experience an upward trend over the course of a series of impressions, e.g. individual viewers will like the final episode of a TV season more than the first even if it is really the same quality.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we used {{electroencephalography}} {{to investigate}} the influence of discourse-level semantic coherence on electrophysiological signatures of <b>local</b> sentence-level <b>processing.</b> Participants read groups of four sentences that could either form coherent stories or were semantically unrelated. For semantically coherent discourses compared to incoherent ones, the N 400 was smaller at sentences 2 – 4, while the visual N 1 was larger at {{the third and fourth}} sentences. Oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range (13 – 21  Hz) was higher for coherent discourses. We relate the N 400 effect to a disruption of <b>local</b> sentence-level semantic <b>processing</b> when sentences are unrelated. Our beta findings can be tentatively related to disruption of <b>local</b> sentence-level syntactic <b>processing,</b> but it cannot be fully ruled out that they are instead (or also) related to disrupted <b>local</b> sentence-level semantic <b>processing.</b> We conclude that manipulating discourse-level semantic coherence does have an effect on oscillatory power related to <b>local</b> sentence-level <b>processing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Deficits in {{processing}} contextual information {{are one of}} the main features of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, but the neurophysiologic substrate underlying this dysfunction is poorly understood. We used ERPs to investigate <b>local</b> contextual <b>processing</b> in schizophrenic patients. Local context was defined as the occurrence of a short predictive series of stimuli occurring before delivery of a target event. Response times of predicted targets were faster in controls compared to patients. Schizophrenia patients failed to generate the P 3 b latency shift between predicted and random targets that was observed in controls and demonstrated a prominent reduction of the peak of an early latency context dependent positivity.
