5|$|Kessler then invites Cole to {{join him}} for a final fight in the same {{location}} where the game began. Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler comes close to killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded by a massive energy discharge, Kessler uses his <b>last</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a final twist, Kessler {{turns out to be}} Cole himself from an alternate timeline. While raising a family with Trish, Kessler failed to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from conquering humanity. With his reign secure, the Beast then tracked down and killed Trish and her children. Sending himself back in time, Kessler seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for the future to come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory, but recognizes that his actions have given his life a new purpose.|$|E

For instance, if the lookup of k {{is based on the}} <b>last</b> 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> x, then when we want to undo a step like x = x [...] (k << 8), we can look up k by noting that the <b>last</b> 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> x are unchanged by this operation.|$|R

Belle shows up to tell everyone that the <b>last</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by the Darkness, and the group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart from his chest, and uses his power to pull the Darkness out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcerer’s Hat, which severs Gold's link to the Dagger of Kris in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable to contain the Darkness, and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic to force the Darkness back out of the Apprentice, and the Darkness exits the shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled the Darkness and tethered it to a human soul with the Dark One's Dagger, and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent the Darkness from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin.|$|E

[...] The heart actress Emilia Clarke ate was, according to Weiss, [...] "basically a giant, three-pound gummi bear covered in fake sugar blood – which has the added attraction of drawing real flies." [...] Through repeated takes, Clarke did have to eat much of the sugary heart.

She retorted, [...] "Oh, I suppose that is what you eat to exist on." [...] This brought the King's rage to an instant climax and [...] threw the articles at her head.

[...] Sepinwall praised Timothy Dalton's ability to deliver both a comic and serious performance, writing that, while on other series Volkoff's back-story [...] "would be an incredibly dark, tragic storyline", Dalton acted well enough that his emotions were not overwhelming. Sepinwall continued that the storyline [...] "would have sucked every <b>last</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> joy out of the episode" [...] if the character had been portrayed by another Chuck actor. In contrast, Sepinwall wrote that he felt no empathy for Volkoff's daughter, as [...] "Lauren Cohan has never managed to make a cohesive and interesting character out {{of a bunch of}} jarring personality shifts". Brody Gibson of Boom Tron wrote," [...] The writers of Chuck sure know how to pull together a great finale. I was floored." [...] Gibson agreed with Sepinwall on Timothy Dalton's range of acting skills, praising Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski as well. Gibson wrote that Levi deserved an Emmy nomination for a scene in which Chuck surrenders himself to Vivian to plead for the antidote to save Sarah's life. Gibson also praised Levi and Strahovski's performance in Chuck and Sarah's [...] "practice wedding": [...] "These two have always had such great chemistry, you could swear they're actually in love and not just actors pretending." ...|$|E
