50|$|Most {{scissors}} are best-suited for {{use with}} the right hand, but left-handed scissors are designed {{for use with}} the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> Because scissors have overlapping blades, they are not symmetric. This asymmetry is true regardless of the orientation {{and shape of the}} handles: the blade that is on top always forms the same diagonal regardless of orientation. Human hands are also asymmetric, and when closing, the thumb and fingers do not close vertically, but have a lateral component to the motion. Specifically, the thumb pushes out from the palm and the fingers pull inwards. For right-handed scissors held in the right hand, the thumb blade is closer to the user's body, so that the natural tendency of the right hand is to force the cutting blades together. Conversely, if right-handed scissors are held in the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> the natural tendency of the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> would be to force the cutting blades laterally apart. Furthermore, with right-handed scissors held by the right <b>hand,</b> the shearing <b>edge</b> is visible, but when they are used with the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> the cutting <b>edge</b> of the scissors is behind the top blade, and one cannot see what is being cut.|$|R
50|$|Middlesbrough were up {{next for}} United, at the Riverside. A usually tricky {{game for the}} Reds ended with a {{comfortable}} 2-0 away win, thanks to goals either side of half-time. Ryan Giggs opened the scoring with his first goal since being named as PFA Player of the Year, and his 98th Premier League goal in total. Giggs received the ball from Nemanja Vidić, steadied himself, and slotted it past Brad Jones' <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> from the <b>edge</b> of the area with 25 minutes played. United created a handful of chances {{in the remainder of}} the first half but none worried Boro's Australian goalkeeper. Park Ji-sung doubled the Reds' lead though shortly after half-time. Giggs and Federico Macheda combined with a one-two before Wayne Rooney threaded a pass through the Boro defence to find Park superbly. Park then settled the game with a decisive strike low into the bottom corner.|$|R
60|$|Captain Madwell rose to {{his feet}} and drew his sword from the scabbard. He passed the fingers of his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> along the <b>edge</b> from hilt to point. He held it out {{straight}} before him, as if to test his nerves. There was no visible tremor of the blade; the ray of bleak skylight that it reflected was steady and true. He stooped and with his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> tore away the dying man's shirt, rose and placed the point of the sword just over the heart. This time he did not withdraw his eyes. Grasping the hilt with both hands, he thrust downward with all his strength and weight. The blade sank into the man's body--through his body into the earth; Captain Madwell came near falling forward upon his work. The dying man drew up his knees {{and at the same time}} threw his right arm across his breast and grasped the steel so tightly that the knuckles of the hand visibly whitened. By a violent but vain effort to withdraw the blade the wound was enlarged; a rill of blood escaped, running sinuously down into the deranged clothing. At that moment three men stepped silently forward from behind the clump of young trees which had concealed their approach. Two were hospital attendants and carried a stretcher.|$|R
50|$|When {{a regular}} repeating pattern is viewed on a CRT monitor {{as if it}} were a {{wallpaper}} autostereogram, it is usually possible to see depth ripples. This can also be seen in the background to a static, random-dot autostereogram. These are caused by the sideways shifts in the image due to small changes in the deflection sensitivity (linearity) of the line scan, which then become interpreted as depth. This effect is especially apparent at the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge</b> of the screen where the scan speed is still settling after the flyback phase. On a TFT LCD, which functions differently, this does not occur and the effect is not present. Higher quality CRT displays also have better linearity and exhibit less or none of this effect.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, {{the cousins}} {{admitted}} {{in an article}} published in the magazine The Unexplained that the photographs had been faked, although both maintained that they really had seen fairies. Elsie had copied illustrations of dancing girls from a popular children's book of the time, Princess Mary's Gift Book, published in 1914, and drew wings on them. They said they had then cut out the cardboard figures and supported them with hatpins, disposing of their props in the beck once the photograph had been taken. But the cousins disagreed about the fifth and final photograph, which Doyle in his The Coming of the Fairies described in this way: Seated on the upper <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge</b> with wing well displayed is an undraped fairy apparently considering whether it is time to get up. An earlier riser of more mature age is seen on the right possessing abundant hair and wonderful wings. Her slightly denser body can be glimpsed within her fairy dress.|$|E

5000|$|Formatting with WordStar {{was carried}} out before the text to be {{formatted}} - unlike many other word processors where the formatting of a paragraph is 'buried' within the usually hidden paragraph marker {{at the end of}} the paragraph. This latter method leaves the user unclear where formatting starts. In normal editing, WordStar hides formatting markers but these are easily displayed with ^OD command. Formatting information is then displayed in the normal text area displacing the actual text. It nonetheless made it absolutely clear where formatting started and finished. Page and section formatting was handled differently by the addition of formatting lines. A formatting line was indicated by the line starting with a full stop. A few examples: [...]lh (line height) [...]lm (left margin) [...]rm (right margin) - each of which was followed by a number. The number was assumed to be points (pt) but could be easily modified to inches or mm by the addition of [...] " [...] or mm after the number[...]lm and [...]rm were never equal as both values were from the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge</b> of the page.

The Schüleins belonged to a circle of prominent artists and intellectuals in Munich. Among their friends were Heinrich and Thomas Mann, Lion Feuchtwanger, Paul Klee, and Vassily Kandinsky. In 1930 the Schüleins moved to Berlin. In 1933, with the intervention of the French ambassador to Germany François Poncet, the Schülein’s were able to flee to Paris. After the outbreak of the war, Julius was separated from his wife and interned as an enemy alien at Montauban, near Bordeaux, and other internment camps in the South of France.

Stress-adapted landscapes save water, escape injury in drought Roy M. Sachs Results of investigations at UC ex-periment stations reveal that irriga-tion equal to 14 % or less of refer-ence evapotranspiration (€TO) can be applied to established shrubs and ground covers with no appar-ent drought-related injury. Adapta-tion to stress by reduced irrigation during the 2 years preceding full reduction of irrigation eliminated most injury symptoms (such as wilting and leaf necrosis). Applica-tion of these findings to estab-lished landscapes should signifi-cantly reduce water use and the cost of removing excess vegeta-tion. The current prolonged drought suggests that California is unlikely to enjoy an inex-pensive water supply in the future. More-over, reduced water use in all areas of landscape management not only makes economic sense but will likely be man-dated by legislation. Design and installa-tion of drought-tolerant and perhaps more salt-tolerant landscapes with careful water management should become common-place as more information on the mini-mum water requirements of representa-tive environments becomes available. This is a report of past research on the subject where the objectives were to determine the minimum irrigation required to maintain healthy-appearing plants and to develop techniques for estimating when estab-lished plants require irrigation...|$|E
