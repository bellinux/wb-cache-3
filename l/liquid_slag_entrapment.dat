40|$|Lab scale freeze {{layers of}} an {{industrial}} nonferrous slag with as main components Al 2 O 3 -CaO-FeO (x) -MgO-SiO 2 -ZnO were studied {{to explore the}} mass transport in an industrial freeze lining. The freeze layers were formed by submerging a water-cooled probe into a <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> bath. In previous research,[1] two distinct types of microstructures were observed in these freeze layers: one with only melilite columnar crystals and one with both melilite and olivine columnar crystals. In this article, the mass transport during the formation of these microstructures is investigated. The element distribution, the phase fraction, and the crystal morphology were examined using electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis. In addition, thermodynamic software was {{used to calculate the}} solidification path of the slag. The impact of the mass transport on the growth of a freeze lining depends on the solidification rate. For high solidification rates, only short-range mass transport is observed and small crystals form. For lower solidification rates, long-range mass transport is observed, resulting in an exchange of components between the freeze layer and <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> bath and in the formation of large crystals. Different growth mechanisms are observed for melilite and olivine crystals. The broad large melilite crystals have to exchange components with the <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> bath to grow, because the amount of <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> between the crystals is limited, while the long thin olivine crystals can exchange components with a large amount of <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> in between the crystals.

From the phase diagram of the CaO-SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 system, {{it is well known}} that dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) and tricalcium phosphate (C 3 P) form a solid solution at the steelmaking or hot metal dephosphorization temperature in a wide composition range. This phase diagram implies that the main products of the dephosphorization reaction can be dissolved into the main solid phase in the slag.

In this study, the effects of design/operation parameters and slag properties on the slag behaviors were assessed in a commercial coal gasifier using numerical modeling. The parameters influenced the slag behaviors through mechanisms interrelated to the heat transfer, temperature, velocity, and viscosity of the slag layers. The velocity profile of the <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> was less sensitive to the variations in the parameters. Therefore, {{the change in the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> thickness was typically smaller than that of the solid slag. The gas temperature was the most influential factor, because of its dominant effect on the radiative heat transfer to the slag layer. The solid slag thickness exponentially increased with higher gas temperatures. The influence of the ash deposition rate was diminished by the high-velocity region developed near the <b>liquid</b> <b>slag</b> surface. The slag viscosity significantly influenced the solid slag thickness through the corresponding changes in the critical temperature and the temperature gradient (heat flux).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} LIBS technique considering the rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of metallurgic slag was the main objective of the particular thesis. Firstly, the LIBS technique applied on pure metals and then on samples containing the same metals in CaO matrix and the time-resolved characteristics of the plasmas produced by nsec and psec pulses were studied. Both the plasma temperature and electron density are decaying similarly and the space-averaged values determined in the nanosecond case are slightly higher than for the picosecond one. Moreover, the calibration curves obtained, show that the inherent sensitivity of the technique remains almost unaltered independently of the pulse duration. The detection limits {{were found to be}} few ppm. Then, the potentiality of LIBS method for quantitative on-line, multi-element slag analysis on plant scale was examined. Further, in order to examine more closely the produced slag, slag samples were analysed in the laboratory. The measurements were performed on solidified slag samples in a pelletized form and on as delivered solidified slag samples. The limits of the accuracy of this technique depend mainly on the laser spot/phase size ratio, the level of surface abnormalities and the distribution of each element in the matrix. The non-homogeneity level of the slag product seems to be not important in LIBS analysis, when the above ratio is quite large. It is of great importance whether the element is embedded in the matrix or in a specific crystallized phase. The influence of surface abnormalities is reduced in the case of pressed slag, but primarily for the elements distributed in the matrix, fragmentation of the slag should be avoided.
