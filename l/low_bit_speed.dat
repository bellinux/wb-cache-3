High interblock correlation in natural images results in a high probability that neighbouring image blocks are mapped to small subsets of the VQ codebook, which contains highly correlated codevectors. If, instead of the whole VQ codebook, a small subset is considered for the purpose of encoding neighbouring blocks, it is possible to improve the performance of traditional VQ schemes significantly. The performance improvement obtained with the new method is about 3 dB on average when compared with traditional VQ schemes at <b>low</b> <b>bit</b> rates.
