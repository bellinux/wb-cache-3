500|$|The campus {{contains}} 94 academic classrooms, a 1,250-seat auditorium, a 1,600-seat competition gym (the Auburn Fieldhouse), six tennis courts, {{a baseball}} field (Sam Welborn Field), a track, cafeteria, library, multi-media room, practice gym, {{and physical education}} fields. Off-campus athletic facilities include 8,310-seat Duck Samford Stadium, the Auburn Softball Complex, and the James E. Martin Aquatic Center. [...] The school maintains a 1.16:1 student–to–computer ratio, with all classrooms having wired (100Mbit/s) Internet connections and <b>LCD</b> <b>projectors,</b> while the campus {{as a whole is}} covered by a wireless network.|$|E
50|$|The first {{experiments}} with a direct-driven, transmissive matrix-addressed LCDs by Peter J. Wild using a converted slide projector working at Brown Boveri Research, Switzerland, in 1971 were demonstrated at the SID Conference 1972 in San Francisco. As passive LCDs (without transistors at the intersections) were {{not capable of}} displaying images with sufficient resolution for video pictures, {{a combination of a}} fixed image together with an LCD matrix for the variable elements was proposed as an <b>LC</b> <b>projector</b> for certain control room applications, with a corresponding patent filed in Switzerland on Dec. 3, 1971.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFuji Photo Film Co Ltd and Fuji Xerox Co Ltd have co-developed a {{high-speed}} optical transmission Lumistar system, capable of transmission {{at more than}} 1 Gbps without deterioration in output signal quality due to the graded-index distribution of refractive-index within the fibre. Combining optical transceiver module with VCSEL, high-speed transmitter and receiver developed by Fuji Xerox Co Ltd with the optical lens module developed by Fuji Photo Optical Co Ltd, the system realises some 100, 000 h of network build. The system links large flat panel displays such as plasma TV, large-size <b>LC</b> TVt, and <b>projectors</b> with tuners. Conventional electric wires deteriorate the quality of an electric signal along their distance, {{making it difficult to}} establish a link of 10 m or longer. Lumistar enables an optical link of 30 m and is suitable for application fields such as event sites, amusement facilities, commercial establishments, security facilities, hotels, and service areas.

500|$|With {{the changes}} in 1969 {{many of the old}} traditions were lost in the course of {{modernisation}} along with the demolition of older buildings that have been replaced by extensive expansion. The school nevertheless retains its centuries-old stance as {{the focal point of the}} tiny village, and its high standards of academic achievement. The campus now comprises many new buildings that include six science laboratories, two computer rooms, two music rooms, a drama studio, two art studios and five craft, design and technology work areas. Funded by [...] Worcester County Council [...] and Malvern Hills District Council, a £650,000 sports hall accommodating four badminton courts was added in 2002. The school also has a self-contained sixth-form college on site, with around 200students studying for their A levels. A modern, purpose built 2-storey language centre was added to the campus in 2008, and is fully equipped with language learning technology including overhead <b>LCD</b> <b>projectors,</b> interactive whiteboards, and laptop computers to convert any of the classrooms into language laboratories. A new music block has also been added[...]|$|E

2500|$|<b>LCD</b> <b>projectors</b> have {{fundamental}} {{limits on}} their ability to project true black as well as light, which has tended to limit their use in planetaria. LCOS and modified LCOS projectors have improved on LCD contrast ratios while also eliminating the “screen door” effect of small gaps between LCD pixels. “Dark chip” DLP projectors improve on the standard DLP design and can offer relatively inexpensive solution with bright images, but the black level requires physical baffling of the projectors. [...] As the technology matures and reduces in price, laser projection looks promising for dome projection as it offers bright images, large dynamic range and a very wide color space.|$|E
2500|$|Montgomery Bell State Park is {{also known}} as Montgomery Bell State Resort Park. The resort {{features}} at the park include an inn and conference center, several villas and a golf course. The Resort Inn, built in 1951, has 120 hotel rooms and is on Lake Acorn. The hotel has cable television, an indoor swimming pool, hot tub, exercise room and laundry facilities. The conference center is six thousand square feet and features [...] "standard business items" [...] such as microphones, <b>LCD</b> <b>projectors,</b> DVD players and Internet connections. Eight modern villas are fully furnished and are {{the first in a series}} of environmentally responsible homes to be built in Tennessee's state parks. The Frank G. Clement Golf Course was built on park lands during the 1970s. It is a par 72, eighteen hole course. The restaurant serves a southern style buffet and provides catering for the conference center.|$|E
