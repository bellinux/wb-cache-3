5|$|Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren were early {{opportunities}} for the Germans to learn <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> the challenges their poorly equipped and often substandard occupation troops faced fighting in the difficult terrain and weather conditions of Bosnia. However, these lessons were to be repeated many more times in the following years as German commanders persisted with their encirclement tactics and unreasonable expectations {{of what could be}} achieved in a given time and space.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Enlightenment histories, {{which have been}} seen as attempting to draw general <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder in his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind (1784), set out the concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the influence of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors who consider that such a national history did exist in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E

5|$|After {{securing}} {{the area around}} Arleux {{at the end of}} April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the Boiry Riegel and reach the Wotanstellung, a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle was a failure, the British learned important <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} 1790 {{and summer}} of 1792 Metternich studied law at the University of Mainz, {{receiving}} a more conservative education than at Strasbourg, a city the return to which was now unsafe. In the summers he worked with his father, who had been appointed plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands. In March 1792 Francis succeeded his father Leopold as Holy Roman Emperor and was crowned in July, affording Metternich a reprisal of his earlier role of Ceremonial Marshall. To this he added the honour of opening the accompanying ball alongside Louise of Mecklenburg. In the meantime France had declared war on Austria, beginning the War of the First Coalition (1792–7) and making Metternich's further study in Mainz impossible. Now {{in the employment of}} his father, he was sent on a special mission to the front. Here he led the interrogation of the French Minister of War the Marquis de Beurnonville and several accompanying National Convention commissioners. Metternich observed the siege and fall of Valenciennes, later looking back on these as substantial <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> warfare. In early 1794 he was sent to England on, ostensibly on official business helping Viscount Desandrouin, the Treasurer-General of the Austrian Netherlands, to negotiate a loan.|$|E

25|$|Abdul-Qadir Gilani (1077–1166) was a Persian Hanbali jurist and Sufi {{based in}} Baghdad. Qadiriyya was his patronym. Gilani spent his early life in Na'if, {{the town of}} his birth. There, he pursued the study of Hanbali law. Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi gave Gilani lessons in fiqh. He was given <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> Hadith by Abu Bakr ibn Muzaffar. He was given <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> Tafsir by Abu Muhammad Ja'far, a commentator. His Sufi spiritual {{instructor}} was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas. After completing his education, Gilani left Baghdad. He spent twenty-five years as a reclusive wanderer in the desert regions of Iraq. In 1127, Gilani returned to Baghdad and began to preach to the public. He joined the teaching staff of the school belonging to his own teacher, Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi, and was popular with students. In the morning he taught hadith and tafsir, and in the afternoon he held discourse on the science {{of the heart and}} the virtues of the Qur'an.|$|E

25|$|George Banks – {{the husband}} of Winifred, and father of Jane and Michael Banks. George {{grew up in a}} very strict and stern household. He {{mentions}} hardly ever seeing his mother and father, who did not believe in public displays of affection. George works at a bank in London, and it is hinted that his father did as well. George had a nanny named Miss Euphemia Andrew as a child, who was also very strict. George is often away at work and rarely spends time with the children. In the film and musical, as the story goes on, he learns <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> being more affectionate to his family and is taught that they are more important than work.|$|E
25|$|After {{writing a}} column about Japanese popular culture {{for nearly a}} decade for the ezine PopMatters and penning over 600 entries in an online travelblog, Holden {{published}} the memoir, Peripatetic Postcards: The journey of life, through 25 of the world's cities, in 2010. Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what Holden calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life’s road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, Peripatetic Postcards operates at two levels: seeking to convey the panoply of human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience.|$|E
500|$|Angelou learns <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> {{herself and}} about racism {{throughout}} Traveling Shoes, even during her brief tour of Venice and Berlin for The Blacks revival. [...] She revives {{her passion for}} African-American culture as she associates with other African-Americans {{for the first time}} since moving to Ghana. [...] She compares her experiences of American racism with Germany's history of racial prejudice and military aggression. [...] The verbal violence of the folk tales shared during her luncheon with her German hosts and Israeli friend is as significant to Angelou as physical violence, to the point that she becomes ill. [...] Angelou's first-hand experience with fascism, as well as the racist sensibilities of the German family she visits, [...] "help shape and broaden her constantly changing vision" [...] regarding racial prejudice.|$|E

500|$|Caged Bird {{has been}} called [...] "perhaps the most aesthetically {{satisfying}} autobiography written {{in the years immediately}} following the Civil Rights era". Critic Pierre A. Walker expresses a similar sentiment, and places it in the African-American literature tradition of political protest. Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the Black community of Stamps, as well as her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters and [...] "the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans", her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society. Angelou's autobiographies, beginning with Caged Bird, contain a sequence of <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> resisting oppression. [...] The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from [...] "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest".|$|E
500|$|In essence, the Hymns for the Amusement of Children is {{intended}} to teach children the specific virtues {{that make up the}} subject matter of the work. While trying to accomplish this goal, Smart emphasizes the joy of creation and Christ's sacrifice that allowed for future salvation. However, he didn't just try to spread joy, but structured his poems to treat valuable <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> morality; his subjects begin with the three Theological Virtues (Faith, Hope, and Charity), then the four Cardinal Virtues (Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude) and adds Mercy. The next six hymns deal with Christian duties and are followed by ten hymns on the Gospels. The final works introduce the miscellaneous Christian virtues that were necessary to complete Christopher's original self-proclaimed [...] "plan to make good girls and boys." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{uses her}} {{autobiography}} to explore {{subjects such as}} identity, rape, racism, and literacy. She also writes in new ways about women's lives in a male-dominated society. Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book's central character, has been called [...] "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America". Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text. Another metaphor, that of a bird struggling to escape its cage, is a central image throughout the work, which consists of [...] "a sequence of <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> resisting racist oppression". Angelou's treatment of racism provides a thematic unity to the book. Literacy {{and the power of}} words help young Maya cope with her bewildering world; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma.|$|E

40|$|In “The Constraints of Hume’s Naturalism” Barry Stroud {{takes on}} the task of looking at Hume’s {{negative}} and positive accounts of induction in conjunction. Stroud goes about doing this so that we might walk away with “a more general <b>lesson</b> <b>about</b> naturalism, at least when it is indulged in for philosophical purposes”. Given the boldness of Stroud’s quote from above there should be some explicit talk of this general <b>lesson</b> <b>about</b> naturalism outside of Hume’s, but there is none that is readily apparent. If a more general and philosophically motivated <b>lesson</b> <b>about</b> naturalism is to be gleaned from Stroud’s investigation of Hume, then we should take this to be a lesson implicit in Stroud and not Hume. Hence I shall argue that Stroud tacitly endorses the skeptical conclusions of David Hume about naturalism in general when indulged for philosophical purposes...|$|R
500|$|Critic Pierre A. Walker placed Angelou's autobiographies in the African-American {{literature}} {{tradition of}} political protest {{written in the}} years following the American Civil Rights Movement. He emphasized that the unity of Angelou's autobiographies underscored one of her central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. [...] Angelou's biographies, beginning with Caged Bird, consisted of [...] "a sequence of <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> resisting racist oppression". This sequence led Angelou, as the protagonist, from [...] "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest" [...] throughout all seven of her autobiographies. [...] Angelou changed her views in the course of her autobiographies about Black-white relationships and learned to accept different points of view. It was changes in how she regarded race, and her views of white people, that provided Angelou with freedom. According to Hagen, one of Angelou's themes was that humans tend to be more alike than different.|$|E
500|$|Love Among the Walnuts {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Helbig and Perkins {{commented that}} [...] "the large cast consists of individualized, complementary, and affectionately handled characters" [...] and the novel's themes [...] "are conveyed with skill and invention". Publishers Weekly praised {{the story for}} its [...] "cast of offbeat characters and some punchy dialogue" [...] while writing that its [...] "plot will have more appeal for adults than children." [...] In The Horn Book Magazine, Anne St. John commented that Sandy's [...] "emotional responses and internal struggles will ring true with teenagers who are {{coming of age in}} a time of turmoil". According to Elaine McGuire of Voice of Youth Advocates, Love Among the Walnuts is [...] "dripping with charm but never cloying... a fabulous book with lots of <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> our sickeningly fast-paced '90s lifestyles." [...] Paula Rohrlick, writing in Kliatt, compared Love Among the Walnuts favorably to Ferris's later work, Once Upon a Marigold, describing both stories as [...] "madcap".|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{started work}} in 1925 with the Forest Service, {{where he worked}} until 1928. Although {{he had hoped to}} go to Alaska, he was {{assigned}} that year to the Northern Rocky Mountain Experiment Station at Missoula, Montana. Marshall's research at the experimental station focused on the dynamics of forest regeneration after fires. He had to fight a widespread fire after a July storm started more than 150fires in Idaho's Kaniksu National Forest. He was put in charge of supporting and provisioning one of the crews led by the Forest Service. As he later recalled, Marshall worked [...] "18 to 20hours a day as time-keeper, Chief of Commissary, Camp Boss, and Inspector of the fire line". [...] Spending time with loggers and fire fighters, and seeing the conditions under which they worked, Marshall learned vital <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> labor issues and natural resource use. At the experimental station, Marshall became interested in the unsafe conditions for many working Americans. He began to develop [...] liberal and socialist philosophies.|$|E
