5|$|After the Romanian Revolution, many firing ranges and {{training}} areas {{were closed and}} abandoned due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> Currently, the military schools {{and training}} units of the Romanian Land Forces are directly subordinated to the central headquarters. There are 3 military high schools (Câmpulung Moldovenesc, Alba Iulia and Breaza), five military academies , one officers school (Piteşti), 3 training schools (Sibiu, Piteşti, Buzău) and 9 training battalions.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lichfield, Staffordshire, Johnson {{attended}} Pembroke College, Oxford, {{for just}} over a year, but a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> forced him to leave. After working as a teacher, he moved to London, where he began to write for The Gentleman's Magazine. His early works include the biography Life of Mr Richard Savage, the poems London and The Vanity of Human Wishes, and the play Irene.|$|E
5|$|In 1638, the Santa Margherita Lines {{began to}} be built {{encircling}} the land fronts of Birgu and Sengela. Works were suspended in 1645 due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds,</b> and they remained unfinished for many years. Following the fall of Candia to the Ottomans in 1669, a second line of fortifications, the Cottonera Lines, {{began to be}} built encircling both Birgu and Senglea, {{as well as the}} unfinished Santa Margherita Lines. They were begun in 1670, but works stopped in 1680 again due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> By this time, the bastioned enceinte had been built, although other crucial parts had not yet been constructed. Eventually, some effort was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century, although some of the planned ravelins, cavaliers, ditch and other fortifications were never constructed. Fort San Salvatore was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724.|$|E

5|$|On May 14, Paul's {{campaign}} {{announced that}} due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> (though despite financial backing from financiers Peter Thiel and Mark Spitznagel) {{he would no longer}} actively campaign for votes in the 11 remaining primary states, including Texas and California, that had not yet voted. He would, however, continue to seek to win delegates for the national party convention in the states that had already voted.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Washington's death, a Congressional {{committee}} recommended {{a different type}} of monument. John Marshall, a Representative from Virginia (who later became Chief Justice of the United States) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol. However, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds,</b> disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country's first president, and the Washington family's reluctance to move his body prevented progress on any project.|$|E
5|$|The current Romanian {{reconnaissance}} battalions (the 313th, the 317th and the 528th) {{are also}} considered special forces units, and were {{formed in the}} 1960s during the communist regime. After the revolution, the units suffered from a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> {{which resulted in the}} temporary disbandment of the 313th Battalion. However, their equipment was completely overhauled {{in the past few years}} and the combat readiness and capabilities have regained full strength.|$|E

5|$|The first {{proposal}} {{to build a}} fortification on Dragut Point {{was made by the}} Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670. He proposed a fortified city known as Borgo della Città Piccola, with a design similar to Fort Ricasoli. The proposal never materialized, probably due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} railways during railway mania caused coaching services to dry up. Along {{with many other}} turnpike routes, the New Direct Road fell into disrepair during the 19th century owing to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> and available staff. By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, it had become little more than a rough track in places, making it difficult to drive on.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins be struck by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Prices on the exchange began to crash, owing to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to finance purchases. At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, {{the president of the}} New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him {{that he would have to}} close the exchange early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was {{accepted}} for publication by Century, and Marquis was prompted to take down his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, {{as it would be}} some time before royalties were forthcoming. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He also needed to borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason {{it had not been}} reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US$500,000.|$|E
5|$|Mowbray left Hibs in October 2006 {{to manage}} West Bromwich Albion, and was {{replaced}} by former player John Collins. The team won the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final under his management, but the club sold Kevin Thomson, Scott Brown and Steven Whittaker for fees totalling more than £8million. Collins resigned later that year, frustrated by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> provided to sign new players. Former Hibs player Mixu Paatelainen was hired to replace Collins, but he left after the end of his first full season.|$|E
5|$|Much of the inter-war period saw {{economic}} recession or stagnant growth, making fund-raising more challenging. Partially as a result, many memorial projects {{had to be}} cut back or altered {{due to lack of}} money. The final size of Douaumont had to be cut in size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{founded the}} Theological Repository in 1768, a journal {{committed}} to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions. Although he promised to print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles. He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material {{became the basis for}} many of his later theological and metaphysical works). After only a few years, due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds,</b> he was forced to cease publishing the journal. He revived it in 1784 with similar results.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after their}} {{assignment}} to San Giacomo, the brethren started to reconstruct it, choosing as architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, {{but due to}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> its facade was still unfinished in 1590. That year Ludovico Fulgineo, ecclesiastical referendary and governor of the archconfraternity, died, leaving his inheritance to the association. Thanks to his legacy, two years later, the construction was finished. In 1601, an oratory dedicated to Saint Sebastian was built behind the church.|$|E
5|$|Spanish EAV-8Bs joined Operation Deny Flight, {{enforcing}} the UN's no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Spain did not send its aircraft carrier {{to participate in}} the Iraq War in 2003, instead deploying F/A-18s and other aircraft to Turkey to defend that country against potential Iraqi attacks. Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs–with the likely option being the F-35B. The Spanish government, in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> for a replacement aircraft.|$|E
