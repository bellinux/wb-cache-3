Make two careful {{studies of}} this kind of one bough of every common tree,--oak, ash, elm, birch, beech, etc.; in fact, if you are good, and industrious, you will make one such study {{carefully}} {{at least three times a}} week, until you have examples of every sort of tree and shrub you can get branches of. You are to make two studies of each bough, for this reason,--all masses of foliage have an upper and under surface, and the side view of them, or profile, shows a wholly different organization of branches from that seen in the view from above. They are generally seen more or less in profile, as you look at the whole tree, and Nature puts her best composition into the profile arrangement. But the view from above or below occurs not unfrequently, also, and it is quite necessary you should draw it if you wish to understand the anatomy of the tree. The difference between the two views is often far greater than you could easily conceive. For instance, in Fig. 9, a is the upper view and b the profile, of a single spray of Phillyrea.

50|$|Forcing is a {{term used}} by meteorologists to {{describe}} the situation where a change or an event {{in one part of}} the atmosphere causes a strengthening change in another part of the atmosphere.

In some respects, teleconnections could be considered a type of forcing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{investigations}} about vehicle crossing process mainly use {{numerical simulation}} methods and, moreover, the relevant investigation is quite less. In this study, a three- dimensional fluid simulation model was established. By moving mesh technique, the three- dimensional transient simulation for vehicle crossing process was finished. The aerodynamics characteristics of vehicle crossing process with different <b>lateral</b> interval <b>distances</b> were analyzed. The analytical {{results show that}} the smaller the <b>lateral</b> interval <b>distance,</b> the more the transverse thrust between two vehicles during the crossing process. During the whole crossing process, the lateral force shows itself with repulsion in the beginning and attraction in the end. When the <b>lateral</b> interval <b>distance</b> of crossing is very small, the air disturbance due to crossing not only makes large affection to the lateral force but also influence obviously the positive pressure area of the front car bodywork...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{the snow}} water {{equivalent}} (SWE) {{is critical to}} effective {{management of water resources}} {{in many parts of the}} world that depend on the mountain snowpack for water storage. There are currently no methods to remotely sense SWE with accuracy over large <b>lateral</b> <b>distances</b> in the steep and often forested terrain of mountain basins. Previous studies have shown that measurements of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) velocity can provide accurate estimates of SWE in dry snow. Introduction of liquid water into the snowpack results in a three-phase system that cannot be accurately characterized with GPR velocity alone. We show that measuring the frequency-dependent GPR signal attenuation and velocity provides a direct estimate of the complex dielectric permittivity. Because the imaginary component is a function only of liquid water content, we can utilize both the real and imaginary components of the permittivity to estimate liquid water content, snow density, and SWE using existing empirical relationships that are valid in the pendular regime. We tested this new method at two field sites and found that the estimates were accurate to within 12 % of gravimetric methods in both a moist and a dry snowpack. GPR has the potential to provide SWE estimates across large <b>lateral</b> <b>distances</b> over a broad range of snow conditions...|$|R
50|$|Astasia-abasia {{refers to}} the {{inability}} to either stand or walk in a normal manner. Astasia {{refers to the}} inability to stand upright unassisted. Abasia refers to lack of motor coordination in walking. The term abasia literally means that the base of gait (the <b>lateral</b> <b>distance</b> between the two feet) is inconstant or unmeasurable. When seen in conversion disorder, the gait is bizarre and is not suggestive of a specific organic lesion: often the patient sways wildly and nearly falls, recovering at the last moment.|$|E
50|$|When one engine becomes inoperative, a {{yawing moment}} develops, the {{magnitude}} of which {{is equal to the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>distance</b> of the thrust vector of the operative engine to the center of gravity (C.G.), also called moment arm, multiplied by the thrust of the engine. In addition, a rolling moment might develop due to asymmetrical propulsive lift generated by the wing section behind the operative propeller. These moments yaw and/ or roll the aircraft towards the inoperative engine, a tendency which must be counteracted by the pilot's use of the flight controls: rudder and ailerons. Due to P-factor, a clockwise rotating right-hand propeller on the right wing typically develops its resultant thrust vector at a greater <b>lateral</b> <b>distance</b> from the aircraft's C.G. than the clockwise rotating left-hand propeller (Figure 1). The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger remaining yawing moment by the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice versa. Since the operating right-hand engine produces a larger yawing moment, the pilot will need to use larger control deflections in order to maintain aircraft control, or a higher speed. Thus, the failure of the left-hand engine is less desirable than failure of the right-hand engine, and the left-hand engine is called critical.|$|E

40|$|Diblock {{copolymers}} (BCPs) show {{phase separation}} on mesoscopic length scales and form ordered morphologies in both bulk and thin films, the latter resulting in nanostructured surfaces. Morphologies in thin films are strongly in fluenced by film parameters, {{the ratio of}} film thickness and bulk domain spacing. Laterally structured polymer surfaces may serve as templates for controlled assembly of nanoparticles (NPs). We investigated the BCP of poly(n-pentyl methacrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) which show bulk morphologies of stacked lamellae or hexagonally packed cylinders. Thin films were investigated by atomic force microscopy and grazing-incidence small-angleX-ray scattering. For film thicknesses fwell below d$_{bulk}$, standing cylinder morphologies were observed in appropriate molar ratios, while film thicknesses around and larger than d$_{bulk}$ resulted in cylinders arranged parallel to surface. To alter and/or improve the morphology also in presence of different NPs (e. g., silica, gold), solvent vapour annealing (SVA) was applied. The BCP morphology usually remains unchanged but periodicities change depending on type and amount of incorporated NPs. It was found that silica clusters enlarge <b>lateral</b> <b>distances</b> of cylinders, whereas Au NPs reduce it. The effect of SVA is weak. The quality of morphology is slightly improved by SVA and <b>lateral</b> <b>distances</b> remain constant or are slightly reduced...|$|R
