60|$|The House {{knows that}} the Minority Report advocates a system of {{compulsory}} <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges,</b> that no person shall engage any man {{for less than a}} month except through a <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange.</b> That is not the proposal we are making. We are making a proposal of voluntary <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges.</b> I am quite ready to admit that no system of voluntary <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> can deal adequately with the evils and difficulties of casual labour; but there is one conclusive reason against compulsory <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> at the present time. To establish a system of compulsory <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> in order to eliminate casual labour, and so to divide among a certain proportion of workers all available employment, would be absolutely and totally to cast out at the other end a surplus of unemployed: and to do this before preparations have been made for dealing with that surplus, would be to court an administrative breakdown which could not fail to be attended with the gravest possible disaster. Until poor law reform has made further progress, to establish a compulsory system of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> would only increase and not diminish the miseries with which we are seeking to cope.|$|R
50|$|In 1908 Beveridge was {{commissioned}} {{to devise a}} scheme which would combine <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> with a new government-funded unemployment benefit. The <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> Bill was rushed through Parliament and passed in September 1909 and, after months of planning and recruitment of clerks, 62 <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> were opened on 1 February 1910. The number of offices rose to 430 within four years. At the suggestion of the Prime Minister David Lloyd-George, from January 1917 the <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> came under the new Ministry of Labour and were renamed Employment Exchanges, so as to more accurately reflect their purpose and function.|$|R

The {{increasing}} {{process of}} globalization induces {{some changes in}} the labour market. Long-term unemployment {{is one of the most}} relevant and intractable problem in the Lithuania. Consequently, efficient services of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> are the measures, which help long-term unemployed persons to integrate into the labour market. Services of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> are dedicated for unemployed persons to help identify their interests, to develop their career planning and career management skills, to create effective career plans, also services of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> help long-term unemployed persons to adapt to the labour market changes, to integrate into the labour market. The subject of the investigation is services provided by the specialists of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange,</b> who are working with long-term unemployed persons. The aim of the present study is to evaluate services provided by the specialists of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange,</b> who are working with long-term unemployed persons. The theoretical and practical results (the hypothetical model of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> specialist’s competences) reveal the novelty of the article. The article consists of three parts: the first part gives the information about longterm unemployed persons, services of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange.</b> In this part there also the aspects of unemployment and concept of the profession have been examined. Hypothetical model of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> specialist’s competences have been created in the second part. This hypothetical model helps to identify the main and fundamental competences of specialists of <b>labour</b> <b>exchange.</b> The quantitative research of long-term unemployed persons and their opinion about services of labour market have been presented in the third part of this study. This research has been presented in the article in order to evaluate long-term unemployment of Šiauliai city about services of labour market and the benefit of these services to their integration into the labour market.

25|$|In 1906, the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 was {{amended to}} include laundries, {{and under the}} <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> Act 1909 <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> were set up {{in order to help}} {{unemployed}} people find work, by providing centres where a large number of employers and the unemployed could post jobs and apply for them respectively. By February 1910, eighty-three <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> were open, and proved to be invaluable in helping people find employment. In 1913 these <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> were putting around 3000 people into a job each day. Another measure taken was the 1909 Development Fund, which was an attempt to provide work in times of Depression. This fund was devoted to increasing employment opportunities through measures such as afforestation and the provision of smallholdings in the countryside. In addition, the government encouraged the adoption of Fair Wages contracts by local authorities. In 1908, special regulations were made for electrical safety.|$|R

If all <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> adopted a more supply-oriented approach, the average placement percentage would increase by about 10 %. If, in addition, each <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> had one additional staff member to carry out the scheme, a 20 % increase in total placements would occur. ...|$|R

60|$|I do not, therefore, {{propose to}} occupy {{the time of the}} House with any {{elaborate}} justification of the merits of the Bill. Those we may discuss at our leisure later. I confine myself only to a few general observations. Two main defects in modern industrial conditions which were emphasised by the Royal Commission were the lack of mobility of labour and lack of information. With both of these defects the National System of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> is calculated to deal. Modern industry has become national. Fresh means of transport knit the country into one, as it was never knit before. Labour alone in its search for markets has not profited; the antiquated, wasteful, and demoralising method of personal application--that is to say, the hawking of labour--persists. <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> will give <b>labour</b> {{for the first time a}} modernised market. <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges,</b> in the second place, will increase and will organise the mobility of labour. But let me point out that to increase the mobility of labour is not necessarily to increase the movement of <b>labour.</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> will not increase the movement of labour; they will only render that movement, when it has become necessary, more easy, more smooth, more painless, and less wasteful.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccording to {{the data}} of European {{globalization}} adjustment fund (EGF) the re-employment rate {{at the end of}} the EGF measures in Lithuanian construction sector constitutes 74 %, furniture industry - 65 %, wearing apparel sector - 62 %. However, Ex-post evaluation of EGF showed that the re-employment rate 12 months later is characterized by considerable downward trends and reaches only 57 % in construction sector, 63 % in the furniture industry and 56 % in wearing apparel sector. According to data of Lithuanian <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange</b> circa 35 % of jobseekers, who took part in vocational training and after that got a job, return back as unemployed persons to the <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange.</b> As a result, in the companies the employee turnover is increasing, and that has a negative impact on performance of organizations.

60|$|We have, therefore, {{decided that}} {{our system of}} <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> shall be {{voluntary}} in its character. For that very reason {{there is a great}} danger, to which I have never shut my eyes, that the highest ranks of labour, skilled workers, members of strong trade unions, would not think it necessary to use the Exchanges, but would use the very excellent apparatus which they have established themselves; that therefore this expensive system of Exchanges which we are calling into being would come to be used only by the poorest of the workers in the labour market, and, consequently, would gradually relapse and fall back into the purely distress machinery and non-economic machinery from which we are labouring to extricate and separate it. It is for that reason, quite apart from the merits of the scheme of unemployment insurance, that the Government are very anxious to associate with their system of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> a system of unemployed insurance. If <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> depend for their effective initiation and establishment upon unemployment insurance being associated with them, it is equally true to say that no scheme of unemployment insurance can be worked except in conjunction with some apparatus for finding work and testing willingness to work, like <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges.</b> The two systems are complementary; they are man and wife; they mutually support and sustain each other.|$|R
