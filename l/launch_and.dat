50|$|According to the Israel Security Agency's annual report, Palestinians {{carried out}} 150 rocket <b>launches</b> <b>and</b> 215 mortar <b>launches</b> at Israel during the year.

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to <b>launch,</b> <b>and</b> fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|On {{very rare}} occasions, a {{combination}} of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the <b>launch,</b> <b>and</b> the wind can stall a train {{on the top of the}} tower. When this happens, a mechanic takes the elevator to the top and pushes the train down the hill.|$|E
5|$|A {{complementary}} telescope, {{looking at}} even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel {{was not designed}} to be serviced after <b>launch,</b> <b>and</b> had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.|$|E

One explanation for this decision is that Samsung wanted to minimize the time between its <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> availability. The keynote address of the hour-long event was delivered by Loesje De Vriese, Marketing Director of Samsung Belgium.|$|E

Following his retirement, Gugelmin put his Florida mansion in Coral Gables up for sale for $17 million, and moved back to live in Brazil full-time. He runs the family business along with his brother, Alceu, and has also done consultancy work for Mercedes-Benz subsidiary AMG. Both his surviving sons compete in go-kart events.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{decided to}} build a class of two {{submarine}} tenders which could be converted into light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers. The first ship, Tsurugizaki, was commissioned into service in 1939. Construction of the second, Takasaki, was stopped soon after <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> she was completed as an aircraft carrier. The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940. In early 1941, Tsurugizaki {{was taken out of}} service, converted to an aircraft carrier, and recommissioned as Shōhō in early 1942.|$|E
5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E

5|$|STS-8 was {{the eighth}} NASA Space Shuttle mission {{and the third}} flight of the Space Shuttle Challenger. It {{launched}} on August 30, 1983 and landed on September 5, conducting the first night <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> night landing of the Space Shuttle program. It also carried the first African-American astronaut, Guion Bluford. The mission successfully achieved all of its planned research objectives, but was marred by the subsequent discovery that a solid-fuel rocket booster had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during the launch.|$|E

5|$|The Commodore 64, Dragon 32, Oric-1 and Atmos, BBC Micro {{and later}} the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s.

MECO follows the instant of spacecraft separation from the upper stage. The planetary launch program during 1966 - 1978 involved 23 Centaur <b>launches</b> <b>and</b> led to no upper stage reentry; LEO missions for HEAO and OAO satellite lofting in 1963 - 1979 involved nine Centaur <b>launches</b> <b>and</b> led to five reentries.

5|$|The {{first four}} M-class shipsM, N, O, and Pwere 178 meters long at the waterline, and 183 meters long overall.

The ships had a {{designed}} displacement of 8,500metric tons, but displaced 7,800tons at standard load and 10,400tons fully laden. The ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 men. They were designed to carry one picket boat, a barge, a <b>launch,</b> <b>and</b> two cutters.|$|E
5|$|The nickel {{hydrogen}} battery {{was used}} {{for the first time in}} 1977 aboard the U.S. Navy's Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2).

In the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009, more than 19 years after <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> 13 years beyond their design life.|$|E
