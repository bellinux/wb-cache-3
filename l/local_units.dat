5|$|After 10:00 am the {{situation}} rapidly deteriorated when provocateurs came into action, claiming {{that members of}} the negotiating delegation had been arrested. The <b>local</b> <b>units</b> of the regular police (Milicja Obywatelska) were unable to contain the crowd and {{the situation}} turned into a violent uprising as the crowds stormed the prison at Młyńska Street, where some protesters believed the members of the delegation to have been imprisoned; hundreds of prisoners were released around 10:50 am. At 11:30 am, the arms depot at the prison building was seized and the firearms were distributed among the demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{handed over}} the {{administration}} of eastern Herzegovina to the NDH government on 20 May 1941, following {{the signing of the}} Treaties of Rome, which ceded formerly Yugoslav territory along the Adriatic coast to Italy. The Italians did not immediately withdraw all their troops from the region. The NDH moved quickly to establish its authority in the towns and districts of eastern Herzegovina, which included appointing mayors and prefects, the creation of <b>local</b> <b>units</b> of the Ustaše Militia, and deploying hundreds of gendarmes, Croatian Home Guards and Ustaše Militia units from outside eastern Herzegovina. These forces were brought in to maintain order. The academic Professor Alija Šuljak was appointed the Ustaše commissioner for eastern Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{threw himself}} into the role, {{travelling}} {{around the country and}} inspecting <b>local</b> <b>units</b> to gain an overall idea of their efficiency. Even under favourable circumstances, however, he found that only 54% of the volunteers attended parades in 1906; at the annual camps, the proportion was as low as 45%. He pressed for greater use of active day-time tactical training rather than evening indoors drill, which he felt was key for a part-time volunteer force, and for a greater emphasis on the training and standards of officers. By the end of his second year in office, he had organised local selection boards for appointing officers, and a central promotion board for senior field officers, as well as mandatory regular fitness and efficiency tests.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine possible indicators that affect <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> credit risk and investigate their effect on default (credit risk) of <b>local</b> government <b>units</b> in Croatia. No system for the estimation of <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> credit risk has been established in Croatia so far causing many practical problems in <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> borrowing. Because of the specific nature of the operations of <b>local</b> government <b>units</b> and legislation that does not allow <b>local</b> government <b>units</b> to go into bankruptcy, conventional methods for estimating credit risk are not applicable, and the set of standard potential determinants of credit risk has to be expanded with new indicators. Thus in the paper, in addition to the usual determinants of credit risk, the hypothesis of the influence of political factors on <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> credit risk in Croatia is also tested out, with the use of a Tobit model. Results of econometric analysis show that credit risk of <b>local</b> government <b>units</b> in Croatia is affected by the political structure of local government, the proportion of income tax and surtax in operating revenue, the ratio of net operating balance, net financial liabilities and direct debt to operating revenue, as well as the ratio of debt repayment and cash, and direct debt and operating revenue...|$|R

5|$|<b>Local</b> <b>units</b> {{are called}} {{squadron}}s. A squadron is broken into flights. Squadrons {{are the main}} functioning body of Civil Air Patrol. Civil Air Patrol squadrons are designated as either cadet, senior, or composite squadrons. A CAP composite squadron consists of both cadets and senior members, who {{may be involved in}} any of the three missions of Civil Air Patrol. Composite squadrons have two deputy commanders to assist the squadron commander: a Deputy Commander for Seniors and a Deputy Commander for Cadets. A senior squadron includes only senior members, who participate in the emergency services or aerospace education missions of Civil Air Patrol. A cadet squadron is largely made up of cadets, with a small number of senior members as necessary for supervision of cadets and the proper execution of the cadet program. Overseas squadrons operate independently of this structure, reporting directly to the National Headquarters.|$|E

40|$|Current work {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} <b>local</b> <b>unit,</b> {{microcontroller}} based to acquire signals from a set of sensors and locally diagnose on the air quality. The <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> permits the interface with standards atmospheric and meteorological sensors, as well as the communication with a central unit by message passing protocol, via GSM. A fuzzy inference system has been developed to perform the approximate reasoning process performed by a human being, based on the perception of the environment conditions. The decision algorithm is based on a performance criterion, the one that forces the emergence of the pollution level with minimum communication and maximum environment safety. The processes running at the <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> have been modularly designed within the frame of a Client/Server architecture to ease its gradual growing and maintenance. The <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> bi-directionally communicates with several central units that record and visualize stationary data and acts at the reception of an emergency message.

25|$|Camps {{were not}} {{necessarily}} in remote areas. They were often situated near hamlets, or even within them - with troops taking shelter in individual houses if the village was fully dominated by the guerilla forces.

These <b>local</b> <b>units</b> were crucial in warning, diversion and delay of GVN or US forces if the Main Force element came under attack. Communist forces generally avoided villages with high canal banks, graveyards or trees because such obstacles hindered observation and gave advancing US and ARVN troops cover.
