25|$|Studies {{show that}} doctors can be {{influenced}} by drug company inducements, including gifts and food.

25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{is named}} after The Great Gatsby, a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nobody really knows when or how the concept came about (even though many falsely laid {{claim to be the}} originators because of its popularity) except that it originated in various factories in and around in the 70s. It is believed that the workers from factories in and around Cape Town would share <b>lunches</b> <b>and</b> thus created sandwiches from whatever they had for lunch that day. As the French loaf allowed for extra filling space, they would prefer to use these over traditional bread slices that way it could also be easier shared amongst co-workers. A Gatsby is thus better enjoyed when shared and best served in its largest form.|$|E
