5000|$|Similarly, bit {{stuffing}} replaces these start and end marks with flag {{consisting of a}} special bit pattern (e.g. a 0, six 1 bits and a 0). Occurrences of this bit {{pattern in the data}} to be transmitted are avoided by inserting a bit. To use the example where the flag is 01111110, a 0 is inserted after 5 consecutive 1's in the data stream. The flags and the inserted 0's are removed at the receiving end. This makes for arbitrary <b>long</b> <b>frames</b> and easy synchronization for the recipient. Note that this stuffed bit is added even if the following data bit is 0, which could not be mistaken for a sync sequence, so that the receiver can unambiguously distinguish stuffed bits from normal bits.|$|E

Subframes 2 and 3 together contain the transmitting satellite's ephemeris data. Subframes 4 and 5 contain components of the almanac but each frame contains only 1/25th of the complete almanac; a receiver must process 25 whole frames worth of data to retrieve the entire 15,000 bit almanac message.

In this scheme, long MSDUs should be fragmented to a series of smaller units to be transmitted sequentially one by one and acknowledged as well.

As the result, the independence of source signals decreases greatly at some bins, leading to deteriorated instantaneous BSS and hence significantly reducing convolutive BSS performance in high reverberation [15, 17]. In other words, short frames make the conversion to instantaneous mixture incomplete, while long ones disturb the separation. The conflict becomes severer in highly reverberant environments and lead to the degraded performance.|$|E

3000|$|Besides the {{permutation}} problem, another {{fundamental problem}} also limits {{the performance of}} frequency-domain BSS: the dilemma in determining the STFT analysis frame length [15 – 17].

The conflict is even severer in high reverberation with long mixing filters.

30|$|The first {{conclusion}} {{is that the best}} performing resolution overall is not the best resolution for each and every acoustic event class separately.

This is also the case with “applause” (40 ms), which has a very similar structure in the frequency domain.

Other sounds such as a “laugh” perform in various ways with no strong trend.|$|E
