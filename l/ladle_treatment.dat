The principal aims are to attain ultra-high purity, (especially low interstitial elements) and ultra-cleanliness (by the control of the inclusion content and size). Whereas the steel used to build the Titanic contained 650 ppm sulphur, resulting in MnS stringer-inclusions 25 mm in length, modern quality requirements for arctic pipelines would only allow 10 ppm of sulphur and inclusions in ball-bearing steels must be smaller than 5 µm.

40|$|Scientific and {{practical}} {{interest is the}} application of alloying alloy-modifiers for secondary treatment of high-strength cast iron to stabilize the process of spheroidization graphite and achieving higher physical-mechanical properties of castings. The peculiarity of the high-strength cast irons manufacturing technology is their tendency to supercooling during solidification in the mold. This leads {{to the formation of}} shrinkage defects and structurally free cementite, especially in thin-walled sections of the finished castings. To minimize these effects in foundry practice during production of ductile iron the secondary inoculation is widely used. In this regard, the question of the choice of the additives with effective impact not only on the graphitization process but also on the formation of the metallic base of ductile iron is relevant. The aim of the present work is to study the peculiarities of structure formation in cast iron with nodular graphite when alloying alloy-modifier based on tin with additions of nanoparticles of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes is used for secondary treatment. Melting of iron in laboratory conditions was performed in crucible induction furnace IST- 006 with an acid lining held.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, the {{correlation}} between ladle glaze and non-metallic inclusions in the <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment</b> was studied. A number of industrial trials with full scale ladle and laboratory works were performed to investigate the inclusions in the <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment.</b> BaO was used as tracer in the ladle slag to investigate the effect of slag on inclusion composition {{and the formation of}} non-metallic inclusions by ladle glaze. BaO was detected in the inclusions of all followed heats. This observation showed strong evidence for the generation of non-metallic inclusions by the ladle glaze. The increase of the fractions of BaO containing inclusions and their average content of BaO in the first heat with tracer suggested that the effect of slag on the composition of inclusions was a very slow process. The detachment of ladle glaze and the chemical transformations of oxide solution in the MgO matrix were investigated. The experimental results evidently showed that the ladle glaze could be the source of inclusions continually during the <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment.</b> Samples of liquid oxide solution to simulate the liquid oxide inclusions carried over from EAF were equilibrated with molten steel under controlled atmosphere. The results along with thermodynamic calculation suggested that the SiO 2 content of inclusions from EAF could be considerably reduced by dissolved aluminium in the steel. This would explain the vanishing of inclusions containing high SiO 2 content after deoxidation. Due to the lack of experimental data, the viscosities of slags in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system were measured using the rotating cylinder method in the temperature range of 1720 to 1910 K. Eight different slag compositions related to the secondary steel making operations were selected. Viscosities in this system and its sub-systems were expressed as a function of temperature and composition based on the viscosity model developed earlier at KTH. The activities of oxide components in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 systems at 1873 K were measured by equilibrating liquid slag and metal. Either silicon or copper was used as the metal phase and the oxygen partial pressure was controlled with different mixing rates of Ar and CO gas flow in equilibrium with graphite. Iso-activity lines were drawn from the measured activity values in the isothermal section of the slag systems. Nine series of industrial trials were carried out using the same ladle in each series to examine the effect of ladle slag on the number of non-metallic inclusions in the next heat. It was found that the number of inclusions increased with SiO 2 content of the ladle slag in the previous heat. No clear trends were found for the effects of viscosity and MgO activity of the previous slag on the number of inclusions.

40|$|Ladle {{metallurgical}} processes {{constitute a}} portion of the total production chain of steel from iron ore. With these batch processes, the hot metal or steel transfer ladle is being used as a reactor vessel and a reagent is often injected in order to bring the composition of the hot metal or steel to the specification of the final product. To control and further improve these processes, often use is made of models that predict the course of the processes. Models derived from first principles of mass and energy transport have the advantage over empirical descriptions that predictions outside the established window of operation can be made. The establishment of such a model, however, requires deeper knowledge of the underlying thermo-chemical processes. The purpose of this work is to provide a uniform method {{for the development of a}} model of injection processes in the ladle metallurgy. This will give direction to the development of new models, and will clarify blind spots in the existing knowledge for which further research is required. It is chosen to study two <b>ladle</b> <b>treatments</b> and to develop a reactor model of these, namely the desulphurisation of hot metal by the injection of magnesium and lime, and the modification of inclusions in aluminium killed steel by the injection of calcium. The hot metal desulphurisation has been studied by microscopic analysis of hot metal samples taken during different heats. The top layer of the bath, where the hot metal is in contact with the slag layer, has also been studied. From these analyses, it follows that during the injection of magnesium, magnesium sulphide particles are formed which continue to be present for some time in the hot metal, grow and later on rise out of the bath. This corresponds to the mechanism as has been proposed by G. Irons and R. Guthrie, based on their experiments on a laboratory scale. Due to the differences in scale, however, the accumulation of magnesium sulphide particles in the hot metal plays a significant role in the explanation of sulphur levels observed in the industrial desulphurisation process. The measurements furthermore show that the rise of the particles to the slag layer is partially obstructed by graphite and Ti (C, N) particles that accumulate in the colder surface layer of the hot metal. This creates a layer with a high concentration of MgS-particles that remain unnoticed but can lead to undesirable sulphur pick up in the converter process. It also appears that the MgS particles that rise to the slag layer react with co-injected lime to form MgO and CaS. In order to prevent sulphur reversal by oxidation of MgS in the ambient air, lime should always be injected in a slight excess. During the injection process, iron droplets are thrown up from the spout area. These droplets slowly sink through the slag layer and do not make it back to the hot metal before the end of the injection process. Based on this it can be explained how the hot metal loss depends on the amount of injected magnesium, the hot metal temperature, and the hot metal titanium content. Because these droplets are entrained with the sulphide containing slag during deslagging, this presents a major cost in the form of loss of hot metal. Based on these findings, a reactor model of the hot metal desulphurisation has been developed The mixing in the hot metal bath has been described as an ideally mixed tank reactor, wherein the residence time of injected magnesium and lime has been described by a generic model of the bubble plume. An important aspect of the model is that the total sulphur content is formed by the sulphur that is dissolved in the hot metal and the sulphur which is bound in the MgS particles suspended in the hot metal. The specific surface area of the MgS particles is derived from the microscopic observations and the flotation of the MgS particles is described by a first order rate equation. The predicted development of the concentrations of magnesium and sulphur during the duration of the injection is in good agreement with the measurements which have been made with two treatments. The calcium treatment of aluminium killed steel has been extensively studied by W. Tiekink. Based on the measurements carried out by him on laboratory and industrial scale, the steel bath in the ladle is divided into two reaction zones: a zone plume in which the steel is saturated with calcium and a bulk zone in which initially no calcium is present. In the plume zone CaO and CaS are deposited on the Al 2 O 3 particles. Induced by the bubble plume resulting from the calcium injection, a circulating current flows between these zones. Each zone is modelled by a continuously stirred, ideally mixed tank reactor (CISTR). Carried along with this circulating current, the particles are alternately exposed to high and low levels of calcium activity which ultimately results in a variation in size and composition of the particles. This is modelled by taking a population balance of the particles for each zone containing terms for convection and growth by deposition of CaO and CaS. The results of the model are consistent with the observations when it is assumed that the solubility of calcium in steel amounts to 1 ppm. There is a good prediction of particle sizes and composition, but the CaS content of the particles is slightly overestimated by the model. This is explained by the pick up of oxygen at the surface of the steel which is not yet taken into account in the model. The final conclusion of this work is that the chemical conversion of the hot metal and steel during ladle metallurgical injection processes can be well modelled with a detailed description of nucleation, growth and rise of the product particles in conjunction with a relatively simple macroscopic description of the flow field in the ladle. This can best be achieved by providing a population balance of the product particles in which, to the extent appropriate, terms for nucleation, growth, convection and flotation are included. The flow field in the ladle then is modelled using three CISTR's coupled by circulating currents of liquid metal. These CISTR's represent the three zones that can be distinguished in a ladle stirred by a bubble plume; the plume zone, the recirculation zone and the stagnant zone above the bottom of the ladle. <br/...|$|R

It is known that clusters in liquid steel have a harmful effect on the casting process {{and the quality of the}} final steel product. Therefore, clusters of rare earth metals (REM) were investigated in steel samples of a S 30185 stainless steel grade from a pilot trial (PT, 250 kg) and from an industrial heat (IH, 100 t). Samples were taken from the liquid steel at differentholding times after the addition of a mischmetal. The morphology, composition, number and size of clusters in PT and IH steel samples were analyzed and compared as a function of the holding time. It was found that typical clusters with regular and irregular inclusions were the main type of clusters (69 %- 98 %) in all PT and IH steel samples. The composition of inclusions in clusters corresponded mostly to REM-oxides. The size of clusters that were observed in different samples varied mainly from 2 to 23 μm. In addition, the size and number of most clusters in PT are larger than those in IH samples. Largesize inclusions are recognized to be crucially harmful for the mechanical properties of steel products. Therefore, predictionsof the maximum size of Al 2 O 3 -CaO spherical inclusions in an Fe- 10 mass% Ni alloy have been examined based on two dimensional (2 D) and three dimensional (3 D) investigations. The effects of the number of measurements and unit volume on the estimated 3 D results were also investigated. QC 20140526 </p...|$|E

This thesis presents a formulation of coupled electromagnetic and fluid flow equations. The coupled electromagnetic and fluid flow equations are solved using the finite element method in two and three-dimensions.

To substantiate the adequacy and appropriateness of simulation results the operational trials were carried out in a 75 t commercial ladle-furnace facility using varied values of gas flow rates. The results of plant experiments revealed the relationships between average desulphurization rate as well as arc heating rate and mixing efficiency.

It was stressed that incorporating slag-metal reactions into the mass transfer modelling strongly would enhance {{the reliability and}} amount of information to be analyzed from the CFD calculations.   In the present work, a thermodynamic model taking all the involved slag metal reactions into consideration was incorporated into a 2 -D fluid flow model of an argon stirred ladle. Both thermodynamic constraints and mass balance were considered. The activities of the oxide components in the slag phase were described using the thermodynamic model by Björkvall and the liquid metal using the dilute solution model. Desulphurization was simulated using the sulphide capacity model developed by KTH group. A 2 -D fluid flow model considering the slag, steel and argon phases was adopted.   The model predictions were compared with industrial data and the agreement was found quite satisfactory.

40|$|The aim of {{the process}} is to produce silicon for {{crystallization}} into ingots that can be sliced to wafers for processing into photovoltaic cells. If the potential purity can be realized, the silicon will also be applicable for ribbon pulling techniques where the purification during crystallization is negligible. The process consists of several steps: selection and purification of raw materials, carbothermic reduction of silica, <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment,</b> casting, crushing, leaching, and melting.

The most difficult specifications to fulfill are the low contents of boron, phosphorus, and carbon.

During cooling carbon will precipitate as silicon carbide crystals, which will be harmful in solar cells. The cost of this solar silicon will depend strongly on the scale of production.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{a study of}} the {{mechanisms}} of hydrogen control pickup during <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment</b> was undertaken. Previous studies showed that the presence of hydroxyl ions in the ladle slag resulteds in hydrogen transfer from the slag back into the steel bath. The main focus of the present work was therefore to gain deeper knowledge of the ladle slag, its properties and impact on hydrogen concentration in the liquid steel. For this purpose a number of slag compositions were examined in order to clarify whether these slags were single liquids at 1858 K. 14 out of 27 compositions in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system werewas completely melted, while the rest had solid shape present. These results were in disagreement with the existing phase diagram.   Water solubility measurements were carried out by employing a thermo gravimetric technique. The temperature was found to have negligible effect in the water solubilities. The experimental results showed that the water capacity values varied between 1 · 103 and 2 · 103 in the majority of the composition range. However, for compositions close to CaO saturation the water capacity value could reach higher than 3 · 103. The experimental determined water capacity was further used to develop a water capacity model for the quaternary slag system Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2. The model was constructed by considering the effects of the binary interactions between the cations in the slag on the capacity of capturing hydroxyl ions. The model calculations agreed reasonably well with the experimental results {{as well as with the}} literature data.   The water capacity model was used in the last part of the present thesis in order to determine the major source for hydrogen pick-up of the steel after vacuum degassing but before casting. For this purpose, samples of slag and metal were taken at different stages ofduring <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment</b> at SSAB. Hydrogen increase after vacuum treatment was observed. Moisture contents of the industrial slag were analysed and the water capacities of the slags were calculated. It could be seen that the hydrogen increase was correlated to the amount of moisture in the slag and the water capacity. The study showed that the slag containing most water was also the heat having the largest hydrogen increase. The slag with most water had the highest water capacity. It could be concluded that the major source for hydrogen coming back into the steel was due to the slag-metal reaction. A tentative process model to predict the final contents of hydrogen and nitrogen after tundish process was attempted. More work is needed to improve the model. QC 20150825 </p...|$|E
40|$|To keep up {{with the}} tough {{competition}} today {{and to be able to}} offer the customers competitive prices, it is desirable to shorten the <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment</b> and still keep a high quality of the product. To be able to shorten the <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment</b> under these restrictions, faster deoxidation process is demanded. This master’s thesis investigates what influences the reaction coefficient, which describes the separation rate of oxygen. A higher reaction coefficient indicates a fast separation rate. Special attention has been taken to the factor reoxidation, with regard to the nitrogen pick up after tapping and an increase of the oxygen content after degassing. The reaction coefficient has been calculated for four steel groups, two silicon deoxidised groups, one silicon and aluminium deoxidised group and one aluminium deoxidised steel group. The apparent deoxidation is in the reality the sum of two phenomena: deoxidation and reoxidation. An increase of the deoxidation rate or a decrease of the reoxidation rate would result in a higher k-value. A small increase of the reaction coefficient could gain minutes in the process of oxygen removal, which would result in economical benefits. The deoxidisers have naturally a strong effect on the oxygen content and thus on the reaction coefficient. The fastest separation – highest reaction coefficient – after tapping is found for steel groups deoxidised with the strongest deoxidiser: aluminium. Reoxidation occurs after tapping/before degassing due to the breakthrough eye caused by the strong gas injection. By using nitrogen as a tracer for reoxdiation from the atmosphere it was possible to determine if reoxidation had an effect on the deoxidation rate, which it had since the reaction coefficient decreases as the nitrogen content increases. Stirring makes deoxidation quicker, but on the other hand, too intensive stirring retards the deoxidation rate somewhat due to reoxidation. An optimisation of the gas flow rate might be useful to get an optimum relation between deoxidation and reoxdiation, where the fastest separation of oxides is achieved. The deoxidisers have an effect on the oxygen content after degassing and in the tundish. Reoxidation can occur during these time steps too, but most probably not due to reactions with the atmosphere, since the nitrogen content is stable. The oxygen content increases for the silicon deoxidised heats after degassing due to a higher iron oxide content in the top slag. Thus, the FeO content in the slag is too high to keep the low oxygen content in the steel stable. The heats with higher amount of deoxidisers in the steel tend to be able to stay at a lower oxygen concentration too. Though, in the later parts of the process additional alumina formation should be avoided for the best separation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{there is}} a high demand on clean steel for high {{performance}} materialproperties. Thus, steel producers try to deliver a steel product with the highestquality and cleanliness to the market. The number of parameters that affect thesteel cleanliness may vary depending on the required material properties of thefinal product. However, the non-metallic inclusion characteristics represent one ofthe most important parameters. More specifically, the composition, size, numberand morphology affect steel cleanliness. In this work, selected parameters affectingthe inclusion characteristics were studied using the following methods: i) thermodynamic calculations (including computational thermodynamiccalculations), ii) inclusion determinations using a cross sectional (CS) method (2 Dinvestigations) and iii) inclusion determinations using an electrolytic extraction(EE) method (3 D investigations). The computational thermodynamic calculations of the slag-steel and inclusion-steelequilibriums were carried out using the Thermo-Calc software. With the help ofthese calculations, the influence of the slag carryover on the top slag, aluminumcontent in steel and sulfur distribution ratio as well as predictions of stable phasesof inclusions were studied. In addition, inclusion determinations of tool steel gradesamples collected during various stages of the <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment</b> in a scrap-based steelplant were carried out using both 2 D and 3 D methods. Furthermore, inclusiondeterminations of bearing steel grade samples from a runner system after ingotcasting were performed using a 2 D metallographic method (CS-method). Also, theINCAFeature software was used, when using cross sectional method, in order tocollect more statistics of the inclusion characteristics. It was found that slag carryover has a large influence on the composition of theactual top slag as well as the aluminum content in the steel as well as the sulfurdistribution ratio. In addition, steel and slag were found to be in “near”-equilibriumconditions, after the completion of the vacuum degassing operation. Furthermore,the composition of small-size inclusions in samples taken from tool steel was foundto be very scattered. Moreover, the composition of the large-size inclusions wasfound to be less scattered. Furthermore, closer to the top slag composition insamples collected after vacuum degassing. Finally, the accuracy of the inclusioncomposition determinations of tool steel samples using the electrolytic extractionmethod was found to be better than for the cross sectional method. The worseaccuracy of the CS-method is due to a considerable effect of matrix elements oninclusion composition. QC 2010070...|$|E
40|$|Al–O {{relations}} in iron were investigated. Pure iron with varying Al content was equilibrated at 1873 K. The oxygen content of iron with higher Al content than 1. 0 mass % {{was found to}} be much lower than previous works, while the oxygen content for Al content less than 1 mass% {{was found to be}} slightly higher. Further, a classification procedure of inclusions was developed using the commercial software INCA Feature. Three classes were made, spinel, TP-(CaO-Al 2 O 3), and (CaO-Al 2 O 3) class, corresponding to the inclusions found during degassing at Uddeholm Tooling. The results showed that the spinel phase disappeared after degassing along with a reduction in numbers for the two phase inclusion (TP-(CaO-Al 2 O 3)). Pure calcium aluminates however showed an increasing trend in a majority of the heats. The chemical development of inclusions at OVAKO Steel in Hofors, Sweden was also established. According to the morphologies and compositions, the inclusions were classified into 5 different types, namely, (1) alumina inclusions, (2) calcium aluminate, (3) spinel+calcium aluminate, (4) calcium aluminate surrounded by a CaS shell, and (5) spinel+calcium aluminate surrounded by a CaS shell. Thereafter refractory lining samples with attached slag layer were taken from used ladles at the two steel plants. The morphologies of the slag layers and the phases present were examined. The precipitated phases found in the refractory were 3 CaO. Al 2 O 3, MgO. Al 2 O 3 and CaO in the case of Ovako Steel and 3 CaO. Al 2 O 3 and 2 CaO. SiO 2 in the case of Uddeholm Tooling. To help the understanding, model calculations using THERMOCALC were carried out. The model predictions differed somewhat from the experimental observation, the predicted major phases were in line with the EDS analysis on the refractory samples. Finally experiments were carried out to study the slag entrainment related to the open-eye during <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment.</b> Ga-In-Sn alloy was used to simulate the liquid steel, while MgCl 2 -Glycerol(87 %) solution was used to simulate the ladle slag. No noticeable amount of top liquid was observed in any of the samples taken from the metal bulk during gas stirring. To confirm this aspect, slag-metal interface samples were taken from an industrial gas stirred steel ladle. No entrapment was found in the steel. The accordance of the laboratory and industrial results suggests that the entrainment of slag into the steel bulk around the open-eye cannot be considered as the major contribution to inclusion formation.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} theformation and chemical development of non-metallic inclusionsduring <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment</b> of steel. To begin with, {{an investigation of the}} deoxidation processand the impact of aluminium addition was carried out. For thispurpose, a new experimental setup was constructed. The setupallowed the examination of the deoxidation process as afunction of time by using a quenching technique. Preliminaryexperiments showed that homogeneous nucleation of alumina tookplace in the areas supersaturated with aluminium. Theseexperiments also showed that agglomeration of alumina particleswas a very rapid process, even when the convection in the meltwas negligible. In order to examine whether aluminium supersaturation occursduring industrial practice, the deoxidation of liquid steelwith aluminium wire injection in a gas-stirred ladle wassimulated by mathematical modeling using a Computational FluidDynamics (CFD) approach. The results showed that theconcentration of aluminium {{in the vicinity of the}} aluminiumwire injection was high enough to generate homogeneousnucleation of alumina. Aiming at an understanding of the inclusion chemistry duringthe ladle process, an industrial study was performed atUddeholm Tooling AB. The impact of slag-lining reactions andladle glaze as a source of inclusions in the melt was alsostudied. The experimental results were analysed from athermodynamic viewpoint to gain an insight into the origins ofthe inclusions and their changes along the process of the ladletreatment. Six types of inclusions were found in the steel. Thetypes of inclusions present varied along the history of theladle treatment. Three types of inclusions were found in theliquid steel before deoxidation, namely type A (a liquidinclusion with high SiO 2 concentration), type B (spinel) andtype C (a combination of type A and type B). Thermodynamicanalysis indicated that these types of inclusions could begenerated by the reaction between the Electric Arc Furnace(EAF) slag and the ladle glaze, during the filling of theladle. The addition of aluminium resulted in the formation ofalumina inclusions (type E), which agglomerated and separatedfrom the steel very fast. The spinel inclusions of type B werefound to be unstable at low oxygen potentials. The inclusionsof this type would react with the liquid metal forming theinclusions of type F (spinel in the centre surrounded by anoxide solution containing Al 2 O 3, CaO and MgO). Further,reaction between the liquid metal and inclusions of type Fwould result in the inclusions of type G, an oxide solutionmostly consisting of Al 2 O 3 and CaO with small amounts of MgOand SiO 2. The inclusions of type G were the only inclusionsfound in the steel before casting. NR 2014080...|$|E
40|$|The present work is {{to study}} slag {{phenomena}} in steelmaking process. In order to attain thegoal, a number of high temperature experiments and simulation experiments were carried out. Four master slags were used to study the effect of CaF 2 on slag viscosity. Experimentalresults indicated the effect of CaF 2 on slag viscosity depended strongly on the composition ofmaster slag. For high basicity slags, CaF 2 mainly suppressed the precipitation of solid phasesat lower temperatures, leading to a lower viscosity compared to CaF 2 -free slags. For slagswith higher SiO 2 contents, CaF 2 both lowered the viscosity of the liquid phase and suppressedthe precipitation of solid phases. The viscosities of solid-liquid mixtures were experimentally determined for silicon oilparaffinsystem at room temperature and solid-liquid oxide mixture at steelmakingtemperature. The results of both measurements indicated that the increasing trend of mixturesviscosity with particle fraction can be described by Einstein-Roscoe equation. Silicone oils of different viscosities were used to simulate slag foaming. The experimentalresults showed, at a constant viscosity, the foaming height increased first with superficialvelocity before reaching a maximum value. Thereafter, the foaming height decreased with thefurther increase of the superficial velocity. Similar, a maximum foaming height was observedat an optimum viscosity when a constant superficial gas velocity was applied. Based on theexperimental data, a semi-empirical equation of foaming height was developed. Thepredictions of the model agreed well with experiment data. The model could also reasonablywell explain the industrial pilot trial experiments. Water-silicon oils model and liquid alloy (Ga-In-Sn) - 12 % HCl acid model were employed tosimulate the formation of open-eyes in a gas stirred ladle. The experimental results indicatedthat the viscosity of the top liquid and the interfacial {{tension between the two}} liquids had onlylittle effect on the open-eye size. A semi-empirical model was developed to describe the sizeof open-eye as functions of the gas flow rate, bath height and slag height. The two sets ofparameters obtained for the water and Ga-In-Sn models were very different. Industrial trialswere also conducted to examine the applicability of the models. Liquid alloy model couldwell predict the formation of an open-eye during <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment.</b> Two cold models, sodium tungstate-oil model and water-oil model, were carried out tosimulate the formation of droplets in a gas stirred ladle.

40|$|The {{effects of}} melting {{atmosphere}} and charge material type on the metallic and alloy recovery of ferrous charge materials were investigated in {{two sets of}} experiments (Tasks 1 and 2). In addition, thermodynamic studies were performed (Task 3) to determine the suitability of <b>ladle</b> <b>treatment</b> {{for the production of}} ductile iron using scrap charge materials high in manganese and sulfur. Task 1 [...] In the first set of experiments, the charge materials investigated were thin steel scrap, thick steel scrap, cast iron scrap, and pig iron in the rusty and clean states. Melting atmospheres in this set of experiments were varied by melting with and without a furnace cover. In this study, it was found that neither covered melting nor melting clean (non-rusty) ferrous charge materials improved the metallic recovery over the recovery experienced with uncovered melting or rusty charge materials. However, the silicon and manganese recoveries were greater with covered melting and clean materials. Silicon and manganese in the molten iron react with oxygen dissolved in the iron from uncovered melting and oxidized iron (surface rust). Silica and manganese silicates are formed which float to the slag decreasing recoveries of silicon and manganese. Cast iron and pig iron had higher metallic recoveries than steel scrap. Carbon recovery was affected by the carbon content of the charge materials, and not by the melting conditions. Irons with higher silicon contents had higher silicon recovery than irons with lower silicon contents. Task 2 [...] In the second set of experiments, briquetted turnings and borings were used to evaluate the effects of briquette cleanliness, carbon additions, and melting atmosphere on metallic and alloy recovery. The melting atmosphere in this set of experiments was varied by melting in air and with an argon atmosphere using the SPAL process. In this set of experiments, carbon additions to the briquettes were found to have the greatest effect on metallic and alloy recovery. The use of an argon atmosphere was also found to increase recoveries, but to a lesser extent than with carbon additions to the briquettes. Task 3 [...] Finally, thermodynamic studies were carried out to evaluate the potential for removing manganese and sulfur from iron melts for the production of ferritic ductile iron. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that manganese and sulfur might be removed from iron melts by careful control of the temperature and slag. In laboratory tests however, it was shown that the removal of sulfur was much less successful than that indicated by the thermodynamic analyses...|$|E
