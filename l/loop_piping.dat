It focuses {{on the impact of}} building fabric, area and rooms’ layout on both the system‘s performance and thermal comfort. The building integration of the distribution pipework is sensitively examined through an experimental analysis of a case study; a residence in South Europe, using dynamic thermal simulation and numerical modeling. It is found that pipe losses - regarded both as energy wastage and heat gains to the space - can be significant but also controlled if the pipe network is carefully planned. The results show that collector loop losses can be comparable to tank losses for most of the year or even higher in some months, and that the management of the collector <b>loop</b> <b>piping</b> length can be more effective in controlling these losses than improving the pipes’ insulation. The analysis further shows that there are times when distribution losses have the potential to cause noticeable local overheating e. g. long piping length or piping route passing through narrow spaces like corridors and lobbies...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this design {{analysis}} and calculation is to size a circulating pump for the service hot water system in the Shop Building 5006, {{in accordance with the}} Uniform Plumbing Code (Section 4. 4. 1) and U.

This consists of determining the total heat transfer from the service hot water system piping to the surrounding environment. The heat transfer is then used to define the total pumping capacity based on a given temperature change in the circulating hot water as it flows through the closed <b>loop</b> <b>piping</b> system. The total pumping capacity is used to select a pump model from manufacturer's literature. This established the head generation for that capacity and particular pump model.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{results of}} a preliminary evaluation to determine the operating conditions for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) that will transfer heat from the reactor primary system to the demonstration hydrogen production plant(s). The Department of Energy is currently investigating two primary options {{for the production of}} hydrogen using a high temperature reactor as the power source. These options are the High Temperature Electrolysis (HTE) and Sulfur-Iodine (SI) thermochemical hydrogen production processes. However, since the SI process relies entirely on process heat from the reactor, while the HTE process relies primarily on electrical energy with only a small amount of process heat required, the design of the IHX is dictated by the SI process heat requirements. Therefore, the IHX operating conditions were defined assuming 50 MWt is available for the production of hydrogen using the SI process. Three configurations for the intermediate loop were evaluated, including configurations for both direct and indirect power conversion systems. The HYSYS process analysis software was used to perform sensitivity studies to determine the influence of reactor outlet temperatures, intermediate loop working fluids (helium and molten salt), intermediate loop pressures, and intermediate <b>loop</b> <b>piping</b> lengths on NGNP performance and IHX operating conditions.

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued Bulletin 88 - 08 in {{response}} to thermal fatigue failures that occurred at three plants in unisolable portions of piping systems attached to the reactor coolant <b>loop</b> <b>piping.</b> The failure mechanism was thermal stratification caused by valve leakage, and thermal cycling, caused by turbulence penetration. The EPRI Materials Reliability Project (MRP) is currently undertaking a project to develop improved guidelines for screening, evaluation, inspection, and monitoring of thermal fatigue. One of the first steps in developing such guidelines has been to collect operating experience data from domestic PWR plants, to {{gain an understanding of}} the quantity and severity of thermal fatigue damage that has actually occurred. By reviewing the failure locations, mechanisms, monitoring results, and corrective actions, more effective tools that address the root causes of actual failures can be developed. The operating experience data collected consists of two groups: major leak events in domestic and foreign plants, and precursors to leakage, such as thermal monitoring results and observed anomalies in domestic plants. Both sets of data will be available to utilities for review in a database format. The emphasis in this paper will be on the latter group, reviewing the experiences of domestic utilities in implementing monitoring and inspection activities {{in response}} to the Bulletin.

The use of passive cooling systems both during the accident and operation become reliable in the advanced reactor safety systems.

50|$|The RPV and Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) have {{significant}} improvements, {{such as the}} substitution of RIPs, eliminating conventional external recirculation <b>piping</b> <b>loops</b> and pumps in the containment that in turn drive jet pumps producing forced flow in the RPV. RIPs provide significant improvements related to reliability, performance and maintenance, including a reduction in occupational radiation exposure related to containment activities during maintenance outages. These pumps are powered by wet-rotor motors with the housings connected {{to the bottom of}} the RPV and eliminating large diameter external recirculation pipes that are possible leakage paths. The 10 internal recirculation pumps are located at the bottom of the annulus downcomer region (i.e., between the core shroud and the inside surface of the RPV). Consequently, internal recirculation pumps eliminate all of the jet pumps in the RPV, all of the large external recirculation <b>loop</b> pumps and <b>piping,</b> the isolation valves and the large diameter nozzles that penetrated the RPV and needed to suction water from and return it to the RPV. This design therefore reduces the worst leak below the core region to effectively equivalent to a 2 in leak. The conventional BWR3-BWR6 product line has an analogous potential leak of 24 or more inches in diameter. A major benefit of this design is that it greatly reduces the flow capacity required of the ECCS.|$|R

Cook is a two unit Ice Condenser Pressurized Water Reactor (Westinghouse). Unit 1 has completed 22 cycles and refueling outages and Unit 2 has completed 18 cycles and refueling outages. 	Specialty resin was utilitized during the Unit 2 shutdown chemistry protocol to capture and remove Co- 60 from the reactor coolant. A CRUD burst was achieved during the first 48 hours of shutdown with the addition of peroxide to achieve significant CRUD removal from the coolant. The study monitored the dose rates on selected in-plant primary <b>loop</b> <b>piping</b> to provide a comprehensive database of the dose rate changes during the shutdown and Crud burst regimes.

Technical comparisons are made of the cycle 16, 17 and 18 telemetry data to demonstrate the improvements in source term removal. Significant source term improvement was observed during the Unit 2, Cycle 18 refueling outage due to successive uses for the specialty resin after full core replacement after 6 cycles, major high source term piping removal in lower containment (RTD bypass line removal) and use of specialty resin on unit startup to remove nickel. 	Results demonstrate how Cook Unit 2 achieved the lowest record refueling outage dose of 34 person rem for 4 loop, Westinghouse PWR Ice Condenser.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the design, assembly, {{and operation of}} a Pilot-Scale Evaporator built and operated by SRTC in support of Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Project at the DOE's Hanford Site. The WTP employs three identical evaporators, two for the Waste Feed {{and one for the}} Treated LAW. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator was designed to test simulants for both of these waste streams. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator is 1 / 76 th scale in terms of evaporation rates. The basic configuration of forced circulation vacuum evaporator was employed. A detailed scaling analysis was performed to preserve key operating parameters such as basic loop configuration, system vacuum, boiling temperature, recirculation rates, vertical distances between important hardware pieces, reboiler heat transfer characteristics, vapor flux, configuration of demisters and water spray rings. Three evaporation test campaigns were completed. The first evaporation run used water in order to shake down the system. The water runs were important in identifying a design flaw that inhibited mixing in the evaporator vessel, thus resulting in unstable boiling operation. As a result the loop configuration was modified and the remaining runs were completed successfully. Two simulant runs followed the water runs. Test 1 : Simulated Ultrafiltration Recycles with HLW SBS, and Test 2 : Treated AN 102 with Envelop C LAW. Several liquid and offgas samples were drawn from the evaporator facility for regulatory and non-regulatory analyses. During Test 2, the feed and the concentrate were spiked with organics to determine organic partitioning. The decontamination factor (DF) for Test 1 was measured to be 110, 000 (more than the expected value of 100, 000). Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A antifoam agent was tested during both Tests 1 and 2.

Incandescent exit signs have been replaced with LED, reducing energy consumption by 80 - 90 %. Daylight harvesting has also been used to automatically turn off interior lights in areas that receive sunlight. * Motion Sensors - Motion sensors have been installed in thousands of classrooms, offices, conference rooms, and laboratories to turn off lights and set-back thermostats when spaces are unoccupied. * Efficiency Upgrades of Building Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems - Major HVAC systems have been retrofitted to higher efficiency systems, by upgrading the controls, motors, regulation of air flow, and use of energy recovery systems to reduce building energy consumption. * Design Standards for HVAC Systems - Energy efficiency design standards for HVAC systems are implemented on all campus projects to meet or exceed federal and state guidelines. * Energy Management Control System (EMCS) - The EMCS is an automated digital control system for HVAC systems, which monitors, controls, and reports energy use while maintaining comfort in campus buildings. Over the past 16 years the EMCS system has been expanded from fewer than 10 buildings to over 110 buildings comprising approximately 80 % of the campus. * Reduced Building Energy Use and Analysis - All buildings are fully metered for energy consumption. Metering data is analyzed and energy consumption patterns are identified. Buildings showing a potential energy saving opportunities are audited and energy conservation projects are implemented. * Window Film - Window film has been installed on several buildings to reduce radiant heating during the summer months. * Chilled Water Loop - Over 17 miles of underground chilled water <b>loop</b> <b>piping</b> connects major campus buildings to form a loop, reducing the number of chillers required by 75 %. * Campus-wide Energy Conservation Awareness - Faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to conserve energy through the use of advertisements, tours, and presentations...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD thesis work is the computational thermal hydraulic analysis of ITER and DEMO fusion reactors PHTSs; the performances of the cooling loops have been evaluated during normal operation pulsed condition (ITER) and accidental scenario (DEMO). The fusion reaction, {{which is at the}} basis of current tokamak machines, is briefly reported together with a description of the current design status for ITER and DEMO fusion reactors. Also some existing experimental facilities, aimed to test some of the fusion reactors cooling system features, are briefly presented. Then the ITER in-vessel components PHTS (IBED PHTS) is analyzed through the RELAP 5 code during plasma pulse scenario. During the pulsed plasma operation, the pressure and temperature variation within the IBED PHTS shall be controlled and maintained within an acceptable range of values to avoid both potential dangerous pressure fluctuation within the circuit and thermal fatigue to the <b>loop</b> <b>piping</b> and equipment. A set of countermeasure to control the IBED PHTS pressure and temperature and mitigate their fluctuation during the plasma operation is simulated through RELAP 5 and obtained results are shown and discussed. Finally, a temperature and pressure control strategy is proposed, also addressing possible criticalities to be carefully evaluated during the design activities. The reference PHTS layout for DEMO HCPB concept is analyzed, together with its auxiliaries systems, through a novel analytical method, the Functional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis at component level with evaluation of loss of function. The {{objective of}} the FMEA is to analyze the system and its functions and identify possible failure mode associated to the loss of function and hence define representative accidental scenarios to be further investigated. As result of this analysis a set of Postulated Initiating Events is identified and the possible accidental chain sequences discussed in detail, also specifying the severity of the events (e. g. Large and Small Break LOCA). Hence the DEMO PHTS ex-vessel LOCA, one of the identified Postulated Initiating Event in the FMEA, is analyzed by means of MELCOR code. The purpose of the analyses is to evaluate the influence of size and location of the break in terms of pressurization of the pressure confinement system of DEMO. In this section, together with the reference PHTS layout, an alternative loop configuration, whose design has been entirely developed within the thesis activities, is proposed and modeled. Here the dynamic behavior of the pressure and flow rate of the two PHTS layouts is compared, highlighting in which cases (i. e. for which break size and layout) mitigating actions, such as prompt loop isolation through safety valve activation or atmosphere detritiation, can be performed effectively. In the conclusions a rationale for the future fusion reactors PHTS is formulated {{on the basis of the}} consideration rising from the results collected in this work. Here The PHTS control strategy to be adopted to cope with the pulsed regime is discussed; some remarks on potential critical aspect associated to the pulsed operation are highlighted. Emphasis is given also to the preventive PHTS design features which might enhance the overall safety of the reactor. ...|$|E

One of the inportant&# 13; drag reducing agents suggested to improve the flow in pipelines are the suspended powders. &# 13; Approach: In the present study, aluminum powders and zwitrionic surfactant ((3 -(Decyldimethyleammonio) &# 13; propanesulfonate inner salt and 3 -(n-n Dimethylpalmityl-ammonio propanesulfonate) were&# 13; investigated as drag reducing agent in aqueous media. The effect of additive concentration, Reynolds&# 13; number and the testing section length are the main variables investigated. All the experimental work&# 13; was carried in a build up experimental rig that consist of a closed <b>loop</b> experimental <b>piping</b> system. &# 13; Results: The experimental results showed that, the percentage drag reduction Dr (%) increases by&# 13; increasing the additive concentration and Reynolds number with maximum percentage drag reduction&# 13; up to 50 % with only 500 ppm addition concentration. Conclusion: The effect of testing section length&# 13; was not so clear due to the way of introducing the additive to the main flow, that the additive is mixed&# 13; in the main tank and not injected...|$|R
2500|$|Excellent heat transfer. Liquid {{fluoride}} salts, especially LiF based salts, {{have good}} heat transfer properties. Fuel salt such as LiF-ThF4 has a volumetric heat capacity that is around 22% higher than water, FLiBe has around 12% higher heat capacity than water. In addition, the LiF based salts have a thermal conductivity around {{twice that of}} the hot pressurized water in a pressurized water reactor. This results in efficient heat transfer and a compact primary loop. Compared to helium, a competing high temperature reactor coolant, the difference is even bigger. The fuel salt has over 200 times higher volumetric heat capacity as hot pressurized helium and over 3 times the thermal conductivity. A molten salt <b>loop</b> will use <b>piping</b> of 1/5 the diameter, and pumps 1/20 the power, of those required for high-pressure helium, while staying at atmospheric pressure ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Primary <b>loop</b> {{recirculation}} (PLR) <b>piping</b> {{weld joints}} in light water reactor (LWR) environments {{are more susceptible}} to stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Limited experimental work also suggested the complicated material and mechanical property of the fusion zone and the heat affected zone (HAZ) especially in dissimilar weld joints might {{play an important role in}} promoting SCC growth. In our study, different from the former sandwich like weld joint, a model of continuous heterogeneity mechanical property was established, the effect of welded mechanical heterogeneity on the stress-strain field and J-integral along the crack fronts at different locations were simulated in an Alloy 182 -A 533 B dissimilar weld joint by the elastic-plastic finite element method (EPFEM). The results indicate that the crack near the dividing line of base metal (BM) and HAZ has higher resistance to SCC. At the dividing line of HAZ and weld metal (WM), the crack is prone to propagate into the WM, and will present more complex crack morphology and behaviors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo {{independent}} sodium loops under {{common name}} INSOT facilities were constructed in Fast Reactor Technology Group, IGCAR for conducting material testing of PFBR components in dynamic sodium. One loop is utilized for in-sodium Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) and Creep - Fatigue Interaction (CFI) {{studies and the}} second loop for in sodium creep studies. The <b>loop</b> components and <b>piping</b> were constructed using AISI type 316 LN/ 316 L material. The sodium loops were constructed by adopting stringent quality control measures stipulated in relevant international codes. Suitable creep and fatigue testing chambers were designed and developed indigenously. The test chambers were qualified for sodium service before commencement of experiments by conducting trial runs. The sodium purity was achieved by on-line purification method prior to admitting into the test chambers and the purity was maintained during testing. Characterization of sodium in the loops during test run were carried out by foil equilibration technique, electro-chemical carbon meter and chemical analysis of sodium sample drawn from the loop using state of art sampling techniques. A versatile PLC based instrumentation system has been successfully implemented for monitoring and controlling the process parameters. Safety interlocks were provided by hardware logic to ensure reliability...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{sustainable}} design is to utilize the natural resources offered by the surrounding environment. Considering the drought conditions {{over the past several}} years, water is a resource that received significant consideration in the planning and design phases at four elementary schools in McKinney ISD. By harvesting the rainwater from the roof of the building and channeling this water into six oncampus storage tanks, enough rainwater can be collected to flush the toilets and irrigate the school's lawn areas. The rainwater collection and utilization system includes gutters to direct the water to the cisterns, cisterns to collect the rainwater and pumps to distribute the water. A floor plan of Walker Elementary School is shown in Figure 1. Other features of the system include a <b>piping</b> <b>loop</b> for tank equalization, a circulation system for freeze protection, a booster system for flushing, a tie-in to City water for make-up water and chemical treatment. Another element of sustainable design is ?eco education? which is a concept that incorporates sustainability into the curriculum so that students can understand the design and how it impacts the environment. By making this collection system visible, it is a very powerful teaching tool for students to learn about water conservation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present detailed information on the rainwater collection and utilization system at four elementary schools in McKinney ISD. This information will include planning issues and considerations, design features and constraints, construction needs and maintenance and operation requirements...|$|R
