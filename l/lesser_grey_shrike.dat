25|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> is {{a smaller}} and {{comparatively}} short-tailed bird. It {{can best be}} recognized by the rather large black area above the bill, almost reaching to the forehead and without a white stripe above it. In flight, the wide instead of pointed black tail end of L. minor is characteristic. The African species are completely allopatric with L. excubitor; they lack white scapulars (grey-backed fiscal) or wingspots (Mackinnon's fiscal) and differ in some other details, particularly the tail pattern.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, the parapatric {{relatives}} of the L. excubitor are the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) from East Asia and the northern shrike (L. borealis) and loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus) from North America. The northern grey shrike is sympatric in winter quarters with each of its three close relatives at the north of their range. Their overall colouration is – apparently plesiomorphically – shared in sub-Saharan Africa by the somewhat more distantly related grey-backed fiscal (L. excubitoroides) which is found from the Sahel eastwards, and Mackinnon's fiscal (L. mackinnoni) of the Congo Basin region. The <b>lesser</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. minor, Balkans to Central Asia) seems to be quite distinct indeed and is sympatric with the grey shrike superspecies between Eastern Europe and Central Asia; {{it may be more}} closely related to the small brown shrikes and resemble the bold, aggressive and hard-to-catch grey shrikes because of Batesian mimicry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of Systema Naturae {{under the current}} binomial name. His description is L cauda cuneiformi lateribus alba, dorso cano, alis nigris macula alba – [...] "a shrike with a wedge-shaped white-bordered tail, back grey, wings black with white spot". At that time, {{none of the other}} grey shrikes – including the <b>lesser</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. minor), for which the description of the tail pattern is incorrect and which some authors already recognized as distinct – were considered separate species by Linnaeus, but that was to change soon.|$|E
50|$|In Europe {{the numbers}} of <b>lesser</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes</b> has been dwindling and there are now thought to be three to five {{thousand}} breeding pairs. The diminution in numbers {{may be due to}} a series of wet summers leading to a dearth of insects. Another factor may be changes in agricultural practices with small enclosures with varying crops and patches of woodland being replaced by large fields. As a result, this bird has been listed as a threatened species in Annex I of the European Commission Birds Directive.|$|R

40|$|During {{a trip to}} the Dzungarian Gobi {{in southwestern}} Mongolia, a group of German birdwatchers found several {{territorial}} <b>lesser</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes,</b> Lanius minor, and documented an active nest. The species had not previously been recorded from Mongolia. Observations were made near Bulgan gol (Bulgan river; nest coordinates: 46 ° 6 ’N 91 ° 32 ’E, 1190 m a. s. l.) in Khovd aimag (Khovd province) on June 24, 2006. Besides two territorial pairs, of which a female could be photographically documented on the nest, at least four more territorial adults were found within an area of about 1. 5 km 2. Based on these records, an abundance of 4 pairs/km 2 can be assumed for this riparian site, which consists mainly of open meadows with scattered bushes and trees...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In many bird species, males display colour-ful, usually {{carotenoid}} or structurally based plumage ornaments. On {{the other}} hand, {{there are many}} bird species and entire avian genera that are achromatic, i. e. with predominantly white, grey and black plumage colours. Achromatic plumage is a typical feature in many shrikes for example. In this study, we examine the importance of an achromatic plumage pattern, namely, the black tail spots on the two outermost tail feathers (T 6 and T 5) of <b>Lesser</b> <b>Grey</b> <b>Shrikes</b> (LGS) for sex discrimination and {{as an indicator of}} individual quality. Our results suggest that the black tail patterns, especially spots on T 5, are important for sex discrimi-nation, but only in combination with other melanin-based or morphological features. The presence of black tail spots on T 5 is also an indicator of male age. However, {{there is no indication that}} presence, size and asymmetry of these black spots are indicators of indi-vidual quality of both sexes in the terms of breeding performances...|$|R
25|$|The great <b>grey</b> <b>shrike,</b> {{northern}} <b>grey</b> <b>shrike,</b> or northern shrike (Lanius excubitor) {{is a large}} songbird {{species in}} the shrike family (Laniidae). It forms a superspecies with its parapatric southern relatives, the southern <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. meridionalis), the Chinese <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. sphenocerus) and the loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus). Within the great <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> species itself, there are two subspecies. Males and females are similar in plumage, pearly grey above with a black eye-mask and white underparts.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius meridionalis) is {{a member}} of the shrike family. The plumage is generally similar to great <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> apart from the differences noted below. It is closely related to the great <b>grey</b> <b>shrike,</b> Lanius excubitor, which it was previously considered conspecific; where they co-occur, they do not interbreed and are separated by choice of habitat.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius minor) is {{a member}} of the shrike family Laniidae. It breeds in South and Central Europe and western Asia in the summer and migrates to winter {{quarters}} in southern Africa in the early autumn, returning in spring.

50|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the great <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> Lanius excubitor and the southern <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> Lanius meridionalis being predominantly black, white and grey, with the males having pink-flushed underparts.

25|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> {{superspecies}} {{consists of}} L. excubitor and its parapatric southern relatives. As mentioned above, {{the other members}} of this group are the southern <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. meridionalis), the Chinese <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. sphenocerus) and the loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus). The centre of this group's radiation is probably in the eastern Mediterranean region, and the southern <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> represents the basalmost form. The other three only diverged during the expansion into temperate regions. This must have happened fairly recently, because lineage sorting is not complete in the <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes,</b> and most of the present-day habitat of L. excubitor was uninhabitable during much of the Quaternary glaciation. Because of the phylogenetic uncertainties surrounding this close-knit group {{in the absence of a}} good fossil record, some refrain from splitting them up into distinct species; most modern authors do so however.|$|R
50|$|In a 2010 {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, Olsson and colleagues {{found that the}} northern shrike was most {{closely related to the}} southern <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius meridionalis), and the two formed a clade along with the Chinese <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> and loggerhead shrike.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> has a world {{population}} estimated as being {{between two and}} a half and nine million individuals.

40|$|Animals often settle near competitors, a {{behavior}} known as social attraction, which belies standard habitat selection theory. Two hypotheses account for these observations: individuals obtain Allee benefits {{mediated by the}} physical presence of a competitor, or they use successfully settled individual {{as a source of}} information indicating the location of high quality habitat. We evaluated these hypotheses experimentally in two species of shrikes. These passerine birds with a raptor-like mode of life impale prey to create larders that serve as an indicator of male/habitat quality. Thus, two forms of indirect information are available in our system: a successfully settled shrike and its larder. Typically these two cues are associated with each other, however, our experimental treatment created an unnatural situation by disassociating them. We manipulated the presence of larders of great <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes</b> and examined the settling decisions of red-backed shrikes within and outside the great <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> territories. Male red-backed shrikes did not settle sooner on plots with great <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes</b> compared to plots that only contained artificial larders indicating that red-backed shrikes do not use the physical presence of a great <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> when making settling decisions which is inconsistent with the Allee effect hypothesis. In contrast, for all plots without great <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes,</b> red-backed shrikes settled, paired and laid clutches sooner on plots with larders compared to plots without larders.
