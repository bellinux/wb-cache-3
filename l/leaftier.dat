50|$|Acleris semipurpurana is {{a species}} in the moth family Tortricidae, and one of several species of moth {{commonly}} known as oak <b>leaftier</b> or oak leaf tier. The larvae feed on the leaves of oak trees in the Eastern United States and southeastern Canada. It can be {{a major cause of}} defoliation in oak trees. The loss of leaves can kill or damage the affected trees, which are chiefly in the Lobatae or red oak section of Quercus or oaks.|$|E
50|$|Cnephasia longana, the {{omnivorous}} <b>leaftier</b> moth, long-winged shade or strawberry fruitworm, is a moth of {{the family}} Tortricidae. It was described by Haworth in 1811. It is native to western Europe (where it is found from Scandinavia to the Iberian Peninsula, Sardinia, Sicily and Crete and from Ireland to Poland). It is an introduced species in western North America (where it is found in southern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California). The species has also been reported from north-western Africa and Asia. The habitat consists of downland and rough ground.|$|E
5000|$|Acleris semipurpurana {{is found}} in the eastern United States and {{adjoining}} portions of southeastern Canada. It has been found in US states ranging from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Pennsylvania in the northeast to Minnesota and Texas in the west, as well as the Canadian province of Ontario. The oak leaftiers feed mainly trees in the Lobatae or red oak section of Quercus or oak trees: Specifically on eastern black oak, northern red oak, pin oak, scarlet oak, and scrub oak. Several species of moths are referred to with the common name oak <b>leaftier,</b> most from the Tortricidae family, but also from [...] "three other minor families". Of these species Acleris semipurpurana is the most common {{and one of the most}} important for defoliation. In addition to the oak leaftiers, other pest species will often feed on the same trees, including Archips semiferanus and other oak leafrollers.|$|E
5000|$|Oak <b>leaftier</b> moths {{lay their}} eggs in June each year, {{typically}} as single eggs on rough-bark twigs, typically [...] "second year branches". The eggs overwinter and hatch in spring of the next year. The larvae (or caterpillars) emerge in April and initially eat the buds of oak trees and young leaves inside them. When fully grown, the larvae are 12 mm long and are [...] "dirty white to light green" [...] with [...] "a pale brown head and black to brown front legs". [...] Other identifying characteristics in the larvae are a long head with a black bar found on the cheek or lower portion, and brown legs on the thorax. The larvae tie leaves together with silk, which gives the insect its common name. The larvae feed and nest inside the tied or folded leaves until {{they are ready to}} pupate in mid to late May.|$|E
5000|$|The young larvae eat the buds {{and either}} destroy {{developing}} leaves, or cause leaves to develop with many holes in them. This can severely stress the tree's food reserves, {{and the older}} larvae can eat nearly all the remaining leaves, defoliating them. When trees are defoliated two or more years in a row, this leads to [...] "branch dieback, loss of diameter growth, and tree decline". The oak <b>leaftier</b> has caused [...] "considerable tree mortality", especially in the Appalachian region. Dead wood in affected trees is attacked by fungi such as the shoestring root fungus and wood borers like the twolined chestnut borer. A major outbreak occurred in the 1960s and 1970s in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Tiadaghton State Forest in north central Pennsylvania was especially hard hit. Natural methods of pest control usually are sufficient to keep Croesia semipurpurana populations in check, but chemical pesticides are sometimes needed.|$|E
