5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings. Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional <b>lability</b> and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing, pressure suit malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E
5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind neurological pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as <b>lability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional <b>lability</b> leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E

A set of three columns packed with different substrates, namely, a chelating ion exchange resin Chelex- 100, an anion exchange resin Dowex l-X 8 and C- 18 reversed phase was developed.

40|$|When Martian {{regolith}} {{samples are}} moistened with water, a strong oxidant and oxygen gas are released. The many possible oxidants {{which have been}} suggested as present, including superoxide (O 2 (-)) hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 (-)), and manganese (IV) oxide (MnO 2), as well as peroxonitrite (ONOO(-)), can be distinguished by their ability {{to account for the}} numerous observations of the Viking Labelled Release (LR) and Gas Exchange (GEX) experiments. The magnitudes, kinetics, and heat <b>labilities</b> of the LR experiments and the magnitudes and heat <b>labilities</b> of the GEX experiments have been quantitatively replicated with peroxonitrites. Further, it is to be expected from information about the photochemistry of nitrogen in the atmosphere, the calculated fluxes of the NO(x) to the surface, the known reactions of NO(x) with carbonates to produce nitrates and photolysis studies of nitrates, that peroxonitrites are present on Mars. However, considerable uncertainty has existed about the form in which oxygen is stored in photolyzed nitrate crystals. Models have ranged from micropores of O 2 to chemically bound oxygen as peroxonitrite (O 2 NOO(-)), as well as peroxonitrite. Studies of the solution chemistry and solid state photochemistry were completed, which show that much of the oxygen evolved on wetting comes from thermal breakdown of peroxonitrite after it is dissolved. A chemical model is developed for the photochemical processes occurring during UV irradiation of solid nitrates which resolves the several contradictory models discussed in the literature in recent years...|$|R

Bacteriol. 86 : 1019 – 1024. 1963. —Malic dehydrogenase from a marine psychrophilic vibrio (PS 207) {{was found to}} be heat-sensitive at 30 C, the maximal growth temperature for the organism. Initial denaturation was reversible, with maximal renaturation occurring when the denatured enzyme was slowly cooled in the presence of mercaptoethanol, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and malate. No renaturation occurred when these compounds were added after slow cooling, or when the renaturation mixture was rapidly cooled. Mercaptoethylamine, cysteine, glutathione, or mercaptoacetic acid could not replace mercaptoethanol. The kinetics of denaturation and renaturation suggest the presence of several malic isozymes each with different heat <b>labilities,</b> or that these processes are occurring in several distinct steps...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic metal {{speciation}} {{analysis in}} aquatic ecosystems {{is emerging as}} a powerful basis for development of predictions of bioavailability and reliable risk assessment strategies. A given speciation sensor is characterized by an effective time scale or kinetic window that defines the measurable metal species via their <b>labilities.</b> Here we review {{the current state of}} the art for the theory and application of dynamic speciation sensors. We show that a common dynamic interpretation framework, based on rigorous flux expressions incorporating the relevant diffusion and reaction steps, is applicable for a suite of sensors that span a range of time scales. Interpolation from a kinetic spectrum of speciation data is proposed as a practical strategy for addressing questions of bioavailability. Case studies illustrate the practical significance of knowledge on the dynamic features of metal complex species in relation to biouptake, and highlight the limitations of equilibrium-based models...|$|R

The results indicate a relatively far-reaching correctness of the KK approximation in the complete kinetic range from non-labile to labile complexes, {{as long as the}} kinetic flux is computed from the effective concentration of the complex in the reaction layer. Some approximate analytical expressions for this concentration are provided. The KK approximation is shown to be applicable for any metal-to-ligand ratio, provided that the thickness of the reaction layer is expressed in terms of the ligand concentration at the electrode surface...|$|R

40|$|Corrole {{and four}} of its isomers with subtle {{structural}} changes promoted by exchange of nitrogen and carbon atoms in the corrole ring have been studied by traveling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry and collision induced dissociation experiments. Significant differences in shapes and charge distributions for their protonated molecules were found to lead to contrasting gas phase mobilities, most particularly for corrorin, the most "confused" isomer. Accordingly, corrorin was predicted by B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 g(d,p) and collisional cross section calculations to display the most compact tri-dimensional structure, whereas NCC 4 and corrole {{were found to be}} the most planar isomers. Better resolution between the corrole isomers was achieved using the more polarizable and massive CO 2 as the drift gas. Sequential losses of HF molecules were found to dominate the dissociation chemistry of the protonated molecules of these corrole isomers, but their unique structures caused contrasting <b>labilities</b> towards CID, whereas NCC 4 showed a peculiar and structurally diagnostic loss of NH 3, allowing its prompt differentiation from the other isomers...|$|R

The differences include the following. (1) The methylation of cytoskeletal components (band 2. 1 and 4. 1) occurs only {{in the case of}} the L-[methyl- 3 H]methionine-labelled cells. (2) The methionine-mediated methylation was much less sensitive to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine inhibition than the adenosylmethionine-mediated methylation (22 % versus 95 % inhibition at 10 microM). (3) The membrane protein methylation mediated by exogenous adenosylmethionine and methionine differed markedly in their alkali labilities; at pH 6. 0, 30 % of the adenosylmethionine-mediated protein methyl esters were hydrolysed after 30 min (37 degrees C) while the methionine-mediated esters were stable. At pH 7. 4, the respective <b>labilities</b> were 60 % and 30 % for the 30 min incubation.

40|$|A mutant of {{wild-type}} Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 - 13 {{has been}} isolated which resists aggregation by exogenous dextran. This variant {{is able to}} form adherent plaque deposits in vitro when cultured {{in the presence of}} sucrose and has dextranase activity. In these respects it is the complement of previously described isolates which are plaque formation defective but aggregation normal. Measurements of the incorporation of glucose from glucosyl-labeled sucrose into glucan by cell-associated glucosyltransferase enzyme activity and the thermal <b>labilities</b> of catalytic and receptor functions, as well as the binding of labeled dextrans to the cells, provide evidence that neither dextranase nor glucosyltransferase is the receptor involved in dextran-induced aggregation. Blockage of such bacterial aggregation by anti-glucosyltransferase or anti-dextranase sera suggests cross-reactivity between the antigenic determinants of proteins which recognize alpha(1 - 6) glucan linkages. A model is proposed, consistent with these and previous findings, in which enzymatic function precedes dextran receptor activity in emergence from the cell. It is also proposed that dextran receptor components of the multireactive glucosyltransferase enzyme(s) and dextranase(s) are spatially separate from, although functionally and antigenically related to, the receptors on the bacterial surface involved in dextran-induced aggregation...|$|R
40|$|Gangliosides play {{important}} biological {{roles and}} structural characterization {{of both the}} carbohydrate and the lipid moieties is important. The FT-ICR MS/MS techniques of electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron detachment dissociation (EDD), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) provide extensive fragmentation of the protonated and deprotonated GM 1 ganglioside. ECD provides extensive structural information, including identification of both halves of the ceramide and cleavage of the acetyl moiety of the N-acetylated sugars. IRMPD provides similar glycan fragmentation but no cleavage of the acetyl moiety. Cleavage between the fatty acid and the long-chain base of the ceramide moiety is seen in negative-ion IRMPD but not in positive-ion IRMPD of GM 1. Furthermore, this extent of fragmentation requires a range of laser powers, whereas all information is available from a single ECD experiment. However, stepwise fragmentation by IRMPD {{may be used to}} map the relative <b>labilities</b> for a series of cleavages. EDD provides the alternative of electron-induced fragmentation for negative ions with extensive fragmentation, but suffers from low efficiency as well as complication of data analysis by frequent loss of hydrogen atoms. We also show that analysis of MS/MS data for glycolipids is greatly simplified by classification of product ion masses to specific regions of the ganglioside based solely on mass defect graphical analysis...|$|R

Then, the extracts were charged to an AE-cellulose column, equilibrated with 14 mM veronal-HCl buffer, pH 7. 1 and eluted with NaCl plus ATP at pH 6. 6. Three peaks of activity were eluted and named a, / 3, and y. The specific activities of the three peaks were very high (up to 7000 ̂ moles Pi liberation/mg protein/hr), and the activities were inhibited completely by ouabain. The <b>labilities</b> of the three peaks differed. On sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis they gave a main band with an apparent molecular weight of 100, 000. The molecular weights of native active ATPase [EC 3. 6. 1. 3] in the a and y peaks were both determined as 480, 000 using gel chromatography on Sephadex G- 200 and Sepharose 6 B.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} survival of diatoms and long-term pigment dynamics in dark sediment, we incubated samples of homogenized, sieved, tidal-flat sediment for 1 yr in darkness. Microscopic observations revealed that some diatoms survived the full year in darkness and retained their pigments. Concentrations of the diatomspecific phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) 20 : 5 v 3 indicate that these survivors represented {{only a small}} fraction of the original diatom community, probably no more than a few percent. Consequently, the effect of pigment retention in living diatoms on the overall pigment dynamics was negligible. The photosynthetic potential of the surviving diatoms was further investigated by re-exposing the sediment to light in the presence of 13 Cbicarbonate. Rapid 13 C fixation into algal PLFAs at a level similar to that in sediment freshly collected from the field indicates that surviving diatoms fully retained their photosynthetic capacity. Concentration dynamics of photosynthetic pigments generally reflected degradation of two different pools with clearly different loss rates. Losses during the first 1 – 2 months of the experiment (half lives of 6 – 22 d) reflected degradation of fresh algal material, while losses during the rest of the experiment reflected much slower degradation of more refractory pigment pools (half lives of $ 1 yr). Individual pigments showed distinctly different <b>labilities,</b> with losses ranging from 0 % to 86 % over the full year.
