25|$|The steppe wildcat's coat {{is lighter}} than the forest wildcat's, and never attains the level of density, length, or <b>luxuriance</b> {{as that of the}} forest wildcat, even in winter. The tail appears much thinner than that of the forest wildcat, as the hairs there are much shorter, and more close-fitting. The colours and {{patterns}} of the steppe wildcat vary greatly, though the general background colour of the skin on the body's upper surface is very lightly coloured. The hairs along the spine are usually darker, forming a dark gray, brownish, or ochreous band. Small and rounded spots cover the entirety of the species' upper body. These spots are solid and sharply defined, and do not occur in clusters or appear in rosette patterns. They usually do not form transverse rows or transverse stripes on the trunk, {{as is the case in}} the forest wildcat. Only on the thighs are distinct striping patterns visible. The underside is mainly white, with a light gray, creamy or pale yellow tinge. The spots on the chest and abdomen are much larger and more blurred than on the back. The lower neck, throat, neck, and the region between the forelegs are devoid of spots, or have bear them only distinctly. The tail is mostly the same colour as the back, with the addition of a dark and narrow stripe along the upper two-thirds of the tail. The tip of the tail is black, with 2–5 black transverse rings above it. The upper lips and eyelids are light, pale yellow-white. The facial region is of an intense gray colour, while the top of the head is covered with a dark gray coat. In some specimens, the forehead is covered in dense clusters of brown spots. A narrow, dark brown stripe extends from the corner of the eye to the base of the ear.|$|E
500|$|He was {{regularly}} {{approached by}} aspiring young authors for advice or endorsement, including Edgar Allan Poe, who sought Irving's comments on [...] "William Wilson" [...] and [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher". Irving also championed America's maturing literature, advocating stronger copyright laws to protect writers {{from the kind}} of piracy that had initially plagued The Sketch Book. Writing in the January 1840 issue of Knickerbocker, he openly endorsed copyright legislation pending in the U.S. Congress. [...] "We have a young literature", he wrote, [...] "springing up and daily unfolding itself with wonderful energy and <b>luxuriance,</b> which... deserves all its fostering care". The legislation did not pass. In 1841, he was elected in the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.|$|E
500|$|Where Rimsky-Korsakov changed {{between these}} two sets of works was in orchestration. While his pieces were always celebrated for their imaginative use of {{instrumental}} forces, the sparser textures of Sadko and Antar pale compared to the <b>luxuriance</b> {{of the more popular}} works of the 1880s. While a principle of highlighting [...] "primary hues" [...] of instrumental color remained in place, it was augmented in the later works by a sophisticated cachet of orchestral effects, some gleaned from other composers including Wagner, but many invented by himself. As a result, these works resemble brightly colored mosaics, striking in their own right and often scored with a juxtaposition of pure orchestral groups. The final tutti of Scheherazade {{is a prime example of}} this scoring. The theme is assigned to trombones playing in unison, and is accompanied by a combination of string patterns. Meanwhile, another pattern alternates with chromatic scales in the woodwinds and a third pattern of rhythms is played by percussion.|$|E
500|$|Since Aaronson's poetry {{does not}} display formal innovation, {{literature}} professor William Baker, characterises him as [...] "A post-Georgian {{rather than a}} modernist [...] ". Baker further notes that Aaronson's poetry deals with several issues of his time, such as the rise of fascism and the Second World War, but points out that Aaronson did not directly write about the Holocaust. Upon Aaronson's death, the poet Arthur Chaim Jacobs compared him with Isaac Rosenberg, the more celebrated poet of the same Anglo-Jewish generation. According to Jacobs, Aaronson was [...] "clearly influenced by him in terms of diction, and {{in a kind of}} verbal energy which runs through a lot of his poetry. But he was less radical than Rosenberg in his use of language, and tended towards Keatsian <b>luxuriance</b> and sweetness." [...] The poet Jon Silkin also unfavourably compared Aaronson to Rosenberg, writing [...] "it cannot be said that his work attains to either the burning majesty or the depth of Rosenberg's poetry, and this is explicable perhaps by the fact that Aaronson does not altogether care to acknowledge his roots." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lord Lindsay {{wrote in}} 1847: [...] "The soil of Palestine still enjoys her sabbaths, and only {{waits for the}} return of her banished children, and the {{application}} of industry, commensurate with her agricultural capabilities, to burst once more into universal <b>luxuriance,</b> and be all that she ever was in the days of Solomon." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{described}} {{this as a}} [...] "circumstance-adaptive law, operating upon the slight but continued natural disposition to sport in the progeny". Matthew then quoted the opening three paragraphs from Part III of his book, Miscellaneous Matter Connected with Naval Timber: Nurseries, pages 106 to 108, on [...] "the <b>luxuriance</b> and size of timber depending upon the particular variety of the species" [...] {{and the need to}} select seed from the best individuals when growing trees.|$|E
2500|$|The Exflora Park : The Exflora Park is a five-hectare (...) garden {{open to the}} public. Next to {{the large}} olive grove, there are {{different}} styles of Mediterranean gardens, from ancient Rome to the exuberant Riviera of the 19th century. Fountains and ponds stretch along the terrace, making a waterway [...] long. Antibes is renowned for rose production, and rose bushes line the path leading to the sea. The <b>luxuriance</b> of the exotic garden and palm grove {{is reminiscent of the}} belle époque, when English gardeners succeeded in planting flowers that bloom in winter, the season when the aristocracy visited the Côte d'Azur.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzgerald {{was popular}} and witty. Lord Harris wrote of him: [...] "Whether {{it was the}} magnificence of his swagger, the <b>luxuriance</b> of his beard, the fun that rolled out of him so easily, or {{the power of his}} swiping, I do not know, but as regards each he could not escape notice." [...] Harris {{accompanied}} Fitzgerald on the first MCC tour abroad to North America in 1872. [...] Fitzgerald's own book, Wickets in the West was published in 1873 and records this tour. [...] Among the tour party was WG Grace who had been proposed by Fitzgerald in 1867 as a member of MCC.|$|E
2500|$|The size of Nonnus' {{poem and}} its late date between Imperial and Byzantine {{literature}} {{have caused the}} Dionysiaca to receive relatively little attention from scholars. The contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica (8th edition, 1888), noting the poem's [...] "vast and formless <b>luxuriance,</b> its beautiful but artificial versification, its delineation of action and passion to the entire neglect of character," [...] remarked, [...] "His chief merit consists in the systematic perfection to which he brought the Homeric hexameter. But the very correctness of the versification renders it monotonous. His influence on the vocabulary of his successors was likewise very considerable," [...] expressing the 19th-century attitude to this poem as a pretty, artificial, and disorganized collection of stories. As with many other late classical poets, newer scholarship has avoided the value-laden judgments of 19th-century scholars and attempted to reassess [...] and rehabilitate Nonnus' works. There are two main focuses of Nonnian scholarship today: mythology and structure.|$|E
2500|$|Augustus was {{determined}} to bring back [...] "the style of yesteryear" [...] (the toga). He ordered that any theatre-goer in dark (or coloured or dirty) clothing {{be sent to the}} back seats, traditionally reserved for who those had no toga; ordinary or common women, freedmen, low-class foreigners and slaves. He reserved the most honourable seats, front of house, for senators and equites; this was how it had always been, before the chaos of the civil wars; or rather, how it was supposed to have been. Infuriated by the sight of a darkly clad throng of men at a public meeting, he sarcastically quoted Virgil at them, [...] "Romanos, rerum dominos, gentemque togatam [...] " [...] ("Romans, lords {{of the world and the}} toga-wearing people"), then ordered that in future, the aediles ban anyone not wearing the toga from the Forum and its environs – Rome's [...] "civic heart". Augustus' reign saw the introduction of the toga rasa, an ordinary toga whose rough fibres were teased from the woven nap, then shaved back to a smoother, more comfortable finish. By Pliny's day (circa 70 AD) this was probably standard among the elite. [...] Pliny also describes a glossy smooth, lightweight but dense fabric woven from poppy-stem fibres and flax, in use from at least the time of the Punic Wars. Though probably appropriate for a [...] "summer toga", it was criticised for its improper <b>luxuriance.</b>|$|E

60|$|Took {{the train}} for Curepipe at 1.30--two hours' run, {{gradually}} uphill.
