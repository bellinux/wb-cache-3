Four days after landfall, there were 147known deaths, which increased to 164 the following day. The final death toll was set at 168, although 24people were missing as of the <b>last</b> <b>count.</b> Most of the deaths were from collapsed houses, with others due to flooding, landslides, or flying debris.|$|E
5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed to {{the reputation of the}} wines that came from this area. The Counts of Champagne ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the <b>last</b> <b>Count</b> of Champagne assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region became part of the Crown territories.|$|E
5|$|The Graduate Cooperative Education Program, {{established}} in 1983, {{is the largest}} such program in the United States. It allows graduate students pursuing master's degrees or doctorates in any field to spend a maximum of two consecutive semesters working full- or part-time with employers. The Undergraduate Professional Internship Program enables undergraduate students—typically juniors or seniors—to complete a one- or two-semester internship with employers. The Work Abroad Program hosts a variety of cooperative education and internship experiences for upperclassmen and graduate students seeking international employment and cross-cultural experiences. While all four programs are voluntary, they consistently attract high numbers of students—more than 3,000 at <b>last</b> <b>count.</b> Around 1,000 businesses and organizations hire these students, who collectively earn $20 million per year.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no Olympic competition, there are the World Gliding Championships. The first event {{was held at the}} Samedan in 1948. Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. The latest {{worldwide}} statistics for 2011 indicate that Germany, the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounted for 27percent of the world's glider pilots, and the three major glider manufacturers are still based there. However the meteorological conditions that allow soaring are common and the sport has been taken up in many countries. At the <b>last</b> <b>count</b> there were over 111,000 active civilian glider pilots and 32,920 gliders, plus an unknown number of military cadets and aircraft. Clubs actively seek new members by giving trial flights, which are also a useful source of revenue for them.|$|E

25|$|Sweden {{is often}} {{considered}} {{to be at the}} forefront of Internet use and Internet regulations. On 11 May 1973 Sweden enacted the Data Act − the world's first national data protection law. They are constantly innovating the way that the Internet is used and how it impacts their people. In 2012, Sweden received a Web Index Score of 100, a score that measures how the Internet significantly influences political, social, and economic impact, placing them first among 61 other nations. Sweden received this score while in the process of exceeding new mandatory implementations from the European Union. Sweden placed more restrictive guidelines on the directive on intellectual property rights enforcement (IPRED) and passed the FRA-law in 2009 that allowed for the legal sanctioning of surveillance of internet traffic by state authorities. The FRA has a history of intercepting radio signals and has stood as the main intelligence agency in Sweden since 1942. Sweden is an interesting topic when discussing Laws and Regulations of Internet Privacy because of mixture of their government's strong push towards implementing policy and their citizens continued perception of a free and neutral Internet. Both of the previously mentioned additions created controversy by critics but they did not change the public perception even though the new FRA-law was brought in front of the European Court of Human Rights for human rights violations. The law was established by the National Defense Radio Establishment (Forsvarets Radio Anstalt - FRA) to eliminate outside threats. However, the law also allowed for authorities to monitor all cross-border communication without a warrant. Sweden's recent emergence into Internet dominance may be explained by their recent climb in users. Only 2% of all Swedes were connected to the Internet in 1995 but at <b>last</b> <b>count</b> in 2012, 89% had broadband access. This was due in large part once again to the active Swedish government introducing regulatory provisions to promote competition among Internet Service Providers. These regulations helped grow web-infrastructure and forced prices below the European average. To add to the intrigue around Sweden's laws and regulations, one must also mention how copyright laws evolved in Sweden. Sweden was the birthplace of the Pirate Bay, an infamous file-sharing website. File sharing has been illegal in Sweden since it was developed, however, there was never any real fear of being persecuted for the crime until 2009 when the Swedish Parliament was the first in the European Union to pass the intellectual property rights directive. This directive persuaded internet service providers to announce the identity of suspected violators. A final piece of legislation worth mentioning when discussing Sweden's regulations is the infamous centralized block list. The list is generated by authorities and was originally crafted to eliminate sites hosting child pornography. However, there is no legal way to appeal a site that ends up on the list and as a result, many non-child pornography sites have been blacklisted. It is important to consider that Sweden's government enjoys a high level of trust from their citizens. Without this trust, many of these regulations would not be possible and thus many of these regulations may only be feasible in the Swedish context.|$|E

2500|$|A true {{direction}} change involving the feet {{moving in a}} new direction requires either a prep step or a pivot, both of which are sometimes referred to as a flank. To perform a prep step, on the <b>last</b> <b>count</b> of movement in the first direction a marcher plants the foot with the heel turned outward at half the angle of the turn desired, with the upper body still facing forward. On the next count, the other foot snaps into position completing the turn. The upper body may or may not turn with the lower body. Some bands plant the heel on the prep step rather than the toe, but preserving the angle of the foot. [...] To perform a pivot, the marcher pivots between directions over the ball of the foot on the <b>last</b> <b>count</b> instead of using a prep step.|$|E
