5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} {{applications}} that are supplied direct from AC <b>line</b> <b>power</b> can save energy {{when they are}} operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E

The plant was an oil-burning 25 horsepower (19 kilowatt) direct current electrical generator. The town quickly outgrew the plant, and by 1920 a more economical coal-fired plant was built. In 1928 the plant was sold to the Montreal Engineering Company, and the town was hooked into the Soo <b>Line</b> <b>power</b> grid.

500|$|The {{earliest}} transmission <b>line</b> <b>power</b> dividers {{were simple}} T-junctions. [...] These suffer from very poor isolation between the output ports – {{a large part}} of the power reflected back from port 2 finds its way into port 3. [...] It can be shown that it is not theoretically possible to simultaneously match all three ports of a passive, lossless three-port and poor isolation is unavoidable. [...] It is, however, possible with four-ports and this is the fundamental reason why four-port devices are used to implement three-port power dividers: four-port devices can be designed so that power arriving at port 2 is split between port 1 and port 4 (which is terminated with a matching load) and none (in the ideal case) goes to port 3.|$|E
500|$|The λ/4 coupled line {{design is}} good for coaxial and {{stripline}} implementations but does not work so well in the now popular microstrip format, although designs do exist. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that microstrip is not a homogeneous medium – there are two different mediums above and below the transmission strip. [...] This leads to transmission modes other than the usual TEM mode found in conductive circuits. [...] The propagation velocities of even and odd modes are different leading to signal dispersion. [...] A better solution for microstrip is a coupled line much shorter than λ/4, shown in figure 5, but this has the disadvantage of a coupling factor which rises noticeably with frequency. [...] A variation of this design sometimes encountered has the coupled line a higher impedance than the main line such as shown in figure 6. [...] This design is advantageous where the coupler is being fed to a detector for power monitoring. [...] The higher impedance line results in a higher RF voltage for a given main <b>line</b> <b>power</b> making the work of the detector diode easier.Vizmuller, pp.102–103 ...|$|E

In contrast, some forest ungulates preferentially forage in <b>power</b> <b>line</b> rights-of-way, cleared areas under <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> We reviewed the factors that possibly influence avoidance and attraction effects of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> on ungulates, construct a conceptual framework, and make {{suggestions on how to}} mitigate avoidance effects through <b>power</b> <b>line</b> routing and rights-of-way management. <b>Power</b> <b>line</b> construction, noise and electromagnetic fields are possible sources of disturbance, while rights-of-way management influences habitat use under <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Disturbance and altered habitat use can induce barrier and corridor effects, thereby influencing connectivity. Species-specific effects influence behavioural disturbance and habitat use. We found little evidence for behavioural disturbance of reindeer or forest ungulates under <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Forest ungulates could benefit from browsing in <b>power</b> <b>line</b> rights-of-way if they are managed to provide abundant and preferred forage as well as sufficient cover. However, <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> may facilitate access for hunters and predators. As a precaution, construction of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> should be avoided in calving areas.

40|$|Abstract: Broadband <b>power</b> <b>line</b> (BPL) data {{transmission}} deals with transfer of data via the existing <b>power</b> <b>line</b> systems {{and is a}} fast emerging technology. The main advantage of BPL {{is being able to}} use the existing <b>power</b> <b>line</b> infrastructure, thereby reducing the cost. However, <b>power</b> <b>line</b> systems were not designed for high-speed {{data transmission}} as they consist of various branches and <b>power</b> <b>line</b> elements such as bridges, taps, transformers and capacitor banks. Therefore, the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> transmission medium not only introduces noise but is also adverse to high-speed data transfer in terms of the channel bandwidth.
