This is a copy of a 17th-century original now displayed at Plas Mawr, Conwy.

5000|$|Many {{types of}} items were made: {{as well as}} the usual plates and bowls, there were teapots and small round <b>lidded</b> <b>boxes,</b> usually {{described}} as for cosmetics. Items made for burial included tall funerary urns with complicated, and rather crowded, sets of figures. There are also tomb figures, though less care is expended on these than on the famous sancai figures of the Tang dynasty. [...] Small Buddha statues, often with highly detailed hair, clothes and accessories, come from late in the period.|$|R

50|$|The ‘Whimsy’ laser-cut {{wooden puzzles}} feature unique, individual, “whimsical” cut-out shapes {{that reflect the}} theme of the image used {{on the face of the}} puzzle. All puzzles are {{supplied}} in a cotton draw-string bag within a <b>lidded</b> <b>box.</b> These wooden puzzles are cut from 3mm thick wooden boards (as opposed to softer cardboard) to ensure they will survive the rigours of use for a very long time. Puzzles are supplied to the customer with the option of an image of the puzzle's subject matter printed on the box. With no reference image there is the added difficulty of assembling the pieces into the correct pattern, and the element of surprise concerning the subject matter when the puzzle's image is reassembled.|$|R

5000|$|Chabako (茶箱, {{literally}} [...] "tea boxes"). Special <b>lidded</b> <b>boxes</b> containing tea bowl, tea caddy, tea scoop {{and other}} equipment.

The interior dimensions of the large version are slightly smaller than 19 cm in length, 13 cm in width, and 11.5 cm in height. It has a shelf inside. Originally there were no rules for the tea-making procedure (temae). However, the 11th-generation head of the Urasenke school of tea created certain types of procedures. For the procedures, the box is carried into {{the place where the}} tea is to be made, sometimes on a tray, and the ceremony proceeds with each item being removed from, and finally returned to, the box.|$|R
