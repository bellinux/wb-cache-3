Aeration rate had a strong effect on emissions. High aeration rate (0. 300 <b>L</b> <b>air</b> kg - 1 min - 1) caused normally high emissions of all selected compounds whereas low aeration rates (0. 05 <b>L</b> <b>air</b> kg - 1 min - 1) could cause anaerobiosis problems and generation of organic sulphur compounds. We observed that the effect of the moisture upon the emitted concentrations varied depending on the studied compound. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} basic bubble manipulations, including transporting, splitting, and merging, by dielectrophoresis (DEP) in an oil environment. In our presented method, bubbles {{are placed}} between parallel plates in an oil medium {{of a low}} vapor pressure, which eliminates the possibility of changing the gaseous composition of the bubble caused by evaporation of the medium. DEP has been previously investigated to actuate dielectric droplets and is adopted here to drive the oil environment {{as well as the}} immersed bubbles between parallel plates. In our experiment, air bubbles of 0. 3 l were successfully transported in a 20 cSt silicone oil medium between a 75 m-high parallel plate gap. In addition, 0. 6 <b>l</b> <b>air</b> bubbles were successfully split into two 0. 3 <b>l</b> <b>air</b> bubbles, and then merged again by DEP.

The biochemical composition of D. tertiolecta was strongly affected by the aeration rate. There was a negative correlation between stationary-phase protein cellular content and air flow. Carbohydrate cellular content also decreased with aeration rate, a minimum being reached with 0 · 93 <b>l</b> of <b>air</b> min− 1 <b>l</b> of culture− 1. Maximum carbohydrate per volume unit was achieved with maximum aeration as the increase of carbohydrates per ml was directly proportional to air flow and therefore to CO 2 availability. Maximum protein per ml was achieved with 1 · 86 <b>l</b> of <b>air</b> min− 1 <b>l</b> of culture− 1, keeping stable with higher air flows. The cultures supplied with CO 2 showed carbohydrate and protein concentrations similar to the cultures with 1 · 86 <b>l</b> of <b>air</b> min− 1 <b>l</b> of culture− 1, indicating a correlation between available CO 2 and not only carbon, but also nitrogen metabolism.

Factors affecting mass loss were explored. Wood moisture content and ratio of heartwood area proved to be significant factors. In addition, six weather factors were found to influence mass loss. Disks that were sampled on a cloudy day showed significantly higher mean mass loss compared to those sampled on a sunny day. Subculturing of filamentous fungi from 16 -week incubated disks suggested one-third of the isolated fungi produced ligninolytic enzymes.|$|R

40|$|Bioaerosols {{are mainly}} {{composed}} of fungal particles, bacteria and plant spores, being fungi {{responsible for the}} release of VOCs and micotoxins into indoor environments. Aspergillus flavus is a common opportunistic pathogen causing human infections and is involved in the production of aflatoxin and other secondary metabolites associated with toxic and allergic reactions. Poultry workers are exposed to high concentrations of fungi and are therefore more prone to develop associated pathologies. To evaluate occupational exposure of the workers to Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxins, six animal production facilities were selected, including 10 buildings, from which indoor air samples and outdoor reference samples were obtained. Twenty-five duplicate samples were collected by two methodologies: impactation onto malt extract agar of 25 <b>L</b> <b>air</b> samples using a Millipore Air Tester were used to evaluate quantitative (CFU/m 3) and qualitative (species identification, whenever possible) sample composition; 300 <b>L</b> <b>air</b> samples collected with the Coriolis Air Sampler into phosphate–saline buffer were used to isolate DNA, following molecular identification of Aspergillus section flavi using nor- 1 specific primers by real-time PCR. Overall, Aspergillus was the most frequent genus detected. Using conventional methodologies, A. flavus species were identified in five indoor samples belonging to three buildings and in two outdoor samples. Using real-time PCR, aflatoxigenic species were detected in two buildings, although only one was coincident with the ones identified by cultures. Using both methodologies we could quantify viable microorganisms and simultaneously identify potentially toxigenic species, resulting in complementary information useful in the adoption of strategies to minimize exposure to micotoxins...|$|R
