40|$|Smart {{actuators}} with {{fast and}} reversible changes towards external stimuli have attractive potentials in diverse applications. Here, we present the rational design and facile fabrication of graphene oxide (GO) /poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PANIPAM) hybrid film-based bilayer actuators, which display efficient and reversible bending/unbending behaviors {{in response to}} repeated cycles of near-infrared (NIR) light irradiations. Our bilayer actuator comprises a layer of GO, and a layer of GO/PNIPAM (GP) hybrid, taking advantages of the NIR absorbance and photothermal conversion capability of GO, along with the thermo-responsiveness of PNIPAM. Upon NIR light irradiation, GO converts absorbed light into heat, which subsequently triggers the shrinkage of PANIPAM chains, leading to the bending of the bilayer actuator. Owning to the shape inertness of GO to the NIR light, repeated irradiations of NIR light cause the bilayer to shrink/relax in an asymmetric manner, consequently leading to reversible bending/unbending behaviors of the bilayer actuator. Remarkably, our actuator shows templated bending orientation once exposed to NIR light, and exhibits shape memory effect due to the incomplete recovery of PNIPAM chains. This shape memory effect is retained in rectangular strips cut from the original disk-shaped bilayer and is exploited to selectively achieve either bending or twisting deformation. As an interesting example for potential practical utilization, a smart NIR light-driven forklift capable of <b>lifting</b> <b>goods</b> has been built by pinning {{one side of the}} bilayer film...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} at Bosch Rexroth’s hydraulics plant in Älvsjö at the section StoP/MFG during a time period of ten weeks. The assignment has been an investigative work connected to an investment project, where a vertical lift module used for long goods, have been purchased for the plant. Bosch Rexroth has a make-to-order approach when they manufacture their hydraulic cylinders, in other words, the hydraulic cylinders are not made to stock for later sales. By having a make-to-stock supply chain, {{there are a lot}} of variation between the different manufactured cylinder types. To respond quickly to the customer needs, a large stock level of different goods must be kept. The manufacturing plant has for some time had some problems regarding the handling of goods with lack of storage space, faulty goods picking and unsafe lifting procedures. These problem became significantly more noticeable when a new material for piston rods got introduced at the plant. To reduce the area on which stock are kept and lower the amount of faulty goods picking, the plant invested in a vertical lift module. This thesis describes a solution proposal in which large amounts of Bosch Rexroth’s long goods are placed in the vertical lift module. Instead of focusing on a fast handling, the solution focuses on a placement in which it is difficult to make picking errors and adding goods to the wrong place. The lifting tools presented are easy to use and will be a safe alternative for <b>lifting</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{a review}} of sidings at {{unattended}} stations in 1953 it was noted of Clareville that inward goods comprised approximately 12 wagons of coal and 6 wagons of shooks for the Carrington Dairy Company, who consigned their outward goods at Carterton. Outward goods consisted primarily of hay and straw, amounting to approximately 12 wagons per year. It was considered that only minor inconvenience would be caused in closing Clareville to goods traffic and instead handling it at Carterton. In response to the review the District Engineer stated he had no objection to the <b>lifting</b> of the <b>goods</b> siding at Clareville. After the possibility of new business at Clareville from Airlift (N.Z.) was aborted on 11 June 1956, closure of the station to goods traffic was confirmed and a request to <b>lift</b> the <b>goods</b> siding was put in hand on 20 November 1957 with work being completed by 1 March 1958.|$|R
