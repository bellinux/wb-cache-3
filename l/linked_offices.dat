40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the impact office layout has on office occupiers' productivity. Design/methodology/approach – The paper evaluates the literature that claims to make a linkage between the office layout and the effect on office occupiers' productivity. Two main themes are developed. First, the literature that <b>links</b> <b>office</b> layout to work patterns is evaluated, and second, the open-plan office vs cellular office debate is developed. Findings – The review of the literature reveals that the connection between the three major components of office layout, office occupiers' work patterns and productivity is not clearly established. Originality/value – The paper establishes that there is a requirement to <b>link</b> together <b>office</b> layout to the work patterns of office occupiers. It is only when the connection is made between the office layout and the office occupiers' work patterns that productivity gains can be achieved. To support the different work patterns undertaken, the facilities manager can create office environments that consist of a balance between private space and communal shared space. The amount of balance will be very much dependent on the mix of the work patterns in the office. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess, in the motor {{insurance}} industry, the state of customer satisfaction with service delivery, the dimensions of service delivery customers are satisfied with and the dimensions which are most important to them. In the light of this evaluation, we suggest ways to enhance service delivery. To achieve this purpose, a case study involving a motor insurance firm was conducted. Findings from the study reveal that customer satisfaction with service delivery can be considered as acceptable. Mostly, the customers are satisfied with convenient periods and terms for expired policy renewals, operating hours, sound loyalty programme, individualised customer attention, understanding customer needs and apologising for inconvenience to clients. It also appears that offering a value for money is the dimension of service delivery most essential to clients. Finally, to enhance customer service delivery further, players in the industry need to adopt the right mix of policies practiced in the advanced countries, firms must train and equip the agencies or <b>link</b> <b>offices</b> well and check material shortages.
