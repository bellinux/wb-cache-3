5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as <b>lamp</b> <b>black,</b> reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{treating}} wood, it {{was also}} used for lighting and fuel. In the beginning, it was only used for lighting needed in harbour and outdoor work, where the smoke that was produced from burning it was of little inconvenience. By 1879, lamps had been created that ensured a more complete combustion by using compressed air, removing the drawback of the smoke. Creosote was also processed into gas and used for lighting that way. As a fuel, {{it was used to}} power ships at sea and blast furnaces for different industrial needs, once it was discovered to be more efficient than unrefined coal or wood. It was also used industrially for the softening of hard pitch, and burned to produce <b>lamp</b> <b>black.</b> By 1890, the production of creosote in the United Kingdom totaled approximately 29,900,000 gallons per year.|$|E
500|$|Libby's first {{detector}} was a Geiger {{counter of}} his own design. He converted the carbon in his sample to <b>lamp</b> <b>black</b> (soot) and coated the inner surface of a cylinder with it. [...] This cylinder was inserted into the counter {{in such a way}} that the counting wire was inside the sample cylinder, in order that there should be no material between the sample and the wire. Any interposing material would have interfered with the detection of radioactivity, since the beta particles emitted by decaying [...] are so weak that half are stopped by a 0.01mm thickness of aluminium.|$|E

5000|$|Light traps, with {{or without}} {{ultraviolet}} light, attract certain insects. Light sources may include fluorescent <b>lamps,</b> mercury-vapor <b>lamps,</b> <b>black</b> lights, or light-emitting diodes. Designs differ according to {{the behavior of the}} insects being studied. Light traps are widely used to survey nocturnal moths. Total species richness and abundance of trapped moths may be influenced by several factors such as night temperature, humidity and lamp type. Grasshoppers and some beetles are attracted to lights at a long range but are repelled by it at short range. Farrow's light trap has a large base so that it captures insects that may otherwise fly away from regular light traps. [...] Light traps can attract flying and terrestrial insects, and lights may be combined with other methods described below.|$|R
