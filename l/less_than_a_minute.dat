5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among {{the three of them}} was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{initially}} {{planned to}} retire in 1955 but came back for a final year in 1956, when the Browns posted a 5–7 record, the team's first-ever losing season.

He could often be heard calling for Graham to throw him the ball while running routes. He was also known {{for his ability to}} improvise on the field. In a 1955 game against the Eagles in slippery conditions, he caught the winning touchdown with <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> left by swinging around the goalpost with his arm to get open.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Rabbit, {{human and}} cock {{spermatozoa}} collected and washed without exposure to light respired very slowly {{or not at}} all. Brief exposure to white light of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> duration stimulated normal rates of respiration. Ubiquinone (UQ, Co-enzyme Q), seminal plasma, in-utero incubation, and dinitrophenol each markedly stimulated the respiration of spermatozoa protected from light. Ubiquinone 10 was effective with cock spermatozoa while UQ 1 was superior to UQ 3 or UQ 4 with rabbit spermatozoa. Ubiquinone 1 appeared more effective than UQ 3 for human spermatozoa...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} day, 24 September 1917, a British patrol {{reached the}} crash site. Documents in Voss' pocket identified him. A military doctor cursorily examined the corpse. He noted three bullet wounds. One ranged slightly upward through the chest cavity {{from right to}} left, consistent with Hoidge's angle of fire; it would have killed Voss in <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> The other two gunshot wounds pierced Voss's abdomen from rear to front, coinciding with Rhys-Davids's firing angle. Werner Voss was buried like any other dead soldier near Plum Farm, laid in a shell crater without coffin or honors. His grave's location was recorded as Map Sheet 28, coordinates 24.C.8.3. The field grave would subsequently be lost trace of, through the turmoil of ongoing ground fighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} of the match came with ten minutes left. After a period of fluent {{football}} by the Arsenal forwards which saw Smith hit the woodwork and Hayes, Thomas and Rocastle all had shots saved by Dibble, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after Rocastle was fouled in the box. Dibble saved Winterburn's spot-kick by turning the ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton equalised with seven minutes remaining when Caesar mis-kicked a clearance {{on the edge of}} his penalty area, enabling Luton's Wilson to head the ball into the Arsenal goal from a Mark Stein cross. With <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to go, Adams fouled Mark Stein, and from the resulting free kick, Brian Stein scored his second goal of the match to put the game beyond the reach of the defending champions.|$|E

Four of the drives took <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> of game time to reach the end zone, and a fifth took barely over a minute. In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven seconds left in the half, but chose not to attempt to score again.

5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E
5|$|Astorias bridge crew called general {{quarters}} upon sighting the flares {{south of}} Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, {{shortly after the}} Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, Astorias main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. Astorias captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> later. Chōkai, however, had found the range, and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of Astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasas searchlight, but missed and hit Chōkais forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.|$|E
5|$|Hotchkiss driver Elliott Shepard, who {{finished}} {{the first day}} in fourth, less than four minutes behind Nazzaro, spent half-an-hour working on his car {{at the start of}} the second day, fitting new tyres and changing liquids. On the eighth lap, he ran off the wooden planking at Saint-Calais but was able to resume; a wheel failure later in the lap caused him to run into a bank of earth and forced him to retire. Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed early in the day and retired, as did Claude Richez of Renault; the sole Gobron-Brillié of Rigolly suffered radiator damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race. After two laps' running on the second day, second-placed Clément had established a 23-minute lead over Nazzaro, but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap. Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten, a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front. Nazzaro passed again, and led Clément into the last lap of the race by <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
