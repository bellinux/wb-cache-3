In Burges's time {{the door had}} a <b>letterbox,</b> {{in the form of}} Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The <b>letterbox</b> is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W. Lonsdale, it resembles the cave canem floor at Pompei.|$|E
5|$|Region 1 DVDs of Reservoir Dogs {{have been}} {{released}} multiple times. The first release was a single two-sided disc from LIVE Entertainment, released in June 1997 and featuring both pan-and-scan and <b>letterbox</b> versions of the film. Five years later, Artisan Entertainment (who changed their name from LIVE Entertainment in the interim) released a two-disc 10th anniversary edition featuring multiple covers color-coded to match the nicknames of five of the characters (Pink, White, Orange, Blonde and Brown) and a disc of bonus features such as interviews with the cast and crew.|$|E

50|$|Pillarboxing is the {{vertical}} equivalent of <b>letterboxing</b> and {{is sometimes called}} reverse <b>letterboxing.</b> Its name is derived from its resemblance to pillar box-style mailboxes used in the UK and the Commonwealth of Nations.

50|$|Interest in <b>letterboxing</b> in the U.S. is {{generally}} considered to have started with a feature article in the Smithsonian Magazine in April 1998. Much of the terminology below is associated with <b>letterboxing</b> in the US and would be unfamiliar to UK letterboxers. The growing popularity of the somewhat similar activity of geocaching during the 2000s has increased interest in <b>letterboxing</b> as well.Clues to American <b>letterboxes</b> are commonly published on several different websites.|$|R
5|$|Poppy interferes in Dot's {{relationship}} with her son, Nick (John Altman), telling him that his mother {{does not want to}} speak to him. She then allows Fatboy to stay with her after Tamwar throws him out. Poppy is then devastated to learn that Fatboy shared a passionate kiss with Denise Fox (Diane Parish), after hearing the pair whispering about it. She then learns that Fatboy and Denise had slept together before he was even in a {{relationship with}} Poppy. This infuriates Poppy, who storms over to the Minute Mart and confronts Denise, leading to the two women clashing in the shop. Poppy then returns home and tells Fatboy that she has forgiven him, but she needs to move away from Walford so that they can have a fresh start. Fatboy refuses to move and says he wants to end their relationship. She packs her bags and leaves Walford for Hemel Hempstead, but not before posting a letter through Ian's <b>letterbox,</b> detailing about his fiancée's infidelity.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Letterbox</b> Hybrid Cache is a {{combination}} of a geocache and a <b>letterbox</b> in the same container. A <b>letterbox</b> has a rubber stamp and a logbook instead of tradable items. Letterboxers carry their own stamp with them, to stamp the letterbox's log book and inversely stamp their personal log book with the <b>letterbox</b> stamp. The hybrid cache contains the important materials for this and may or may not include trade items. Whether the <b>letterbox</b> hybrid contains trade items is up to the owner.|$|E

50|$|<b>Letterboxing</b> {{originated}} on Dartmoor in the 19th {{century and}} has become increasingly popular in recent decades. Watertight containers, or 'letterboxes', are hidden throughout the moor, each containing a visitor's book and a rubber stamp. Visitors take an impression of the <b>letterbox's</b> rubber stamp as proof of finding the box and record their visit by stamping their own personal stamp in the <b>letterbox's</b> logbook. A recent related development is geocaching. Geocache clues make use of GPS coordinates, whereas <b>letterboxing</b> clues tend to consist of grid references and compass bearings.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Letterboxing</b> is {{an outdoor}} hobby that {{combines}} elements of orienteering, art, and puzzle solving. Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly accessible places (like parks) and distribute clues {{to finding the}} box in printed catalogs, on one of several web sites, or by word of mouth. Individual <b>letterboxes</b> contain a notebook and a rubber stamp, preferably hand carved or custom made. Finders make an imprint of the <b>letterbox's</b> stamp in their personal notebook, and leave an impression of their personal signature stamp on the <b>letterbox's</b> [...] "visitors' book" [...] or [...] "logbook" [...] — as proof of having found the box and letting other letterboxers know who has visited. Many letterboxers keep careful track of their [...] "find count".|$|R

50|$|The first Dartmoor <b>letterboxes</b> were {{so remote}} and well-hidden {{that only the}} most {{determined}} walkers would find them, allowing weeks to pass before the letter made its way home. Until the 1970s {{there were no more}} than a dozen such sites around the moor, usually in the most inaccessible locations. Increasingly, however, <b>letterboxes</b> have been located in relatively accessible sites and today there are thousands of <b>letterboxes,</b> many within easy walking distance of the road. As a result, the tradition of leaving a letter or postcard in the box has been forgotten.|$|R

25|$|In 2004, NBC {{experienced}} a Three on a match scenario (Friends and Frasier ended their runs; Jerry Orbach, {{who had played}} {{one of the most}} popular characters of its hit Law & Order, died suddenly later that year), and shortly afterward was left with several moderately rated shows and few true hits. In particular, Friends spin-off Joey, despite a relatively strong start, started to falter in the ratings during its second season. The 2004–05 season saw NBC become the first major network to air select dramas in <b>letterbox</b> over its analog broadcast feed; the move was done in the hopes of attracting new viewers, although the network saw only a slight boost.|$|E
25|$|The film {{aired in}} its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour {{telecast}} which presented the musical numbers in a <b>letterbox</b> format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, {{the film was}} broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC, generally during Christmas week, and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, ABC Family, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!—a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month.|$|E
25|$|Rena {{maintained}} sporadic {{contact with}} her children on each occasion she and Fred separated. She {{is known to have}} visited Moorcourt Cottage to enquire as to her children's whereabouts sometime {{in the latter half of}} August 1971. Fred's sister-in-law, Christine, would later recollect Rena was both depressed and extremely anxious as to her children's welfare. Being provided with Fred's Midland Road address, Rena sought to confront him—likely to discuss or demand custody of her daughters. This was the final time Rena was seen alive. She is believed to have been murdered by strangulation, possibly in the back seat of Fred's Ford Popular and likely while intoxicated. When her body was discovered, a short length of metal tubing was found with her remains, leaving an equal possibility she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder. Rena's body was extensively dismembered, placed into plastic bags, and buried close to a cluster of trees known as Yewtree Coppice at <b>Letterbox</b> Field.|$|E

50|$|<b>Letterboxing</b> {{is used as}} an {{alternative}} to a full-screen, pan-and-scan transfer of a widescreen film image to videotape or videodisc. In pan-and-scan transfers, the original image is cropped to the narrower aspect ratio of the destination format, usually the 1.33:1 (4:3) ratio of the standard television screen, whereas <b>letterboxing</b> preserves the film's original image composition as seen in the cinema. <b>Letterboxing</b> was developed for use in 4:3 television displays before widescreen television screens were available, but it is also necessary to represent on a 16:9 widescreen display the unaltered original composition of a film with a wider aspect ratio, such as Panavision's 2.35:1 ratio.|$|R
25|$|Following an {{assembly}} in Lucerne, Switzerland in early September 1936 up to 3,000 {{copies of a}} resolution of protest were sent to government, public and clerical leaders, stepping up the Watch Tower Society's anti-Catholic polemic. Several German Witnesses who attended the convention were arrested by waiting police as they returned to their homes and between August and September the Gestapo arrested more than 1,000 members. The society responded with a pamphlet campaign on December 12, dropping up to 200,000 copies of the Lucerne resolution in mailboxes and also leaving them at phone booths, park benches and parked cars. Those arrested in subsequent police raids were sentenced to {{up to two years}} in prison. The number of arrests increased; in Dresden alone as many as 1500 Witnesses had been arrested by mid-1937. Another <b>letterbox</b> campaign was carried out in June 1937, a year in which the Watch Tower Society announced German Witnesses had distributed more than 450,000 books and booklets in 12 months.|$|E
25|$|In July 2012 Ofcom {{consulted}} on {{a scheme}} proposed by Royal Mail to alter its delivery obligations to allow larger postal items {{to be left}} with neighbours rather than returning them to a Royal Mail office to await collection. The scheme was presented as offering consumers greater choice for receiving mail when not at home, that is if Royal Mail deliver items as per their stated contractual obligations and was said to follow Royal Mail research from a 'delivery to neighbour' trial across six areas of the UK that showed widespread consumer satisfaction. In a statement dated 27 September 2012, Ofcom announced it would approve the scheme after noting that more goods were being purchased over the internet and that Royal Mail's competitors were permitted to leave undelivered items with neighbours. People who {{do not wish to}} have parcels left with neighbours, or to receive those of others, can opt out by displaying a free opt-out sticker near their <b>letterbox.</b> Royal Mail remains liable for undeliverable items until they are received by the addressee or returned to sender.|$|E
