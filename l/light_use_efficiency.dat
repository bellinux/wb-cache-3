These interactions are largely expressed through changes in phytoplankton physiology, but physiological status has proven extremely challenging to characterize globally. Phytoplankton fluorescence does provide {{a rich source of}} physiological information long exploited in laboratory and field studies, and is now observed from space. Here we evaluate the physiological underpinnings of global variations in satellite-based phytoplankton chlorophyll fluorescence. The three dominant factors influencing fluorescence distributions are chlorophyll concentration, pigment packaging effects on light absorption, and light-dependent energy-quenching processes. After accounting for these three factors, resultant global distributions of quenching-corrected fluorescence quantum yields reveal a striking consistency with anticipated patterns of iron availability. High fluorescence quantum yields are typically found in low iron waters, while low quantum yields dominate regions where other environmental factors are most limiting to phytoplankton growth. Specific properties of photosynthetic membranes are discussed that provide a mechanistic view linking iron stress to satellite-detected fluorescence. Our results present satellite-based fluorescence as a valuable tool for evaluating nutrient stress predictions in ocean ecosystem models and give the first synoptic observational evidence that iron {{plays an important role in}} seasonal phytoplankton dynamics of the Indian Ocean.

Less developed beds low connectivity between PS II antennae leading inevitably to an impairment of the energetic transport.

The driving force for intercropping was the need to increase household income by producing a cash crop, while maintaining {{the production of a}} major staple food. This study aims at analyzing the productivity and resource use of cotton-wheat relay intercropping systems. Wheat is sown in strips with interspersed bare soil in October and harvested in June of the next year, while cotton is sown in the interspersed space in the wheat crop in April and harvested before the next wheat sowing in October. Crop growth, phenology, productivity, quality, resource <b>use</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and profitability of mono- and intercrops were studied at the plant, field and system levels. The measurements were carried out in field experiments during three consecutive years with monocultures of wheat and cotton and four intercropping designs differing in strip and path width as well as number of rows per strip. The intercrop systems were identified by the number of rows per strip of wheat and cotton, as 3 : 1, 3 : 2, 4 : 2 and 6 : 2, respectively. All intercropping systems showed an advantage in land productivity compared to growing of monocrops. The fiber quality of cotton was not affected by intercropping. The land equivalence ratio was 1. 39 in the 3 : 1, 3 : 2 and 4 : 2 systems, and significantly lower, 1. 28, in the 6 : 2 system. All systems thus provide a substantial land <b>use</b> advantage. Resource (<b>light</b> and nitrogen) <b>use</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of intercropped wheat were similar to the monoculture; however, the resource capture decreased, because part of the land space was assigned to cotton. For intercropped cotton, <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were similar to the monoculture; the amount of light intercepted decreased due to a delay in development and growth during the seedling stage and by the extent of canopy closure after the wheat harvest. The relative nitrogen yield total of intercrops was higher than the land equivalence ratio. Nitrogen <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> of cotton was decreased. The analysis of the N balance sheet showed that in the intercropping systems N was considerably more prone to losses than in the sole cotton. Conventional N-management in intercrops results in high N-surpluses that pose an environmental risk. Water productivity, both of wheat and cotton, was lower for the intercrops than for monocultures. The lower WP in the intercropping systems compared to the sole crop is a concern for the sustainability of these systems; water productivity needs to be enhanced. A simple mechanistic model for cotton (SUCROS-Cotton) was developed to explore the prospects to optimize intercropping systems. This model simulates cotton development as well for intercrops as for monoculture. The findings suggest that the productivity and resource <b>use</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of cotton-wheat intercropping can be improved by modifying the conventional management practices and by system optimization. It is concluded that the intercropping systems increase farmers’ income under a wide range of wheat and cotton prices. ...|$|R

This modelling approach would avoid the complications that are involved in using me- teorological data as constraints for a fixed maximum LUE. However, no unifying model predicting LUE across climate zones and time based on MODIS PRI has been published to date. This study evaluates the effectiveness with which MODIS-based PRI can be used to estimate ecosystem <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> at study sites of different plant functional types and vegetation densities. The objective is to examine if known limitations such as dependence on viewing and illumination geometry can be overcome and a single PRI-based model of LUE (i. e. based on the same reference band) can be applied under a wide range of conditions. Fur- thermore, this thesis examines the effect of using different fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (faPAR) products on the in-situ LUE used as ground truth and thus on the whole evaluation exercise. The conclusion of this study is that estimating LUE at site-level based on PRI reduces uncertainty compared to the approaches relying on a maximum LUE reduced by minimum temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Despite the advantages of using PRI to estimate LUE at site-level, a universally applicable <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> model based on MODIS PRI could not be established.

Spatial statistic results were consistent with the practical condition in most cases.

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} {{characteristics of}} eight contrasting cocoa genotypes were studied {{with the aim}} of examining genotypic variation in maximum (light-saturated) photosynthetic rates, light-response curve parameters and water <b>use</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Photosynthetic traits were derived from single leaf gas exchange measurements using a portable infra-red gas analyser. All measurements were conducted in a common greenhouse environment. Significant variation was observed in light-saturated photosynthesis ranging from 3. 4 to 5. 7 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 for the clones IMC 47 and SCA 6, respectively. Furthermore, analyses of photosynthetic light response curves indicated genotypic differences in light saturation point and quantum efficiency (i. e. the <b>efficiency</b> of <b>light</b> <b>use).</b> Stomatal conductance was a significant factor underlying genotypic differences in assimilation. Genotypic variation was also observed in a number of leaf traits, including specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf area to leaf weight), chlorophyll concentration and nitrogen content. There was a positive correlation between leaf nitrogen per unit area and light-saturated photosynthesis. Water <b>use</b> <b>efficiency,</b> defined as the ratio of photosynthetic rate to transpiration rate, also varied significantly between clones (ranging from 3. 1 mmol mol- 1 H 2 O for the clone IMC 47 to 4. 2 mmol mol- 1 H 2 O for the clone ICS 1). Water <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> was a negative function of specific leaf area, suggesting that low specific leaf area might be a useful criterion for selection for increased water <b>use</b> <b>efficiency.</b> It is concluded that both variation in water <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the photosynthetic response to light have the potential to be exploited in breeding programmes...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of leaf area is an {{essential}} component of plant growth analysis and evapotranspirational studies. Leaf area is important for crop light interception and therefore has a large influence on growth (Boote et al., 1988), transpiration (Enoch and Hurd, 1979) and growth rate (Leith et al., 1986). Leaf area production is essential for energy transference and dry matter accumulation processes in crop canopies. It is also useful in the analysis of canopy architecture as it allows determination of leaf area index, which is important for <b>light</b> interception, radiation <b>use</b> <b>efficiency,</b> plant growth, etc. However, measurement of leaf area of all the leaves of any single plant is not only time consuming but also involves a large amount of labour. But, one cannot do away without measuring leaf area because estimation of leaf area is {{an essential}} part of plant growth analysis. Although many methods are available for leaf area measurements, the use of leaf area as a variable in plant growth analysis and physiological studies is limited owing to the time consuming and laborious methods involved in its measurement and though sophisticated electronic instruments provide accurate and fast leaf area measurement, is expensive especially in developing countries. Hence the nee...|$|R

For instance, South Mediterranean area is strongly affected by prolonged drought, high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and extremely high temperatures during summertime. In the present work we investigated the soil water effect on crop growth and leaf gas exchange of Saccharum spontaneum L. ssp. aegyptiacum (Willd.) Hackel, a perennial, rhizomatous, herbaceous grass. Furthermore, the net increase of biomass production per unit <b>light</b> intercepted [radiation <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> (RUE) ] and per unit water transpired [water <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> (WUE) ] was also studied. To this end a field trial was carried out imposing three levels of soil water availability (I 100, I 50 and I 0, corresponding to 100 %, 50 % and 0 % of ETm restutition) under a semi-arid Mediterranean environment. Leaf area index (LAI), stem height, biomass dry matter yield, CO 2 assimilation rate, and transpiration rate resulted significantly affected by measurement time and irrigation treatment, with the highest values in I 100 and the lowest in I 0. RUE was the highest in I 100 followed by I 50 and I 0; on the other hand, WUE was higher in I 0 than I 50 and I 100. At LAI values greater than 2. 0, 85 % photosynthetically active radiation was intercepted by the Saccharum stand, irrespective of the irrigation treatment. Saccharum spontaneum spp. aegyptiacum is a potential species for biomass production in environment characterized by drought stress, high temperatures and high VPD, as those of Southern Europe and similar semi-arid areas...|$|R

Here we present estimates of ^(13) C discrimination for northern biomes based on a biosphere-atmosphere model and on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research remote flask measurements. With our inversion approach, we solved for three ecophysiological parameters of the northern biosphere (^(13) C discrimination, a net primary production <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and a temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration (a Q 10 factor)) that provided a best fit between modeled and observed δ^(13) C and CO_ 2. In our analysis we attempted to explicitly correct for fossil fuel emissions, remote C 4 ecosystem fluxes, ocean exchange, and isotopic disequilibria of terrestrial heterotrophic respiration caused by the Suess effect. We obtained a photosynthetic discrimination for arctic and boreal biomes between 19. 0 and 19. 6 ‰. Our inversion analysis suggests that Q 10 and <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> values that minimize the cost function covary. The optimal <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> was 0. 47 gC MJ^(− 1) photosynthetically active radiation, and the optimal Q 10 value was 1. 52. Fossil fuel and ocean exchange contributed proportionally more to month-to-month changes in the atmospheric growth rate of δ^(13) C and CO_ 2 during winter months, suggesting that remote atmospheric observations during the summer may yield more precise estimates of the isotopic composition of the biosphere...|$|E

Gross primary production (GPP) {{is one of the}} key factors for understanding grass growing conditions. Methods for estimating GPP are plentiful, and the <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> (LUE) model based on remote sensing data is widely used. The MODIS GPP product, which is employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is calculated using the LUE model and the surface reflection data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Terra/Aqua satellite.

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> (LUE) {{models are}} widely used to {{simulate}} gross primary production (GPP). However, {{the treatment of the}} plant canopy as a big leaf by these models can introduce large uncertainties in simulated GPP. Recently, a two-leaf <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> (TL-LUE) model was developed to simulate GPP separately for sunlit and shaded leaves and has been shown to outperform the big-leaf MOD 17 model at six FLUX sites in China. In this study we investigated the performance of the TL-LUE model for a wider range of biomes. For this we optimized the parameters and tested the TL-LUE model using data from 98 FLUXNET sites which are distributed across the globe. The results showed that the TL-LUE model performed in general better than the MOD 17 model in simulating 8 [*]day GPP. Optimized maximum <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiency</b> of shaded leaves (εmsh) was 2. 63 to 4. 59 times that of sunlit leaves (εmsu). Generally, the relationships of εmsh and εmsu with εmax were well described by linear equations, indicating the existence of general patterns across biomes. GPP simulated by the TL-LUE model was much less sensitive to biases in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) input than the MOD 17 model. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the proposed TL-LUE model has the potential for simulating regional and global GPP of terrestrial ecosystems, and it is more robust with regard to usual biases in input data than existing approaches which neglect the bimodal within-canopy distribution of PAR.

40|$|The {{potential}} to measure vegetation fluorescence from space (1) and {{to derive from}} it direct information on the gross primary productivity (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems {{is probably the most}} thrilling development in remote sensing and global ecology of recent years, as it moves Earth observation techniques from the detection of canopy biophysics (e. g., fraction of absorbed radiation) and biochemistry (chlorophyll and nitrogen content) to the realm of ecosystem function. The existence of a functional relationship between fluorescence and photosynthesis has been elucidated over the last decade by several laboratories, notably as part of the preliminary studies of the European Space Agency Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) Earth Explorer Mission. The empirical observation presented by Guanter et al. (2) of a linear relationship between fluorescence radiance and GPP, however, provides the first experimental confirmation of the feasibility of the approach already thoroughly tested at leaf levelat the desired scale, despite the confounding effects associated with the satellite detection of such a faint signal. A word of clarification is needed here. The use of fluorescence as a probe of leaf photochemistry has been a staple of plant ecophysiology for decades, rooted in a sound understanding of photosynthetic energy dissipation. However, most past studies had to rely for the interpretation of results on active (pulse-saturated) techniques, making them unsuitable for remote-sensing applications. Over recent years, however, novel process based models have been developed for the interpretation of steady-state, solar-induced fluorescence at the leaf to canopy scale (3). We are therefore in a position to move beyond the mere empirical observation of an association between GPP and fluorescence radiance. In particular, Guanter et al. (2) base their analysis on the assumption of a constant ratio between photosynthetic and fluorescence <b>light</b> <b>use</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (equation 3 in ref. 2). We know, however, that the ratio is not constant, but changes widely in response to light, CO 2, stomatal limitations, and extreme stress (4, 5). Whats more, we can make sense of such changes, thus extracting valuable information from the very scatter that is apparent in their data. However, this process will require the availability of more tailored instruments, such as the one planned for the FLEX mission. As already stressed by Guanter et al. (2), the spatial resolution of the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment- 2 sensor (40 80 km) makes it difficult to compare meaningfully the fluorescence signal with ground measurements, when only 6070 % of the footprint consists of the desired land-cover type (table S 1 in ref. 2), suggesting that this could be largely responsible for the low signals observed in European grasslands. Moreover, the overpass time of the MetOp-A satellite (9 : 30 AM) implies that fluorescence is generally measured under light-limiting conditions, when fluorescence is only marginally affected by stomatal closure even under stress conditions. This result could explain the seasonal mismatch with daily GPP observed in natural ecosystems in the absence of irrigation (figure 4 in ref. 2). We hope, therefore, that this welcome contribution to this fast-advancing field will help demonstrate the potential of the new technique, and pave the way for more refined studies under both a technological and scientific point of view...|$|R
