5|$|Born in Mitchell, Ontario to William Frederick Morenz and Rosena (Rose) Pauli, Howie Morenz {{had three}} sisters, Freda, Erma and Gertrude, and two brothers, Wilfred and Ezra. Morenz learned his hockey by playing shinny on the Thames River. At {{the age of}} eight, he played his first {{organized}} game as a goaltender, where he allowed 21 goals in a game. After that game, a coach switched Morenz to rover, a defensive position. Starting the 1916–17 junior season as a goaltender, Morenz became a forward when it became apparent his speed was much more suitable for an offensive role, and he helped the Mitchell ice hockey team win the Western Ontario junior championship. After the Morenz family moved to the nearby community of Stratford in May 1917, Morenz tried enlisting in the Canadian military but was refused when recruiters <b>learned</b> <b>he</b> was only 15years old.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Meredith {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} play for the Australia national team. Australia coach Ange Postecoglou said {{at the time that he}} was open to selecting a number of new players to the national team, including Meredith. Meredith was first called up by Australia for a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan on 8 October 2015, for which he was an unused substitute as Australia lost 2–0. Meredith debuted for Australia on 12 November 2015, after being selected in the starting line-up for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Kyrgyzstan, which the team won 3–0 at home. He only <b>learned</b> <b>he</b> would be starting on the morning of the match, and his family flew to Canberra from Melbourne to watch him. He made a second start in a win over Bangladesh four days later.|$|E
5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr <b>learned</b> <b>he</b> was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the corruption of the NHL's pension plan.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks later}} MacLachlan <b>learned</b> <b>he</b> {{was to be}} {{relocated}} to Malta. Twelve pilots and 207 men boarded HMS Argus in the River Clyde just off Greenock on 7 November 1940 and set sail for the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations. The convoy sent to Malta constituted a part of Operation Collar. The operation was to supply aircraft for the Island's defence. In June 1940 Italy had declared war on France when the country {{was on the verge}} of collapse at the hands of the German Wehrmacht. The Italians hoped they could take advantage of the weakened Allies by joining the Axis Powers. It was the Italian intent to launch a series of air, naval and land offensives throughout the Mediterranean and in particularly in North Africa. Malta lay across Italian sea communications between Sicily and Italian-held Libya. The island had the potential to be a useful base from which the British could disrupt Axis supplies to and from North Africa and the ensuing North African Campaign. The Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) resolved to eliminate the island by bombing shipping bringing in supplies and attacking the island directly. With air power crucial to both sides, the island was reinforced.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, each Gatling gun {{had to be}} hauled by four horses, and {{soldiers}} often had to drag the heavy guns by hand over obstacles. Each of the heavy, hand-cranked weapons could fire up to 350 rounds a minute, an impressive rate, but they were known to jam frequently. During the Black Hills Expedition two years earlier, a Gatling gun had turned over, rolled down a mountain, and shattered to pieces.

However, he was forced to leave the show three months later because of ill health caused by dehydration resulting from the enormous fat-suit he wore during the performance.

25|$|Experience {{was also}} a key element to {{learning}} for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of knowledge often practised in book learning.He argued that students would become passive adults; blindly obeying and lacking {{the ability to think}} on their own. Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be <b>learned.</b> <b>He</b> believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books. For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Veteran CCPD detective Paul Rivera led {{the murder}} investigation. Originally, an unnamed man {{was hired to}} defend Saldívar but withdrew from the case on April 4 fearing {{community}} retaliation, and concerned about his children's reaction when they <b>learned</b> <b>he</b> was defending Saldívar whom they disliked. Judge Mike Westergren began searching for a defense attorney. Prosecutor Carlos Valdez was designated lead prosecutor, while Mark Skurka was appointed his legal counsel. On April 6, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict Saldívar for murder. After about an hour, the jury had returned a true bill and the indictment was randomly assigned to the 214th District Court. Carlos Valdez believed that a speedy trial with Westergren presiding over the case was probable.|$|E
