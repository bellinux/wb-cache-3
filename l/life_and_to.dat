5|$|A key {{ingredient}} to the Hammond organ's success {{was the use}} of dealerships and a sense of community. Several dedicated organ dealers set up business in the United States and there was a bi-monthly newsletter, The Hammond Times, mailed out to subscribers. Advertisements tended to show families gathered around the instrument, often with a child playing it, as an attempt to show the organ as a center-point of home <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> encourage children to learn music.|$|E

5|$|Armatus, as magister militum, {{was sent}} with all {{available}} forces in Asia Minor, {{to oppose the}} advancing army of the Isaurians, but secret messages from Zeno, who promised {{to give him the}} title of magister militum for <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> confer the rank of Caesar on his son, induced him to betray his master. Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the community at Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{training}} period was for six weeks; {{later it was}} changed to eight weeks. General in scope, the program was designed to give cadets an overall view of the USCG. Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and visual aids. The regimental part of {{the training}} was designed to help cadets adjust to military <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> acquaint them with their responsibilities as officers. The cadets {{ranged in age from}} 20 to 40, with diverse civilian backgrounds from teachers and journalists to lawyers and technicians.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity. One reason for including this color final was, according to Tarkovsky, {{to give the}} viewer some rest and {{to allow him to}} detach himself from Rublev's <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> reflect. The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life was the source of all of Rublev's art.|$|E
5|$|Aerith makes several {{appearances}} in the CGI film , as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him {{to move on with}} his <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past. However, she also acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support. One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She also appears in the final scene of the movie, along with Zack Fair, where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement before she and Zack walk into the light. Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church, which manifests itself as a cure for Geostigma.|$|E

5|$|Legatine councils in 1125, 1127 and 1129 {{were held}} in Westminster, the last two called by Archbishop William. The council of 1125 met under the {{direction}} of John of Crema and prohibited simony, purchase of the sacraments, and the inheritance of clerical benefices. John of Crema had been sent to England not only to seek a compromise in the Canterbury–York dispute, but to publicize the decrees of the First Council of the Lateran held in 1123, which neither William nor Thurstan had attended. Included in canons were the rejection of hereditary claims to a benefice or prebend, which was a source of consternation to the clergy. Also prohibited was the presence of any women in clergy's households unless they were relatives. In 1127 the council condemned the purchase of benefices, priesthoods, or places in monastic houses. It also enacted canons declaring that clergy who refused to give up their wives or concubines would be deprived of their benefices, and that any such women who did not leave the parish where they had been could be expelled and even forced into slavery. Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more admonished to live a celibate <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> put aside their wives. This council was presided over by King Henry, who then undermined the force of the prohibition of concubines by permitting the clergy to pay a fine to the royal treasury to keep their women. William's allowance of this royal fine was condemned by the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon. The festival of the Conception was also allowed at one of these councils.|$|E
5|$|The emperor was the {{ultimate}} authority in policy- and decision-making, {{but in the early}} Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council (consilium) became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency. Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions {{until the end of the}} Antonine dynasty, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium. The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions. Plotina exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian. Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published, as a sign that the emperor was reasonable in his exercise of authority and listened to his people.|$|E
5|$|With the Halliwells' help, Billie {{attempts}} to help Christy reintegrate back into everyday <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> gain control over her powers. Billie and the Halliwells {{are unaware of}} Christy's collaboration with the Triad. The Triad identifies Billie as the Ultimate Power, which was foreshadowed in earlier episodes as the season's big bad, and refers to Christy {{as the key to}} unlocking Billie's power. The Triad arranges for Christy's parents to be killed by a pair of Noxon demons (John Rosenfeld and David S. Lee), believing prolonged contact with them could sway her morality to the side of good. Billie becomes angry by the Halliwell sisters when they decide to interrogate the demons to gather more information about the Ultimate Power rather than killing them to avenge her parents' deaths. Christy uses Billie's feeling of betrayal to turn her against the Charmed Ones. Billie and Christy vanquish the Noxon demons, who were previously believed to be invincible, and the Halliwell sisters realize that Billie is the Ultimate Power.|$|E
