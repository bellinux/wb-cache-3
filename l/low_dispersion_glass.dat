2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or apochromat. Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently <b>low</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>glass</b> can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass. Similarly, the benefit of apochromats is not simply that they focus 3 wavelengths sharply, but that their error on other wavelength is also quite small.|$|E

5000|$|... 1981: Sigma 21-35mm f/3.5-4 (Japan): first super-wide angle {{zoom lens}} for SLRs. For decades, {{combining}} {{the complexities of}} rectilinear super-wide angle lenses, retrofocus lenses and zoom lenses seemed impossibly difficult. Sigma did the impossible and reached a 91° maximum field of view for 35 mm SLRs with an all-moving eleven element formula through the maturation of computer-aided design and multicoating. In 2004, the Sigma 12-24mm f/4.5-5.6 EX DG Aspherical HSM (Japan) zoom reached 122°, wider than any SLR prime lens ever made, by taking additional advantage of aspherics and <b>low</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|R
500|$|Lanthanum(III) oxide (...) {{improves}} the alkali resistance {{of glass and}} is used in making special optical glasses, such as infrared-absorbing glass, as well as camera and telescope lenses, {{because of the high}} refractive index and <b>low</b> <b>dispersion</b> of rare-earth <b>glasses.</b> Lanthanum oxide is also used as a grain-growth additive during the liquid-phase sintering of silicon nitride and zirconium diboride.|$|R

50|$|One {{solution}} {{is to reduce the}} aberration by using multiple elements of different types of glass.

40|$|Recently, a {{group of}} glasses has been {{investigated}} that have high refractive index and <b>low</b> <b>dispersion.</b> These <b>glasses</b> are known as reluctant glass formers and lie in the 'forbidden' region of the conventional glass map.

Since these glasses have unusual optical properties, a study was performed to {{gain an understanding of}} the impact such glasses could have on optical design and to establish desired baseline optical properties as objectives for the material scientists. Several generic optical configurations were explored to determine if a meaningful improvement could be realized. Study results are presented and discussed to illustrate that a notable enhancement in optical performance is attainable...|$|R

50|$|Convenience of a {{different}} sort was the major feature of the Tokina SZ-X 70-210mm f/4-5.6 SD (Japan) of 1985. It was the first ultra-compact zoom (85×66 mm, 445 g, 52mm filter); half the size of most earlier 70-210 zooms (the third generation Vivitar Series 1 70-210mm f/2.8-4 USA/Japan was 139×70 mm, 860 g, 62mm filter). Like the Kiron 28-210mm, the twelve element/eight group/three cell Tokina had a small variable maximum aperture, but added <b>low</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>glass</b> and a new bidirectional nonlinear zooming action, to bring size and weight down to an absolute minimum.|$|E
50|$|The Canon F-1 {{used the}} Canon FD lens mount, though earlier FL and R series lenses {{could be used}} as well with very few {{exception}}s. One exception is the FLP 38 mm F2.8 which sat way back in the mount and was designed for the Canon Pellix, an FL era camera. Canon Lenses were acclaimed for their superb optical quality, and ranged from 7.5 mm Fisheye to the super long telephoto FL 1200 mm F11. Canon pioneered the use of artificial Calcium Fluorite lens elements, thus making high speed long telephoto lenses a reality. Ultra <b>Low</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>glass</b> was another Canon innovation, as was aspherical lens elements for high speed normal and wide angle lenses. Canon's superior lenses quality and excellent cameras was (and still is) manifested by the legions of sports photographers with long white super telephoto lenses at major sporting events worldwide. All those white lens barrels are Canon lenses and back in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s those lenses were fitted to Canon F-1s.|$|E

30|$|Thus, the M 1 {{microstructure}} {{results in}} moderate overall transmission but high dispersion.
