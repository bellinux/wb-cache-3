5|$|Kraków hosts many annual and {{biannual}} artistic events, some {{of international}} significance {{such as the}} Misteria Paschalia (Baroque music), Sacrum-Profanum (contemporary music), the Cracow Screen Festival (popular music), the Festival of Polish Music (classical music), Dedications (theatre), the Kraków Film Festival (one of Europe's oldest short films events), Etiuda International Film Festival (the oldest international art-film event in Poland), Biennial of Graphic Arts, and the Jewish Culture Festival.

5|$|The current city {{structure}} can {{be traced}} back to the Tanzimat period of reform in the 19th century, before which Islamic judges and imams led the city under the auspices of the Grand Vizier. Following the model of French cities, this religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed of representatives of the confessional groups (millet) across Istanbul. Beyoğlu was the first area of the city to have its own director and council, with members instead being <b>longtime</b> <b>residents</b> of the neighborhood. Laws enacted after the Ottoman constitution of 1876 aimed to expand this structure across the city, imitating the twenty arrondissements of Paris, but they were not fully implemented until 1908, when Istanbul was declared a province with nine constituent districts. This system continued beyond the founding of the Turkish Republic, with the province renamed a belediye (municipality), but the municipality was disbanded in 1957.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasingly}} upscale {{nature of}} the city – not just the northern part, which was always affluent, but the southern Ocean Park neighborhood as well {{which has become a}} favorite of those in the entertainment industry – has created some tensions between newcomers and <b>longtime</b> <b>residents</b> nostalgic for the more bohemian, countercultural past. Nevertheless, with the recent corporate additions of Yahoo! (2005) and Google (2006), gentrification continues.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the California Gold Rush in 1848, at least 25,000 Mexicans had been <b>longtime</b> <b>residents</b> of California since the Spanish colonial period.

25|$|Bowser {{emphasized}} {{that she can}} connect with <b>longtime</b> <b>residents</b> concerned about the rapid changes occurring in the District, while still celebrating the changes that had occurred. Bowser disdained business-as-usual and corruption in the District's government. She favored free Metro fares for students. She was against increasing for the minimum wage only for employees of large retailers. Bowser was criticized for being too inexperienced for the position, with too few legislative accomplishments while on the Council, and for having a platform that was short on details. She limited the number of debates by only agreeing to participate after the field of candidates had been set, which postponed the first debate until August.|$|E
25|$|The Yat dialect is {{the most}} {{pronounced}} version of the New Orleans Accent. Natives often speak {{with varying degrees of}} the Brooklyn-esque accent, ranging from a slight intonation to what is considered full Yat. As with all dialects, there is variance by local speakers due to geographic and social factors. This results in many different levels of Yat throughout the area, marking distinct differences between higher-income people and lower-income people. Yat tends to differ in strength and intonation from neighborhood to neighborhood. The type, strength, and lexicon of the accent vary from section to section of the New Orleans Metropolitan Area. <b>Longtime</b> <b>residents</b> can often tell what area the other residents are from by their accent.|$|E

25|$|Old Austin is an adage {{often used}} by the native {{citizens}} in Austin, Texas when being nostalgic {{to refer to the}} olden days of the capital city of Texas. Although Austin is also known internationally as the live music capital of the world and its catch phrase/slogan Keep Austin Weird can be heard echoed in places as far as Buffalo, NY and Santa Monica, CA - the term Old Austin refers to a time when the city was smaller and more bohemian with a considerably lower cost of living and better known for its lack of traffic, hipsters, and urban sprawl. It is often employed by <b>longtime</b> <b>residents</b> expressing displeasure at the rapidly changing culture.|$|E
500|$|A dialect of English, {{known as}} Bristolian, Bristolese, Brizzle or Bristle (after the {{publication}} of Derek Robson's [...] "Krek Waiters peak Bristle") is spoken by <b>longtime</b> <b>residents,</b> who are known as Bristolians. Bristol natives have a rhotic accent, in which the post-vocalic r in [...] "car" [...] and [...] "card" [...] is pronounced (unlike in Received Pronunciation). The unique feature of this accent is the [...] "Bristol (or terminal) l", in which l is appended to words ending in a or o. Whether this is a broad l or a w is a subject of debate, with [...] "area" [...] pronounced [...] "areal" [...] or [...] "areaw". The ending of [...] "Bristol" [...] {{is another example of}} the Bristol l. Bristolians pronounce -a and -o {{at the end of a}} word as -aw (cinemaw). To non-natives, the pronunciation suggests an l after the vowel.|$|E
2500|$|Natives and <b>longtime</b> <b>residents</b> use the {{pronunciation}} [...] (BOY-see), as {{given on}} the city's website. The pronunciation is sometimes {{used as a}} shibboleth, as outsiders (and newcomers) tend to pronounce the city's name as [...] (BOY-zee).|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} {{language spoken}} in Büsum is Dithmarscher Platt, {{a variant of}} Low German.
