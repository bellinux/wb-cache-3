5|$|On 6 December 2011, a prequel to {{the episode}} was {{released}} online. The Doctor (Matt Smith) is {{seen on a}} spaceship holding a red button which, when he lets go, will cause the space ship to explode. While holding the button, he has phoned the TARDIS to speak to Amy Pond asking her to rescue him, although {{he does not have}} his co-ordinates, Amy cannot fly the TARDIS, and she is not on the TARDIS. The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> button, and the spaceship explodes.|$|E
5|$|The modern event sees athletes {{run down}} {{a strip of}} track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the {{horizontal}} bar before <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre. The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition {{was held at the}} 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. <b>Letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E

5|$|In December 2009, Tucker is {{introduced}} as J.T. Hellstrom’s (Thad Luckinbill) employer, while pursuing a business deal with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and beginning {{an affair with}} Jill Abbott (Jess Walton). Tucker secretly gains control of Katherine’s company, Chancellor Industries, after she buys stock in a dummy corporation and at a shareholders' meeting, Tucker reveals that he is Kay's long-lost son, and he was behind a woman named Jojo Glover pretending to be her daughter. After years of planning, Tucker had finally gotten his revenge on Katherine for giving him away and he begins slowly dismantling Chancellor Industries by selling its subsidiaries. Meanwhile, Katherine's other son, Brock Reynolds (Beau Kazer) advises Tucker {{to get to know}} their mother, but Katherine refuses to accept him, and Tucker is hurt. He hires Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) and plans to sell off Chancellor Industries piece by piece, including Jabot Cosmetics. Adam’s father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) wins Jabot in a bidding war; Tucker refuses to hire Jill at Chancellor Industries. Katherine threatens to reveal Tucker's bribing of Alexander Thomas until she begins feeling guilty and backs off; an impressed Tucker puts a hold on the selling of her company. While Katherine and Tucker bond, he asks about his father, Arthur Hendricks (David Hedison), while Jill finds the information on Tucker and runs it in Restless Style magazine. Tucker and Katherine come to an agreement where she gets 51% of Chancellor Industries, but Tucker mistakenly believes Jill and Katherine were working together, and he promises to dismantle the company before their agreement comes into effect. Thanks to Jill, Tucker is investigated by the SEC while he bonds with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who is struggling with <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child she thought was her daughter. Tucker supports her, much to the dismay of her boyfriend, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), while he announces his plans to purchase Jabot for himself. Tucker blackmails Katherine into giving him back control of Jabot in exchange for him keeping quiet about Adam giving Victor access to the bids and he offers Ashley the CEO position.|$|E

25|$|Forgiveness in Hinduism {{does not}} {{necessarily}} require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, {{and being able to}} focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (dharmic life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger (akrodhi).|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} of April, 2010, being blonde again and having left Avrupa Müzik, now {{being part of the}} music label of Poll Production, Yener {{released}} yet another album, called Hande'ye Neler Oluyor? (What's Going On With Hande?). Before she released this album, she has been cited that she would likely return to a more pop-oriented sound, meaning <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing electronic sound of her last three albums and her EP Hande Maxi. Although not a collection of pure electronic songs, the album didn't throw the electronic sound completely overboard — it actually contains no live instrumentation — favouring a more dance-pop oriented album, reminiscing of some songs of her Apayrı-era, over the more Türk pop albums {{in the early days of}} her career.|$|E
25|$|Borg {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{distinctive}} playing styles in the Open Era. He played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes. His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander. He hit the ball hard and high {{from the back of the}} court and brought it down with considerable topspin, which made his ground strokes very consistent. There had been other players, particularly Rod Laver and Arthur Ashe, who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand, yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots to pass their opponents at the net easily. Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.|$|E

25|$|Each team {{consisted}} of 40 to 50 men. The best players were highly prized, and villages gave them houses, planted their fields for them, and overlooked their misdeeds {{in an effort}} to keep such players on their teams. Players scored one point if they hit the goalpost with the ball, and two points if the ball landed in the nest. Eleven points won the game. Play was rough: players would pile on fallen players, walk on them, kick them, including in the face, pull on arms and legs and stuff dirt in each other's mouths. Players were told to die before <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball. They would try to hide the ball in their mouths; other players would choke them or kick them in the stomach to force the ball out. Arms and legs were broken. Players laid out on the ground would be revived by a bucket of cold water. There were occasional deaths. According to Father Paiva, five games in a row had ended in riots.|$|E
500|$|Before departing Fortuna, Dante surprises Nero by {{deciding}} to entrust him with Yamato indefinitely; thus recognizing {{him as a}} part of his family. The two part as equals. In a way, this also symbolizes Dante <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, and allowing himself to move on from his brother Vergil's death. Left in the ruins of Fortuna, Nero easily fights off the last remaining demons, before finally sharing his first kiss with Kyrie. In the extra Special Edition story for Trish and Lady, both appear (somewhat non-canonically for Lady) and witness the kiss from afar with Dante, only for Trish to lament that [...] "at least someone knows how to get the girl." ...|$|E

So {{there are a lot}} of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past and becoming something new." [...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life". [...] "Blunt Force Trauma" [...] is about when someone or something comes up behind you when you least expect it, [...] "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle".|$|E

500|$|Written and {{produced}} by Madonna and Pettibone, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] {{was the first}} time that Pettibone worked with live string arrangement. Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with instrumentation from piano, organ, strings and a basic drum sounds. During the final recording, the duo had to redo the whole orchestra section to tailor it for the song. [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] starts with a keyboard introduction and strings, with Madonna singing in expressive but subdued vocals. Its verse and chorus merge into each other for having a continuity in the song, but the track ends abruptly. Lyrically it discusses visiting one's childhood places and not <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E
500|$|Seven {{years in}} the future, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) reads a comic book {{entitled}} [...] "Smallville", detailing the rise of Superman, to her son. Flashing back seven years, Lois Lane (Erica Durance) and Clark Kent (Tom Welling) argue about their upcoming wedding. Lois wants to call off the wedding, believing that she is hindering Clark’s destiny. Chloe gives Lois a copy of Clark’s vows to help convince her {{to go through with}} the wedding. Meanwhile, Clark has a discussion with his mother, Martha (Annette O'Toole) about <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. Clark visits Lois at their apartment, where she tells him that the wedding is on, admitting that she read his vows, and gives him hers in exchange. Clark reads her vows and tells her that he will meet her at the chapel.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, it is a self-empowerment anthem that {{discusses}} {{themes of}} confidence and hope.

[...] Nao'ymt furthered commented to TBS that he song talked about looking forward and <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, alongside complimented Amuro's [...] "strong" [...] vocals. In an interview with Billboard Japan, an English version of [...] "Contrail" [...] was written and recorded by Nao'ymt, but was replaced with the Japanese version because Amuro felt {{the majority of the}} recordings on Feel felt [...] "better in English", and that the theme song for the television series was directed towards Japanese audiences only.|$|E

500|$|There are {{two songs}} about falling in love, [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Vámonos Negrito". The former, {{arranged}} to emulate emotional outbursts, {{was the most}} difficult to finish, and the singer had a hard time trying to find the right place for it on the album. [...] "Vámonos Negrito" [...] is a tribute to her Latin American roots that she started writing after a show in Colombia and finished in Cuba; in this song, one of her favorites, she tried to create a musical landscape with instruments, textures, and harmonies. The bolero [...] "Antes de Huir", is a [...] "sad and hopeful" [...] song. It is about not <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things we love. [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer" [...] is, according to Lafourcade, an obscure folk-pop song about finding that one cannot be in a relationship anymore; it was written during a concert tour in Monterrey.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have since}} remarked that Bannon's books are {{remarkable}} for portraying homosexual relationships relatively accurately. The continuity of {{characters in the}} series also gave her books a unique quality, especially when most lesbian characters during this time were one-dimensional stereotypes who met punishment for their desires. Bannon's characters have been called [...] "accessibly human", and still engrossing by contemporary standards compared to being [...] "revolutionary" [...] when first released. LGBT historian Susan Stryker describes the relationships between Bannon's characters as mostly positive, satisfactory, and at times complex depictions of lesbian and gay relationships, which Bannon attributed to not <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hope that she could [...] "salvage (her) own life." [...] One retrospective of lesbian pulp fiction remarked on the reasons why Bannon's books in particular were popular is {{because they were so}} different from anything else being published at the time: [...] "Bannon was implicitly challenging the prevailing belief that homosexual life was brief, episodic, and more often than not resulted in death... Bannon insisted on the continuity of lesbian love, while everything in her culture was speaking of its quick and ugly demise." ...|$|E
500|$|Another combat timing {{mechanic}} {{featured in}} the game is the [...] "Charge Meter", which allows players to increase the power of spells or attacks by spending additional time preparing them. This meter is always used for spell casting, as well as when using the [...] "Charge Attack" [...] skill used by the [...] "Monk" [...] class. Although players can choose to act immediately, an ability will become more powerful the longer that the player charges the attack. However, the greater {{the amount of time}} one charges attacks, the longer the charging character must wait before the next turn. As a result of this, players can choose to charge up an ability so that the ability triggers shortly before an enemy acts, or can instead aim for the [...] "sweet spot", a special red area on the charging bar, indicating a charge that allows for less time until the next attack, as well as a smaller mana cost. [...] Overall, deciding on the correct amount of charge and <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> button at precisely that time can greatly influence the effectiveness of each character's attacks during combat.|$|E
