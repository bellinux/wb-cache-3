The darling wish of your heart, sir, {{is to have a}} slap-up coat turned out of the ateliers of Messrs. <b>Linsey,</b> <b>Woolsey</b> and Company. You said you'd give twenty guineas for one of our coats, you know you did! Lord Bolsterton's a fatter man than you, and look what a figure we turn HIM out. Can any firm in England dress Lord Bolsterton but us, so as to make his Lordship look decent? I defy 'em, sir! We could have given Daniel Lambert a figure!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Need we tell {{with what}} triumphant success the [...] "Brigand's Bride" [...] was received? All the Irish sub-editors {{the next morning}} took care to have such an account of it as made Miss Ligonier and Baroski die with envy. All the reporters who could spare time were in the boxes to support their friend's work. All the journeymen tailors of the {{establishment}} of <b>Linsey,</b> <b>Woolsey,</b> and Co. had pit tickets given to them, and applauded with all their might. All Mr. Walker's friends of the [...] "Regent Club" [...] lined the side-boxes with white kid gloves; and in a little box by themselves sat Mrs. Crump and Mr. Woolsey, a great deal too much agitated to applaud--so agitated, that Woolsey even forgot to fling down the bouquet he had brought for the Ravenswing.|$|E
60|$|The Woolsey {{compared}} in {{the above}} sentence both to a leg of mutton and a cherub, was not the eminent member of the firm of <b>Linsey,</b> <b>Woolsey,</b> and Co., but the little baby, who was christened Howard Woolsey Walker, with the full consent of the father; who said the tailor was a deuced good fellow, and felt really obliged to him for the sherry, for a frock-coat which he let him have in prison, and for his kindness to Morgiana. The tailor loved the little boy with all his soul; he attended his mother to her churching, and the child to the font; and, as a present to his little godson on his christening, he sent two yards of the finest white kerseymere in his shop, {{to make him a}} cloak. The Duke had had a pair of inexpressibles off that very piece.|$|E
6000|$|... "What was it? A man! A {{stranger}} {{that nobody}} seen before, and nobody suspicioned was there till they hearn him give {{that kind of}} snort, and they seen him standun' {{right in front of}} the mourners' bench under Elder Grove's pulpit. He was in his bare head, and he had a suit of long, glossy, jet-black hair hengun down back of his ears clean to his shoulders. He was kind of pale like, and sad-lookun', and he had a Roman nose some like yourn, and eyes like two coals, just black fire, kind of. He was putty thickset, round the shoulders, but he slimmed down towards his legs, and he stood about six feet high. But the thing of it," [...] Reverdy urged, seeing that Braile remained outwardly unmoved, [...] "was the way he was dressed. I s'pose the rest beun' all in brown jeans, and <b>linsey</b> <b>woolsey,</b> made us notice it more. He was dressed in the slickest kind of black broadcloth, with a long frock-coat, and a white cravat. He had on a ruffled shirt, and a tall beaver hat, the color of the fur, and a pair of these here high boots, with his breeches strapped down under 'em." ...|$|E

"Sir," [...] said Mr. Woolsey, {{for that}} worthy man had {{conducted}} Morgiana home--"sir," [...] said he, shaking his stick {{at the young}} page, [...] "if you give any more of your impudence, I'll beat every button off your jacket:" [...] and as there were some four hundred of these ornaments, the page was silent. It was a great mercy for Morgiana that the honest and faithful tailor had accompanied her. The good fellow had waited very patiently for her for {{an hour in the}} parlour or coffee-room of the lock-up house, knowing full well that she would want a protector on her way homewards; and his kindness will be more appreciated when it is stated that, during the time of his delay in the coffee-room, he had been subject to the entreaties, nay, to the insults, of Cornet Fipkin of the Blues, who was in prison at the suit of <b>Linsey,</b> <b>Woolsey</b> and Co., and who happened to be taking his breakfast in the apartment when his obdurate creditor entered it. The Cornet (a hero of eighteen, who stood at least five feet three in his boots, and owed fifteen thousand pounds) was so enraged at the obduracy of his creditor that he said he would have thrown him out of the window but for the bars which guarded it; and entertained serious thoughts of knocking the tailor's head off, but that the latter, putting his right leg forward and his fists in a proper attitude, told the young officer to [...] "come on;" [...] on which the Cornet cursed the tailor for a [...] "snob," [...] and went back to his breakfast.|$|E
60|$|The tiptop men of {{the society}} were two bachelors, and two as fashionable tradesmen as any in the town: Mr. Woolsey, from Stultz's, of the famous house of <b>Linsey,</b> <b>Woolsey</b> and Co. of Conduit Street, Tailors; and Mr. Eglantine, the celebrated perruquier and perfumer of Bond Street, whose soaps, razors, and patent {{ventilating}} scalps are know throughout Europe. Linsey, the senior partner of the tailors' firm had his handsome mansion in Regent's Park, drove his buggy, and did little more than lend his name to the house. Woolsey lived in it, was the working man of the firm, and {{it was said that}} his cut was as magnificent as that of any man in the profession. Woolsey and Eglantine were rivals in many ways--rivals in fashion, rivals in wit, and, above all, rivals for the hand of an amiable young lady whom we have already mentioned, the dark-eyed songstress Morgiana Crump. They were both desperately in love with her, that was the truth; and each, {{in the absence of the}} other, abused his rival heartily. Of the hairdresser Woolsey said, that as for Eglantine being his real name, it was all his (Mr. Woolsey's) eye; that he was in the hands of the Jews, and his stock and grand shop eaten up by usury. And with regard to Woolsey, Eglantine remarked, that his pretence of being descended from the Cardinal was all nonsense; that he was a partner, certainly, in the firm, but had only a sixteenth share; and that the firm could never get their moneys in, and had an immense number of bad debts in their books. As is usual, there was a great deal of truth and a great deal of malice in these tales; however, the gentlemen were, take them all in all, in a very fashionable way of business, and had their claims to Miss Morgiana's hand backed by the parents. Mr. Crump was a partisan of the tailor; while Mrs. C. was a strong advocate for the claims of the enticing perfumer.|$|E

5000|$|The Parramatta Female Factory was multi-purpose. It was a {{place of}} assignment, a hospital, a {{marriage}} bureau, a factory, an asylum and a prison for those who committed a crime in the Colony. The reason it is called a factory is because it manufactured cloth - linen, wool and <b>linsey</b> <b>woolsey.</b> It was also the site of the colony's first manufactured export producing 60,000 yd of woven cloth in 1822.The women also did spinning, knitting, straw plaiting, washing, cleaning duties and if in third class, rock breaking and oakum picking.|$|E
