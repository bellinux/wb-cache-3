40|$|Conventional stone columns are {{commonly}} used {{as a form of}} ground improvement in soft soils, for the support of lightly and moderately loaded structures such as embankments. However, their use in very soft and extremely soft soils is limited by the low stiffness and minimal confinement provided by the soft soil. To extend their use to such soft soils, a method of geotextile encasement has recently been developed, providing additional circumferential confinement. The technique has been used on numerous projects throughout Europe and more recently in South America. Although geotextile encasement provides a practical form of ground improvement, its use can be limited in some cases by excessive settlements, resulting from the adopted materials and installation practices. To investigate the potential benefits of using a stiffer encasement than geotextile (and to broaden the appeal of geosynthetics in ground improvement), the use of geogrid encasement is investigated. The research presented in this thesis was used to investigate practical aspects of geogrid encasement including developing effective and efficient methods of encasement construction and assessment of encased column performance. The research was undertaken using a four-stage approach comprising small-scale laboratory testing, numerical simulation of small-scale tests, medium-scale laboratory testing and scaled-up numerical modelling of full-scale columns. Small-scale testing was undertaken on isolated and simulated group columns to investigate whether the full-length of the column needed to be encased, the impact of geogrid stiffness and methods of constructing the encasement. Numerical modelling was undertaken using the PLAXIS software package and was initially used to reproduce the small-scale test results. Following this, the models were scaled up to investigate the impact of different parameters on full-scale encased column behaviour. Medium-scale testing of unconfined columns was used to investigate methods of encasement construction including the suitability of different geogrids and stone column aggregates. The research indicates that geogrid encasement can be constructed at relatively low cost and most effectively by constructing sleeves with a full circumference of overlap, fixed in position using cable ties. The technique relies on interlock between the overlapped section of geogrid and protruding aggregate to provide a level of fixity similar to welding. Biaxial geogrids provide the stiffest and most reliable encasement material, particularly when used with typical stone column aggregates. Based on the results of modelling and testing, geogrid encased columns are expected to reduce untreated settlements by between 50 % and 95 %, depending on properties such as geogrid stiffness, column density, soil stiffness and encased length. By progressively increasing the replacement ratio, geogrid stiffness and the encased <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>column,</b> the stiffness of the treated soil mass may be steadily increased. Although the research indicates that geogrid encasement is likely to provide a stiffer alternative to geotextile, site testing is recommended to confirm some aspects of performance, including installation techniques...|$|E

40|$|The {{approach}} proposed {{recently as}} <b>a</b> spectroscopic tecnique <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boron density determination in microwave plasma has been expanded for B, Al, Ga, Si atoms and generalized. The method {{is based on}} measurements of relative intensities of pairs of spectral lines belonging to resonance multiplets having common upper level.

Thus {{in the case of}} the B, Al, Ga doublets the temperature T should be known.

50|$|The Van Deemter {{equation}} in chromatography {{relates the}} variance per unit <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separation <b>column</b> to the linear mobile phase velocity by considering physical, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separation. These properties include pathways within the column, diffusion (axial and longitudinal), and mass transfer kinetics between stationary and mobile phases. In liquid chromatography, the mobile phase velocity {{is taken as}} the exit velocity, that is, {{the ratio of the}} flow rate in ml/second to the cross-sectional area of the ‘column-exit flow path.’ For <b>a</b> packed <b>column,</b> the cross-sectional area of the column exit flow path is usually taken as 0.6 times the cross-sectional area of the column. Alternatively, the linear velocity can be taken as the ratio <b>of</b> the column <b>length</b> to the dead time. If the mobile phase is a gas, then the pressure correction must be applied. The variance per unit <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the column is taken as the ratio <b>of</b> the column <b>length</b> to the column efficiency in theoretical plates.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using microbiological processes {{to improve the}} mechanical properties of soil by undisturbed in situ application has gained attention over recent years. This paper describes <b>a</b> new variation <b>of</b> in situ soil reinforcement technology based on microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP), which involves both the hydrolysis of urea by soil bacteria enzyme and calcium carbonate precipitation {{in the presence of}} dissolved calcium ions. In contrast to other previously published approaches, the current work uses surface percolation for in situ placement of bacteria and cementation solution. Bacteria could be immobilised over the full <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1 m <b>column</b> by surface percolation. To accomplish this it was necessary to percolate alternate solutions containing either bacteria or fixation solution containing calcium ions. The biologically triggered cementation resulted in homogeneous cementation over the entire <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the 1 -m sand column. The efficiency of calcite crystals to form strength was found {{to be related to the}} pore water content of the continuously drained column with less water content enabling more efficient strength formation. Scanning electron microscopy supported the idea that lower water contents lead to selective positioning of crystals at the bridging points between sand grains. These findings imply that the cost of MICP technology can be reduced by optimising the conditions for effective crystals precipitation. This is expected to make this technology more readily acceptable for large scale applications...|$|R
