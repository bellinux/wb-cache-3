5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal <b>Lowveld</b> areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
25|$|The erosional {{retreat of}} the {{escarpment}} {{from the coast}} to its present position, means that the rocks of the coastal plain are, with very few and small exceptions, older than those that cap {{the top of the}} escarpment. Thus the rocks of the Mpumalanga <b>Lowveld</b> below the Mpumalanga portion of the Great Escarpment are more than 3000million years old. The rocks of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands belong, in the main, to the Beaufort and Ecca Groups (of the Karoo Supergroup), aged 220–310million years, and are therefore considerably older than the Drakensberg lavas (aged 180million years) which cap the escarpment on the border between KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho.|$|E
25|$|The colonial {{government}} in Southern Rhodesia delineated {{the country into}} five distinct farming regions which corresponded roughly to rainfall patterns. Region I comprised an area in the eastern highlands with markedly higher rainfall best suited to the cultivation of diversified cash crops such as coffee and tea. Region II was highveld, also in the east, where the land could be used intensively for grain cultivation such as maize, tobacco, and wheat. Region III and Region IV endured periodic drought and were regarded as suitable for livestock, in addition to crops which required little rainfall. Region V was <b>lowveld</b> and unsuitable for crop cultivation due to its dry nature, however, limited livestock farming was still viable. Land ownership in these regions was determined by race {{under the terms of}} the Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act, passed in 1930, which reserved Regions I, II, and III for white settlement. Region V and a segment of Region II which possessed greater rainfall variability were organised into the Tribal Trust Lands (TTLs), reserved solely for black African ownership and use. This created two new problems: firstly, in the areas reserved for whites, the ratio of land to population was so high that many farms could not be exploited to their fullest potential, and some prime white-owned farmland was lying idle. Secondly, the legislation resulted in enforced overuse of the land in the TTLs due to overpopulation there.|$|E
2500|$|The Air Force {{maintains}} six Umlindi (Zulu: [...] "Watchman") AR3D long-range {{early warning}} radar systems (British AR3D radar systems extensively upgraded by the South African company, Tellumat) which are operated by 140 Squadron SAAF {{as part of the}} South African Air Force Mobile Deployment Wing. There are two static radar stations located in Lephalale (Ellisras) and Mariepskop, near Air Force Base Hoedspruit. The other systems are mobile and can be deployed to any part of the country to support operations with the use of 20-ton 8x8 MAN trucks. Each of these systems has a range of 500km but can only track aircraft flying above 700 metres. The static radars are usually linked to two Air Force sector control centres (SCC), the <b>Lowveld</b> Airspace Control Sector and the Bushveld Airspace Control Sector, while the mobile radar have their own mobile sector control centres (MSCC).|$|E
50|$|<b>Lowveld</b> Media {{is a major}} printer and {{publisher}} of newsprint materials in the region. Major newspapers include the Lowvelder, Mpumalanga News and Nelspruit Post. Magazines like <b>Lowveld</b> Living {{have proven to be}} very popular.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lowveld</b> {{is known}} for its high {{concentration}} of big game, including the larger animals, like African elephants, rhino, African buffalo, the big cats (lions, leopards, and cheetahs), the Plains zebra, and a wide variety of antelope, while the slow-flowing streams and wetlands of the <b>Lowveld</b> are a haven for the hippos and crocodiles. The bird life is also astoundingly abundant and varied. This wildlife is particularly concentrated in the Kruger National Park located in the eastern <b>Lowveld</b> areas of Mpumalanga and Limpopo Provinces, along almost the entire border with Mozambique. But many private game farms and game reserves can also be found in elsewhere in the <b>Lowveld.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The coastal belt, {{below the}} Great Escarpment, moving {{clockwise}} from the northeast, {{consists of the}} Limpopo <b>Lowveld,</b> which merges into the Mpumalanga <b>Lowveld,</b> below the Mpumalanga Drakensberg (the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment). This is hotter, drier and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld above the escarpment. The Kruger National Park, located in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa, occupies {{a large portion of}} the <b>Lowveld</b> covering 19,633 square kilometres (7,580 sq mi.) [...] South of the <b>Lowveld</b> the annual rainfall increases as one enters KwaZulu-Natal Province, which, especially near the coast, is subtropically hot and humid. The KwaZulu-NatalLesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment, or Drakensberg, which reaches an altitude of over abbr=on 3000 m. [...] The climate at the foot of this part of the Drakensberg is temperate.|$|E
5000|$|The South African {{portion of}} the coastal strip between the Limpopo and Mpumalanga Drakensberg and the ocean, {{together}} with the Limpopo River valley, is called the <b>Lowveld.</b> [...] These lowlands, below about abbr=on 500 m altitude, form South Africa's northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe, where a 180&#8209;million-year-old failed rift valley cuts into Southern Africa's central plateau and locally obliterates the Great Escarpment. The Limpopo and Save rivers run from the central African highlands via the <b>Lowveld</b> into the Indian Ocean to the east. The Limpopo <b>Lowveld</b> extends southwards, east of the Drakensberg escarpment through Mpumalanga Province and ultimately into eastern Swaziland. This southern limb of the <b>Lowveld</b> is bounded by South Africa's border with Mozambique to the east, and the north-eastern part of the Drakensberg to the west. This region is generally hotter and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lowveld</b> is subtropical, {{due to its}} {{latitude}} and proximity to the warm Indian Ocean. The Highveld is comparatively much cooler, due to its altitude of 2300 m to 1700 m above sea level. The Drakensberg Escarpment receives the most precipitation, with all other areas being moderately well-watered by mostly summer thunderstorms. The Highveld often experiences severe frost, while the <b>Lowveld</b> is mostly frost-free. Winter rainfall is rare, except for some drizzle on the escarpment. The differences in climate are demonstrated below by the capital, Nelspruit, {{which is in the}} <b>Lowveld,</b> an hour from Belfast on the Highveld.|$|E

50|$|Small mammal {{evidence}} suggests that the vegetation of Border cave ranged from miombo savanna woodland or high rainfall miombo woodland to <b>Lowveld,</b> arid <b>Lowveld,</b> or mopane at various times during the Upper Pleistocene. Four general phases emerged. In the earliest period, the highest-rainfall miombo occurred. Annual rainfall was at least 25% higher than today, but less than 10% of rainfall occurred during the winter. There were high and relatively high mean annual temperatures, which are comparable to the current conditions found further north. Next, Zululand Thornveld, which occurs today has increased winter rainfall by between 20% to 30%. A mean daily range that is greater than the annual range is considered to be tropical climates. Additionally, frost is sporadic in the <b>Lowveld,</b> occurring every few years in lower altitude areas that have cold air drainage and strong inversions.|$|E
