5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, <b>lateralization</b> of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
25|$|Phenomena such as {{emotional}} <b>lateralization</b> {{may help}} describe how emotions arise, persist, and alter our behavior. Understanding emotional <b>lateralization</b> will help scientists understand emotion in general. Emotional <b>lateralization</b> may {{also play a}} role in psychological disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Future treatment of psychological disorders may have more targeted neurological treatments rather than ingested drugs.|$|E
25|$|Emotional <b>lateralization</b> is the {{asymmetrical}} {{representation of}} emotional control and processing in the brain. There is {{evidence for the}} <b>lateralization</b> of other brain functions as well.|$|E
25|$|Most {{language}} {{production and}} processing {{occur in the}} left hemisphere {{while the majority of}} the emotional processing and production of emotion in speech occurs in the right hemisphere. Schizophrenic patients usually have difficulty processing prosody. These patients also show a remarkable increase in <b>lateralization</b> towards the right hemisphere of both emotionally and non-emotional prosody rich speech. Also, a decrease in right-handedness led to an increase in the right hemisphere <b>lateralization.</b> This right hemisphere <b>lateralization</b> extends beyond prosody to many of aspects of language and speech processing in schizophrenic patients.|$|E
25|$|Damage {{to brain}} hemispheres alters {{immunity}} (hemispheric <b>lateralization</b> effects).|$|E
25|$|Emotion is {{processed}} {{in many different}} areas of the brain, and a specific emotion may be processed in multiple areas. Regions involved in emotional <b>lateralization</b> appear to follow the general conventions that describe the roles/functions of certain brain regions. Below are a few regions and structure involved in emotional processing that show functional <b>lateralization.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{scientific}} {{studies have found}} <b>lateralization</b> of emotions. FMRI and lesion studies have shown asymmetrical activation of brain regions while thinking of emotions, responding to extreme emotional stimuli, and viewing emotional situations. Processing and production of facial expressions also appear to be asymmetric in nature. Many theories of <b>lateralization</b> have been proposed {{and some of those}} specific to emotions. Please keep in mind that most of the information in this article is theoretical and scientists are still trying to understand emotion and emotional <b>lateralization.</b> Also, some of the evidence is contradictory. Many brain regions are interconnected and the input and output of any given region may come from and go to many different regions.|$|E
25|$|One of Broca's {{major areas}} of {{expertise}} was the comparative anatomy of the brain. His research on the localization of speech led to entirely new research into the <b>lateralization</b> of brain function.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} Genie's brain aided {{scientists}} in refining several existing hypotheses regarding brain <b>lateralization,</b> especially {{its effect on}} language development. In particular, the disparity between Genie's linguistic abilities and her competence in other aspects of human development strongly suggested there was a separation of cognition and language acquisition, a new concept at the time. The unevenness of her ability to learn right-hemisphere versus left-hemisphere tasks gave the scientists valuable information about {{the manner in which}} certain brain functions develop, as well as the way <b>lateralization</b> affects a person's ability to improve upon them. Genie's difficulty with certain tasks which had been described as predominantly controlled in the right hemisphere also gave neuroscientists more insight into the processes controlling these functions.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Curtiss {{argued that}} Genie proved only {{linguistic}} stimulation could cause the <b>lateralization</b> of language functions, {{pointing out that}} Genie's language center had not developed in her left hemisphere despite experiencing enough environmental stimulation to commence <b>lateralization</b> of other brain functions. Without this stimulation, a person would be rendered incapable of processing language from the left hemisphere {{of the brain and}} would be forced to only use the right hemisphere. The contrast between Genie's vocabulary and grammar acquisition also supported the existing hypothesis that these two processes underwent separate development during language acquisition. Genie's inability to master language despite clear progress in her cognitive development in other areas also suggested that language acquisition and cognition were separate, a new concept at the time.|$|E
25|$|Particularly, {{cardiovascular}} function {{appears to be}} lateralized and tied to emotional stress. Intense emotional stimuli that cause stress can lead to alterations in {{cardiovascular function}}. The right insular cortex probably plays the most significant role in these phenomena. Similar <b>lateralization</b> is probably involved in cardiovascular malfunction in patients with head injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, meningitis and encephalitis, migraine, cluster headache and neurosurgical procedures.|$|E
25|$|Depression {{or having}} {{previously}} been depressed probably {{is due to}} altered brain structure or alters brain structure. Patients who have been depressed or are depressed show more activation to negative stimuli in emotion. When negative stimuli were presented to patients' right hemispheres, the patients were significantly more accurate and quicker {{to respond to the}} stimuli. The data in this study shows that psychological disorders are correlated with increased <b>lateralization.</b>|$|E
25|$|A study {{analyzing}} the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men {{by using the}} Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam determined that males with a pronounced degree of paraphilic interest (including pedophilia) had {{a greater number of}} older brothers, a high 2D:4D digit ratio (which would indicate low prenatal androgen exposure), and an elevated probability of being left-handed, suggesting that disturbed hemispheric brain <b>lateralization</b> {{may play a role in}} deviant attractions.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural studies {{demonstrate}} that rhythm and pitch can be perceived separately, {{but that they}} also interact in creating a musical perception. Studies of auditory rhythm discrimination and reproduction in patients with brain injury have linked these functions to the auditory regions of the temporal lobe, but have shown no consistent localization or <b>lateralization.</b> Neuropsychological and neuroimaging {{studies have shown that}} the motor regions of the brain contribute to both perception and production of rhythms.|$|E
25|$|Lesions rarely are {{localized}} and {{can affect}} {{large areas of}} the brain. Processing in the brain is generally not localized and requires many areas of the brain to process. Furthermore, lesioning may interfere with pathways that span the lesion site. Thus, lesions are not always a good way to determine what specific brain areas do. Therefore, a degree of skepticism should be kept in mind when viewing <b>lateralization</b> data from lesion studies.|$|E
25|$|A large {{percent of}} the human studies are of {{anomalies}} due to accidents, tumors, or attempts to cure disease (e.g. seizures) using lesioning. Since very few such cases exist the sample size of human studies of emotional <b>lateralization</b> are generally very limited and may be as small as single person. While these studies may provide a good insight into certain brain regions and their functions their conclusions are not definite. Animal studies may help in understanding this problem but emotions in humans are generally considered more complicated than in most animals.|$|E
25|$|It is {{currently}} believed that {{in regards to}} brain <b>lateralization</b> males are left-lateralized, while females are bilateralized. Studies on patients with unilateral lesions have provided evidence that females are in fact more bilateralized with their verbal abilities. It seems that when a female has experienced a lesion to the left hemisphere, she is better able to compensate for this damage than a male can. If a male has a lesion in the left hemisphere, his verbal abilities are greatly impaired in comparison to a control male {{of the same age}} without that damage. However, these results may also be task-dependent as well as time-dependent.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the fall}} of 1971, under the {{direction}} of Curtiss, Victoria Fromkin, and Stephen Krashen—who was then also one of Fromkin's graduate students—linguists continued to administer regular dichotic listening tests to Genie until 1973. Their results consistently corroborated the initial findings of Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima. Researchers therefore concluded that Genie was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain, and definitively ruled out the possibility that Genie's language <b>lateralization</b> was only reversed. Due to the lack of physiological problems with Genie's left hemisphere, they believed abnormal neurological activity in her left hemisphere—which they speculated came from her atrophied language center—blocked all language reception in her right ear but did not obstruct non-language sounds.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, Roger Sperry {{developed}} split-brain preparations in non-human primates {{that emphasized}} the importance of information transfer that occurred in these neocortical connections. For example, learning on simple tasks, if restricted in sensory input and motor output to one hemisphere of a split-brain animal, would not transfer to the other hemisphere. The right brain has no idea what the left brain is up to, if these specific connections are cut. Those experiments were followed by tests on human beings with epilepsy who had undergone split-brain surgery, which established that the neocortical connections between hemispheres are the principal route for cognition to transfer {{from one side of the}} brain to another. These experiments also formed the modern basis for <b>lateralization</b> of function in the human brain.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{performance}} on these tests led the scientists {{to believe that}} her brain had lateralized, and that her right hemisphere had undergone specialization. Because Genie's performance was so high on such {{a wide variety of}} tasks predominantly utilizing the right hemisphere of her brain, they concluded her exceptional abilities extended to typical right-hemisphere functions in general and were not specific to any individual task. They attributed her extreme right hemisphere dominance to the fact that what very little cognitive stimulation she did receive was almost entirely visual and tactile. While even this had been extremely minimal it had been enough to commence <b>lateralization</b> in her right hemisphere, and the severe imbalance in stimulation caused her right hemisphere to become extraordinarily developed.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, viewing tools potentiates motor {{activity}} {{related to the}} specific tool-use. This phenomenon is different from other classes of objects, and indicates that tools are not viewed just based off what they are, but also what they actually do. In just viewing tools, activation of left lateralized areas {{are very similar to}} the use/pantomiming areas as noted above. These areas include the ventral premotor cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and some parietal areas. The main difference is that tools being used elicit greater activation in ventral brain regions, and decreased activation in primary motor areas. Additionally, there were very similar areas of activation in naming tools and viewing tools. There were other areas of activation in the left hemisphere, possibly reflecting the <b>lateralization</b> of language.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the {{scientists}} finished working with Genie, she had not fully mastered English grammar and her rate of acquisition had significantly slowed down. Linguists ultimately concluded that because Genie had not learned a first language before the critical period had ended, {{she was unable to}} fully acquire a language. Furthermore, despite the clear improvements in her conversational competence it remained very low, and her vocalizations remained highly atypical. While she had expanded her use of language to serve a wider range of functions, she had an unusually difficult time utilizing it during social interactions. Tests on Genie's brain found she was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain despite being right-handed, giving rise to many new hypotheses and refining existing hypotheses on cerebral <b>lateralization</b> and its effect on linguistic development.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results, Bellugi and Klima {{believed}} that Genie had been developing {{as a typical}} right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her. They attributed the imbalance between Genie's hemispheres {{to the fact that}} Genie's sensory input as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile, stimulating functions which are predominantly controlled in the right hemisphere of a right-handed person, and although this input had been extremely minimal it was sufficient to cause their <b>lateralization</b> to the right hemisphere. They therefore believed that because Genie had no linguistic input during her childhood, it underwent no specialization whatsoever and as a result her language functions never lateralized to it. Since Genie accurately distinguished speech sounds with her right hemisphere, they thought her language functions had lateralized there instead.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results the {{concluded}} that Genie's brain had completed <b>lateralization</b> and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center {{when she was}} a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able to learn some basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{psychological}} understanding {{grew from}} the philosophical works of Laozi and Confucius, and later from the doctrines of Buddhism. This {{body of knowledge}} involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, {{with an emphasis on}} purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on yin–yang balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the Qing Dynasty with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671), Liu Zhi (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and insomnia, and advanced a theory of hemispheric <b>lateralization</b> in brain function.|$|E
25|$|This model {{provides}} a neuroanatomical basis for emotional control and processing. The peripheral {{autonomic nervous system}} is not symmetrical. Afferent nerves in the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems of the autonomic nervous system differently innervate various organs that maintain homeostasis such as {{the heart and the}} face. The asymmetrical representation of the autonomic peripheral nervous system leads to the asymmetrical representation in the brain. The left hemisphere is activated predominantly by homeostatic afferents associated with parasympathetic functions and the right hemisphere is activated predominantly by homeostatic afferents associated with sympathetic functions. The <b>lateralization</b> is extremely apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex (AI) associated with higher emotions such as romantic love and motivation correlated with homeostatic functions. The left AI and ACC are more active during feelings of romantic love and maternal attachment. The AI and ACC were activated on both the right and left sides while watching pain being inflicted on a loved one while only the right AI and ACC that is elicited during subjective feelings of pain; this supports the association of right AI in aroused (‘sympathetic’) feelings and left AI in affiliative (‘parasympathetic’) feelings.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with hemispheric <b>lateralization,</b> {{there is}} {{evidence}} to suggest that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different components of musical memory. By studying the learning curves of patients who have had damage to either their left or right medial temporal lobes, Wilson & Saling (2008) found hemispheric differences in the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobes in melodic memory. Ayotte, Peretz, Rousseau, Bard & Bojanowski (2000) found that those patients who had their left middle cerebral artery cut in response to an aneurysm suffered greater impairments when performing tasks of musical long term memory, than those patients who had their right middle cerebral artery cut. Thus, they concluded that the left hemisphere is mainly important for musical representation in long term memory, whereas the right is needed primarily to mediate access to this memory. Sampson and Zatorre (1991) studied patients with severe epilepsy who underwent surgery for relief as well as control subjects. They found deficits in memory recognition for text regardless of whether it was sung or spoken after a left, but not right temporal lobectomy. However, melody recognition when a tune was sung with new words (as compared to encoding) was impaired after either right or left temporal lobectomy. Finally, after a right but not left temporal lobectomy, impairments of melody recognition occurred in the absence of lyrics. This suggests dual memory codes for musical memory, with the verbal code utilizing the left temporal lobe structures and the melodic relying on the encoding involved.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{unlikely}} that the brain evolved an asymmetrical control of emotional behavior. Rather, it seems more likely that although there may be some asymmetry in the neural control of emotion, the observed asymmetries are largely a product of the asymmetrical control of other functions such as the control of movement, language, or the processing of complex sensory information," [...] <b>Lateralization</b> may have been evolutionarily adaptive. <b>Lateralization</b> may allow for a greater variety of emotions. The left temporal cortex is involved in language processing while the right temporal cortex is involved in processing faces. This <b>lateralization</b> is also apparent when processing emotions.|$|E
2500|$|Goldberg's work on {{frontal lobe}} {{functions}} includes {{the discovery of}} the [...] "reticulo-frontal disconnection" [...] syndrome, functional <b>lateralization</b> and gender differences in the prefrontal cortex. His work on memory includes the description of relatively pure retrograde amnesia without anterograde amnesia, which in turn has led to the elucidation of the role of brain stem arousal mechanisms in memory.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{all human}} based {{scientific}} experiments there are limitations to what researchers can do. Attempting to study emotions is especially hard since emotions {{are complex and}} can lead to subjective response. Since the majority of experiments in emotional <b>lateralization</b> have been on fear this leaves the question of whether other emotions are also lateralized. [...] Below are two major issues associated with many of the experiments studying emotion that require further explanation.|$|E
2500|$|Auditory {{processing}} disorder can be developmental or acquired. It {{may result}} from ear infections, head injuries or neurodevelopmental delays that affect processing of auditory information. This can include problems with: [...] "...sound localization and <b>lateralization</b> (see also binaural fusion); auditory discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of audition, including temporal integration, temporal discrimination (e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and temporal masking; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals (including dichotic listening); and auditory performance with degraded acoustic signals".|$|E
2500|$|The {{fusiform}} {{face area}} (FFA) {{is associated with}} facial recognition. [...] It is generally located on the fusiform gyrus in the temporal lobe, but its precise location varies between individuals. [...] The FFA {{has been found to}} show a degree of <b>lateralization.</b> [...] Typically, it is larger in the right hemisphere of the brain. It is widely accepted that the FFA is involved in the encoding and retrieval of memory for faces and other familiar categorical processing.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers such as Boroditsky, Lucy and Levinson {{believe that}} {{language}} influences thought in more limited ways than the broadest early claims. Researchers examine {{the interface between}} thought (or cognition), language and culture and describe the relevant influences. They use experimental data to back up their conclusions. Kay ultimately concluded that [...] " [...] Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left". His findings show that accounting for brain <b>lateralization</b> offers another perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Biological psychology, {{also known}} as {{physiological}} psychology, or neuropsychology {{is the study of}} the biological substrates of behavior and mental processes. Key research topics in this field include comparative psychology, which studies humans in relation to other animals, and perception which involves the physical mechanics of sensation as well as neural and mental processing. For centuries, a leading question in biological psychology has been whether and how mental functions might be localized in the brain. From Phineas Gage to H. M. and Clive Wearing, [...] have inspired new discoveries in this area. Modern neuropsychology could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric <b>lateralization</b> of brain function. Soon after, Carl Wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these difficulties, fMRI {{has been}} used {{clinically}} to map functional areas, check left-right hemispherical asymmetry in language and memory regions, check the neural correlates of a seizure, study how the brain recovers partially from a stroke, test how well a drug or behavioral therapy works, detect the onset of Alzheimer's, and note the presence of disorders like depression. Mapping of functional areas and understanding <b>lateralization</b> of language and memory help surgeons avoid removing critical brain regions {{when they have to}} operate and remove brain tissue. [...] This is of particular importance in removing tumors and in patients who have intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Lesioning tumors requires pre-surgical planning to ensure no functionally useful tissue is removed needlessly. Recovered depressed patients have shown altered fMRI activity in the cerebellum, and this may indicate a tendency to relapse. Pharmacological fMRI, assaying brain activity after drugs are administered, can be used to check how much a drug penetrates the blood–brain barrier and dose vs effect information of the medication.|$|E
2500|$|There are now {{significant}} {{reports of}} ictal EEGs in 20 cases, which objectively document the seizures of Panayiotopoulos syndrome and their variable localisation at onset. [...] All these recorded seizures occurred while {{the children were}} asleep. The onset of the electrical ictal discharge was mainly occipital (7 cases) or frontal (7 cases)and consisted of rhythmic monomorphic decelerating theta or delta activity with small spikes. The ﬁrst clinical manifestation which appeared long (1–10 minutes) after the electrical onset, usually consisted of opening of the eyes as if the children were waking from sleep. At this stage, usually the children responded, often correctly, to simple questions. On many occasions, tachycardia was the first objective sign when ||ECG|| was recorded. Vomiting was a common ictal symptom occurring at any stage of the seizures but not as the ﬁrst clinical manifestation. Seizures associated with ictal vomiting {{did not have any}} particular localization or <b>lateralization.</b> Vomiting occurred mainly when the ictal discharges were more diffuse than localized. Sometimes only retching without vomiting occurred, and on a few occasions, vomiting did not occur. Other autonomic manifestations included mydriasis, pallor, cyanosis, tachypnea, hypersalivation, and perspiration at various stages of the ictus. Of non-autonomic manifestations, deviation of eyes to the right or left occurred before or after vomiting without any apparent EEG localisation; it was present in seizures starting from the occipital or frontal regions.|$|E
