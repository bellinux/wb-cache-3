50|$|The {{optimization}} problem for each time {{step is to}} minimize the electricity supply cost using the existing power plant fleet for <b>all</b> <b>regions.</b> After this regional dispatch, the exchange between the regions is carried out and is restricted by the grid capacity. This latter problem is solved with a heuristic procedure rather than calculated deterministically. The input is the merit order, the marginal power plant, the excess energy (renewable energy that could be curtailed), and the excess demand (the demand that cannot be supplied) for each region. The exchange algorithm seeks the least cost for <b>all</b> <b>regions,</b> thus the target function is to minimize the total costs of <b>all</b> <b>regions,</b> given the existing grid infrastructure, storage, and generating capacities. The total cost {{is defined as the}} residual load multiplied by the price in each <b>region,</b> summed over <b>all</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|R
