25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; {{the number of axles}} required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels is derived from the adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the Bissel bogie in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{frequent}} occurrence of earthquakes sudden failure of structures leads to maximum loss of lives and property. Multistoryed buildings are affected severely {{since they are}} more susceptible to damage during earthquakes. Due to the large <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements,</b> both structural and non structural distress and damages are observed in reinforced concrete frames. The current codal provisions emphasis lateral forces rather than <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements.</b> The maximum <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements</b> are checked {{at the end of the}} design process to satisfy serviceability requirements. In recent times a growing interest in performance based design procedures in which <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements</b> are emphasized than lateral forces. From the lessons learnt due to past earthquakes is it observed that large numbers of multistoryed buildings are severely affected. This leads to increased awareness in the analysis of multistoreyed buildings. In this study seismic analysis of five stoyred reinforced cement concrete frames is carried with and without the horizontal bracing element at substructure level. The analysis is carried out using standard software package. The results are compared to study the earthquake resistant behaviour of the multistoryed building frame systems with and without horizontal brace elements...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the design, validation, and {{application}} of a new flexible fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing beam are presented for effectively measuring dynamic <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements</b> inside soil mass in a shaking table test. The special flexible FBG sensing beam has been fabricated by employing a series of FBG sensors along with design of temperature compensation. Based on this design, equations of converting strains to <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements</b> are derived by using both differential and integral methods. Subsequently, {{the effectiveness of the}} FBG sensing beam has been verified in a shaking table test with non-contact laser displacement sensors (LDSs). The dynamic <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements</b> at different depths of the soil mass in the shaking table box throughout time history are calculated by differential and integral methods and compared with the results of LDSs. The comparison validates the measurement accuracy of the FBG sensing beam. Additionally, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis result demonstrates that frequency measured by the sensing beam fits well with the results of traditional accelerometers and LDSs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the flexible FBG sensing beam is compatible with the stiffness of the soil and is capable of measuring dynamic <b>lateral</b> <b>displacements</b> with good accuracy in a shaking table test.

Schneider reported the heavy and middle guns ready for combat, and gave the order to open fire. The first salvo was fired by Rodney at 08:47 followed by King George V at 08:48. Schneider fired a partial salvo at Rodney since the Bismarck rear turrets could not fire at the appropriate angle. Schneider's aim was good, and he reported the first three salvos as short, on target and over. Schneider continued firing at Rodney. King George V and a little later Rodney turned to pass Bismarcks port side, a maneuver which Bismarck couldn't counter due to the damaged rudders. Bismarck started oscillating around her center axis which threw Schneider's aim off and necessitated continuous <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement</b> corrections of the guns.

6000|$|... "Dateram" [...] is, as {{the late}} Dr. Barth, {{informed}} me, the Bornu name for a most excellent African contrivance, used {{in some parts of}} the Sahara desert, by means of which tent-ropes may be secured, or horses picketed in sand of the driest description, as in that of a sand dune, whence a tent-peg would be drawn out by a strain so slight as to be almost imperceptible. I have made many experiments upon it, and find its efficiency to be truly wonderful. The plan is to tie to the end of the tent-rope, a small object of any description, by its middle, as a short stick, a stone, a bundle of twigs, or a bag of sand; and to bury it from 1 to 2 feet in the loose sand. It will be found, if it has been buried 1 foot deep, that a strain equal to about 50 lbs. weight, is necessary to draw it up; if 1 1/2 feet deep, that a much more considerable strain is necessary; and that, if 2 feet deep, it is quite impossible for a single man to pull it up. In the following theoretical case, the resistance would be as the cube of the depth; but in sand or shingle, the increase is less rapid. It varies under different circumstances; but it is no exaggeration to estimate its increase as seldom less than as the square of the depth. The theoretical case of which I spoke, is this:--Let x be part of a layer of shingle of wide extent: the shingle is supposed to consist of smooth hard spherical balls, all of the same size. Let s be a dáterám buried in x; and T the string to which it is tied. Now, on considering fig. 2, where a series of balls are drawn on a larger scale and on a plane surface, it is clear that the ball A cannot move in any degree to the right or the left without disturbing the entire layer of balls on the same plane as itself: its only possible movement is vertically upwards. In this case, it disturbs B1 and B2. These, for the same reason as A, can only move vertically upwards, and, in doing so, they must disturb the three balls above them, and so on. Consequently, the uplifting of a single ball in fig. 2, necessitates the uplifting of the triangle of balls of which it forms the apex; and it obviously follows from the same principle, that the uplifting of S, in the depth of X, in fig. 1, necessitates the uplifting of a cone of balls whose apex is at S. But the weight of a cone is as the cube of its height and, therefore, the resistance to the uplifting of the dáterám, is as the cube of the depth at which it has been buried. In practice, the grains of sand are capable of a small but variable amount of <b>lateral</b> <b>displacement,</b> which gives relief to the movement of sand caused by the dateram, for we may observe the surface of the ground to work very irregularly, although extensively, when the dáterám begins to stir. On the other hand, the friction of the grains of sand tends to increase the difficulty of movement. The arrangement shown in the diagram, of a spring weighing-machine tied to the end of a lever, is that which I have used in testing the strain the dateram will resist, under different circumstances. The size of the dateram is not of much importance, it would be of still less importance in the theoretical case. Anything that is more than 4 inches long seems to answer. The plan succeeds in a dry soil of any description, whether it be shingly beach or sand.|$|E
