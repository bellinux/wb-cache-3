40|$|Abstract Background To prevent {{endothelium}} {{and nerve}} lesions, tracheal tube and <b>laryngeal</b> mask <b>cuff</b> pressure {{is to be}} maintained at a low level and yet be high enough to secure air sealing. Method In a prospective quality-control study, 201 patients undergoing surgery during anaesthesia (without the use of nitrous oxide) were included for determination of the cuff pressure of the tracheal tubes and laryngeal masks. Results In the 119 patients provided with a tracheal tube, the median cuff pressure was 30 (range 8 - 100) cm H 2 O and the pressure exceeded 30 cm H 2 O (upper recommended level) for 54 patients. In the 82 patients provided with a <b>laryngeal</b> mask, the <b>cuff</b> pressure was 95 (10 - 121) cm H 2 O and above 60 cm H 2 O (upper recommended level) for 56 patients and in 34 of these patients, the pressure exceeded the upper cuff gauge limit (120 cm H 2 O). There was no association between cuff pressure and age, body mass index, type of surgery, or time from induction of anaesthesia to the time the cuff pressure was measured. Conclusion For maintenance of epithelia flow and nerve function {{and at the same}} time secure air sealing, this evaluation indicates that the cuff pressure needs to be checked as part of the procedures involved in induction of anaesthesia and eventually checked during surgery. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cuff leak Test Introduction: Although cuff {{leak test}} has been {{proposed}} as a simple method of predicting the occurrence of postextubation stridor, cut-off point of cuff-leak volume substantially differs between previous studies. In addition, laryngeal ultrasonography including measurement of air column width could predict postextubation stridor.

40|$|Hyperinflation of <b>laryngeal</b> mask airway <b>cuffs</b> {{can cause}} {{harm to the}} upper airway mainly by exerting high {{pressures}} on pharyngeal and laryngeal structures thus impairing mucosal perfusion. Although cuff manometers {{can be used to}} guide the monitoring of cuff pressures, their use is not routine in many institutions. In a prospective audit, we assessed the incidence of sore throat following day-case-surgery in relation to the intracuff pressure within the laryngeal mask airway...|$|R
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the <b>laryngeal</b> mask airway, <b>cuffed</b> oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|R
40|$|Hyperinflation of the <b>laryngeal</b> mask airway <b>cuff</b> may exert high {{pressure}} on pharyngeal and laryngeal structures. In vitro {{data show that}} high intra cuff pressures may occur when inflated to only 30 % of the manufacturer's recommended maximum inflation volume. We prospectively assessed the pressure volume curves of paediatric sized laryngeal mask airways (size 1 - 3) in 240 consecutive children (0 - 15 years). Following laryngeal mask airway insertion the cuff was inflated with 1 -ml increments of air up to the maximum recommended by the manufacturer. After each ml cuff pressure was measured. At the end all cuff pressures were adjusted to 55 cmH(2) O. The maximum recommended volume resulted in high intracuff pressures in all laryngeal mask airway brands and sizes studied. Approximately half the maximum volume produced a cuff pressure < or = 60 cmH(2) O. This occurred in all brands and all sizes studied. We recommend that cuff manometers {{should be used to}} guide inflation in paediatric laryngeal mask airways...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{efficacy}} of the intubating laryngeal mask as a ventilation device and blind intubation guide. Following induction of anaesthesia with propofol, the device was successfully inserted at the first attempt in 110 / 110 (100 %) patients. Placement took less than 10 s in all patients. Size selection was based on nose-chin distance. Adequate ventilation was achieved in 104 / 110 (95 %) patients. Blind tracheal intubation using an 8 -mm internal diameter straight silicone cuffed tracheal tube was attempted 3 min after the administration of vecuronium. Passage of a lighted stylet through the intubating laryngeal mask was used to determine the position of the intubating <b>laryngeal</b> mask <b>cuff</b> before blind intubation. If resistance was felt during intubation, a sequence of adjusting manoeuvres was used, based on the depth at which resistance occurred. Tracheal intubation was possible in 104 / 104 (100 %) patients. In 42 (40 %) patients, no resistance was encountered and the trachea was intubated at the first attempt. Sixty-two (60 %) patients required one adjusting manoeuvre. The mean (range) time taken to successful intubation, i. e. the time from disconnection of the intubating laryngeal mask from the breathing system to successful tracheal intubation, was 79 (12 - 315) s. Six patients with potential or known intubation problems were included in the study. The tracheas of all six patients were successfully intubated. We conclude that the intubating laryngeal mask is an effective ventilation device and intubation guide with potential for use in patients who may present difficulty in tracheal intubation...|$|R
30|$|The lateral {{position}} of a <b>laryngeal</b> mask airway <b>cuff</b> can be seen if the cuff is filled with fluid but the fluid damages the cuff on subsequent autoclaving [73]. Airway obstruction due to a prevertebral haematoma following difficult central line insertion may be prevented by using US for this procedure [250]. Endoscopic high-frequency ultrasound of the larynx has been described: the larynx is depicted from the luminal side by filling the larynx and the trachea above the cuff of the endotracheal tube with 0.9  % saline to obtain sufficient tissue connection and prevent the retention of air bubbles in the anterior commissure [251]. The technique involves a thin catheter high frequency probe with a rotating mirror to spread the ultrasound ray, producing a 360 ° image rectilinear to the catheter [251, 252]. Three-dimensional and pocket-sized US devices are likely to move the boundaries for both the quality {{and the availability of}} ultrasonographic imaging of the airway. Even a pocket-sized smartphone-based system allows ultrasonography in a quality acceptable for airway evaluation [253].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{have planned}} to {{evaluate}} the <b>laryngeal</b> mask <b>cuff</b> pressures (LMcp) inflated by anesthesia workers of several seniority, without using manometer. METHODS: 180 patients scheduled to have short duration surgery with laryngeal mask {{were included in the}} study. Five anesthesia specialists (Group S), 10 residents (Group R) and 6 technicians (Group T) inflated the LMc; thereafter LMcp were measured with pressure manometer. Participants have repeated this practice in at least five different cases. LMcp higher than 60 cm H 2 O at the initial placement or intraoperative period were adjusted to normal range. Sore throat was questioned postoperatively. Groups were compared in terms of mean LMcp and occupational experience. RESULTS: At the settlement of LM, LMcp pressures within the normal range were determined in 26 (14. 4 %) cases. Mean LMcp after LM placement in Group S, R and T were 101. 2 ± 14. 0, 104. 3 ± 20. 5 cm H 2 O and 105. 2 ± 18. 4 cm H 2 O respectively (p > 0. 05). Mean LMcp values in all measurement time periods within the groups were above the normal limit (60 cm H 2 O). When groups were compared in terms of LMcp, no difference has been found among pressure values. Occupational experience was 14. 2 ± 3. 9; 3. 3 ± 1. 1 and 6. 6 ± 3. 8 years for specialists, residents and technicians respectively and measured pressure values were not different in regard of occupational experience. Seven (3. 9 %) patients had sore throat at the 24 th hour interview. CONCLUSION: Considering lower possibility of normal adjustment of LMcp and ineffectiveness of occupational experience to obtain normal pressure values, it is suitable that all anesthesia practitioners should adjust LMcp with manometer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cuff {{leak test}} (CLT) has been {{proposed}} as a simple method of predicting post-extubation stridor (PES), however due to different cut-off point of cuff-leak volume between previous studies, the laryngeal ultrasonography (US) including measurement of air column width was used to predict PES. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the value of <b>laryngeal</b> US versus <b>cuff</b> leak test in predicting PES. Methods: The study included fifty patients admitted to the Critical Care Department, Cairo University Hospitals from the period of November 2014 to January 2016, intubated for at least 24  h and examined prior to extubation using CLT and laryngeal ultrasound. Results: Four cases developed PES. CLT identified PES patients with a sensitivity of 75 %, with PPV of 50 % for leakage volume of 132. 5  ml. Laryngeal ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 50 % for those patients with air column width before deflation less than 10. 955  mm and air column width difference (ACWD) of 0. 905  mm with PPV of 11. 8 % and 14. 3 % for both respectively. Conclusion: Both CLT and laryngeal US might have low sensitivity and PPV in predicting PES and should be used with caution in prediction of PES...|$|R
40|$|Waveform capnography was {{recommended}} {{as the most}} reliable method to confirm correct endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway placements. However, capnography may be unreliable during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and during low flow states. It may lead to an unnecessary removal of a well-placed endotracheal tube, re-intubation and interruption of chest compressions. Real-time upper airway (laryngo-tracheal) ultrasonography to confirm correct endotracheal tube placement was shown to be very useful in cadaveric models and during emergency intubation. Tracheal ultrasonography does not interrupt chest compressions and is not affected by low pulmonary flow or airway obstruction, but is limited by ultrasonography scattering and acoustic artifacts generated in air – mucosa interfaces. Sonographic upper airway assessment emerges as a rapid and easily available method to predict difficult intubation, to assess the laryngeal and hypopharyngeal size and visualize {{the position of the}} laryngeal mask airway in situ. This study demonstrates that the replacement of air with saline in endotracheal tube or <b>laryngeal</b> mask airway <b>cuffs</b> {{and the use of the}} contrast agents enables detection of cuffs in the airway. It also allows visualization of the surrounding structures or tissues as the ultrasound beam can be transmitted through the fluid – filled cuffs without being reflected from air – mucosal interfaces...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyperinflation of {{laryngeal}} mask airway (LMA) cuffs may be harmful {{because of the}} exertion of high pressures on pharyngeal and <b>laryngeal</b> structures. Although <b>cuff</b> manometers {{may be used to}} monitor cuff pressure, their use is not routine in many institutions and clinical endpoints are used instead. Furthermore, it is common clinical practice to add air to the cuff in the presence of an air leak to obtain a better seal. METHODS: In a prospective audit, the authors assessed air leakage around pediatric sized LMAs (n = 200) following inflation guided by common clinical endpoints (slight outward movement of the LMA) and then following adjustment of the cuff pressure to the recommended pressure range (120 cmH(2) O (size 1) and the median leakage around the cuff ranged from 0. 66 to 1. 07 ml x kg(- 1). Following cuff pressure adjustment according to the recommended pressure range (> 60 cmH(2) O), the leakage decreased significantly to 0. 51 - 0. 79 ml x kg(- 1) (P = 0. 002 for size 1, P > 0. 001 for size 1. 5 - 3). CONCLUSION: The use of clinical endpoints to inflate LMA cuffs is not only associated with significant hyperinflation in the majority of patients but also with an increased leakage around the LMA cuff when compared with adjusted LMA cuff pressures. Therefore, cuff manometers should routinely be used not only to avoid unnecessary hyperinflation but also to improve cuff sealing of LMA in children...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{incidence}} {{of damage to}} the individual cranial nerves and their branches associated with laryngeal mask airway use is low; there have been case reports of damage to the lingual nerve, hypoglossal nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve. To {{the best of our}} knowledge we present the first reported case of inferior alveolar nerve injury associated with laryngeal mask airway use. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35 -year-old Caucasian man presented to our facility for elective anterior cruciate ligament repair. He had no background history of any significant medical problems. He opted for general anesthesia over a regional technique. He was induced with fentanyl and propofol and a size 4 laryngeal mask airway was inserted without any problems. His head was in a neutral position during the surgery. After surgery in the recovery room, he complained of numbness in his lower lip. He also developed extensive scabbing of the lower lip on the second day after surgery. The numbness and scabbing started improving after a week, with complete recovery after two weeks. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of vascular occlusion and injury to the inferior alveolar nerve, causing scabbing and numbness of the lower lip, resulting from laryngeal mask airway use. This is an original case report mostly of interest for anesthetists who use the laryngeal mask airway in day-to-day practice.

In addition, laryngeal ultrasonography including measurement of air column width could predict postextubation stridor. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the value of <b>laryngeal</b> ultrasonography versus <b>cuff</b> leak test in predicting postextubation stridor. Methods: In a prospective study, all patients intubated for a minimum of 24 h for acute respiratory failure, airway protection and other causes were included. Patients were evaluated for postextubation stridor and need for reintubation after extubation. The cuff leak volume was defined as a difference between expiratory tidal volumes with the cuff inflated and deflated. Laryngeal air column width was defined as the width of air passed through the vocal cords as determined by laryngeal ultrasonography. The air-column width difference was the width difference between balloon-cuff inflation and deflation. Results: Forty one intubated patients with the mean age of 57. 16 ± 20. 07 years were included. Postextubation stridor was observed in 4 patients (9. 75 %). Cuff leak test (cut off point: 249 mL) showed sensitivity and specificity of 75 % and 59 %, respectively. In addition, laryngeal ultrasonography (cut off point for air column width: 10. 95 mm) resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 50 % and 54 %, respectively. Positive predictive value of both methods were < 20 %. Conclusion: Both cuff leak test and laryngeal ultrasonography have low positive predictive value and sensitivity in predicting postextubation stridor and should be used with caution in this regard...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Internal neck anatomy {{landmarks}} {{and their}} relation after placement of an extraglottic airway devices {{have not been}} studied extensively {{by the use of}} ultrasound. Based on our group experience with external landmarks as well as internal landmarks evaluation with other techniques, we aimed use ultrasound to analyze the internal neck anatomy landmarks and the related changes due to the placement of the Laryngeal Mask Airway Unique. Methods: Observational pilot investigation. Non-obese adult patients with no evidence of airway anomalies, were recruited. External neck landmarks were measured based on a validated and standardized method by tape. Eight internal anatomical landmarks, reciprocal by the investigational hypothesis to the external landmarks, were also measured by ultrasound guidance. The internal landmarks were re-measured after optimal placement and inflation of the extraglottic airway devices <b>cuff</b> <b>Laryngeal</b> Mask Airway Unique. Results: Six subjects were recruited. Ultrasound measurements of hyoid-mental distance, thyroid-cricoid distance, thyroid height, and thyroid width were found to be significantly (p < 0. 05) overestimated using a tape measure. Sagittal neck landmark distances such as thyroid height, sternal-mental distance, and thyroid-cricoid distance significantly decreased after placement of the Laryngeal Mask Airway Unique. Conclusion: The laryngeal mask airway Unique resulted in significant changes in internal neck anatomy. The induced changes and respective specific internal neck anatomy landmarks could help to design devices that would modify their shape accordingly to areas of greatest displacement. Also, while external neck landmark measurements overestimate their respective internal neck landmarks, as we previously reported, the concordance of each measurement and their respective conversion factor could continue to be of help in sizing extraglottic airway devices. Due to the pilot nature of the study, more investigations are warranted...|$|R
