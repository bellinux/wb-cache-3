40|$|Conventional lag dampers use passive materials, such as elastomers, to dissi-pate {{energy and}} provide {{stiffness}}, but their damping and stiffness levels diminish markedly as amplitude of damper motion increases. Magnetorheological (MR) fluids based dampers have controllable damping {{with little or}} no stiffness. In order to combine the advantages of both elastomeric materials and MR flu-ids, semi-active magnetorheological fluid elastomeric (MRFE) lag dampers are developed in this thesis.

Three challenging level flight conditions are investigated: 1) high speed with advancing blade negative lift, 2) low speed with blade-wake interaction, and 3) high thrust with dynamic stall. The predicted flap bending and torsion moments, pitch link and <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> loads, in general, show reasonably good correlation with the test data. A nonlinear <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> model {{is essential for the}} accurate prediction of root chord bending moment and <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> load.

Parametric study shows that blade stiffness variations have only a small influence on the loads calculations. However, modal damping in the first flap mode has a significant influence on the flap bending moments. Inclusion of a simple one degree-of-freedom drivetrain model shows the potential importance of high frequency drivetrain modes for the accurate prediction of the 4 /rev chord bending moments and a need to develop a realistic drivetrain model.

40|$|Lead-lag dampers {{are present}} in most rotors to provide the {{required}} level of damping in all flight conditions. These dampers are {{a critical component of}} the rotor system but they also represent a major source of maintenance cost. A semi-active friction based lead-lag damper is proposed as a replacement for hydraulic and elastomeric dampers. In the semi-active damper, damping is provided by optimized energy dissipation using modulated frictional forces in joints. A conceptual design of a piezoelectric-actuated friction-based <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> for a full-scale rotor is presented. A control law governing the actuation in the <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> is designed to generate the desired level of damping for performing adaptive damping of individual blade lag motion.

The rotor blade and hub configuration were selected such that the hub and blade had comparable levels of bending stiffness. Experimental measurements of the <b>lag</b> <b>damping</b> were made for various values of rotor rotational speed and blade pitch angle.

40|$|Prediction of <b>lag</b> <b>damping</b> is {{difficult}} {{owing to the}} delicate balance of drag, induced drag and Coriolis forces in the in-plane direction. Moreover, induced drag is sensitive to dynamic wake, both shed and trailing components, and thus its prediction requires adequate unsteady-wake representation. Accordingly, rigid-blade flap-lag equations are coupled with a three-dimensional finite-state wake model; three isolated rotor configurations with three, four and five blades are treated over a range of thrust levels, Lock numbers, lag frequencies and advance ratios. The investigation includes convergence characteristics of damping {{with respect to the}} number of radial shape functions and harmonics of the wake model for multiblade modes of low frequency (less than 1 /rev.) to high frequency (greater than 1 /rev.). Predicted flap and <b>lag</b> <b>damping</b> levels are then compared with similar predictions with (1) rigid wake (no unsteady induced flow, (2) Loewy lift defficiency and (3) dynamic inflow.

This MRFE damper consists of a flexible cylindrical snubber body, a flexible elastomeric center wall fitted with two MR flow valves, through which MR fluid enclosed in the snubber body can pass through and be activated by a magnetic field in the MR valve. During normal operation, the MRFE damper is exposed to temperature variations due to ambient temperatures and in-service self-heating. To characterize performance at different operating temperatures, the MRFE damper was tested in the fixed frame under a helicopter rotor in-plane bending frequency (lag/rev) at temperatures varying from 20 °C to 50 °C.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a way to}} add the effects of main rotor blade flexibility in the in- plane or lead-lag direction to a large set of non-linear equations of motion for a single rotor helicopter with rigid blades(l). Differences between {{the frequency of the}} regressing lag mode predicted by the equations of (1) and that measured in flight (2) for a UH- 60 helicopter indicate that some element is missing from the analytical model of (1) which assumes rigid blades. A previous study (3) noted a similar discrepancy for the CH- 53 helicopter. Using a relatively simple analytical model in (3), compared to (1), it was shown that a mechanical <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> increases significantly the coupling between the rigid lag mode and the first flexible mode. This increased coupling due to a powerful <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> produces an increase in the lowest lag frequency when viewed in a frame rotating with the blade. Flight test measurements normally indicate the frequency of this mode in a non-rotating or fixed frame. This report presents the additions necessary to the full equations of motion, to include main rotor blade lag flexibility. Since these additions are made to a very complex nonlinear dynamic model, in order to provide physical insight, a discussion of the results obtained from a simplified set of equations of motion is included.

40|$|Currently the {{lifespan}} of helicopter {{rotor blades}} is determined {{based on a}} conservative lifetime calculation. This leads to blades being discarded while they still possess a significant residual amount of flighthours. Blade health monitoring systems are desired to actively track the strains in the blade {{as a means to}} determine the residual life of the blade, significantly extending the technical life expectancy. A major drawback is the need for an electrical infrastructure to transmit all the signals to and from the rotor hub to the aircraft body. It would be advantageous if the required power could be generated locally. Within the European Clean Sky project vibrationbased power harvesting is chosen as a solution to powering in-blade health monitoring systems. In this paper simulations of a new power harvesting concept are validated experimentally. Local generation of power will allow for a ‘plug and play’ rotor blade and signals may be logged or transmitted wirelessly to the body of the aircraft. Examples are the blade strains, hinge forces, vibrations and so on. At the ERF 2011 [1] presented a simulation model to predict the electrical output of a <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> augmented with a piezoelectric based energy harvester. Simulations indicated that for an 8. 15 m blade the output is to be around 5 W. The concept includes a piezo electric stack mounted in the damper rod and in series with the damping element. All forces generated by the damper are also passed through the stack and through the piezo electric effect electric charge is generated. Through the use of advanced circuits the power is conditioned and can be stored in a large capacitor or battery located in the rotor hub. The concept is validated in the lab. The setup consists of a large stroke shaker delivering a high force at low frequency. A piezoelectric stack with a large pre-stress is used so that it can also cope with the tensile forces generated by the damper. A viscous damper which has no dead zone upon reversal of the motion is used to mimic the <b>lag</b> <b>damper.</b> Although the damper does not possess a similar damping profile as an actual <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> this does not pose a problem as the peak force {{is more important than the}} exact profile. Lastly a laser vibrometer, a force sensor, a thermocouple and a voltmeter are utilized to log relevant data through a SigLab system. A number of experiments are conducted to verify the simulation model. Following individual component experimentation, different electrical circuits are coupled to the stack and each result is then compared to a simulation of the respective electrical configuration. Two circuits are to be validated: Direct Current Impedance Matching is used as it is a passive circuit and the ‘standard’ for power harvesting and Synchronous Switch Harvesting on Inductor is used as it is shown to be the best performing circuit investigated in previous simulations [2]. The desired end result is an experimentally validated simulation model of the <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> - harvester model which can be used to predict power output of similar power harvesting system...|$|E

The effects of damper steady displacement and kinematic couplings on helicopter air resonance in hover were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the elastomeric damper can increase helicopter dynamic stability; however, its available damping will decrease as its steady displacement increased. For the notional rotor system, the damper steady displacement will decrease when kinematic couplings are introduced, and hence the regressive lag modal damping can be increased...|$|E

The predictions are correlated with the measured <b>lag</b> <b>damping</b> of an experimental isolated three-blade rotor; the correlation covers rotor operations from near-zero-thrust conditions in hover to highly stalled, high-thrust conditions in foward flight.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an investigation exploring {{the use of}} magnetorheological (MR) dampers to augment the stability of helicopter rotors. Helicopters with advanced soft in-plane rotors are susceptible to ground resonance instabilities due to the coupling of the lightly <b>damped</b> rotor <b>lag</b> modes and fuselage modes. Traditional passive lag dampers, such as hydraulic or elastomeric dampers, {{can be used to}} alleviate these instabilities. However, these passive dampers suffer from the disadvantages that they produce large damper loads in forward flight conditions. These damper forces increase fatigue loads and reduce component life. Thus, it is desirable to have lag dampers be controllable or adaptable, so that the damper can apply loads only when needed. MR fluid based dampers have recently been considered for helicopter <b>lag</b> <b>damping</b> augmentation because the forces generated by these dampers can be controlled by an applied magnetic field.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new power {{harvesting}} application is developed and simulated. Power harvesting is chosen within the European Clean Sky {{project as a}} solution to powering in-blade health monitoring systems as opposed to installing an elaborate electrical infrastructure to draw power from and transmit signals to the helicopter body. Local generation of power will allow for a ‘plug and play’ rotor blade and signals may be logged or transmitted wirelessly. The <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> is chosen to be modified as it provides a well defined loading due to the re-gressive damping characteristic. A piezo electric stack is installed inside the damper rod, effec-tively coupled in series with the damper. Due to the well defined peak force generated in the damper the stack geometry requires a very limited margin of safety. Typically the stack geometry must be chosen to prevent excessive voltage build-up as opposed to mechanical overload. Development and simulation of the model is described starting with a simplified blade and piezo element model. Presuming specific flight conditions transient simulations are conducted using various power harvesting circuits and their performance is evaluated. The best performing circuit is further optimized to increase the specific power output. Optimization of the electrical and mechanical domains must be done simultaneously due to the high electro-mechanical cou-pling of the piezo stack. The non-linear electrical properties of the piezo material, most notably the capacitance which may have a large influence, are not yet considered in this study. The power harvesting <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> provides sufficient power for extensive health monitoring systems within the blade while retaining the functionality and safety of the standard component.

40|$|Conventional lag dampers use passive materials, such as elastomers, to {{dissipate}} energy and provide stiffness, but their damping and stiffness levels diminish markedly as amplitude of damper motion increases. Magnetorheological (MR) fluids based dampers have controllable damping {{with little or}} no stiffness. In order to combine the advantages of both elastomeric materials and MR fluids, semi-active magnetorheological fluid elastomeric (MRFE) lag dampers are developed in this thesis. In such a damper configuration, magnetic valves are incorporated into the chamber enclosed by elastomeric layers. Preliminary MRFE damper design analysis was conducted using quasi-steady Bingham-plastic MR flow mode analysis, and MRFE damper performance was evaluated analytically. To investigate the feasibility of using a combination of magnetorheological (MR) fluids and elastomeric materials for augmentation of lag mode damping in helicopters, a semi-active linear stroke MRFE <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> was developed as a retrofit to an existing elastomeric helicopter <b>lag</b> <b>damper.</b> Consistent with sinusoidal loading conditions for a helicopter <b>lag</b> <b>damper,</b> single frequency (lag/rev) and dual frequency (lag/rev and 1 /rev) sinusoidal loadings were applied to the MRFE damper. Complex modulus and equivalent damping were used to compare the characteristics of the MRFE damper with the passive elastomeric damper. The experimental damping characteristics of the MRFE damper were consistent with the analytical results obtained from the Bingham plastic analysis of the MR valve. Based on measurements, the Field-OFF MRFE characteristics are similar to the passive elastomeric damping, and controllable damping as a function of different flight conditions is also feasible as the applied current is varied in the MR valve. A second key objective of the present research is to develop an analytical model to describe the nonlinear behavior demonstrated by an MRFE damper. Since the damping behavior of both elastomers and MR fluids is dominated by friction mechanisms, a rate-dependent elasto-slide element is developed to describe the friction characteristics. An MR model developed from a single elasto-slide element successfully emulated the yield behavior of the MR damper, and this model captured nonlinear amplitude and frequency dependent behavior of MR dampers using constant model parameters. Meanwhile, using a distributed elasto-slide structure, an elastomeric model was developed to describe the stiffness and damping behavior of the elastomer as the amplitude of excitation increases. The fidelity of this five parameters time domain model is demonstrated by good correlation between modeling and experimental results for both the complex modulus and steady-state hysteresis cycles. Since an MRFE damper was shown to be a linear combination of the elastomeric and MR component, a time domain MRFE damper model was constructed based on the linear combination of the MR and elastomer models to describe the nonlinear behavior of the MRFE damper. Good correlation between the model and experimental data demonstrates the feasibility of the MRFE model for future MRFE damper applications...|$|E

However, the damping and stiffness properties of elastomeric and fluid elastomeric lag dampers are non-linear functions of lag/rev frequency, dynamic lag amplitude, and operating temperature.

Further, passive dampers tend to present severe damping losses as damper operating temperature increases either due to in-service self-heating or hot atmospheric conditions. Magnetorheological (MR) dampers have also been considered for application to helicopter rotor lag dampers to mitigate amplitude and frequency dependent damping behaviors. MR dampers present a controllable damping with little or no stiffness. Conventional MR dampers are similar in configuration to linear stroke hydraulic type dampers, which are heavier, occupy a larger space envelope, and are unidirectional. Hydraulic type dampers require dynamic seal to prevent leakage, and consequently, frequent inspections and maintenance are necessary to ensure the reliability of these dampers. Thus, to evaluate the potential of combining the simplicity and reliability of FE and smart MR technologies in augmenting helicopter lag mode stability, an adaptive magnetorheological fluid-elastomeric (MRFE) <b>lag</b> <b>damper</b> is developed in this thesis as a retrofit to an actual fluid-elastomeric (FE) <b>lag</b> <b>damper.</b> Consistent with the loading condition of a helicopter rotor system, single frequency (lag/rev) and dual frequency (lag/rev at 1 /rev) sinusoidal loading were applied to the MRFE damper at varying temperature conditions. The complex modulus method was employed to linearly characterize and compare the performance of the MRFE damper with the baseline FE damper performance. Based on experimental measurements, it is shown in the research that at all test temperatures, a significant damping control range, extending beyond the baseline FE damper, can be provided by the MRFE damper with the application of varying magnetic fields. This controllable damping range can be programmed to potentially provide the required damping augmentation as a function of different flight conditions. The added benefits of employing smart MR fluids in MRFE lag dampers are to produce adequate damping at critical flight conditions while concurrently reducing periodic hub loads at other flight conditions and to compensate damping losses associated with temperature. The other main objective of the present research is to develop and formulate a comprehensive analytical model that can accurately describe the non-linear hysteretic behavior that is demonstrated by the MRFE <b>lag</b> <b>damper.</b> Thus, a hydromechanical model, which can delineate the physical flow motion of the system and accurately describe the non-linear hysteretic behavior of the MRFE damper is proposed. The hydromechanical model explored in this study is a design-based model which describes the damper system with a series of lumped hydraulic, mechanical and magnetorheological components. The model employs physical parameters such as inertia, damping, yield force and compliances that are dependent on damper geometry and material properties of components and which can potentially be approximated a priori. Further, temperature variation will mainly cause material properties to change. Once model parameters have been established, the model is shown to simulate accurately the measured hysteretic force-displacement history under single and dual frequency excitations, and varying temperatures...|$|E
40|$|A {{fuzzy logic}} system is {{developed}} for helicopter rotor system fault isolation. Inputs to the {{fuzzy logic system}} are measurement deviations of blade bending and torsion response and vibration from a "good" undamaged helicopter rotor. The rotor system measurements used are flap and lag bending tip deflections, elastic twist deflection at the tip, and three forces and three moments at the rotor hub. The fuzzy logic system uses rules developed from an aeroelastic model of the helicopter rotor with implanted faults to isolate the fault while accounting for uncertainty in the measurements. The faults modeled include moisture absorption, loss of trim mass, damaged <b>lag</b> <b>damper,</b> damaged pitch control system, misadjusted pitch link, and damaged flap. Tests with simulated data show that the fuzzy system isolates rotor system faults with an accuracy of about 90 - 100 %. Furthermore, the fuzzy system is robust and gives excellent results, even when some measurements are not available. A rule-based expert system based on similar rules from the aeroelastic model performs much more poorly than the fuzzy system {{in the presence of}} high levels of uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the Aeroflightdynamics Directorate at the Ames Research Center has been {{conducting}} tests on isolated hingeless rotors in hover and forward flight. The primary objective is to generate a database on aeroelastic stability in trimmed flight for torsionally soft rotors at realistic tip speeds. The rotor test model has four soft inplane blades of NACA 0012 airfoil section with low torsional stiffness. The collective pitch and shaft tilt are set prior to each test run, and then the rotor is trimmed in the following sense: the longitudinal and lateral cyclic pitch controls are adjusted through a swashplate to minimize the 1 /rev flapping moment at the 12 percent radial station. In hover, the database comprises <b>lag</b> regressive-mode <b>damping</b> with pitch variations. In forward flight the database comprises cyclic pitch controls, root flap moment and <b>lag</b> regressive-mode <b>damping</b> with advance ratio, shaft angle and pitch variations. This report presents the predictions and their correlation with the database. A modal analysis is used, in which nonrotating modes in flap bending, lag bending and torsion are computed from the measured blade mass and stiffness distributions. The airfoil aerodynamics {{is represented by the}} ONERA dynamic stall models of lift, drag and pitching moment, and the wake dynamics is represented by a state-space wake model. The trim analysis of finding, the cyclic controls and the corresponding, periodic responses is based on periodic shooting with damped Newton iteration; the Floquet transition matrix (FTM) comes out as a byproduct. The stabillty analysis of finding the frequencies and damping levels is based on the eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis of the FTM. All the structural and aerodynamic states are included from modeling to trim analysis. A major finding is that dynamic wake dramatically improves the correlation for the lateral cyclic pitch control. Overall, the correlation is fairly good...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{uncertainty}} in composite material properties on the aeroelastic response, vibratory loads, {{and stability of}} a hingeless helicopter rotor is investigated. The uncertainty impact on rotating natural frequencies of the blade is studied with Monte Carlo simulations and first-order reliability methods. The stochastic aeroelastic analyses in hover and forward flight are carried out with Monte Carlo simulations. The flap, lag, and torsion responses show considerable scatter from their baseline values, and the uncertainty impact varies with the azimuth angle. Furthermore, the blade response shows finite probability of resonance-type conditions caused by modal frequencies approaching multiples of the rotor speed. The 4 /rev vibratory forces show large deviations from their baseline values. The <b>lag</b> mode <b>damping</b> shows considerable scatter due to uncertain material properties with an almost 40 % probability of instability in hover...|$|R
40|$|Two isolated, {{hingeless}} rotors with identical fiber-reinforced composite root flexures {{were tested}} in hover and forward flight at realistic tip speeds. The rotors differed in blade planform and structure. The first blade set was of rectangular planform. The second set had blades of stiffer construction with swept-tips. The purpose of these tests was to measure the isolated rotor aeroelastic stability of bending/torsion coupled rotor blades over a range of flight conditions. The two soft inplane rotor systems were designed with low first torsion frequency to emphasize the effects of torsion. Regressing <b>lag</b> mode <b>damping</b> is shown in hover with precone and collective pitch variations and in forward flight with airspeed, shaft angle, precone and collective pitch variations. Correlation with comprehensive analysis {{for a number of}} test conditions is shown. Agreement in hover is excellent and forward flight correlation is reasonably good...|$|R
