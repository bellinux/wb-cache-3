40|$|A multi {{institutional}} {{initiative is}} underway towards {{the development of}} 42 GHz, 200 kW gyrotron system in India under the frame work of Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. Indigenous realization comprising of design, fabrication, prototypes and functional validations of an appropriate Magnet System {{is one of the}} primary technological objective of these initiatives. The 42 GHz gyrotron magnet system comprises of a warm gun magnet, a NbTi/Cu based high homogenous superconducting cavity magnet and three warm collector magnets. The superconducting cavity magnet has been housed inside a low loss cryostat. The magnet system has been designed in accordance with gyrotron physics and engineering considerations respecting highly homogenous spatial field profile as well as maintaining steep gradient as per the compression and velocity ratios between the emission and resonator regions. The designed magnet system further ensures the co-linearity of the magnetic axis with that of the beam axis with custom winding techniques apart from a smooth collection of beam with the collector magnet profiles. The designed magnets have been wound after several R & D validations. The superconducting magnet has been housed inside a low loss designed cryostat with in-built radial and axial alignment flexibilities to certain extent. The cryostat further houses <b>liquid</b> helium <b>port,</b> <b>liquid</b> nitrogen <b>ports,</b> current communication ports, ports for monitoring helium level and other instrumentations apart from over-pressure safety intensive burst disks etc. The entire magnet system comprising of warm and superconducting magnets has been installed and integrated in the Gyrotron test set-up.

40|$|The invention, {{a static}} phase {{separator}} (SPS), uses airflow and capillary wetting characteristics to passively separate a two-phase (liquid and air) flow. The device accommodates highly variable liquid wetting characteristics. The resultant design {{allows for a}} range of wetting properties from about 0 to over 90 advancing contact angle, with frequent complete separation of liquid from gas observed when using appropriately scaled test conditions. Additionally, the design accommodates a range of air-to-liquid flow-rate ratios from only liquid flow to over 200 : 1 air-to-liquid flow rate. The SPS uses a helix input section with an ice-cream-cone-shaped constant area cross section (see figure). The wedge portion of the cross section is on {{the outer edge of the}} helix, and collects the liquid via centripetal acceleration. The helix then passes into an increasing cross-sectional area vane region. The liquid in the helix wedge is directed into the top of capillary wedges in the liquid containment section. The transition from diffuser to containment section includes a 90 change in capillary pumping direction, while maintaining inertial direction. This serves to impinge the liquid into the two off-center symmetrical vanes by the airflow. Rather than the airflow serving to shear liquid away from the capillary vanes, the design allows for further penetration of the liquid into the vanes by the air shear. This is also assisted by locating the air exit ports downstream of the <b>liquid</b> drain <b>port.</b> Additionally, any droplets not contained in the capillary vanes are re-entrained downstream by a third opposing capillary vane, which directs liquid back toward the <b>liquid</b> drain <b>port.</b> Finally, the dual air exit ports serve to slow the airflow down, and to reduce the likelihood of shear. The ports are stove-piped into the cavity to form an unfriendly capillary surface for a wetting fluid to carryover. The <b>liquid</b> drain <b>port</b> is located at the start of the containment region, allowing for draining the bulk fluid in a continuous circuit. The functional operation of the SPS involves introducing liquid flow (from a human body, a syringe, or other source) to the two-phase inlet while an air fan pulls on the air exit lines. The fan is operated until the liquid is fully introduced. The system is drained by negative pressure on the liquid drain lines when the SPS containment system is full...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA twin-fluid {{atomizer}} {{was designed}} and developed for fuel atomization.

In the twin-fluid atomizer, atomization is attained by injecting an air stream at tip of the <b>liquid</b> inlet <b>port.</b> In this research, the test liquid supply pressure was kept constant and the air flow rate through the atomizer was varied over a range of air supply pressure to obtain the variation in air liquid mass flow ratio (ALR) from 0. 2 to 2. 7.

The project was highly innovative in order to meet demanding requirements: sufficient speed to successfully pursue any ship; the ability to avoid anti-submarine weapons and to ensure success in underwater combat; low detectability, in particular to airborne MAD arrays, and also especially to active sonars; minimal displacement; and minimal crew complement. A special titanium alloy hull would be used to create a small, low drag, 1,500 ton, six compartment vessel capable of very high speeds (in excess of 40 kn) and deep diving.

40|$|With highly {{efficient}} modem catalysts, startup HC emissions {{have become a}} significant portion of the trip total. Liquid fuel is a major source of HC emissions during the cold start and fast idle period. Thus the control of liquid fuel, particularly during startup, is required for future engine designs. The effect of a turbulence plate, or charge motion control valve, on the <b>port</b> <b>liquid</b> fuel mass is examined. A purging process was used to examine the effect of a charge motion control plate on the port fuel film mass. It was found that the charge motion plate can provide substantial reductions in both the total and downstream intake fuel film mass. These reductions are the result of the increased intake turbulence that results from the charge motion plate. This increased turbulence provides enhanced fuel - air mixing and increases port film strip atomization due to the increased viscous shear. The effect of different film locations was postulated and backed experimentally. The downstream and valve films have the most immediate effect on the fuel delivery. Large upstream films, which can take thousands of cycles to develop, influence the fuel delivery on a much longer time scale. (cont.) In-cylinder hydrocarbon measurements were made. Despite the high level of scatter in the measurements, similar transient responses were observed for both CMCV open and closed. This similarity despite different film masses was attributed to different t and x values. by Robert J. Scaringe. Thesis (S. M.)
