40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{evaluating}} the in-situ degradation of nitro polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAH) in sediments is presented. The methodology is adapted from the passive sampler technique, which commonly uses the dissipation rate of <b>labeled</b> <b>compounds</b> loaded in passive sampler devices to sense the environmental conditions of exposure. In the present study, polymeric passive samplers (made of polyethylene strips) loaded {{with a set of}} labeled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nitro-PAH were immersed in sediments (in field and laboratory conditions) to track the degradation processes. This approach is theoretically {{based on the fact that}} a degradation process induces a steeper concentration gradient of the <b>labeled</b> <b>compounds</b> in the surrounding sediment, thereby increasing their compound dissipation rates compared with their dissipation in abiotic conditions. Postulating that the degradation magnitude is the same for the <b>labeled</b> <b>compounds</b> loaded in polyethylene strips and for their native homologs that are potentially present in the sediment, the field degradation of 3 nitro-PAH (2 -nitro-fluorene, 1 -nitro-pyrene, 6 -nitro-chrysene) was semi-quantitatively analyzed using the developed method...|$|R
