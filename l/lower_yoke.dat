40|$|In the RHIC arc dipoles, {{the center}} of the cold mass lies above {{the center of}} the cryostat. At the maximum design field, the {{magnetic}} flux lines leak through the yoke to the asymmetrically located cryostat, which provides an additional return path. This introduces a systematic top-bottom asymmetry leading to a skew quadrupole term at high fields. A similar asymmetry is also created by any difference in weights of the upper and the <b>lower</b> <b>yoke</b> halves. Data from measurements of several RHIC dipoles are presented to study this effect. In the current production series of the RDIC dipoles, an attempt is made to compensate the effect of the cryostat by an asymmetry in the iron yoke. Seven dipoles with this type of yoke have been cold tested, and show a reduced saturation in the skew quadrupole term, as expected...|$|E
50|$|Sirras {{took part}} in the Pelopponesian War as an ally of Athens, on the side of Arrhabaeus I of Lyncestis against Perdiccas of Macedonia. In 423 BC Arrhabaeus threw off the <b>Lower</b> Macedonian <b>yoke</b> and became an ally of Sirras. This was {{reinforced}} when Sirras married the daughter of Arrhabaeus. At first Sparta avoided involvement in Macedon's war with Arrhabaeus, but in 423 BC they joined an expedition which ended with a retreat by the Macedonians and a brilliantly contrived escape of the Spartans.|$|R
50|$|Similar pumping engines {{were also}} used in waterworks. Inverted {{vertical}} engines had their cylinder {{at the top and}} water ram pumps at their base, or in a borehole below them. A crankshaft and flywheels were provided in the space between these, for smoother running rather than rotary power output. These were driven from the <b>lower</b> (pump) <b>yoke,</b> by short return connecting rods. Two Worth McKenzie engines of this type; a triple-expansion engine on 1895 and a duplex simple of 1906 were installed at the Waterworks Museum, Hereford, Hereford and are preserved in steam there.|$|R
50|$|The pilot {{uses the}} yoke {{to control the}} {{attitude}} of the plane, usually in both pitch and roll. Rotating the control wheel controls the ailerons and the roll axis. Fore and aft movement of the control column controls the elevator and the pitch axis. When the yoke is pulled back the nose of the aircraft rises. When the yoke is pushed forward the nose is <b>lowered.</b> When the <b>yoke</b> is turned left the plane rolls to the left and when it is turned to the right the plane rolls to the right.|$|R
50|$|The {{arms were}} : Per fess Gules and Or, in chief, dexter a Griqua hunter statant holding in his dexter hand a slain buck {{and in his}} {{sinister}} hand a rifle, sinister a lion statant, all Or; in base, below a yoke {{the barrel of a}} cannon palewise, all Sable; the whole within a bordure compony of 40 pieces Argent and Sable. In layman's terms, the shield was divided horizontally into red and gold, the upper half depicting a Griqua hunter holding a slain buck and a rifle and facing a lion, and the <b>lower</b> half a <b>yoke</b> above an upright black cannon barrel, the whole design surrounded by a border divided into forty sections alternately silver and black.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new method for the {{accurate}} characterization of soft magnetic sheets using a permeameter {{based on the}} precise compensation of the magnetomotive force (MMF) drop in the flux-closing yoke. It has been developed in order to overcome the systematic uncertainty affecting {{the value of the}} magnetic fieldstrength in single sheet testers when obtained, according to the standards, through the measurement of the magnetizing current. This phenomenon is more critical for high permeability materials, because of the reduced MMF drop across the sample. While additional sensors and auxiliary windings have been proposed in the literature, a novel approach is demonstrated here, based {{on the use of the}} permeameter upper half yoke as the MMF drop sensor and of an auxiliary winding on the <b>lower</b> half <b>yoke,</b> implementing compensation. This solution, dispensing one from dealing with the usually small signal levels of the conventional MMF drop sensors (e. g. Chattock coils), provides best results with the introduction of wedge-shaped magnetic poles, in order to accurately define the magnetic path length. The method is validated by measurements of power loss, apparent power, and hysteresis cycles on non-oriented and grain-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets, which are compared with local measurements performed on the same samples using H-coil and B-coil across a uniformly magnetized region...|$|R
40|$|Woman's suit {{of brown}} wool gabardine. a) Single breasted, jacket with {{rectangle}} motif carried throughout. Convertible collar with 3 " points, and one under collar stop 2 " from CF as shoulder yoke extends in a 2 " wide rectangle parallel to collar edge. Shoulder yoke also extends to self-face the jacket, creating a 1 "x 3 " rectangle {{on the underside}} of the first bound button hold and button. There are 4 brown buttons with three narrow bound button holes, the second button falling at bottom of rectangle yoke as a inseam button. Pair of double welt slit pockets below shoulder within a rectangle of opposite grain within the larger rectangle in same grain as welt lips, with rectangle design lines extending over sleeve and top of it slip-stitched to mid-arm scythe. Two parallel princess seams starting from <b>lower</b> rectangle <b>yoke</b> and front under arm seam run under 8 " over-sized pocket flap, narrow to define width of 4 " slit pocket. Over-sized bias pocket flap is 8 " x 4 " with 1 1 / 2 " x 7 " vertically center rectangle insert of opposite bias grain both starting from side seam. Full length set in sleeves with one elbow dart at each under seam. At right sleeve's forearm starts a rectangle welt insert attached til 1 3 / 4 " above cuff, where it floats above sleeve and continues as its own shape to cuff's edge and folds back 1 " basted to itself.
