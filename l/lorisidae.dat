40|$|The {{origin of}} African <b>Lorisidae</b> {{has been the}} subject of debate for the past half century, so far without resolution. The matter is complecated by the fact that strepsirrhines (Lorisiformes = <b>Lorisidae</b> + Galagidae) are rare in the African fossil record, with large gaps between occurrences in the Early Oligocene Fayum (Egypy) deposit, the Early Miocene strata of East Africa and the Plio-Pleistocene of the same region. Likewise, the Asian fossil record of this group is spotty, with only a few {{specimens}} described from the Late Miocene of Pakistan. In the search for evidence concerning the dichotomy between <b>Lorisidae</b> and Galagidae, authors have tended to focus on the Early Miocene fossils from Kenya and Uganda which is the only region to have yielded a reasonable diversity of forms. Unfortunately, the history of study has been marred by the description and interpretation of non-primate material as strepsirrhines (Lorisiformes spurii). This contrasts with the genuine strepsirrhine (Lorisiformes veri) fossil from the same region which have thrown much light on the group, but which have not yet resolved the issue of the timing or the modality of the dichotomy between the two families. At present, among the described African fossil lorisiformes only the genus Mioeuoticus is accepted by some, but not all, authors (Harrison, 2010) as a <b>Lorisidae</b> (or Lorisinae, all the others generally being classed as Galagidae (or Galginae) Walker (1987). It is thus of interest to put on record the discovery of a lorisid anout from the Late Miocene deposits of the Tugen Hills, Kenya, which is close in dimensions and some aspects of the Far East (Nycticebus, Nycticeboides) and West Africa (Arctocebus).

40|$|The {{function}} of {{the central nervous system}} cannot be understood from inspection of a single region, for each cell and fiber has discrete connections. Therefore, a study of the nervous system requires distinct approaches. One fundamental approach has been the study of comparative neuroanatomy. In a comparative study of the evolution of the primates and subsequently man, the investigator is confronted with a variety of animal forms. Each form represents an end product of a long vertical line of evolutionary development. The problem is to try to reconstruct the vertical line (ancestral forms) from the horizontal end products (extant forms). The order Primates has two suborders: (1) the Prosimii - composed of six families - Tupaiidae, Lemuridae, Indriidae, Daubentoniidae, <b>Lorisidae,</b> and Tarsiidae and (2) the Anthropoidea - also composed of six families including the Old and New World monkeys, the great apes and man. One group of the suborder Prosimii is the family <b>Lorisidae.</b> The living members of the family are represented by the lorises of India and Southeast Asia and the galagoes and pottos of Africa. Characters these animals share with the higher anthropoid primates are seen in the osteology of the middle ear and the medial wall of the orbit (Le Gros Clark, 1959). They also have orbits encircled by bone, three kinds of teeth, a well developed caecum, true nails and a pseudo-opposable thumb. In habit, these animals are omnivorous, nocturnal and arboreal. In progression, the lorisoids are less tied to the quadrupedalism of many lemurs (Osman Hill, 1953). The lorises have a slow deliberate mode of hand-over-hand locomotion, their limbs are subequal in length. In contrast, the galagos locomote by a rapid, saltatory behavior and have pelvic limbs much longer than pectoral limbs. Both of these means of progression effect an orthograde (erect or semi-erect) posture of the trunk and a tendency for a different mode of balancing the head on the spine. Some authors regard the vertical clinging and leaping of galagos as the earliest locomotor specialization of primates (Napier and Walker, 1967; Napier, 1967). From the post-cranial osteology of early Miocene <b>Lorisidae</b> (Walker, 1970) and from a comparative osteological, behavioral and paleontological study (Napier and Walker, 1967), it appears that this locomotor pattern was present in early Eocene and subsequent Miocene prosimians. These authors conclude that vertical clinging and leaping is the earliest known primate locomotor specialization and preadaptive to some or possibly all subsequent patterns of primate progression—quadrupedalism, brachiation and bipedalism. Although comparative neuroanatomical investigations have utilized the anthropoid primates, (mainly Macaca) rodents and carnivores (chiefly the cat), the prosimian primates have been relatively ignored. Yet their locomotor behavior and their propensity toward bipedalism make them an interesting model for a study of central nervous pathways related to locomotion...|$|E
40|$|Primate {{evolution}} draws {{special attention}} {{because of its}} direct relevance to the human origins. Particularly, prosimians (tarsiers and strepsirrhini) are the first diverged species among primates and have a close relation with the primate origin. In addition, the adaptive radiation among prosimians of Madagascar provides an excellent model for studies of evolutionary diversification. The phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of primates have been of special interest to anthropologists and evolutionary biologists. 　　　Chapter 1 presents the classification and the features of primates, especially prosimians. 　　　In my study, complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of primates were used. I review the nature and characteristics of mtDNA in chapter 2. 　　　It is sometimes the most difficult step in such studies to get samples particularly from endangered species. In chapter 3, I show a successful amplification and sequencing of mt-genome of Propithecus (sifaka) from feces sample, using the extract method of Chelex- 100 Phenol-Chloroform or QIAamp DNA Stool kit (Qiagen) in combination with FTA cards (Whatmann). For biologists, such a noninvasive sampling method should be an important resource that will provide greater opportunities to collect and to use invaluable samples. By using the mt-genome sequence of sifaka obtained by this work with other published sequences of primates, I estimated the phylogeny of primates, and demonstrated that the evolutionary rate acceleration, particularly in the amino acid level, occurred in the Anthropoids lineage after they diverged from tarsier. 　　　Major lineages among anthropoidea are well represented by complete mtDNA sequence data, but only one complete mtDNA sequence from a representative {{of each of the}} infraorders in prosimians (Nycticebus coucang (lorisiformes), Lemur catta (lemuriformes), Tarsius bancanus (tarsiiformes)) has been described. So, I determined new complete mtDNA sequences from 6 lemurs (including the sifaka described in chapter 3), 5 lorises and one platyrrhini and combined the data set with the 14 primates sequences reported to the data base in order to carry out an extended study of the prosimian relationships among primates. In chapter 4, I present the first systematic analyses using abundant complete mt genome data derived from 11 prosimians;, representatives of three families out of five of lemuriformes, the Asian <b>lorisidae</b> (south Asia, south-east Asia) and the African <b>lorisidae</b> and galagidae from lorisiformes, and tarsiiformes. The purposes of this study are (1) to clarify problematic relationships among prosimians based on mtDNA data and (2) to investigate the advantage of mtDNA data in studying the phylogenetics of primates. The position of tarsiers among primates and the question of the <b>lorisidae</b> monophyly could not be resolved by the maximum likelihood (ML) and neibor-joining (NJ) analyses with several data sets. The KH and SH tests indicated that the differences between several alternative trees are not significant. As to the position of tarsiers, three alternative topologies (the monophyly of haplorrhini, the monophyly of prosimians, and tarsiers being the basal position in primates) were not rejected at the significance level of 5 %, neither at the nucleotide nor at the amino acid level. As to lorisiformes, three distinct lineages (African <b>lorisidae</b> (potto, Perodicticus), Asian <b>lorisidae</b> (Loris and Nycticebus), and monophyly galagidae (Galago and Otolemzur)) were detected as well. In addition, the significant variations of C and T compositions were observed across primates. These variations of base composition could sort primates to three groups. The first group is catarrhini, higher primates involving human, having a high percentage of C. The second group consists of platyrrhini, tarsiiformes, and lemuriformes having a low percentage of C. The third group is lorisiformes having an intermediate percentage of C between the above 2 groups. These variations of base composition across primates were found some significant correlation to codon and amino acid bias and they might affect the phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, I used AGY data sets for phylogenetic analyses in order to retain information from transitions between purines and to remove the effect of transition between pyrimidines. As to the analyses of protein-encoding region, the support value of the position of tarsiers branching off first among primates were decreased from 85 % to 60 % with the HKY + Γ model, from 88 % to 57 % with the GTR + Γ model using data excluding third codon positions and decreased as well using all codon position data. The rRNA data sets yielded the topology, with tarsier and the anthropoids forming a monophyletic group where bootstrap support increased from 34 % to 57 % with the HKY + Γ model and from 36 % to 60 % with the GTR + Γ model. In this study, the ML analyses could not give a fu 11 y resolved and reasonable inference about the problematic taxa, that is, tarsiers and potto. The analyses of AGY data sets, however, provided a medium support for the monophyly of haplorhini. I feel that the monophyly of haplorhini might be screened by the variation in base composition of mtDNA across species. 　　　Although the phylogenetic relationships of living primate species are relatively well established, the divergence times of living primates estimated by molecular data and the biogeographic history of primates are still controversial. Furthermore, the estimation of the divergence date of lemuriformes-lorisiformes and the adaptive radiation among lemurs endemic to Madagascar was still problematic {{due to the lack of}} terrestrial fossils from the Tertiary of Madagascar. In chapter 5, I estimate and discuss the divergence dates among primates species. To estimates the speciation dates within primates, particularly within strepsirrhini, I used the new mt genome sequence data from 12 primates together with those from 14 primates and 26 nonprimate mammals available in the public databases. I used amino acid sequences of mtDNA for estimating divergence times of distantly related species and employed a Bayesian method (Thorne et al. 1998, Thorne and Kishino 2002). The Bayesian approach does not assume a uniform clock and does not require prior specification of rates for branches and permits the incorporation of multiple constraints from the fossil record. Seven calibration points, including one calibration within the primate clade, were used based on paleontological data. Divergence ages were estimated in this study for the following crown groups: 33. 1 ± 3. 7 (26. 2 - 40. 8) million years ago (mya) for <b>lorisidae,</b> 20. 6 ± 3. 1 (23. 4 - 39. 2) mya for galagidae, 36. 5 ± 3. 8 (29. 3 - 44. 4) mya for lorisiformes, 26. 2 ± 3. 3 (20. 2 - 33. 0) mya for lemuridae, 55. 6 ± 3. 8 (48. 1 - 63. 2) mya for lemuriformes, 64. 5 ± 3. 6 (57. 5 - 71. 7) mya for strepsirrhini, 70. 2 ± 3. 4 (63. 5 - 77. 2) mya for haplorrhini. and 76. 0 ± 3. 3 (69. 5 - 82. 7) mya for primates. The lorisiformes diverged 36. 5 ± 3. 8 (29. 3 - 44. 4) mya into Galagidae and <b>Lorisidae</b> which is well in agreement with the recently discovered fossils by Seiffert et al. (2003) from the late Middle Eocene, which suggested that the basal divergence between extant Galagidae and <b>Lorisidae</b> was under way by at least 38 - 40 mya. 　　　In chapter 6, I reexamined the biogeographic scenarios proposed for the origin of strepsirrhini (lemuriformes and lorisiformes) and dispersal of the lemuriformes and lorisiformes with the data obtained by this study, as well as the fossil record and the geological history of the relevant geographic areas. The enigmatic questions in strepsirrhine evolution are when and how lemurs first arrived in Madagascar, when and how lorises spread over Asia and Africa. By using the correlations between divergence age and geological conditions, I hoped to gain a better understanding of the speciation scenarios of lemuriformes and lorisiformes. The extant strepsirrhini colonize Africa, Asia, and Madagascar. Where is the origin of strepsirrhini? In this study, two hypotheses arise about dispersal and migration of strepsirrhini. One hypothesis is that strepsirrhines originated in Africa and that Madagascar and Asia were colonized by respective single immigration events. In agreement with paleocontinental data, the molecular analyses suggest a crossing of the Mozambique Channel by rafting or hopping island between the late Cretaceous and the middle Eocene, whereas Asia was most likely colonized between the early Eocene and the middle Oligocene on a continental route. Combining the colonization theories, it seems likely that the initial separation between lemuriformes and lorisiformes occurred in Africa, followed by a monophylic lemuriformes progenitor invading Madagascar. In Africa, the lorisiformes subsequently underwent two major splitting events, with a first one separating galagidae and <b>lorisidae</b> and a second one leading to two <b>lorisidae</b> lineages, of which one migrated to Asia. Another hypothesis is that that strepsirrhini originally inhabited Indo-Madagascar, rather than Africa, and that lemurs became isolated when Madagascar separated from India, on which the ancestral lorisiformes evolved. Subsequently, lorises could have migrated to Africa after India collided with Asia, reaching Africa during the Eocene. The Indo-Madagascar continent split from the African mainland and reached its current position 400 km east of Africa 121 mya. Later, 88 mya, the Indian subcontinent split from Madagascar, drifting north-eastward and colliding with Asia 56 - 66 mya. A later time of breakup between the Indian and Malagasy or an earlier divergence of strepsirrhini might be compatible with this Indo-Madagascar origin hypothesis. Bugtilemur fossil clearly enhances the critical role of the Indian subcontinent in the early diversification of lemurs and constrains paleobiogeographic models of strepsirrhine lemur evolution (Marivaux et al. 2001). However, this fossil suggested another interpretation that Bugtilemur might alternatively be interpreted as a very specialized adapiforms (Marivaux et al. 2006) and is needed more discussion. A similar scenario (adapted from molecular data) has been suggested for the Indian frog (Biju and Bossuyt 2003) and the ratites, large flightless birds (Cooper et al. 2001). <br /...|$|E

However, new evidence provided by the deciduous dentition of Avahi suggests that the traditional interpretations are correct, specifically: (1) the lateral teeth in the dental scraper of Indriidae are homologous with the incisors of Lemuridae and <b>Lorisidae,</b> not the canines; (2) the dental formula for the lower deciduous teeth of indriids is 2. 1. 3; (3) the dental formula for the lower permanent teeth of indriids is 2. 0. 2. 3; and (4) decrease in number of incisors during primate evolution was usually in the sequence I 3, then I 2, then I 1. It appears that dental reduction during primate evolution occurred {{at the ends of}} integrated incisor and cheek tooth units to minimize disruption of their functional integrity...|$|E
40|$|This study {{utilizes}} two-dimensional geometric morphometric {{techniques to}} address molar shape variation in extinct and extant prosimians using the relative orientation of selected homologous molar landmarks (paraconid, protoconid, metaconid, entoconid, hypoconid, hypoconulid, metaconulid, and {{the intersection of}} the cristid obliqua with the protolophid). Molar shape was studied using Thin-Plate Splines analysis to explore variation using shape variables simultaneously, rather than by comparing inter-landmark distances, as in traditional studies. The sampled extant taxa included members from the Malagasy lemur families Lepilemuridae, Lemuridae, and Indriidae, as well as Asian <b>Lorisidae.</b> Extant taxa were categorized using taxonomic, as well as dietary, categories to determine if intra-sample variation was correlated with either category. Results suggest that frugivores (and gramnivores) generally exhibit a relatively wide anterior talonid basin and little trigonid torsion (observed as the angle of the protolophid relative to the long axis of the molar). Folivores, on the other hand, generally exhibit a constricted anterior talonid and higher degrees of trigonid torsion. Lorisid omnivore...|$|E
40|$|Lorisiform {{primates}} (Primates: Strepsirrhini: Lorisiformes) represent almost 10 % of {{the living}} primate species and are widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa and South/South-East Asia; however, their taxonomy, evolutionary history, and biogeography are still poorly understood. In this study we report the largest molecular phylogeny {{in terms of the}} number of represented taxa. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for 86 lorisiform specimens, including ∼ 80 % of all the species currently recognized. Our results support the monophyly of the Galagidae, but a common ancestry of the Lorisinae and Perodicticinae (family <b>Lorisidae)</b> was not recovered. These three lineages have early origins, with the Galagidae and the Lorisinae diverging in the Oligocene at about 30 [*]Mya and the Perodicticinae emerging in the early Miocene. Our mitochondrial phylogeny agrees with recent studies based on nuclear data, and supports Euoticus as the oldest galagid lineage and the polyphyletic status of Galagoides. Moreover, we have elucidated phylogenetic relationships for several species never included before in a molecular phylogeny. The results obtained in this study suggest that lorisiform diversity remains substantially underestimated and that previously unnoticed cryptic diversity might be present within many lineages, thus urgently requiring a comprehensive taxonomic revision of this primate group. © 2015 The Linnean Society of Londo...|$|E
