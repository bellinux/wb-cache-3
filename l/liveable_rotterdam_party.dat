50|$|In the 2002 {{municipal}} elections, held on 6 March, <b>Liveable</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> took 35% of {{the vote}} in the city of Rotterdam, a city with a high immigrant population. They formed the city's first non-Labour government since the Second World War. In the same month, he released the book De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars (The Wreckage of eight purple years) criticising the record of the governing coalition. The Economist described the rise in support for Fortuyn as a shock for the Dutch political establishment and their traditional system of consensus.|$|R
50|$|Michiel Smit was {{secretary}} of Pim Fortuyn's local Leefbaar <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>party.</b> He was elected into the Rotterdam city council in March 2002. After the assassination of Fortuyn, May 6, 2002, the Leefbaar Rotterdam leadership was handed over to Ronald Sørensen. Michiel Smit was {{forced out of the}} Leefbaar <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>party</b> though in February 2003, after it became public that Smit participated on various rightwing radical internet fora, one of which was the American-based Stormfront.org and operating the site www.arabischeuropeseliga.nl. Sørensen earlier forbade Smit from visiting the Belgian Vlaams Blok as representative of Leefbaar Rotterdam.|$|R
50|$|Sørensen {{obtained}} an M.A. {{in history}} from Utrecht University. Before he became political active {{he was a}} history and biology teacher. He co-founded the Livable <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>party</b> and was an early associate of the politician Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated in 2002.|$|R
25|$|Heading {{the list}} of the Livable <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>party,</b> a local issues party, he {{achieved}} a major victory in the Rotterdam district council elections in early March 2002. The new party won about 36% of the seats, making it the largest party in the council. For {{the first time since the}} Second World War, the Labour Party was out of power in Rotterdam.|$|R
50|$|Madlener has a {{relationship}} with Jelena, a Croatian by origin, with whom he lives as of 2002. They met at the party office of Leefbaar Rotterdam. Madlener noted in an HP/De Tijd interview that most Leefbaar <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>party</b> officials have foreign life partners, and that this peculiarity seems {{to continue in the}} PVV party: That party's leader Geert Wilders is married to a Hungarian.|$|R
50|$|In its strongholds of Amsterdam and <b>Rotterdam</b> the <b>party</b> {{provided}} various mayors. The former VDB leader Oud {{was mayor}} of Rotterdam between 1938 and 1941.|$|R
5000|$|Bernard Johannes [...] "Joost" [...] Eerdmans (born 9 January 1971) is a Dutch {{politician}} of the Livable <b>Rotterdam</b> (LR) <b>party.</b> He is an Alderman and the Deputy {{mayor of}} Rotterdam 15 May 2014.|$|R
50|$|At the Municipality Council {{elections}} in 2002, Madlener was listed eleventh {{on the list}} of Leefbaar <b>Rotterdam,</b> the local <b>party</b> whose leader Pim Fortuyn was assassinated later that year. Madlener was considered a confidant of Pim Fortuyn.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the year, Melkert and the VVD leader Hans Dijkstal {{appeared}} to be the frontrunners in the race to become Prime Minister. The situation changed {{with the arrival of the}} controversial politician Pim Fortuyn. Fortuyn was a critic of Islam and had questioned whether its culture was compatible with Western society even before the September 11 attacks. He was elected the leader of Liveable Netherlands in November 2001, but he was expelled from the party after making controversial comments in an interview with De Volkskrant on 9 February 2002. Fortuyn had described Islam as a [...] "backward culture", criticizing its attitude to homosexuality (he himself was openly gay). Part of the reason for the uproar was that the Dutch word for [...] "backward" [...] (achterlijk) can also be used in an insulting sense (with a similar meaning to the word [...] "retarded"); Fortuyn stated he used the word in the former sense. Two days later, he formed his own party, the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) in order to contest to the upcoming general election, while maintaining the leadership over the local Livable <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>party.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Yasin {{travelled}} to the Netherlands {{and taught}} lectures on several occasions, including at the private Muslim university of <b>Rotterdam.</b> Several Dutch <b>parties</b> {{tried unsuccessfully to}} deny him access to the country. The most visible campaign against Yasin was led by right-wing politician Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom.|$|R
50|$|Eerdmans {{was elected}} lijsttrekker of Leefbaar Rotterdam on 6 October 2013.In the local {{elections}} of 2014 Leefbaar Rotterdam became the biggest <b>party</b> in <b>Rotterdam,</b> meaning the <b>party</b> {{would get the}} chance to lead the formation of a new coalition.The party subsequently formed a coalition with D66 and CDA, in which Eerdmans is an alderman.|$|R
50|$|The {{support for}} the SDP, which was founded before the {{introduction}} of universal suffrage, was strong among leftwing intellectuals and educated working class circles. This was mainly limited to Amsterdam and Rotterdam. With the introduction of universal suffrage, the SDP, and later CPH began to branch out to the poorest circles of the working classes. In the Zaanstreek, around Zaandam and the harbour cities of Amsterdam and <b>Rotterdam</b> the <b>party</b> was especially strong. After the Second World War, the CPN branched out to the poor rural province of Groningen and other poor rural areas like West Friesland. In some Groningen municipalities like Finsterwolde, Beerta, the party won near absolute majorities. In these municipalities, which now form Reiderland the refounded CPN, NCPN still performs particularly well. In the 1950s the general {{support for the}} CPN weakened {{with the rise of}} Cold War. In the 1960s and 1970s the CPN began to gain support form students. In the 1980s the party lost its working class support.|$|R
500|$|Until February, the LN had {{received}} disproportionate and generally sympathetic {{coverage in the}} media. The situation took a dramatic turn on 9February, when Fortuyn was interviewed in de Volkskrant, {{one of the leading}} national newspapers. Against the strong advice of his campaign team, he made several controversial statements; including one that said Islam was [...] "a backward culture", that no more asylum seekers would be allowed into the country, and, if necessary, the possible repeal of anti-racism clauses in the Dutch Constitution to protect freedom of speech. Fortuyn was dismissed as party leader the next day, and in a television interview said that the split was irreparable, although he would have preferred to remain in the party. He founded Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) on 11February. Opinion polls soon showed that he took most of LN's supporters with him, leaving LN with its original 2%, while Fortuyn soared to 17%. The local LR—which held on to Fortuyn as its leader—was hugely successful in the March 2002 local elections, as it won more than one third of the vote and became <b>Rotterdam's</b> strongest <b>party.</b>|$|R
50|$|On March 7, 2006, the PvdA and {{its leader}} van Heemst {{recorded}} a landslide victory in Rotterdam. In the municipal elections they recorded {{an increase in}} member seats from 11 to 18 (out {{of a total of}} 45). This was the biggest growth {{in the history of the}} PvdA in Rotterdam. A coalition with Livable Rotterdam (Leefbaar <b>Rotterdam)</b> (Marco Pastors' <b>party,</b> which received 14 member seats) was however out of the question due to Pastors' unwillingness. Therefore, van Heemst needed to create a coalition with the much smaller parties of CDA, VVD, and GreenLeft (GroenLinks). Van Heemst himself became head of the PvdA in the municipal council. On May 16, 2006, he resigned his commission as a member of the House of Representatives to be able to concentrate fully on his new function.|$|R
50|$|On 8 March 2010, Wilders {{announced}} he would take a seat on The Hague city council, after {{it became clear that}} he had won 13,000 preference votes. Earlier he had said he would not do so. One week after these local elections, the PVV called for an inquiry into the elections in The Hague, since a YouTube clip allegedly showed irregularities, including more than one person entering polling booths {{at the same time and}} a voter not putting the ballot paper into the box. These calls were rejected. The Hague council said the municipal elections had gone well and that any complaint should anyway have been lodged immediately after the results were announced. In Rotterdam, a full recount was held after a protest by Leefbaar <b>Rotterdam,</b> a local <b>party</b> with a programme broadly similar to that of the PVV.|$|R
40|$|The TU Delft and Port of Rotterdam have {{developed}} a management information system for integrated port area development. The instrument is an interactive 3 D computer based simulation system that helps decision makers to explore a wide problem-space. The computer is used for a larger information processing capacity the user’s judgement is needed for the decision making. The system {{can be used to}} assess the spatial and financial feasibility of the different aims of all those involved at an early stage. The use of the system encourages the different contracting parties to become involved in each other’s concerns. Integrated port area development is a way of adjusting the constructed areas to the (continuously) changing demands and needs of the port sector and society. Achieving the quantitative and qualitative aims and ambitions set during the integrated port area development process demands interaction and cooperation between involved departments of the Port of <b>Rotterdam</b> and extern <b>parties.</b> A pilot area (Waalhaven-Zuid) has been chosen to develop and evaluate this instrument. It covers 100 ha and {{is a part of the}} eastern ports of Rotterdam. This area will become the scene of a large-scale transformation process into a mixed area for port activities, housing and working. Increased and more efficient commercial use of space in the port area is the main goal. This can be done by sharing facilities and utilities, innovative building, co-siting and multi-use of space for example. Such adjustments lead to intensification of use of space. In preparation crucial information regarding the current use of space is entered into the system. This information consists of the function, volume and ownership of the buildings, plots, infrastructure and public areas. During the simulation session different volumes of the buildings, infrastructure and public areas are added, modified and/or removed (steering). This is done by looking at the preferred future use of space, the costs and the profit and the planning involved. The system then immediately calculates the effect of the alternative courses of actions or solutions, on a financial and spatial level. The system output is automatically generated and presents the following results: 3 D view area, programme, a set of density variables (Floor Space Index, Ground Space Index and Open Space Ratio) and a financial overview. This thesis is relevant for those (professionals and scholars) interested in science and area development, for students, for advisors, for real estate developers, for civic servants, project leaders and board members.
