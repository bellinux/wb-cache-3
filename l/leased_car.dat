Angebote des oeffentlichen Verkehrs, die mit starren Zeittakten und festen Strecken- und Routenplaenen operieren, sind zunehmend weniger in der Lage, die hohe Streuungsbreite flexibler Wege- und Routenplanung abzudecken. Ohne ein Modul 'Automobil' kann offenbar kein attraktives neues Mobilitaetskonzept entwickelt werden. Dem Automobil muss allerdings der 'autarke Charakter' genommen werden, um die Verknuepfung mit anderen Verkehrsmitteln ueberhaupt gewaehrleisten zu koennen. In diesem Beitrag wird analysiert, wie eine soziale Innovation im Verkehrsbereich aussehen koennte und auf welche politischen und gesellschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen sie trifft. Vorgestellt wird das derzeit in Realisierung befindliche Modell CashCar, ein Leasingangebot mit der Moeglichkeit der zeitweisen Freigabe fuer die CarSharing-Nutzung, das den Kernbestandteil umfassender Mobilitaetsdienstleistungen bilden soll. Auch wenn die Chancen einer breiten Marktdurchdringung in absehbarer Zukunft als gering einzuschaetzen sind, koennen mit der gewaehlten Konstruktion zur Erzeugung wissenschaftsgestuetzter Dienstleistungen durchaus neue Impulse fuer einen zukunftsvertraeglichen Verkehr erhofft werden.

The relation of total amount of outstanding repurchase obligations as of balance sheet date to balance sheet totals qualifies the related risk assessment of the hedging instrument to be an outstanding device for artificial income smoothing. Annual financial statements of 42 dealerships were analysed whether accounting for future losses from repurchase obligations is used for income smoothing purposes.
