6000|$|Youths {{preparing}} {{for the practice of}} sculpture have to acquaint themselves with the bones and muscles of the human frame in their distribution, attachments, and movements. This is a portion of science; and it has been found needful to impart it for the prevention of those many errors which sculptors who do not possess it commit. A knowledge of mechanical principles is also requisite; and such knowledge not being usually possessed, grave mechanical mistakes are frequently made. Take an instance. For the stability of a figure it is needful that the perpendicular from the centre of gravity--"the line of direction," [...] as it is called--should fall within the base of support; and hence it happens, that when a man assumes the attitude known as [...] "standing at ease," [...] in which one leg is straightened and the other relaxed, the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> falls within the foot of the straightened leg. But sculptors unfamiliar with the theory of equilibrium, not uncommonly so represent this attitude, that the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> falls midway between the feet. Ignorance of the law of momentum leads to analogous blunders: as witness the admired Discobolus, which, as it is posed, must inevitably fall forward the moment the quoit is delivered.|$|E
60|$|To this I answer, {{that that}} Hypothesis which the industrious Mersennus has publish'd about the slower {{motion of the}} end of a Ray in a denser medium, then in a more rare and thin, seems {{altogether}} unsufficient to solve abundance of Phænomena, of which this is not the least considerable, that it is impossible from that supposition, that any colours should be generated from the refraction of the Rays; for since by that Hypothesis the undulating pulse is always carried perpendicular, or at right angles with the Ray or <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> it follows, that the stroke of the pulse of light, after it has been once or twice refracted (through a Prisme, for example) must affect the eye {{with the same kind of}} stroke as if it had not been refracted at all. Nor will it be enough for a Defendant of that Hypothesis, to say, that perhaps it is because the refractions have made the Rays more weak, for if so, then two refractions in the two parallel sides of a Quadrangular Prisme would produce colours, but we have no such Phænomena produc'd.|$|E
60|$|Jasper {{required}} no more; springing aft, he {{soon had}} the tiller {{in his own}} hands. The pilot was prepared for what was to follow; and, at a sign from his young commander, the rag of sail that had so long been set was taken in. At that moment, Jasper, watching his time, put the helm up; {{the head of a}} staysail was loosened forward, and the light cutter, as if conscious she was now under the control of familiar hands, fell off, and was soon in the trough of the sea. This perilous instant was passed in safety, and at the next moment the little vessel appeared flying down toward the breakers at a rate that threatened instant destruction. The distances had become so short, that five or six minutes sufficed for all that Jasper wished, and he put the helm down again, when the bows of the Scud came up to the wind, notwithstanding the turbulence of the waters, as gracefully as the duck varies its <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> on the glassy pond. A sign from Jasper set all in motion on the forecastle, and a kedge was thrown from each bow. The fearful nature of the drift was now apparent even to Mabel's eyes, for the two hawsers ran out like tow-lines. As soon as they straightened to a slight strain, both anchors were let go, and cable was given to each, nearly to the better-ends. It was not a difficult task to snub so light a craft with ground-tackle of a quality better than common; and in less than ten minutes from the moment when Jasper went to the helm, the Scud was riding, head to sea, with the two cables stretched ahead in lines that resembled bars of iron.|$|E

60|$|The whole {{being at}} discretion, I beg leave just to suggest some matters for your consideration:--Whether the {{government}} in Church or State {{is likely to be}} more secure by continuing causes of grounded discontent to a very great number (say two millions) of the subjects? or whether the Constitution, combined and balanced as it is, will be rendered more solid by depriving so large a part of the people of all concern or interest or share in its representation, actual or virtual? I here mean to lay an emphasis on the word virtual. Virtual representation is that {{in which there is a}} communion of interests and a sympathy in feelings and desires between those who act in the name of any description of people and the people in whose name they act, though the trustees are not actually chosen by them. This is virtual representation. Such a representation I think to be in many cases even better than the actual. It possesses most of its advantages, and is free from many of its inconveniences; it corrects the irregularities in the literal representation, when the shifting current of human affairs or the acting of public interests in different ways carry it obliquely from its first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction.</b> The people may err in their choice; but common interest and common sentiment are rarely mistaken. But this sort of virtual representation cannot have a long or sure existence, if it has not a substratum in the actual. The member must have some relation to the constituent. As things stand, the Catholic, as a Catholic, and belonging to a description, has no virtual relation to the representative,--but the contrary. There is a relation in mutual obligation. Gratitude may not always have a very lasting power; but the frequent recurrence of an application for favors will revive and refresh it, and will necessarily produce some degree of mutual attention. It will produce, at least, acquaintance. The several descriptions of people will not be kept so much apart as they now are, as if they were not only separate nations, but separate species. The stigma and reproach, the hideous mask will be taken off, and men will see each other as they are. Sure I am that there have been thousands in Ireland who have never conversed with a Roman Catholic in their whole lives, unless they happened to talk to their gardener's workmen, or to ask their way, when they had lost it in their sports,--or, at best, who had known them only as footmen, or other domestics, of the second and third order: and so averse were they, some time ago, to have them near their persons, that they would not employ even those who could never find their way beyond the stable. I well remember a great, and in many respects a good man, who advertised for a blacksmith, but at the same time added, he must be a Protestant. It is impossible that such a state of things, though natural goodness in many persons will undoubtedly make exceptions, must not produce alienation on the one side and pride and insolence on the other.|$|E

40|$|Citation: Wilson, Frederick W. Conformation of a {{horse with}} respect to gait and draft. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: The legs {{of a horse}} are the natural {{supports}} and motors of the body. They are segmented and muscled {{in proportion to the}} work required of the particular breed to which the horse belongs. They are situated on the lateral faces of the body in front and behind the centre of gravity, the anterior being the nearest to the centre and consequently bear more weight and having a secondary office that of bearing the brunt of concussion. Their propelling action is not marked excepting where the animal is in a slow pace and moving a heavy load. The segments of the leg gradually diminish volume from above to below but they are gradual in number, compactness and resistance. This is very well arranged, for a horse would certainly be clumsy from the weight and inactivity through this combination and would also lower the center of gravity. The posterior members are very different in construction and function to that of the anterior; they bear much less of the brunt of concussion. These members by the inclination of these segments push against the trunk at a given moment where the former are straightened one piece upon the other, thus the angles are obliterated and communicate to the body the needed velocity. These muscles are therefore much larger and numerous than in the fore leg and come more into play when the body is fatigued. This is not so true in the, draft horse because we can easily see by observation that the horse is continually inclined forward when drawing a load. In considering the different angles of the articulations of the horse's limbs we first must recognize that the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> should hold certain relations with a vertical line passing through the center of movement...|$|E

Today, snowboarding still is a lifestyle to many, but also an accepted mainstream sport and has been an Olympic sport since the Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan 1998 (18, 35, 36). The movement pattern and body position is asymmetric, since you stand sideways with the front foot ahead of the rear foot in the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> (14, 18, 28). Several studies that have investigated the biomechanics of snowboarding have showed that the loading of the lower extremities are different in the front leg compared to the rear leg during riding (14, 18, 22, 23, 28). The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate if the asymmetric body position in snowboarding causes differences between front and rear leg considering; circumference of thigh, range of motion (ROM) in the hip joints, power in lower extremities, or causes asymmetrical ROM in the spine in the test group compared to the control group. Two groups were used, one test group consisting of ten elite snowboarders (n= 10) with an average age of 18 years, and one control group consisting of eight high level skiers (n= 8), average age 17, 25 years. All subjects were students at Malung/Sälen Alpine Elite Gymnasium. Measurements of ROM in hip and spine were made with a myrin incline goniometer and universal plastic goniometer. A one leg countermovement jump (CMJ) was made as a test of power in the lower extremities using Ivar ump & speed analyzer. Measurements of circumference of thighs were made using a soft tape measure. The results show significant differences in four of the ten measurements in test group and in two of the ten measurements in the control group. There are significant differences in hip passive flexion (P 0, 05) and (P< 0, 001), between front and rear leg in the test group (Table 2), but no such differences can be seen in the control group (Table 3) suggesting that these differences may be caused by the asymmetrical body position during snowboarding...|$|E

Considerando o jogo, aqui, como um ato com características lúdicas, no qual a brincadeira também se enquadra. As crianças brincam o tempo todo e tirá-las da brincadeira é como levá-las à morte. Para termos certeza disso é só chamarmos uma criança para tomar banho, comer ou dormir na hora em que ela está brincando, com certeza essa não será uma missão muito fácil. Para brincar há sempre um pouco mais de disposição do que para fazer outras atividades do cotidiano. E de onde vem tanta energia? Tudo indica que essa energia vem de uma reserva para construir aquilo que a natureza não supriu: a cultura humana. Pensar o lúdico como algo {{cultural}} e como uma necessidade humana nos leva a vários questionamentos sobre como o próprio homem o entende e sobre como os diversos profissionais que de uma forma ou de outra o utilizam no seu dia a dia, o compreendem e o conceituam. Pensando também, nos novos rumos da Educação Física e na nova proposta curricular elaborada pelo município de Londrina no estado do Paraná, para a disciplina de Educação Física, teve-se com essa pesquisa o objetivo de verificar se o lúdico enquanto princípio e diretriz pedagógica está presente na construção e implementação desse novo projeto, além de outros temas relacionados ao lúdico e à escola. Fez parte desse estudo professores de Educação Física do ensino fundamental das escolas da rede municipal de ensino de Londrina. Com base em dados de observação in loco e depoimentais, realizou-se uma análise qualitativa dos dados obtidos. Concluiu-se que apesar de o lúdico estar presente na construção da nova proposta, ele aparece na sua materialização somente enquanto estratégia, o que demonstra que se faz necessário um estudo mais aprofundado, por parte dos professores sobre as contribuições de atividades com características lúdicas, como os jogos e as brincadeiras na vida da criança.
