500|$|After {{completing}} the film, Hillenburg {{wanted to end}} the series [...] "so [...] wouldn't jump the shark." [...] "We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> as a typical run for an animated show. [...] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now {{was a good time}} to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see your show anymore," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: [...] "The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to," [...] storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: [...] "I think [...] respect that my contribution is important. I think they would want to maintain the original concept and quality." [...] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer has a direct involvement in the production of SpongeBob SquarePants, he still retains a position as an executive producer and maintains an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, Hillenburg voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.|$|E
500|$|On December 9, 1993, the United States Congress {{began to}} hold {{hearings}} on video game {{violence and the}} marketing of violent video games to children. One of the games {{at the center of}} this controversy was the Sega CD's Night Trap, a full-motion video adventure game by Digital Pictures. Night Trap had been brought to the attention of United States Senator Joe Lieberman, who said of the game, [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> game, too, and there was a classic. It ends with this attack scene on this woman in lingerie, in her bathroom. I know that the creator of the game said it was all meant to be a satire of Dracula; but nonetheless, I thought it sent out the wrong message." [...] Lieberman's research later went on to conclude that the average video game player at the time was between seven and twelve years old and that video game publishers were marketing violence to children. Similar issues were brought up in the United Kingdom, with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that [...] "Night Trap got Sega an awful lot of publicity.... Questions were even raised in the UK Parliament about its suitability. This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude, and this only served to reinforce that image." [...] Although experiencing increased sales as a result of the hearings, Sega decided to recall Night Trap and re-release it with revisions in 1994. Following these hearings, video game manufacturers came together in 1994 to establish a unified rating system, eventually materializing in the form of the Entertainment Software Rating Board used in North America.|$|E

500|$|Eminem {{has often}} name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles {{he did with}} rapper Proof in 1992 where they {{performed}} against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single [...] "Just Don't Give a Fuck", Eminem mentions Ice alongside Everlast, boasting in a playful manner that he's a better rapper. In [...] "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with Vibe saying that Eminem [...] "raps like a girl". While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song [...] "Purple Pills" [...] in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album Bi-Polar, Ice mentions Eminem {{in a positive light}} ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say [...] "I give him credit, I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking {{through the eyes of a}} racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two.

[...] In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem's song [...] "We Made You". In the 2011 single [...] "Fast Lane", Eminem raps about riding in his car while listening to [...] "Ice Ice Baby".|$|E

[...] However, Herman says that Yasin's presence in Baghdad does not mean Iraq sponsored the attack: [...] "We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> rather extensively.
