40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of a high <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> {{exercise}} with low load motor control exercises on pain intensity, disability and health-related quality of life for patients with mechanical low back pain. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS: Patients with mechanical low back pain as their dominating pain mechanism. METHODS: The intervention programme consisted of a high <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> exercise, while the control group received low load motor control exercises over 8 weeks (12 sessions) with pain education included in both intervention arms. The primary outcome was pain intensity and disability, and the secondary outcome was health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Each intervention arm included 35 participants, analysed following 2 -, 12 - and 24 -month follow-up. There was no significant difference between the high <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> and low <b>load</b> motor control interventions for the primary or secondary outcome measures. Between 50 % and 80 % of participants reported a decrease in perceived pain intensity and disability for both short- and long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: No difference was observed between the high low <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> and low <b>load</b> motor control interventions. Both interventions included retraining of movement patterns and pain education, which might explain the positive results over time Validerad; 2016; Nivå 2; 20160421 (andbra) </p...|$|R

Premature or late inhibition in the load-bearing arm activity would result in augmented arm deflection. Little is currently known about the timing operation of motor systems subserving coordinated, bimanual actions. In this study, we measured neuromagnetic brain activity with whole-head magnetoencephalography while 15 participants performed a bimanual load-lifting task. To investigate neural processes prior to <b>load</b> <b>lifting,</b> a beamformer was applied to 6 contiguous 200. ms time epochs spanning the entire premovement phase of the motor task. The sequence of neural activations, following a signal to lift the weight, was chronologically ordered: firstly, the primary motor cortex contralateral to the load-lifting arm was activated, then the cerebellum, and lastly, the basal ganglia, thalamus and primary-/pre- motor areas contralateral to the load-bearing arm.

40|$|Although {{individual}} {{heads of}} triceps surae, soleus (SO) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles, are often considered close functional synergists, {{previous studies have}} shown distinct activity patterns between them in some motor behaviors. The goal {{of this study was}} to test two hypotheses explaining inhibition of slow SO with respect to fast MG: (1) inhibition occurs at high movement velocities and mediated by velocity-dependent sensory feedback and (2) inhibition depends on the ankle-knee joint moment combination and does not require high movement velocities. The hypotheses were tested by comparing the SO EMG/MG EMG ratio during fast and slow motor behaviors (cat paw shake responses vs. back, straight leg <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> in humans), which had the same ankle extension-knee flexion moment combination; and during fast and slow behaviors with the ankle extension-knee extension moment combination (human vertical jumping and stance phase of walking in cats and leg <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> in humans). In addition, SO EMG/MG EMG ratio was determined during cat paw shake responses and walking before and after removal of stretch velocity-dependent sensory feedback by self-reinnervating SO and/or gastrocnemius. We found the ratio SO EMG/MG EMG below 1 (p< 0. 05) during fast paw shake responses and slow back <b>load</b> <b>lifting,</b> requiring the ankle extension-knee flexion moment combination; whereas the ratio SO EMG/MG EMG was above 1 (p< 0. 05) during fast vertical jumping and slow tasks of walking and leg <b>load</b> <b>lifting,</b> requiring ankle extension-knee extension moments. Removal of velocity-dependent sensory feedback did not affect the SO EMG/MG EMG ratio in cats. We concluded that the relative inhibition of SO does not require high muscle velocities, depends on ankle-knee moment combinations, and is mechanically advantageous for allowing a greater MG contribution to ankle extension and knee flexion moments...|$|R

MethodsSixteen young men, who were experienced in resistance training were randomly divided into two groups: fast contraction velocity (FCV – n= 8) and slow contraction velocity (SCV – n= 8). Both groups performed bench press and incline bench press exercises (free weights) with 4 sets of 12 repetitions maximum. There was a 50 seconds rest interval between each set, and 2 minutes interval between the exercises. The contraction velocity was 6 seconds for the SCV group and 1. 5 seconds for the FCV group. The total volume of load was recorded during the exercise bout, and the one repetition maximum (1 RM) was evaluated before (baseline) and for 96 hours after exercise to measure the neuromuscular function. ResultsThe results demonstrated that the FCV group provide a higher (p< 0. 05) volume of <b>load</b> <b>lifted</b> during the exercise bout, and had a significant decline (p< 0. 05) in the neuromuscular performance post-exercise, {{when compared to the}} SCV group.

40|$|AbstractDuring bimanual <b>load</b> <b>lifting,</b> {{the brain}} must {{anticipate}} {{the effects of}} unloading upon the load-bearing arm. Little is currently known about the neural networks that coordinate these anticipatory postural adjustments. We measured neuromagnetic brain activity with whole-head magnetoencephalography while participants performed a bimanual load-lifting task. Anticipatory adjustments were associated with reduction in biceps brachii muscle activity of the load-bearing arm and pre-movement desynchronization of the cortical beta rhythm. Beamforming analyses localized anticipatory brain activity to the precentral gyrus, basal ganglia, supplementary motor area, and thalamus, contralateral to the load-bearing arm. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} human neuroimaging study to directly investigate anticipatory postural adjustments and to explicitly partition the anticipatory and volitional aspects of brain activity in bimanual <b>load</b> <b>lifting.</b> These data contribute {{to our understanding of the}} neural systems supporting anticipatory postural adjustments in healthy adults...|$|R

Ten males and ten females performed two trials of lifting a device similar to a standard hand dynamometer under each of these conditions. All the main effects were significant at the O.

The results indicate that the surface friction of a glove affects the amount of force with which the subject feels he needs to grasp an object. In addition, the amount of force exerted per pound lifted decreased with increasing weights, perhaps indicating over exertion at the lighter levels of the weight lifted, or under exertion at the higher levels of load...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the effect of {{different}} resistance training systems (Multiple-set [MS] and Pyramid [P]) on hormonal, metabolic and perceptual markers of internal load. Methods. Ten healthy men performed two resistance training sessions (MS and P) which consisted of three exercises (bench press, peck deck and decline bench press) with the same total volume of <b>load</b> <b>lifted.</b> The training sessions were performed 14 days apart and allocated in a counter-balanced order. Hormonal (plasma insulin, growth hormone [GH], testosterone and cortisol) and metabolic (blood glucose and lactate) responses were assessed before and after each exercise bout. Session rating of perceived exertion (session RPE) was taken 30 -min following each bout. Results. No difference was observed for session-RPE between P and MS bouts (P> 0. 05). Plasma GH, cortisol and lactate increased significantly after exercise both bouts (P 0. 05). Conclusion.
