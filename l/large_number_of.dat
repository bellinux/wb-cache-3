5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> walkers, who use a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> footpaths. The <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There are lovely {{connections}} between certain characteristic 2 semifields and their associated translation planes and orthogonal spreads {{on the one}} hand, and Z 4 –linear Kerdock and Preparata codes on the other. These inter– relationships lead to the construction <b>of</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> objects of each type. In the geometric context we construct and study <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> nonisomorphic affine planes coordinatized by semifields; or, equivalently, <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> non–isotopic semifields: their numbers are not bounded above by any polynomial {{in the order of}} the plane. In the coding theory context we construct and study <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Z 4 –linear Kerdock and Preparata codes. All of these are obtained using <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> orthogonal spreads of orthogonal spaces of maximal Witt index over finite fields of characteristic 2. We also obtain <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> “boring ” affine planes {{in the sense that the}} full collineation group fixes the line at infinity pointwise, as well as <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Kerdock codes “boring ” in the sense that each has as small an automorphism group as possible. The connection with affine planes is a crucial tool used to prove inequivalence theorems concerning the orthogonal spreads and associated codes, and also to determine their full automorphism groups. 1...|$|R
