5|$|Fiscal chaos, {{coupled with}} {{problems}} {{of transportation and}} the requisition of metal led to a general economic collapse as factories ran out of raw materials and <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> workers.

Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or melted down. The policy escalated {{after the end of}} the German policy of deportation in 1917 which later created major problems for Belgian economic recovery {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
