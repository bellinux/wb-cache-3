5|$|Being a {{low-cost}} airline, GoAir {{does not provide}} complimentary meals on its flights but offers options for buy on board in-flight meals. The airline publishes an in-flight magazine named Go-getter. GoAir offers a premium service known as Go Business at a higher fare which provides extra services including seats with greater <b>legroom,</b> free meals, increased baggage allowance and priority boarding.

New membership was discontinued in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Express routes are {{assigned}} new or refurbished buses that {{are equipped with}} Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, and extra <b>legroom.</b> In many stations Greyhound Express customers {{can take advantage of}} dedicated waiting areas, separate from passengers traveling on other Greyhound services or other carriers. Some stations also board passengers onto Greyhound Express buses using numbers printed on tickets. This number is assigned in the order in which the ticket was purchased, which means that passengers who bought their tickets earlier get to board the bus and choose their seats earlier.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered 150 more Amfleet {{cars from}} Budd on March 13, 1980, {{at a cost}} of $150 million. These cars, dubbed Amfleet II, were {{intended}} to replace rolling stock on Amtrak long-distance trains, and featured larger windows, more <b>legroom,</b> and folding legrests. Budd delivered the first four cars on October 28, 1981; the unveiling took place on November 11. The final cars arrived on June 11, 1983. The Amfleet IIs were the last intercity cars Budd built. The continuing unreliability of the Budd Metroliner led to refurbished Amfleet I coaches displacing them in Metroliner service in 1981. New EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives pulled the trains.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1980 the Chevette received the facelift which included flush mounted headlamps and various new interior appointments, including extra air vents and different seats, giving more <b>legroom</b> in the cars.|$|E
25|$|The four-speed gearbox was not {{bolted to}} the engine, but was a {{separate}} shaft-driven unit mounted between {{the second and third}} crossmembers. While the remote gearbox placement led to a complicated linkage to the column-mounted shifter, resulting in vague shifter action, it also improved <b>legroom</b> for the front passengers.|$|E
25|$|In the interior, the rear-seat and {{headliner}} are redesigned to {{add more}} rear <b>legroom</b> and headroom, improving comfort, additional sound insulation is added and the cupholders are larger. A rear camera and a 16-gigabyte flash card system now comes with the Navi system. Furthermore, the gauge cluster is refreshed.|$|E
25|$|Coach Class: Coach Class is the {{standard}} class of service on all Amtrak trains except the Acela Express.

Virgin Atlantic was the first airline to offer personal entertainment for all passengers in all classes.|$|E
25|$|As JetBlue gained market share, {{they found}} a unique {{positioning}} where they competed with other low-cost carriers (e.g. Southwest, and Frontier), as well as major carriers (e.g. American, United, and Delta). Amenities such as their live in-flight television, free and unlimited snack offerings, comfortable <b>legroom,</b> and unique promotions fostered an image of impeccable customer service that rivaled the major airlines while competitive low fares made them a threat to low-cost no-frills carriers as well.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 {{model was}} {{extensively}} redone and downsized, like the Delta 88. The new models, at around 4000 pounds curb weight, were over 800 pounds lighter, but headroom and rear seat <b>legroom</b> were increased compared to equivalent 1976 models. The 455CID engine {{was replaced by}} the smaller 403CID V8. The Oldsmobile 350 V8 was now the standard engine. The Ninety-Eight set a new sales record of 139,423. A four-door sedan and a two-door hardtop coupe were available.|$|E
25|$|The latest {{redesign}} of the Economy Class seat was unveiled on 9 July 2013 alongside new first and business class products. Features include increased <b>legroom,</b> slimmer seats, an adjustable headrest, and an 11.1-inch touch screen inflight entertainment system {{which is also}} controllable with a video touch-screen handset as well as brand new KrisWorld software. The new seats were originally announced to only be available exclusively onboard factory-fresh Airbus A350-900 and refitted Boeing 777-300ER, but following customer feedback, Singapore Airlines announced it would refit all older 777-300ER aircraft with new cabin products as well.|$|E

Business Class passengers have access to Metropolitan Lounges located at select stations and may purchase a daily access pass to select ClubAcela locations.|$|E
25|$|Air China {{introduced}} its new Airbus A330-300 to long-haul operations beginning with services to Düsseldorf, Germany in summer 2011. These aircraft provided the same two-class cabin standard as the Airbus A330-200 {{except that the}} economy cabin had no seat-back entertainment system installed (with {{the exception of the}} first two economy rows which also had increased <b>legroom).</b> Düsseldorf is now the third German destination on the Air China network. The airline launched a new Beijing-Milan-Malpensa service on 15 June 2011, complementing the airline's existing service to Milan from Shanghai.|$|E
25|$|Although the '77 Buick LeSabre was {{considerably}} smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat <b>legroom</b> and trunk space were {{increased over the}} much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built V6 and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8.

25|$|The Concord {{also came}} with {{numerous}} standard comfort and upscale features, gaining an inch (25.4mm) of rear seat headroom, {{as well as}} two additional inches (50.8mm) of rear passenger <b>legroom.</b> An advantage of using the aging and heavy Hornet design was its body stiffness and safety performance. Crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) showed the probability of injury in a struck vehicle to range from a low of nine percent for the four-door AMC Concord to a high of 97 percent for the two-door Nissan Sentra.|$|E
25|$|On the 2nd February 2007 Volvo debuted {{the third}} {{generation}} for 2008. Based on the Volvo P3 platform it shares a lot of parts and general styling with the second generation Volvo S80. Compared with its predecessor the rear-seat <b>legroom</b> was increased by two centimetres and a revised tailgate design increased the load area volume by 55L. The V70 was offered {{for the first time}} with four-cylinder engines and six-cylinder engines. The high performance V70R AWD models were discontinued with this third generation, only a mostly cosmetic R-design package was made available.|$|E
25|$|Britain held a {{dominant}} {{position at the}} negotiations, as they had during {{the last seven years}} seized Canada, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, Pondicherry, Senegal, and Belle Île from the French and Havana and Manila from the Spanish. Only one British territory, Menorca, was in enemy hands. Despite suffering a year of defeats, Spain was prepared to fight on—something which their French allies were opposed to. Bute proposed a suggestion that France cede her remaining North American territory of Louisiana to Spain to compensate Madrid for its losses during the war. This formula was acceptable to the Spanish government, and allowed Britain and France to negotiate with more <b>legroom.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early 2007, {{the airline}} {{announced}} plans to introduce Sky-Torah scrolls on each of its aircraft. These were effectively Torah scrolls which would be carried on board its flight for Jewish passengers to use for prayer. This is a first for any Israeli airline and was {{seen by many as}} a means to attract many Haredi passengers to the airline {{at a time when they}} were showing great dissatisfaction with arch-rival, El Al, following their flying of aircraft on the Shabbat. Later on in 2007, an Israir passenger announced he was filing a lawsuit against the airline for misadvertising the <b>legroom</b> they offered on their aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Air France has {{introduced}} a brand new economy long haul product which features a new slimline seat providing up to an inch more <b>legroom,</b> wider table, universal electrical sockets, retractable armrests, winged leather headrests, more storage space, high definition 10-inch screens featuring the latest in flight entertainment with a USB port, a headphones holder, and newly designed pillows featuring different patterns of the Air France logo. The seats would be installed along with the new La Première, Business, and Premium Economy seats from June 2014 till summer 2016 on the Boeing 777 aircraft, {{the core of the}} fleet. All other aircraft will be retrofitted except the Airbus A340-300 and Boeing 747-400 as they would be leaving the fleet soon.|$|E
25|$|Mabuhay Class seats, {{available}} on all aircraft, offer increased <b>legroom,</b> and personal screens (A320-200s with registration numbers RP-C3221 and RP-C3223 do not feature personal screens and instead have drop-down LCD screens). Currently, Philippine Airlines {{is the only}} Philippine carrier to offer business class on domestic flights. Boeing 777-300ER and select Airbus A330-300 aircraft feature lie-flat seats manufactured by Recaro and Thompson Aero Seating Respectively. Arranged in 2-3-2 configuration for the 777 and 1-2-1 for the A330. Seats feature 15 inch (777) and 18 inch (A330) personal screens with AVOD , as well as in-seat power. They feature a USB port where passengers can plug in their flash drives {{to listen to music}} from their personal collection on the aircraft's IFE system.|$|E
25|$|Air Berlin {{long-haul}} aircraft featured business and economy class sections. At {{the beginning of}} 2012, Air Berlin started the renewal of its long-haul cabin, equipping both economy class and business class with new seats and a new in-flight entertainment system. Fully automatic seats that could tilt up to 170 degrees were provided in business class, along with an anti-thrombosis edition and an adjustable headrest, and more <b>legroom</b> and a narrower seat back in economy class. All seats have an 8.9-inch monitor with a touch screen and offer movies, series, music, audio books and games. In January 2013 the airline again presented a new business class which replaced the one introduced a year earlier. The new business class had single seats, offering travellers even more privacy. The new seats had a full-flat function, a massage function, and featured a 15-inch monitor.|$|E
25|$|Three {{distinct}} loyalty {{products are}} offered, tailored towards business and frequent flyers. These are Flexi Fare, easyJet Plus {{and a new}} frequent traveller loyalty programme called Flight Club. Flexi Fare {{is a type of}} ticket that is usually more expensive than the regular fare and comparable to a business ticket with other airlines. This ticket offers additional flexibility, including unlimited free date changes within a set period, free route changes, complimentary checked baggage (1x20kg), an increased carry-on baggage allowance, and a £5 on board refreshment voucher. easyJet Plus is an annual subscription product targeted at frequent flyers, both business and leisure. This service offers free allocated seating (including extra <b>legroom),</b> priority check-in, fast track security, speedy boarding and extra cabin baggage. The airline's loyalty programme is called Flight Club. To qualify for this a person must have flown at least twenty times or spent over £1500 on ten flights within 12 months. Benefits include fee-free flight changes, free name changes, and a dedicated contact centre team.|$|E
25|$|Configured with 85 seats, {{the cabin}} was spacious and {{well-appointed}} with comfortable seats widely spaced, giving plenty of <b>legroom,</b> {{but due to}} the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much {{lower than that of}} the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing seat pitch and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased maximum payload of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970lb). The auxiliary endplate fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was now acceptable and the new ventral fins also improved longitudinal stability at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being sited in an area of flow separation, the new ventral fins also caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane deicing system was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Premium Economy, is Air France's premium economy {{product for}} long haul flights, which became {{available}} on the Boeing 777-200ER, 777-300ER, Airbus A340-300 and Airbus A330-200 in late 2009 and early 2010, and on the A380-800 in late 2010 and early 2011. It is a dedicated cabin section with a 2-4-2 (2-3-2 on the long haul Airbus fleet and 3-3-3 for Alize on the 777-300 serving Indian Ocean and Caribbean routes) configuration with 38″ pitch (36″ for long haul Alize seats), 123° reclining fixed shell seats, including an adjustable headrest, a 10.4″ touchscreen, personal reading lamp, universal power ports, and an adjustable leg rest (40% more space, compared to Voyageur seats; the seats are 20% wider and offer 20% more <b>legroom).</b> There are 38 seats on the Airbus A380, 32 on the Boeing 777-300ER, 24 on the Boeing 777-200 and 21 on the Airbus A340-300 & A330-200 (between the Business and Economy cabin; behind Business on the A380 upper deck).

A new improved Premium Economy seat using the same shell will be introduced from June 2014 on the Boeing 777 aircraft, featuring better cushioning and improved foot rest, adding comfort to the passenger.|$|E
500|$|Alaska {{will also}} reconfigure the Virgin America Airbus fleet to {{include at least}} 3 rows of Main Cabin Select, which is a {{significant}} change as the current configuration includes the emergency exit row (or 2nd row in Airbus A320 fleet) as part of Main Cabin Select; these seats will now just be considered preferred seats/extra <b>legroom</b> after integration.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "New Greyhound" [...] {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of a refreshed logo and a new navy blue and dark gray livery for buses, which was rolled out to the nationwide fleet over several years. As the older buses were repainted they were also refurbished, receiving wireless Internet access, power outlets, and new leather seating with increased <b>legroom.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to improve its image, between 2007 and 2014, the company aggressively {{purchased}} new coaches and refurbished existing ones. , the majority of Greyhound's fleet has the navy blue and grey [...] "neoclassic" [...] livery on the exterior, wireless internet access, leather seating, and 120-volt power outlets at most seats. Greyhound's coaches have one fewer row of seats than the industry standard, giving passengers additional <b>legroom.</b> All buses purchased since 2009 have three-point seat belts installed.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, JAL debuted new {{versions}} of their economy and premium economy seats called Sky Premium and Sky Wider Economy respectively. The Sky Premium seats, found on selected 777-300's and soon 787's, feature the same width as the Sky Shell seats {{but with a}} 4" [...] larger seat pitch of 42" [...] and a 3" [...] larger recline of up to 10" [...] compared to a 38" [...] pitch and 7" [...] recline on the Sky Shell seats. The Sky Wider Economy seats, found on select 767's and select 777-300's, feature slimmer seats with 4" [...] more <b>legroom,</b> and another inch of width totaling up to 35" [...] of seat pitch, and a 19" [...] width compared to the 31" [...] pitch and 18" [...] width of standard economy seats, plus a larger PTV screen of up to 11". The newer 787's will feature {{a new version of}} the Sky Wider seats called Sky Wider II, which will feature 5" [...] more <b>legroom</b> and 2" [...] more width totaling up to 36" [...] of seat pitch and a 20" [...] width in a less dense 2-4-2 setup instead of the 3-3-3 setup commonly used in a 787's economy cabin.|$|E
500|$|Elite Class, EVA Air's premium economy product, {{is offered}} in a {{dedicated}} cabin on the Boeing 777 and 747-400. Elite Class has wider seating and <b>legroom</b> (in a 2-4-2 layout), and a seat similar to short-haul business class with an extendable leg rest, [...] pitch, adjustable winged headrests, and laptop power. Service levels in Elite Class {{are similar to}} Economy Class, but food and amenities are improved, along with the seating. Elite passengers further receive an amenity kit on most flights.|$|E
500|$|A {{lightweight}} steel (not aluminium) {{structure and}} a rear-engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front crumple zone, {{in order to}} meet current safety legislation requirements without compromising interior space. With no powertrain in front of the driver, the designers were able to shorten the front overhang and lengthen the wheelbase to , giving greater <b>legroom</b> for passengers than many comparable kei cars whose wheelbase is typically [...] less. The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo-carrying capacity, which was necessarily compromised by the engine's location in the rear.|$|E
500|$|The Mint subfleet {{consists}} of A321 aircraft with 159 seats, including 16 flat-bed Mint seats. The Mint seat is {{a version of}} the Thompson Aero Vantage business class seat, customized to include extra storage and dual 110V+USB power outlets at every seat. 4 of the 16 Mint seats are mini-suites which include a sliding door for privacy.

There are two power outlets per row of economy class seats.|$|E
500|$|Development of the second-generation LS 400 {{began after}} {{worldwide}} {{launch of the}} first generation under program code 250T. Given the first-generation model's successful reception and high level of customer satisfaction with its design, replicating the original LS 400's attributes with its successor was one of chief engineer Kazuo Okamoto's primary goals (he stated that [...] "a tradition cannot be founded if you reject the first generation"). Externally, the most significant change was an increase in wheelbase length of , resulting in more interior space and an additional [...] of rear-seat <b>legroom.</b> However, as the overall length remained the same, trunk capacity was slightly reduced. The more aerodynamic body (C'd 0.28) retained the general profile and contours of the original LS 400 and was the work of the Calty Design Research center in the U.S. Designers had evaluated 20 competing concepts, including several with a radically changed body, before selecting a winning entry in 1991 that included forms and contours similar to the original LS 400. Upon final approval in 1992, an evolutionary redesign was the ultimate result, with new design features consisting of sharper angles, curved body lines, and a beveled grille. More prominent side lines provided a reference point for parking maneuvers, and forward visibility was improved. Production development lasted from 1991 until conclusion {{in the second quarter of}} 1994.|$|E
500|$|The {{recurring}} theme of published tests was the Tagora´s lack of clear advantages or of a competitive edge. In comparing {{the car to}} its likely competitors, Autocars verdict was that [...] "the new Talbot is highly comparable with the others, and deserves to sell as any of them, although it does not come out with any startling advantages which you might expect of the latest appearance on the scene". Those cars against which the Tagora 2.2 GLS was compared were the Ford Granada 2.3 GL, Opel Rekord 2.0S, Renault 20TX, Rover 2300 and Volvo 244 GL. Of these cars, the Tagora was the second most expensive but {{did not have a}} superiority among the significant attributes of speed, acceleration, interior room or chassis design. Out of the comparison group the Tagora had the second highest top speed, was the third fastest to 60mph though it had the best overall mpg (by 0.7 mpg). In terms of interior room, it had the fourth best <b>legroom</b> (front/rear). Motor Sport also noted the car´s modest competence in comparison with the Rover 2300 (launched 1976), saying that the Tagora had more leisurely acceleration. LJK Setright noted the cars´s overall [...] "adequacy" [...] going on to say that if fitted with the correct type of tyre he would still opt for a Peugeot 604 instead. Car judged the chassis design to be one area [...] "where [...] does not show the comparative youth of its design".|$|E
