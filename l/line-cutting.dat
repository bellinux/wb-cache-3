40|$|Abstract. Ti ions were {{implanted}} into H 21 steel {{to improve the}} surface structure of oxides in H 21 steel. The wear characteristics of the implanted steel was measured and compared {{to the performance of}} the un-implanted steel by a <b>line-cutting</b> apparatus and an optical interference microscope. The Ti concentration depth profile of the implanted steel was measured by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The structure and composition of oxides were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The results showed that the improved wear resistance of the implanted steel was mainly due to the structure and composition changes of the surface oxides after Ti ion implantation...|$|E

The compact design was conceived through research at Goddard Space Flight Center on laser instruments for space missions {{to carry out}} geoscience studies of Earth. An exclusive license to the key NASA patent for the compact laser design was assigned to Microcosm. The FarField- 2 is ideal for field applications, has low power consumption, does not need water cooling or gas supplies, and produces nearly ideal beam quality. The properties of the laser also make it effective over long distances, {{which is one reason}} why NASA developed the technology for laser altimeters that can be toted aboard spacecraft. Applications for the FarField- 2 include medicine, biology, and materials science and processing, as well as diamond marking, semiconductor <b>line-cutting,</b> chromosome surgery, and fluorescence microscopy...|$|E

40|$|Fiber-optic {{networks}} {{are vulnerable to}} natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, {{as well as to}} physical failures, such as an anchor cutting underwater fiber cables. Such real-world events occur in specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network. Therefore, the geography of the network determines the effect of physical events on the network's connectivity and capacity. In this paper, we develop tools to analyze network failures after a `random' geographic disaster. The random location of the disaster allows us to model situations where the physical failures are not targeted attacks. In particular, we consider disasters that {{take the form of a}} `random' line in a plane. Using results from geometric probability, we are able to calculate some network performance metrics to such a disaster in polynomial time. In particular, we can evaluate average two-terminal reliability in polynomial time under `random' <b>line-cuts.</b> This is in contrast to the case of independent link failures for which there exists no known polynomial time algorithm to calculate this reliability metric. We also present some numerical results to show the significance of geometry on the survivability of the network and discuss network design in the context of random <b>line-cuts.</b> Our novel approach provides a promising new direction for modeling and designing networks to lessen the effects of geographical disasters or attacks.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry {{is moving to}} highly regular designs, or 1 D gridded layouts, to enable scaling to advanced nodes, as well as improve process latitude, chip size and chip energy consumption. The fabrication of highly regular ICs is straightforward. Poly and metal layers are arranged into 1 D layouts. These 1 D layouts facilitate a two-step patterning approach: a line-creation step, followed by a <b>line-cutting</b> step, to form the desired IC pattern (See Figure 1). The first step, line creation, can be accomplished {{with a variety of}} lithography techniques including 193 nm immersion (193 i) and Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) 1. It appears feasible to create unidirectional parallel lines to at least 11 nm half-pitch, with two applications of SADP for pitch division by four. Potentially, this step can also be accomplished with interference lithography or directed self assembly in the future. The second step, line cutting, requires an extremely high-resolution lithography technique. At advanced nodes, the only options appear to be the costly quadruple patterning with 193 i, or EUV or E-Beam Lithography (EBL). This paper focuses on the requirements for a lithography system for "line cutting", using EBL to complement Optical. EBL is the most cost-effective option for line cutting at advanced nodes for HVM...|$|E

The show was shot in a studio in New York City called NEP Penn Studios, which is located in the Hotel Pennsylvania across from Madison Square Garden. They shot the show {{starting}} in early January 2016, with production lasting about five or six weeks. Using {{the look and feel of}} Abigail's Party, C.K. used a color-coded shot list that was created during rehearsals to enable live-switching between cameras. A quick <b>line-cut</b> would enable a fast turnaround to distribution. Also unique to this approach, the editing becomes focused on dialogue and how the moods of the characters shift. There would be no ad breaks for commercials and no standards & practices that would restrict language. Also important to C.K., and why he did not want to release the show via a television network, was that he wanted the show to be secret and unexpected, where the audience had little to no information before viewing, which he said would have been impossible with a traditional TV show model.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} several geometric {{methods for}} dividing an irregular mesh into pieces of roughly equal size with few interconnecting edges. All these methods {{are based on}} cutting a mesh with a line (in two dimensions) or a hyperplane (in any dimension). Line cuts have often been used in practice, but their quality varies widely. Until now, no theory has existed to predict the effectiveness of any <b>line-cut</b> algorithm. We make two main contributions: First, we give rigorous (and tight) bounds {{on the quality of}} line cuts for meshes of bounded aspect ratio in terms of a parameter we call grading that measures the nonuniformity of the mesh. Our bound on line cut quality differs from the known bound on circle cut quality by a factor that grows only as the 1 =d power of the logarithm of the mesh grading. Second, we give an upper bound on the quality of an exact 50 : 50 line cut. This is the first proof of a cut size guarantee for any exact bisection induced by a single geometric cut.

There are several useful techniques that are available for encryping videos. However, one of the unique speciality for human eye is spotting the irregularity in videos due to weak video decoding or weak choice of video encryption hardware. Because of this situation, {{it is very important}} to select the right hardware or else our video transmissions may not be secured or our decoded video may be un-watchable. Every technique has advantages and disadvantages over other technical methods.   <b>Line-cut</b> and rotate video encryption method is maybe the best way of acquiring safe, secured and good quality encypted videos. In this method, every line in the video frame cuts and rotates from different points and these cut points are created from a random matrix. The advantage of this method is to supply a coherent video signal, gives an excellent amount of darkness, as well as good decode quality and stableness. On the other hand it’s disadvantages is to have complex timing control and needs specialized encryption equipment...|$|R
40|$|The music {{printing}} of Ottaviano Petrucci {{has been largely}} regarded by historians {{to be the most}} elegant and advanced form of music publishing in the Renaissance, while printers such as Pierre Attaingnant are only given an obligatory nod. Through historical research and a study of primary sources such as <b>line-cut</b> facsimiles, I sought to answer the question, how did the triple impression and single impression methods of printing develop, and is one superior to the other? While Petrucci’s triple impression method produced cleaner and more connected staves, a significant number of problems resulted, including pitch accuracy and cost efficiency. Attaingnant’s single impression method solved most of these difficulties, while only sacrificing a small amount of visual aesthetic. Despite these advancements, Petrucci managed to dominate the music publishing industry in Venice during his lifetime while Attaingnant achieved success to a lesser degree. Based on an overview of their business skills, I concluded that Petrucci obtained this success through his twenty-year legal monopoly in Venice, and by staying in tune with his clients' needs and printing music that was in demand. The single impression method of Attaingnant outlasted the triple impression method of Petrucci because his technology was more efficient and accurate, but Petrucci was more successful during his time because of his business skills...|$|R
40|$|A cooled {{scanning}} probe microscope (SPM) {{has been used to}} image cyclotron orbits of electrons through high-mobility graphene in a magnetic field. 1 - 5 In a hBN-graphene-hBN device patterned into a hall bar geometry, the magnetic field focuses a current Ii injected from one narrow contact into another narrow contact located an integer number of cyclotron diameters away, creating a voltage Vc. The degree of focusing is measured by the transresistance Rm = Vc/Ii. In SPM, the tip can either enhance or decrease conductance in the sample by deflecting electrons into or away from the second contact, respectively. 3, 4 Our SPM images of magnetic focusing feature a region in which the tip transitions from enhancing to decreasing the conductance in the sample where the change in transresistance caused by the tip is equal to zero. In this paper, we investigate how the location of this region in the graphene sample changes as we modulate the electron density n and magnetic field B. By plotting <b>line-cuts</b> of the change in trans-resistance for different electron densities and magnetic fields, we identify trends in the inflection point where the tip changes from enhancing to decreasing the conductance in the sample. From the location of each transition region, we show that the cyclotron diameter of the electron trajectories can be obtained, and explain the trends in inflection point location for different electron densities and magnetic fields.

40|$|AbstractThe European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is {{a commercially}} and recreationally {{important}} fishery target species. In the last decades, the eel has experienced dramatic stock declines {{and has been}} listed as critically endangered. To reduce fishing mortality, several European countries have closed the fishery or introduced stricter management measures which {{increase the likelihood of}} catch-and-release in the recreational fishery. This study investigated hook shedding mechanisms of deep-hooked, <b>line-cut</b> eels via radiography, and quantified hook shedding rates, post-release mortality and sub-lethal effects in captivity. Eels were caught with four different hook treatments, monitored in a tank for 23 weeks, and radiographed 0, 1, 3, 10, 24, 54, 115 and 163 days after capture. After 163 days, total hook shedding rate was significantly higher for smaller hooks (41. 2 %) compared to larger hooks (0. 0 %), and increased with fish length. Post-release mortality rates ranged between 27. 3 % and 50. 0 % after 23 weeks (not adjusted for handling and holding) and did not differ significantly between hook treatments. The majority of dead eels showed gastric perforations caused by the hooks leading to internal haemorrhaging and the intrusion of digestive fluids into the body cavity inducing lethal degradation and inflammation of vital organs. Anglers are encouraged to minimise bycatch of eel in countries where eel harvest is prohibited. Anglers targeting eel should use selective and appropriate fishing gears, baits and tactics (e. g. very large hooks, immediate hook setting after a bite) to reduce deep hooking and the catch of undersized eels, ultimately promoting the eel's conservation...|$|R
40|$|E-Beam {{direct writing}} (EBDW) {{requires}} no masks and affords high resolution. But its slow writing speed has historically kept {{it out of}} mainstream fabs. Thanks to continuing EBDW advances combined with the industry’s move to unidirectional (1 D) gridded layout style, EBDW may soon provide a cost-efficient complement to 193 nm ArF immersion (193 i) optical lithography in high volume manufacturing (HVM). Patterning conventional two-directional (2 D) design layouts with 193 i is a major roadblock in device scaling: the resolution limitations of optical lithography equipment have led to higher mask cost and increased lithography complexity. To overcome these challenges, IC designers have switched to 1 D layouts with “lines and cuts ” in critical layers. 1 Leading logic and memory chipmakers have for several years been producing advanced designs with lines-and-cuts in HVM. However, cut masks in multiple optical patterning are getting extremely costly. Yan Borodovsky envisioned Complementary Lithography in which another lithography technology {{could be used to}} pattern <b>line-cuts</b> in critical layers to complement optical lithography. 2 Complementary E-Beam Lithography (CEBL) has emerged as a strong candidate to pattern the Cuts of optically printed Lines. As the CEBL concept and other EBDW approaches continue to gain industry-wide awareness, concerns about throughput, scaling, and data preparation rate must be fully addressed. This paper examines the following issues: Challenges of massively parallel pixel writing (MPPW) Multiple mini-column design/architecture can: o Boost CEBL throughput o Resolve issues of CD control, CDU, LER, data prep rate, higher resolution, and 450 mm wafers CEBL’s role in next-generation semiconductor lithograph...|$|R
