40|$|The {{southwest}} {{margin of}} Australia {{is a complex}} and relatively poorly studied offshore continental region that includes the Perth and Mentelle basins. Plate reconstruction models, in conjunction with regional seismic and potential field data, demonstrate that the margin comprises three major segments: the normal to oblique Mentelle and southern Perth margins and the Wallaby-Zenith Transform Margin. Margin architecture and overlying basin geometries change markedly across segment boundaries and the patterns of structural reactivation during basin development indicate a strong basement control on margin evolution. <b>Linking</b> <b>plate</b> reconstructions and seismic studies provides new insights into Early Cretaceous basin evolution, including the relative timing of breakup within each sub-basin, the timing of accommodation generation {{and the distribution of}} breakup related igneous activity. Active development of the Wallaby-Zenith Transform Margin lasted from the Valanginian to the Aptian and controlled structural activity and the patterns of sediment fill across the northern Perth Basin. Immediately prior to Early Cretaceous breakup, the majority of accommodation-space generation and igneous activity was focused within the Zeewyck and Western Mentelle sub-basins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The use of fibre {{reinforced}} plastics – FRP’s – in structures {{is under a}} considerable increase. Advantages of their use are related with their low weight, high strength and stiffness. The improvement of the dynamic characteristics has been profitable for aeronautics, automobile, railway, naval and sporting goods industries. Drilling is a widely used machining technique as it is needed to assemble parts in a structure. This is a unique machining process, characterized by the existence of two different mechanisms: extrusion by the drill chisel edge and cutting by the rotating cutting lips. Drilling raises particular problems that can reduce mechanical and fatigue strength of the parts. In this work, quasi-isotropic hybrid laminates with 25 % of carbon fibre reinforced plies and 4 mm thickness are produced, tested and drilled. Three different drill geometries are compared. Results considered are the interlaminar fracture toughness in Mode I – GIc –, thrust force during drilling and delamination extent after drilling. A bearing test is performed to evaluate tool influence on the load carrying capacity of the plate. Results consider the influence of drill geometry on delamination. A correlation <b>linking</b> <b>plate</b> damage to bearing test results is presented...|$|E
40|$|When hot and ductile rocks fail {{they do so}} with an {{astonishing}} variety. Observations from crustal deformation show that when the fluid content is low (less than a few per cent) they form the cores of anastomosing mylonitic shear zones, which feature strong gradients in grain size towards their metamorphic fluid rich centre (Fusseis et al., 2009). In circumstances where the fluid/melt content is high they form macroscopically visible ductile fractures (Weinberg and Regenauer-Lieb, 2010) which allow melt transfer into the shallower crust forming the feeder zone of granites. We show here {{that all of the}} above phenomena are new types of instabilities well known from high temperature deformation of ceramics, i. e. materials that otherwise show brittle cleavage at cold laboratory conditions. The new failure modes boil down to a series of microscopic processes, where upon increasing temperature and decreasing applied stress failure modes transition from brittle cleavage to transgranular and intergranular “creep fractures”, summarized by Ashby’s classical deformation mechanism maps (Ghandi and Ashby, 1979). Although Material Scientists are well aware of these creep enhanced fracture modes we have been lacking concise evidence in the laboratory and field proving the existence of these failure transitions. As creep fracture processes are happening on relatively slow geodynamic time scales they have been argued to provide the critical mechanism <b>linking</b> <b>plate</b> tectonic processes and deep fluid transfer processes (Regenauer-Lieb, 1999). In these considerations fluids are viewed as creating their own pathways through facilitating shear localization by creep fractures, rather than being a passive constituent simply following brittle fractures that are generated inside a shear zone caused by other localization mechanisms. Recently, the missing laboratory (Rybacki et al., 2008) and field evidence for creep fractures have been found (Fusseis et al., 2009). Ghost images of both creep fractures and brittle fractures can also be seen in OH diffusion profiles on grain boundaries (Sommer et al., 2008) and fully embedded intragranular cracks in mantle xenoliths (Sommer et al., 2012). In order to illustrate the fundamental implications for deep fluid transfer we extend classical solutions of material sciences to geodynamic conditions and incorporate melting reactions into the numerical formulation. We will show the implications to a number of applied field studies. ...|$|E

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. Hybrid masonry {{is a new}} seismic {{structural}} system which involves structural steel frames with concrete masonry unit (CMU) walls. The CMU walls serve as shear walls to replace traditional steel bracing. They have different functions {{depending on the type}} of hybrid masonry. The CMU walls are either used to transfer only lateral loads through the height of the structure or lateral and gravity loads. Type I Hybrid Masonry uses the CMU walls to resist only in-plane lateral loads. In Type II Hybrid Masonry the CMU walls are also used to support vertical loads. Using the CMU walls as a gravity member, the steel beams in the frames can be reduced resulting in a lower construction cost. In Type III Hybrid Masonry the CMU walls act as the web of a composite shear wall with the steel columns as boundary elements for columns. Drs. Ian Robertson and Gaur Johnson, along with graduate student researchers Seth Goodnight, Reef Ozaki-Train, and Steven Mitsuyuki have designed and tested prospective connector plates to develop connectors that can transfer lateral loads. The first type tested was the ductile fuse connector, which was designed to transfer many cycles of lateral load for Type I Hybrid Masonry. During cycling, the fuse connector plates dissipated energy caused by the simulated seismic activity. The fuse connector possessed the capability to dissipate large amounts of energy and allowed relatively large deflections without damaging the CMU wall. This ductility is an advantage because only the fuse connector plates must be replaced after a seismic event. The second type of connector that was tested was a <b>link</b> <b>plate,</b> which was designed as a uniform plate with no fuse section. These <b>link</b> <b>plates</b> were designed to transfer higher lateral loads than the fuse connector. Rather than allowing large displacements by yielding, this connector plate provided a rigid system that transferred the lateral loads to the CMU infill wall which must be designed for ductile response. In Type I Hybrid Masonry the transfer of in-plane shear from the fuse or <b>link</b> <b>plates</b> to the CMU panel utilizes bolts which pass through the CMU wall and vertical slotted holes in the connector plates on either side of the wall. These through bolts must not be the weak link in the Hybrid Masonry system since failure of the bolts in shear or masonry break-out could represent a non-ductile response that is not suitable for seismic design. This report presents the results of eleven bolt push-out tests were performed on six 8 " thick grouted CMU walls to evaluate the performance of the through bolts. Based on these tests a number of conclusions were drawn and recommendations are provided for design of through bolted connections. Type II Hybrid Masonry utilizes headed studs to transfer shear from the steel floor beam to the CMU shear panel below. Type III Hybrid Masonry utilizes headed studs to transfer shear from both the steel floor beam and the columns to the CMU shear panel. Three fully grouted 8 " thick CMU walls were tested to evaluate the performance of headed studs at different spacings in these connections. In all cases, the headed studs were ¾" diameter by 6 " long, welded to the bottom of the floor beam bottom flange. They were embedded in a 9 " high by 7 - 5 / 8 " thick grout beam on top of the 8 " CMU wall.
