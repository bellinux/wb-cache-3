A standard solvent presaturation pulse sequence that also partially suppresses the broad envelope from protons with rigid structures in spectrin and selectively enhances the sharp resonances {{has been used}} to characterize the behavior of these resonances. The overall resonance pattern strongly resembles that of the denatured spectrin. The observed spectra are also quite similar to the <b>line-broadened</b> spectrum from a mixture of amino acids that corresponds to the composition of the spectrin molecule.

The catalytic mechanism of this family of enzymes is thought to proceed via a gem-diol reaction intermediate, {{which has not been}} observed directly. Site-directed single mutants of BphD in which catalytic residues His- 265 and Ser- 112 were replaced with Ala were found to possess 10 (4) -fold reduced k(cat) values, and in each case, the C-C cleavage step was shown by pre-steady-state kinetic analysis to be rate-limiting. The processing of a 6 -C- 13 -labeled aryl-containing substrate by these H 265 A or S 112 A mutant BphD enzymes was monitored directly by C- 13 NMR spectroscopy. A new <b>line-broadened</b> signal was observed at 128 ppm for each enzyme, corresponding to the proposed gem-diol reaction intermediate, over a time scale of 1 - 24 h. A similar signal was observed upon incubation of the C- 13 -labeled substrate with an H 114 A MhpC mutant, which is able to accept the 6 -phenyl-containing substrate, on a shorter time scale. The direct observation of a gem-diol intermediate provides further evidence that supports a general base mechanism for this family of enzymes. ...|$|R
50|$|Fluxional {{molecules}} are {{molecules that}} undergo dynamics such that {{some or all}} of their atoms interchange between symmetry-equivalent positions. Because virtually all molecules are fluxional in some respects, e.g. bond rotations in most organic compounds, the term fluxional depends on the context and the method used to assess the dynamics. Often, a molecule is considered fluxional if its spectroscopic signature exhibits <b>line-broadening</b> (beyond that dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) due to chemical exchange. In some cases, where the rates are slow, fluxionality is not detected spectroscopically, but by isotopic labeling.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} (named {{after their}} inventors) {{is based on}} the <b>line-broadening</b> and self-reversal of emission lines from HCL when high current is applied. Total absorption is measured with normal lamp current, i.e., with a narrow emission line, and background absorption after application of a high-current pulse with the profile of the self-reversed line, which has little emission at the original wavelength, but strong emission {{on both sides of the}} analytical line. The advantage of this technique is that only one radiation source is used; among the disadvantages are that the high-current pulses reduce lamp lifetime, and that the technique can only be used for relatively volatile elements, as only those exhibit sufficient self-reversal to avoid dramatic loss of sensitivity. Another problem is that background is not measured at the same wavelength as total absorption, making the technique unsuitable for correcting structured background.|$|E

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of O and B Supergiants {{is known to}} be affected by an important extra <b>line-broadening</b> (usually called macroturbulence) that adds to stellar rotation.
