5|$|Beginning in 2003, PEARL {{deemed the}} {{operation}} self-sufficient and reduced {{financial support for}} the Abahuzamugambi Cooperative. The cooperative provided its growers with <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> helped improve living standards and allowed for livestock investments, affordable medical insurance, and education. A cooperative bank was opened in the village in March, enabling farmers to maintain and manage their own funds locally, {{rather than having to}} trek the long distance to Butare.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that he was leaving the company, and shortly thereafter founded a new business, Moelis & Company. As he had when joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> generated investment banking fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included investment banking co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value {{will depend on the}} eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of his}} death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.|$|E

5|$|The {{project is}} funded through an equity {{contribution}} of about USD 200m from Diwaco, a USD 300m grant and a USD 100m stand-by facility from the Jordanian government, {{as well as}} USD 475m in foreign loans to Diwaco. The project's total cost {{is expected to be}} $1.1 billion USD. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has lent USD 250m to Diwaco to support U.S. foreign investment on the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy. The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about USD 100m to Diwaco. The loan package has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation. Much of the government grant supporting the project comes from sovereign soft <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> the government of Jordan has borrowed from the EIB and AFD and passes on as a grant to the project. AFD provided USD 50m for the state grant and USD 48m for the stand-by facility.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, NetBank {{recognized}} {{that there were}} some significant operating deficiencies and started to restructure the company in an effort to resume profitability. The company shut down or sold several businesses. Some of the shuttered companies included FTI, payroll and finance services, non-auto (RV, boat and aircraft) loans and the subprime/non-conforming mortgage companies. The independent auditor, Ernst and Young, resigned in 2006. NetBank's mortgage operations suffered greatly. NetBank normally originated loans and resold the loans to other financial institutions on the open markets. Some of the <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> NetBank sold did not meet the underwriting guidelines and NetBank was forced to repurchase these loans from the other banks. Since the <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> did not meet the underwriting guidelines were often past-due loans, NetBank was forced to repurchase a many failed <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> it had written. This loss of capital was very harmful to the company's equity position and was the first clue to the bank's poor financial position.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to reserve requirements, {{there are other}} required financial ratios that affect the amount of <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> a bank can fund.

25|$|As Geldof {{began to}} learn more about the situation, he {{discovered}} that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was because of repayments on <b>loans</b> <b>that</b> their countries had taken from Western banks.
