François Truffaut, one of French cinema's most iconic directors and a star of Close Encounters, blamed her for that film's budget difficulties, and she was eventually fired during post-production because of her cocaine dependence.|$|E

He reported that he and Garfield tried to stay in character on the sets even between takes.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Carey {{lived with}} her mother Patricia in a small {{apartment}} on Long Island, New York. They were poor and had to move several times as Patricia found different jobs. As a result, Carey frequently transferred into different schools, and {{at the age of}} seventeen, she moved into a small Manhattan studio with other young women to pursue a career in music. She had already begun working on her demo tape with Ben Margulies, a classmate at her school in Huntington, Long Island. During this period, she lived a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> poverty, often sharing a box of spaghetti with her five roommates and wearing torn shoes. She held several jobs, while juggling school, writing, and recording music.|$|E

5|$|At metamorphosis, {{rapid changes}} in the body take place as the <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed {{together}} with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated {{changes in the}} neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> bee-eaters means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshuka Upanishad {{consists}} of a single chapter of five verses. The first verse states that four types of mendicants seek liberation, and these are Kutichaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa and Paramahamsa. The text describes the frugal <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> all four, and asserts that they all pursue their goal of attaining moksha only through yoga practice. The first three mendicant types are mentioned briefly, {{while the majority of}} the text describes the fourth type: Paramahamsa mendicants.|$|E

5|$|Daily life in Mau's {{village on}} Satawal {{involved}} harvesting taro and gathering breadfruit and coconut. The Satawalese people also raised chicken and pork and caught fish, their {{primary source of}} protein. A freshwater pond served as bathing facilities. Local materials were used to construct outrigger canoes called proa. The island's isolation helped preserve the <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> the Satawalese people and Mau's role as a navigator. Even {{with the arrival of}} the Germans (1890) and the Japanese (1914) in Micronesia, Satawalese culture remained intact. American missionaries who arrived after World War II built the first church and school on Satawal.|$|E

The McGinnitys moved to Gallatin County in 1878. Two days {{after the birth of}} their seventh child, Peter died in an accident. At the age of eight, Joe and his older brothers went to work in the mines to support their family. In 1880, the family moved to Springfield, Illinois, where Joe and his brothers worked for the Springfield Coal Company. They moved to Decatur, Illinois less than six months later, continuing to mine coal, while their mother cleaned houses.|$|E

5|$|The music, {{philosophy}} and <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, ridiculous {{to the limit}} of self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much too real.|$|E
5|$|The rivers {{played a}} leading role in the <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of food and a means of {{communication}} and trade. Murray cod and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers. Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes.

5|$|Young Macedonian {{men were}} {{typically}} expected {{to engage in}} hunting and martial combat as a by-product of their transhumance <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> herding livestock such as goats and sheep, while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits. Some Macedonians engaged in farming, often with irrigation, land reclamation, and horticulture activities supported by the Macedonian state. The Macedonian economy and state finances were mainly supported by logging and by mining valuable minerals such as copper, iron, gold, and silver. The conversion of these raw materials into finished products and the sale of those products encouraged the growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic Macedonian lifestyle {{during the course of}} the 5thcenturyBC.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes {{during the}} Druze revolt, the authorities, {{with whom he}} always had a tense relationship, grew wary of his {{strength}} and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid. He was sent to Istanbul by sea and from there he was sent to serve a prison sentence at the Widin fortress on the Danube River. Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the passport and a disguise, he and an Albanian inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached Salonica. From there, Aqil departed to Anatolia and then Aleppo. Aqil resumed his Bedouin <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> raiding and nomadic dwelling.|$|E

5|$|In April 1948, Castro {{traveled}} to Bogotá, Colombia, with a Cuban student group sponsored by President Juan Perón's Argentine government. There, {{the assassination of}} popular leftist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala led to widespread rioting and clashes between the governing Conservatives – backed by the army – and leftist Liberals. Castro joined the Liberal cause by stealing guns from a police station, but subsequent police investigations concluded {{that he had not}} been involved in any killings. Returning to Cuba, Castro became a prominent figure in protests against government attempts to raise bus fares. That year, he married Mirta Díaz Balart, a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> the Cuban elite. The relationship was a love match, disapproved of by both families, but Díaz Balart's father gave them {{tens of thousands of dollars}} to spend on a three-month New York City honeymoon.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor different cultural aspects such as the <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, so it does not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle between life and death. Although leprosy is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him to separate from his family. After learning he does not have leprosy, he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the <b>lifestyle</b> <b>of</b> the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
