The product's implementation utilized UB Ethernet switches, which were modified to add metadata to every packet which indicated which VPN originated the packet. Specialized segmentation and reassembly, which were compatible with Ethernet's spanning tree algorithm, was implemented in each switch to support jumbo packets.

40|$|Abstract. Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), {{as a new}} layer- 2 Virtual Private Network (VPN) {{technology}} has attracted enormous interest in the filed {{during the last few}} years. Unlike traditional <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>VPN,</b> which provides only point-to-point connectivity, VPLS is built for multi-point connectivity and has a broadcast capability like a common LAN. A series of RFCs and drafts related to VPLS have been proposed by IETF. To enable VPLS in a real network, signaling setup is the first step. In this paper, we first conduct some research on LDP-based signaling protocol and demonstrate how to set up control-plane communication in VPLS network. Then, based on the research, we implement the signaling protocol in an embedded router system. In combination with existing data plane software, VPLS is deployed in a real network and some experiments are conducted to test the validity of signaling protocol. All the test results show that the implementation of signaling protocol works quite well. With VPLS deploying more widely in the world, service providers and customers will benefit greatly from this technology...|$|E
40|$|The need of {{multicast}} {{applications such}} as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and dependent financial services require more scalable and reliable MVPN infrastructures. This diversity and breadth of services pose a challenge for operators to create an infrastructure that supports Layer 2 (ATM/Frame relay/Ethernet/PPP) and Layer 3 (IPv 4 /IPv 6) Virtual Private Networks. The difficulty is particularly true for virtual services that require complex control and data plane operations. Another challenge is to support emerging multicast applications incrementally {{on top of the}} existing Layer 3 VPN infrastructure without adding operational complexity. In this thesis, we investigate and analyze several implementation methods of Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) schemes by carrying out tests in a research testbed environment. These schemes are intended for offering multicast services over layer 3 VPN. However, some of these technologies can be tuned to offer multicast services over <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>VPN</b> as well. We also provide tools and tactics on how to implement and evaluate the scalability and performance of two MPVN schemes in IP/MPLS core networks such as Rosen scheme and NG MVPN...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an end-to-end architecture, called VSITE, for seamless integration of cloud resources into an enterprise’s intranet at layer 2. VSITE allows a cloud provider {{to carve out}} its resources to serve multiple enterprises simultaneously while maintaining isolation and security. Resources (allocated to an enterprise) in the cloud provider appears “internal ” to the enterprise. VSITE achieves this abstraction {{through the use of}} VPN technologies, the assignment of different VLANs to different enterprises, and the encoding of enterprise IDs in MAC addresses. Unlike traditional <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>VPN</b> technology such as VPLS, VSITE suppresses layer 2 MAC learning related broadcast traffic. VSITE makes use of location IP (represents location area) for scalable migration support. The MAC or IP address of a VM is not visible in data center core. VSITE has built in security mechanisms to prevent enterprises from attacking one another. Thus, VSITE is scalable, secure and efficient, and it facilitates common data center operation such as VM migration. Because VSITE extends enterprise network at layer 2, this offers transparency to most existing applications and {{presents an}} easy migration path for an enterprise to leverage cloud computing resources. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{explosion}} of high bandwidth applications over Internet has fuelled {{the deployment of}} broadband access by the service providers. Apart from Internet browsing at high speed, the multimedia applications like IP TV, video on demand, distance learning etc are driving the contents over the network to the residential homes. These applications require higher bandwidth. In small and medium enterprises (SME) and corporate sectors, new services like <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>VPN,</b> transparent LAN service, and storage area networks are the main driving applications behind broadband access. The convergence of voice, data and video has caused a paradigm shift from TDM oriented networks to packet based networks. The packet based broadband access networks offer several advantages over TDM based networks in terms of scalability, bandwidth granularity and fast provisioning. On the other hand, legacy TDM networks offer guaranteed quality of service, fast protection and restoration and reliability.

40|$|Many {{reports have}} been written about the {{techniques}} behind Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). They usually deal with the low level design of the software implementing a specific technique. The initial products are usually not mature enough to run in a large network or have to be adjusted in some way to fit. This report investigates the different ways of implementing strict layer 2 Virtual Private Networks in an existing nation-wide Gigabit Ethernet. The infrastructure in use, as well as the hardware, has to be used without major changes. Since 1998 / 1999, when MPLS first started in the laboratories, development has continued. Today it is possible to introduce MPLS or tunneled national virtual local area network into an existing network. This requires high speed, fault tolerant, and stable hardware and software. Going beyond the separation of traffic at layer 3 using Virtual Private Networks, i. e., IPSec, we can tunnel layer 2 traffic through a network. Although the first layer 3 VPN products are already in use, layer 2 VPNs still need to be evaluated and brought into regular use. There are currently two ways of tunneling VLANs in a core network: tunneled VLANs (or as Extreme Networks calls them, VMANs) and MPLS. This project showed {{that it is possible to}} start with a VLAN-only solution, and then upgrade to MPLS to solve scalability issues. The VMAN solution can not be used at Arrowhead, since there are too many disadvantages in the way Extreme Networks has implemented it. However, a mix of tunneling VMAN in a VLAN core is possible, and enables customer tagging of VLANs in a <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>VPN.</b> Furthermore, the testing of EAPS and per-VLAN Spanning Tree Protocol turned out well, and showed that EAPS should not be used when there is more than one loop...|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} {{introduce a}} whole range of challenges to the traditional TCP/IP network, especially Virtual Private Network (VPN). Changing IP address is a difficult issue for VPNs in wireless networks because IP addresses are used as one of the identifiers of a VPN connection and the change of IP addresses will break the original connection. The current solution to this problem is to run VPN tunnels over Mobile IP (MIP). However, Mobile IP itself has significant problems in performance and security and that solution is inefficient due to double tunneling. This thesis proposes and implements a new and novel solution on simulators and real devices to solve the mobility problem in a VPN. The new solution adds mobility support to existing L <b>2</b> TP/IPsec (<b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> Tunneling Protocol/IP Security) tunnels. The new solution tunnels <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> packets between <b>VPN</b> clients and a VPN server without using Mobile IP, without incurring tunnel-re-establishment at handoff, without losing packets during handoff, achieves better security than current mobility solutions for VPN, and supports fast handoff in IPv 4 networks. Experimental results on a VMware simulation showed the handoff time for the VPN tunnel to be 0. 08 seconds, much better than the current method which requires a new tunnel establishment at a cost of 1. 56 seconds. Experimental results with a real network of computers showed the handoff time for the VPN tunnel to be 4. 8 seconds. This delay was mainly caused by getting an IP address from DHCP servers via wireless access points (4. 6 seconds). The time for VPN negotiation was only 0. 2 seconds. The experimental result proves that the proposed mobility solution greatly reduces the VPN negotiation time but getting an IP address from DHCP servers is a large delay which obstructs the real world application. This problem can be solved by introducing fast DHCP or supplying an IP address from a new wireless access point with a strong signal while the current Internet connection is weak. Currently, there is little work on fast DHCP and this may open a range of new research opportunities...|$|R
