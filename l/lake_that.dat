5|$|The {{eruption}} produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a small <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> {{was observed}} in Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.|$|E

5|$|Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} {{at the end of}} the Anarchy but during the revolt of 1173–74 he faced a {{significant}} uprising led by his son, Henry, backed by the French crown. The conflict spread across England and Kenilworth was garrisoned by Henry II's forces; Geoffrey II de Clinton died in this period and the castle was taken fully into royal possession, a sign of its military importance. The Clintons themselves moved on to Buckinghamshire. By this point Kenilworth Castle consisted of the great keep, the inner bailey wall, a basic causeway across the smaller <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> preceded the creation of the Great Mere, and the local chase for hunting.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, John C.

John Fremont's overly glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition. Stansbury also published a formal report of his survey work which became very popular. His report of the area included a discussion of Mormon religious practices based on Stansbury's interaction with the Mormon community in Great Salt Lake City, which had been established three years earlier in 1847.|$|E
5|$|Little {{literary}} evidence survives of {{the activities}} of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians.|$|E

5000|$|A pluvial lake {{is a body}} {{of water}} that {{accumulated}} in a basin because of a greater moisture availability resulting from changes in temperature and/or precipitation.

Pluvial <b>lakes</b> <b>that</b> have since evaporated and dried out may also be referred to as paleolakes.|$|R
5|$|Natives {{incorporated}} the natural {{features of the}} ridgeline and surrounding geography into their spiritual belief systems. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting {{the course of the}} Connecticut River where it suddenly swings east in Middletown, Connecticut, after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating beaver who lived in a great <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> existed in the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the Sleeping Giant, part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth in some of these tales. For instance, the great <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> the giant beaver was said to have inhabited may very well have been the post-glacial Lake Hitchcock, extant 10,000 years ago; the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear–sized beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, that lived at that time. Many features of the Metacomet Ridge region still bear names with Native American origins: Besek, Pistapaug, Coginchaug, Mattabesett, Metacomet, Totoket, Norwottuck, Hockanum, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, and others.|$|E
5|$|Skipsea Castle was a Norman motte and bailey castle {{near the}} village of Skipsea, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Built around 1086 by Drogo de la Beuvrière, {{apparently}} on the remains of an Iron Age mound, it was designed to secure the newly conquered region, defend against any potential Danish invasion and control the trade route across the region leading to the North Sea. The motte and the bailey were separated by Skipsea Mere, an artificial <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> was linked to the sea during the medieval period via a navigable channel. The village of Skipsea grew up beside the castle church, and the fortified town of Skipsea Brough was built alongside the castle around 1160 to capitalise on the potential trade.|$|E
5|$|The Monte Ne resort {{was not a}} {{financial}} success, {{due in part to}} Harvey's failure to adequately manage the resort's funds. All ventures associated with Harvey's original Monte Ne concept either were never completed or experienced bankruptcy, and shortly after his death in 1936, the property was sold off in lots. The remainder of the resort and town was almost completely submerged after Beaver Lake was created in 1964. All that remains today are foundations and one severely vandalized structure. The area on the edge of Beaver <b>Lake</b> <b>that</b> is still referred to as Monte Ne is owned and managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and serves mainly as a boat ramp.|$|E

5|$|The {{direction}} of Oregon stream flow {{is influenced by}} four major drainage divides: the Oregon Coast Range on the west, the Cascade Range further inland, the Klamath–Siskiyou Mountains in the southwest, and the Blue Mountains in the northeast. One set of streams, including the Nehalem River, flows directly into the Pacific Ocean or into larger streams flowing directly to the Pacific; other streams, such as the Deschutes River, flow into the Columbia River or its tributaries. A third set, including the Klamath River and its tributaries, originates in Oregon, but its waters eventually flow into northern California before reaching the ocean. Other streams like the Donner und Blitzen River flow into closed basins, such as Malheur <b>Lake,</b> <b>that</b> have no outlet to the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} largest glacier was the Sherwin or Pre-Tahoe glacier, which eroded the upper Merced {{watershed}} {{to an extent}} close to its present form. Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation; these were the Tahoe, Tenaya and Tioga stages, of which the Tioga was the smallest. The Tioga glacier left {{at the mouth of}} Yosemite Valley a rocky moraine. This moraine was actually one of several moraines deposited by the four glaciations, which include Medial Moraine and Bridalveil Moraine. After the Tioga Glacier retreated this moraine formed a <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> flooded nearly the entire valley. Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite, creating a broad and flat valley floor. Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then, helping to form the flat floor of the Central Valley.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{was active}} again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918, before its next major {{eruption}} in 1918–1919. Halemaumau, then a small upwelling in the caldera floor, was {{topped by a}} lava <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> then drained, before refilling again, forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching {{the top edge of}} the caldera before draining once more. This activity eventually gave way to the construction of Mauna Iki, building up the large lava shield within the caldera over a period of eight months. The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of lava fountaining.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, the segment of modern NY38A between its southern terminus in Moravia and NY359 in Skaneateles was designated as part of NY26, a northsouth highway extending from Ithaca to Syracuse. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY26 was split into several routes. From Dryden to Moravia, NY26 became part of NY38. Between Moravia and modern NY359, it became the southern half of the new NY38A, an alternate route of NY38 around the east side of Owasco <b>Lake</b> <b>that</b> continued from the current NY359 junction to Auburn by way of a previously unnumbered roadway.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi {{arrived on}} the western shore of Lake Petén Itzá with his {{soldiers}} on 26 February 1697. Once there they built a heavily armed galeota attack boat, which carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces. On 10 March, Ursúa received a mixed Itza and Yalain embassy in peace, and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day, Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the <b>lake.</b> <b>That</b> morning, a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital. The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. After the battle the surviving defenders swam across to the mainland and melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy the abandoned town. Martín de Ursúa renamed Nojpetén as Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). Kan Ek' was soon captured {{with help from the}} Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu; The Kowoj king was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a <b>lake</b> <b>that</b> they can use as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) {{falls in love with}} the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E
