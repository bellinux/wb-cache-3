5|$|As {{part of the}} {{construction}} works for the atmospheric-propulsion system, the world's first railway flyover was constructed {{at the north end}} of Portland Road, to carry the new atmospheric <b>line</b> <b>over</b> the conventional steam line below. In 1847, the atmospheric propulsion experiment was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} contract between the THSR {{and the government}} consisted of two parts: part one was the ’s construction and operation of the High Speed Rail <b>Line</b> <b>over</b> the next 35 year; part two was 's keeping the right of development of the areas around five stations for 50 years, including the Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, and Tainan Stations.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 the centenary of {{the branch}} saw a revival of {{interest}} in the <b>line.</b> <b>Over</b> the weekends of 1–2 and 8–9 July special services were run between Watford and Chesham, using two preserved Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives and a former MR electric locomotive. The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on the trains and large numbers of people travelling to the area to watch the trains. The success prompted LT to repeat the Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production <b>line.</b> <b>Over</b> 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} {{over a three-year}} period from 1925. The project was not originally planned to take as long, but there were delays due to problems with a contractor, and industrial action. The bridge was designed to carry the Mildura railway <b>line</b> <b>over</b> the Murray River and into New South Wales, to service significant cross-border traffic arising from the fruit-growing industry, but the line was never extended beyond the terminus at Yelta. The bridge currently carries a single lane of road controlled by traffic lights.|$|E
5|$|When the Orange Line was {{originally}} constructed in 1977, foundations for the bridges {{to carry the}} Silver <b>Line</b> <b>over</b> I-66 to the median of the Dulles Access Road were built up to ground level. These foundations included steel piles that were driven {{into the ground and}} capped with concrete. However, detailed records for these original foundations were lost. As a result, engineers asked for the foundations to be inspected by digging around them to determine the condition of each pile under the concrete foundation caps.|$|E

Between these <b>lines,</b> <b>over</b> 200 different designs have been released, some several times over. Several companies outside of Takara-Tomy have produced Zoids kits. This has led to Zoids being made as die-cast figures, highly detailed posing kits, smaller action figures and even PVC figurines.|$|R

5|$|After Bullecourt, the 4th Brigade withdrew to Ribemont, where {{reinforcements}} {{brought it}} up to strength. During this period, Murray oversaw musketry training before being granted convalescent leave to London in May. While in the capital, he was decorated with his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Service Order by King George V in Hyde Park on 2 June 1917. Promoted major on 12 July, he rejoined his battalion later in the month, and during the 4th Brigade's advance to the Hindenburg <b>Line</b> <b>over</b> subsequent months, was involved in actions at Messines, Ploegstreert Wood, Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele. For his actions at Passchendaele, Murray garnered a mention in Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's dispatch of 7 November 1917.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in <b>line.</b> <b>Over</b> the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT <b>line</b> <b>over</b> McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local track merges into the southbound express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's bidirectional center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver Yard of the Coney Island Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on Coney Island.|$|E

5|$|Just outside Athol Springs, NY75 passes {{under two}} {{railroad}} bridges, carrying the Norfolk Southern Railway-owned Lake Erie District {{line and the}} CSX Transportation-owned Lake Shore Subdivision <b>line</b> <b>over</b> the highway. On {{the other side of}} the overpasses, NY75 curves northeastward as it becomes Saint Francis Drive, leaving Camp Road to continue northwestward to the lake as a two-lane street. The route continues on, passing south of Saint Francis High School before ending shortly afterward at a partial interchange with NY5. NY75 northbound merges directly into NY5 eastbound, a limited-access highway, while NY75 southbound begins as an offshoot of NY5 westbound. The remaining connections are made by way of a loop road leading from Big Tree Road, which NY5 and NY75 both intersect just south of the interchange.|$|E
5|$|The halt was {{approached}} {{from the road}} by a path leading up the embankment on which the railway ran. To the west, a bridge carried the <b>line</b> <b>over</b> Northrepps Road from where it proceeded on another embankment before reaching Cromer Tunnel which was built by the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway to take the line under the Great Eastern's Cromer High to Norwich route. Although only 61 yards long, the tunnel is notable as being {{one of only two}} standard gauge tunnels anywhere in Norfolk, the other being Barsham Tunnel on the Wells-on-Sea branch. However, as Barsham Tunnel was opened out before 1912, Cromer Tunnel is actually the only tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} was mobilised in August 1914 in the 1st South Western Mounted Brigade, but did {{not proceed}} to France until December 1915. In May 1916, two squadrons joined the XV Corps cavalry unit, with two further squadrons joining IX Corps Cavalry regiment. During 1916–17, duties mainly involved policing, traffic control, despatch riding and similar activities. In March 1917, the regiment played its only part in the War as horsed cavalry, during the German retreat to the Hindenburg <b>Line.</b> <b>Over</b> an eleven-day period, German forces retreated 20–25 miles to prepared positions. The RWY formed part of the advanced guard of the British Army, attempting {{to keep in touch}} with the German rearguards, but this was difficult owing to the broken nature of the ground behind the original German lines. Contact was made several times with Uhlans and a lance captured in one of these engagements is still in possession of the regiment.|$|E

5|$|Easter Road staged {{its first}} Scottish League match when Hibs joined {{the league in}} 1893. Hibs were only renting Easter Road, which Edinburgh city {{planners}} had designated for future development. This meant the club were unwilling to develop the ground and looked for alternatives. Hibs considered relocating to Aberdeen in 1902, a year before Aberdeen FC was formed by a merger of three local clubs. In 1909, work began on a potential new ground in the Piershill area of Ednburgh, but the North British Railway company won a court order allowing them to build a railway <b>line</b> <b>over</b> the ground. No line was ever built, but Hibs' interest in moving to the site was thwarted. The long-term future of Easter Road was only secured in 1922, when the club agreed a 25-year lease on the ground. Two years later, three banks of terraces were raised, while a main stand seating 4,480 people {{was built on the}} west side of the ground. The redeveloped stadium had a capacity of 45,000. The pitch was also moved 40 yards to the east, providing space for the main stand. The slope was reduced to approximately 6 feet as part of this work.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 22 March, German attacks {{continued}} to push back the remaining units of the 66th Division, now supported by the 1st Cavalry Division {{and a handful of}} tanks. The composite force managed a fighting retreat, with most units avoiding encirclement. Shortly after noon the remnants of the division were ordered to retreat behind the 50th (Northumbrian) Division, which were preparing fresh defences on the original Green Line {{along the edge of the}} rear zone. The 66th Division retreated through the new defensive line by 4:00 pm, with the aid of the 5th Durham Light Infantry (DLI), which had been temporarily transferred to support them and the 50th Division took over the front <b>line.</b> <b>Over</b> the following days, the divisions of XIX Corps fell back towards the line of the River Somme, where the 66th Division (plus the 5th DLI) took up positions on the west bank of the river around Barleux and Foucaucourt-en-Santerre, west of Peronne. On 24 March, the German army crossed the Somme and the 2/8th Lancashire Fusiliers counter-attacked the bridgeheads without success but continued to hold a line close to the river. Expecting a follow-up attack the next day, 149th Brigade was temporarily attached to 66th Division and both units were slowly pushed back from the banks of the Somme, withdrawing to Assevillers as night fell on 25 March.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Battalion {{was back}} in action on 22–23 August as the Allied advance {{continued}} north of Proyart. The 10th Battalion was in a supporting role protecting the flank of the 1st Brigade. Wilder-Neligan visited the neighbouring battalion, and upon learning of some difficulties due to German positions in a wood, immediately deployed two companies to clear the area, and due to his initiative the advance was able to continue. The 10th Battalion continued in the advance towards the Hindenburg outpost <b>line</b> <b>over</b> {{the next few days}} before being relieved {{for a short period of}} training and rest. On 18 September, the battalion saw its last fighting of the war during the capture of the Hindenburg outpost line south of the village of Villeret. In heavy fighting, the unit captured the second and third objectives, and were then relieved and went into a period of training and rest. By this point, the battalion had been reduced to a strength of 517 men. On 10 October, Wilder-Neligan was awarded the French Croix de guerre. He was mentioned in despatches for the fifth and final time on 8 November. After the Armistice of 11 November, Wilder-Neligan remained with his battalion until 1 January 1919. He returned to Australia in July, arriving in Brisbane in September. For his service during the war, in addition to the decorations already mentioned, Wilder-Neligan was awarded the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.|$|E
