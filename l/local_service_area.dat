Therefore, {{there are two}} types of service requests to the DC, i. e., new requests (NRs) initiated in the <b>local</b> <b>service</b> <b>area</b> and migration requests (MRs) generated when mobile users move across service areas. A novel resource management scheme is proposed to help {{the resource}} manager decide whether to accept the service requests (NRs or MRs) or not and determine how much resources should be allocated to each service (if accepted). The optimization objective is to maximize the average system reward and keep the rejection probability of service requests under a certain threshold.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} for estimating {{the size of}} the market for a city-pair route at an airport from both the demand and supply sides of air transportation. The average airport access cost, average passenger delay cost, and average airline operating cost all either increase or decrease with an increase in the market size of a city-pair route at an airport, so the optimum market size can be determined from trade-offs among these costs. A nonlinear mathematical programming problem is formulated to determine the optimal number of passengers, the <b>local</b> <b>service</b> <b>area</b> of a city-pair market and to perform sensitivity analyses. The results show that long-haul services ought to be concentrated in one large airport, while short-haul services might be dispersed among many small airports. Improvements in the technology of the airport access mode or increases in the average income of the cities served can expand the market size and service area, but at a declining expansion rate. In metropolitan areas with high population density, airlines can operate more efficiently and distribute air services among more airports. City-pair markets with stable passenger demand, or markets served by airlines with efficient scheduling technology are shown to exhibit high cost efficiencies. ...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{the main}} {{standard}} {{around the world}} for digital terrestrial TV broadcasting is Digital Video Broadcast- Terrestrial (DVB-T). Most of DVB-T networks deployments have been designed for fixed rooftop antennas and high transmission capacity, without providing good coverage level for vehicular mobile reception. These networks also make use of either a Single Frequency Network (SFN) or a Multi Frequency Network (MFN), but none of these topologies is ideally suited for delivery of both global and <b>local</b> <b>services</b> in an efficiently way. This article discusses the use of the hierarchical modulation, the Scalable Video Coding (SVC), antenna diversity reception, Application Layer Forward Error Correction (AL-FEC) and time slicing techniques for the optimization of DVB-T networks in two different issues: the provision of mobile digital television in vehicles and the transmission of <b>local</b> <b>services</b> in SFN topologies.

ABSTRACT: Tuberculosis {{remains a}} problem in Lukhanji <b>Local</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Area</b> (LSA) where the number of {{patients}} notified to authorities is reportedly increasing. This study, undertaken at various clinics in Lukhanji LSA, shows that non-adherence to TB treatment remains a challenge. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the main factors contributing to this situation and to make recommendations. Methods: This was an unmatched case-control observational study using the data relating to patients undergoing treatment. The collection of data took place from December 2010 to June 2011. Two groups were studied: (i) those who did not adhere and (ii) those who did adhere to the prescribed treatment. The data from these two groups was compared. Prevalence of non-adherence was determined. In addition, the prevalence of factors studied were estimated and odds ratios were used to determine factors significantly associated with non-adherence. Results: Data was obtained from 195 patients, 98 (50. 26 %) of whom were non-adherent and 97 (49. 74 %) adherent. The following factors were significantly associated with non-adherence to TB treatment in this community: loss of hope; school or work commitments; patients' marital status; patients' under arrest; lack of support; involvement in drug abuse; TB denial and tablets not available from the clinics. For these factors, the odds ratios were more than one indicating that these factors are more likely to contribute to non-adherence in the non-adherent group Conclusion: The prevalence of factors contributing to non-adherence to TB treatment in this community is high. This was despite the fact that there is no charge TB drug. There is an urgent need for health authorities in this community to take strong action to improve patients' adherence to TB treatment.

40|$|Antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{is slowly}} rolling out across South Africa, but {{coverage}} is highly variable between and within provinces. The chronic shortage {{of health care}} workers is recognised {{as one of the}} major bottlenecks to scaling up treatment, and this has the biggest impact in rural areas where the human resource crisis is most acute. For the past three years Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) has been supporting a programme to provide care and treatment for people with HIV/AIDS in the <b>local</b> <b>service</b> <b>area</b> of Lusikisiki, a subdistrict of 150 000 inhabitants in the Eastern Cape serviced by one hospital and 12 clinics. Lusikisiki represents one of the poorest and most densely populated rural areas of South Africa. Less than half the population live in formal housing and up to 80 % live below the poverty line. With just 5 doctors per 100 000 people, Lusikisiki is 14 times below the national average and less than the average for Sierra Leone, DRC and Zimbabwe. An assessment done by MSF in early 2003 found that electricity was only available in a third of clinics and the supply of electricity was unreliable in half of those; only 8 % had running water or a phone, and half lacked nursing accommodation. Drug supply management was a major problem, with up to 60 Essential Drugs List drugs missing at some clinics. Around half of all nursing posts were (and remain) vacant, and a chronic lack of auxiliary staff meant an increased burden of tasks that further limited direct patient care. Nevertheless, the implementation of HIV care at the primary care level, through task shifting, community mobilisation, and the use of volunteers, has allowed the rapid scale-up of treatment even in this understaffed and poorly equipped setting. Within 2 weeks of the National Operational Plan for Comprehensive HIV Care being launched in October 2003, the first person was initiated on ART, and in less than 3 years, by October 2006, there were almost 2 200 people on antiretrovirals (ARVs), including 110 children. This paper describes how the integration of HIV care and treatment including ART into primary health care in Lusikisiki managed to overcome the challenges of working in a resource-poor rural area to achieve good coverage and outcomes in a relatively short space of tim...|$|E
40|$|This Note explores options {{available}} to decisionmakers by analyzing Chesapeake 2 ̆ 6 Potomac Telephone Co. v. United States (C 2 ̆ 6 P), which set an important precedent regarding a telephone company 2 ̆ 7 s First Amendment right to provide video programming over its own facilities in its <b>local</b> <b>service</b> <b>area.</b> C 2 ̆ 6 P, a Bell Atlantic Corporation subsidiary providing local telephone service in Northern Virginia, claimed that the cable-telco cross-ownership ban, codified at § 533 (b) of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, infringes unconstitutionally upon its First Amendment right to freedom of expression. On November 21, 1994, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the Eastern District Court of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s decision that § 533 (b) is unconstitutional under the First Amendment {{because it is not}} narrowly tailored. As a result of its holding, the district court enjoined the federal government from applying § 533 (b) to prohibit C 2 ̆ 6 P from transmitting over its own lines its own video programming. This Note argues that these courts should have found § 533 (b) to be narrowly tailored because the statute is a reasonable method for Congress to address a significant problem: anticompetitive behavior in the telecommunications industry. To support this conclusion, this Note explores the antitrust concerns underlying the cross-ownership ban. Before reaching this antitrust analysis, however, Part II summarizes the background of the C 2 ̆ 6 P case by discussing the significance of an interactive information highway, reviewing the regulatory history of the telecommunications industry and reporting the facts specific to C 2 ̆ 6 P. Part III traces the C 2 ̆ 6 P courts 2 ̆ 7 First Amendment conclusion that § 533 (b), the cross-ownership ban, is not narrowly tailored. Part IV, the primary focus of this Note, analyzes potential anticompetitive behavior by telcos in the noninteractive and interactive video programming transmission markets, according to the antitrust doctrine of essential facilities. Part V presents three recommendations: (i) emphasize the role of interactivity in making judicial and legislative decisions about the information highway, (ii) in C 2 ̆ 6 P and Other similar cases, courts should defer to Congress, especially considering the complexity of the facts pertinent to telecommunications reform, and (iii) to regulate the structure of telecommunications companies, apply the generally- applicable antitrust laws, which are less vulnerable to First Amendment challenges than industry-specific legislation, such as § 533 (b) ...|$|E
