40|$|In age {{and growth}} studies, many species seem {{to follow a}} {{different}} growth trajectory than the traditionally applied von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM). To test a methodology for improving growth modeling in poorly studied chondrichthyans, 568 <b>longnose</b> <b>spurdogs</b> of Mediterranean origin were aged. A set of seven growth models were fitted to the obtained age-length data. Comparisons in growth model accuracy based on the Akaike Information Criterion allowed {{the assessment of the}} best model. In the case that no model fitted the data correctly, a multi-model inference (MMI) was carried out based on model averaging. The results provided evidence that the growth parameters inferred with the VBGM should be used with caution. JRC. G. 3 -Maritime affair...|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} spurdog {{of the genus}} Squalus occur in the Gulf of Gabès (southern Tunisia, central Mediterranean) : the <b>longnose</b> <b>spurdog</b> Squalus blainvillei (Risso, 1827) and a short-snout spurdog of the Squalus megalops-cubensis group. Morphometric and meristic data {{as well as a}} genetic {{analyses}} (DNA inter-simple sequence repeat markers and molecular barcoding methods) support the assignation of this short-snout spurdog to Squalus megalops (Macleay, 1881). Squalus megalops occurs commonly in temperate and tropical Australian waters, and is also thought to occur in the eastern Atlantic, southern Indian Ocean and western North Pacific although these records need to be confirmed. Our study confirms that it occurs in the Mediterranean Sea. Populations of both S. blainvillei and S. megalops are described based on Tunisian material...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAge, growth, longevity, natural {{mortality}} and size and age at maturity of the <b>longnose</b> <b>spurdog,</b> Squalus blainvillei, in the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea) are reported. Marginal increment suggested annual band formation. Age estimates ranged from 3 to 15 and 4 to 19 years {{for males and}} females, respectively. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters derived from length at age data were: L-infinity = 105. 7 cm, K = 0. 11 year(- 1), t(0) = - 1. 12 year for females and L-infinity = 91. 1 cm, K = 0. 14 year(- 1), t(0) = - 1. 42 year for males. Males and females reached maturity at 52. 3 cm and 62. 5 cm TL corresponding to 4. 97 and 7. 44 years, respectively. Longevity estimates were 24. 75 and 31. 50 years for males and females, respectively. Based on life history parameters, natural mortality estimation M ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 33...|$|E
40|$|The small-spotted {{catshark}} (Scyliorhinus canicula) (Linnaeus, 1758) and the <b>longnose</b> <b>spurdog</b> (Squalus blainville) (Risso, 1826) are {{two species}} {{occurring in the}} European and western African continental shelves with a wide geographical distribution. In this study, the diet of S. blainville and S. canicula off the Portuguese western Atlantic coast was investigated in 2006 by collecting monthly samples of these two species from local fishing vessels. In the stomachs of both species, crustaceans and teleosts were the dominant prey items, and molluscs, polychaetes, echinoderms, and sipunculids were found in lower abundance. In S. canicula, urochordate and chondrichthyan species were also observed in stomachs and were classified as accidental prey items. Scyliorhinus canicula consumed a broader group of prey items than did S. blainville. A significant diet overlap was observed, despite both species occupying different depth ranges over the continental shelf. Scyliorhinus canicula exhibited a consistency in diet composition among seasons, sexes, and maturity stages. Nonetheless, for both adults and juveniles, an increase in relative abundance of teleosts in the diet was observed {{in the spring and}} summer. This study provides evidence of the importance of S. canicula and S. blainville as benthic and pelagic predators along the western Atlantic coast...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of fisheries and globalized trade are emerging as the principal drivers of coastal and ocean threat. Considering {{the important role of}} Chondrichthyes as predators at the top of food chain in marine ecosystems, knowledge on their biology remains scarce in the Mediterranean. In this regard, our objective is to give information on their spatial distribution, abundance and population structure. Data were collected for 25 demersal species, including batoid species, sharks and holocephalans from 1994 to 2013 during scientific bottom trawl surveys (MEDITS project) carried out around the Sardinian seas. The total frequency of occurrence (f%), the Biomass Index (BI, kg/km 2), and the Density Index (DI, N/km 2) were estimated for the continental shelf (10 - 200 m), slope (200 - 800 m), and overall (10 - 800 m) depth strata. Size trends were also calculated for the most abundant species considering all depth strata. The correlation among MEDITS figures (f%, BI, DI, size structure) and years were assessed by species computing the Pearson linear coefficient. From f% and abundance indexes investigation, only the small spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula and the thornback ray Raja clavata were ubiquitous in all strata investigated, instead, all the other species showed a preferential distribution for the shelf or the slope. In general, the temporal trends of BI and DI were stable or positive for both macro-strata, except for the <b>longnose</b> <b>spurdog</b> Squalus blainville which seemed to show a statistically significant decreasing trend. All analyzed species displayed temporal stable trends in size structure analysis, apart from Raja brachyura and Dipturus oxyrinchus that showed a statistically significant increase. Despite the time series analysis revealed stable or positive trends, it appears clear the need of urgent management measures to protect the demersal chondrichthyan species extending the monitoring over time and implementing the data collected by scientific and commercial trawl surveys...|$|E
40|$|Aging chondrichthyans {{has been}} {{characterized}} as a slow and difficult process, {{but at the same}} time it is considered of fundamental importance for the holistic management and conservation of their populations. This study aims to assess the age and growth of the <b>longnose</b> <b>spurdog</b> S. blainville, to correlate the results to the species’ biological features and to compare them with those reported in previous studies that used different aging methods. By counting the growth bands on the enamel surface of the dorsal fin spines, age was estimated in 569 out of 810 individuals that were taken as by-catch from commercial fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea during an 8 -year period. Spine morphometrics revealed sexual dimorphism as far as spine length, spine base width and spine weight are concerned. The between-sex differences were also reflected in the length-weight relationships, in the gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indices, and in the condition factor (K). All three somatic indices differed significantly among maturity stages, seasons or age classes. The reproducibility of the age readings was considered high based on the estimated CV and APE precision indices. Age bias plots also indicated no significant intra- and small inter-reader variation. The estimated VBGF parameters were: L∞ = 1097. 3 mm, k = 0. 03 yr− 1 and t 0 = − 5. 58 yrs for females, and L∞ = 665. 5 mm, k = 0. 08 yr− 1 and t 0 = − 3. 35 yrs for males. Likelihood ratio tests showed that all growth parameters were statistically significantly different between sexes (2 = 38. 26, df = 3, P < 0. 001). Females reached higher longevity (28 yrs) than males (22 yrs) and attained maturity at higher age and larger size (T 50 = 17 yrs and L 50 = 568. 1 mm) than males did (T 50 = 11. 3 yrs and L 50 = 460. 6 mm). S. blainville seems to be a long-lived shark of slow growth and late maturity, a combination of traits indicating a species of great vulnerability to fishing pressure that can only sustain a low harvest rate...|$|E
