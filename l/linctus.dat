40|$|THESIS 6914 Methadone is a long-acting opiate {{commonly}} used in substitution therapy for heroin addiction. In Ireland, prior to 1998, people requiring treatment for opiate addiction could either attend the National Drug Treatment Centre, where low dose, short-term methadone treatment was available, or they could attend {{a limited number of}} private general practitioners (GPs), who were prepared to prescribe methadone <b>linctus</b> (Physeptone?). In 1998, the Misuse of Drugs Act {Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations were introduced and resulted in the implementation of the Methadone Protocol Scheme (MPS). Under the MPS only methadone 1 mg/ml could be prescribed for the treatment of opiate addiction and free prescribing and dispensing services were made available to all. This research project set out to examine, for the first time, the extent and nature of pharmaceutical services for patients in methadone treatment in Ireland before and after the introduction of the MPS. It examines this aspect of the MPS from the perspective of both service providers and service users, using both quantitative and qualitative research techniques...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cough is {{a common}} and {{distressing}} symptom in lung cancer patients. The clinical management of cough in lung cancer patients is suboptimal with limited high quality research evidence available. The aim of the present paper is to present a clinical guideline developed in the UK through scrutiny of the literature and expert opinion, in order to aid decision making in clinicians and highlight good practice. Methods Two systematic reviews, one focusing on the management of cough in respiratory illness and one Cochrane review specifically on cancer, were conducted. Also, data from reviews, phase II trials and case studies were synthesized. A panel of {{experts in the field}} was also convened in an expert consensus meeting {{to make sense of the}} data and make clinical propositions. Results A pyramid of cough management was developed, starting with the treatment of reversible causes of cough/specific pathology. Initial cough management should focus on peripherally acting and intermittent treatment; more resistant symptoms require the addition of (or replacement by) centrally acting and continuous treatment. The pyramid for the symptomatic management starts from the simpler and most practical regimens (demulcents, simple <b>linctus)</b> to weak opioids to morphine and methadone before considering less well-researched and experimental approaches. Conclusion The clinical guidelines presented aim to provide a sensible clinical approach to the management of cough in lung cancer. High quality research in this field is urgently required to provide more evidence-based recommendations. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is a {{disruptive}} and exhausting symptom, {{reported as}} very distressing {{in a quarter}} of those in their last year of life. Existing guidelines for management of chronic cough primarily deal with the commonest benign causes of cough: asthma; eosinophilic bronchitis; gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; rhinosinusitis. AIM/DESIGN: to examine what literature evidence exists and formulate recommendations for managing chronic cough in patients with advanced, progressive, life-limiting illnesses. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar); hand-search; grey literature. RESULTS: Of 11 initially eligible studies, 5 provided evidence at level 2 or better. The small size of these studies, heterogeneity of study population and diversity of interventions and outcome measures used meant that comparison across studies and compilation of guidelines based on high-quality evidence was not possible. Pragmatic recommendations based on available evidence were formulated, drawing on the included studies and, in addition, extrapolating from two other well-designed studies involving patients with chronic cough. They also took into consideration convenience, toxicity and minimizing burden and harm of intervention, as well as considering the potential for disease-directed treatment {{and the possibility of}} pharmacological and co-existing benign causes of chronic cough. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations (Grade D) include simple <b>linctus,</b> therapeutic trial of sodium cromoglycate and then prescription of an opioid or opioid derivative (dextromethorphan, morphine or codeine). Further research is clearly and urgently required in this area for more effective approaches to managing cough, tested in trials that have sufficient size, power and validity...|$|E
40|$|Cough is a {{distressing}} symptom {{in patients}} with cancer and difficult to manage in practice. Hence, {{the aim of this}} review is to assess and synthesise the available literature in the management of cough in cancer patients, in order to improve on practice recommendations. Studies with chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. An extensive literature search yielded 17 studies for evaluation. Eight of them were about the use of brachytherapy (a technique were a radiation source is placed inside the bronchus in the lung or next to the area requiring treatment), use of laser resection or photodynamic therapy (a treatment that uses a drug plus a special type of light to kill cancer cells). Nine more studies assessed the effects of a number of different medication, including codeine and morphine. Overall, the research was of poor quality with significant methodological problems, hence no credible evidence is available in the literature to guide practice. Acknowledging these limitations, brachytherapy was found to be helpful in a variety of radiation doses in selected patients. Also some pharmacological treatments were found to be helpful particularly with regards to morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, levodropropizine, sodium cromoglycate and butamirate citrate <b>linctus</b> (a cough syrup), although all studies had significant risk of bias and some reported side effects. No practice recommendations could be drawn from this review. There is an urgent need to increase the number and quality of studies evaluating the effects of interventions in the management of cough in cance...|$|E
40|$|Virechana (therapeutic purgation) is {{a common}} {{procedure}} that is widely practiced among the panchakarma treatments (pentad treatments). Various Virechaka dravyas (purgative drugs) have been described for Virechana. Even after critical analysis of Virechaka dravyas in the literature, still there is difficulty in the fixation of dose. Hence, the retrospective analysis of varied outcomes of Virechana with Danti (Baliospermum montanum) avaleha (<b>linctus)</b> is discussed in this paper. The study included twenty-seven case reports of patients who were administered Virechana with Danti avaleha. These case reports are of patients suffering from various ailments such as irregular menstrual cycles, polycystic ovarian syndrome, primary and secondary infertility, and psoriasis. Danti avaleha was administered at dose of 10 g and 5 g in the Krura (~strong) and Madhyama (~moderate/normal) Koshta (~GI tract) patients, respectively. Among seven Krura koshta patients, three of them resulted with Pravara (excellent) Shuddhi and other four resulted with Madhyama (medium) Shuddhi. In twenty Madhyama koshta patients, sixteen of them resulted with avara (minimum) Shuddhi and remaining four patients resulted with Madhyama shuddhi. Complications like Udara shoola (spasmodic pain of abdomen) and Vamana (emesis) were observed during Virechana. Majority of the patients suffered with Udara shoola were of Madhyama koshta. Vamana was seen in both Krura and Madhyama koshta patients. Irrespective {{of the type of}} Shuddhi and complications, all the patients resulted with Samyak Kaphaantiki Virikta lakshana (signs of perfect purgation with end expulsion of Kapha). The study concluded that the Krura koshta patients were tolerable for dose of 10 g and are expected to attain Pravara Shuddhi. Whereas Madhyama koshta patients were intolerable even to mild dose of 5 g, producing Avara shuddhi...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{and management of}} chronic respiratory symptoms was studied in all adults aged 40 - 70 years in a group general practice. A respiratory symptoms screening questionnaire was sent to 2387 men and women, of whom 1444 (85 % {{of those who had}} not moved or died) responded. The 509 subjects reporting symptoms were sent a detailed questionnaire and invited to have their respiratory function tested. Of these, 324 (64 %) responded, of whom 256 (79 %) had spirometry. A diagnosis of chronic bronchitis was reported by 3. 9 % of the men and 2. 1 % of the women, and a diagnosis of asthma by 4. 7 % of the men and 3. 3 % of the women. Wheezing in the preceding year was reported by 18 % of the men and 15 % of the women, and 16. 7 % of the men and 7. 1 % of the women satisfied the Medical Research Council criteria for chronic bronchitis. Bronchodilator treatment was being taken by 12 % of the patients with symptoms, regular cough <b>linctus</b> by 10 %, and regular antibiotics by 5 %. After the frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms had been controlled for wheezing patients reporting a diagnosis of asthma were prescribed bronchodilatory drugs three times more often than those labelled as having chronic bronchitis and 12 times more often than those without a diagnostic label. Eleven per cent of general practitioner consultations resulted in a referral to hospital. Referral was unrelated to the diagnosis given, but depended on the degree of respiratory disability and handicap experienced by the patient. Our findings confirm the relevance of the diagnostic label to the drug management of chronic wheezing disorders, but further investigation of the diagnostic process is needed to establish why some patients with severe wheeze remain untreated...|$|E

We investigated medicine use practices in management of symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections among children (≤ 12  years) in households in Nakawa division, Kampala city. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 390 randomly selected children. Data on use of medicines in children (≤ 12  years) during recent episode of acute upper respiratory tract infection was collected from their care takers using an interviewer administered questionnaire. A recall period of two weeks (14  days) was used in during data collection. Results The prevalence of giving children non-prescription antimicrobial medicines was 44. 8 % (38. 3 - 52. 2). The most common disease symptoms that the children reportedly had included flu, 84. 9 % (331 / 390), cough, 83. 1 % (324 / 390), and undefined fever, 69. 7 % (272 / 390). Medicines commonly given to children included, paracetamol 53. 1 % (207 / 390), Coartem 29. 7 % (116 / 390), cough <b>linctus</b> 20. 8 % (81 / 390), amoxicillin 18. 9 % (74 / 390), Co-trimoxazole 18. 5 % (72 / 390), and diphenhydramine 15. 4 % (60 / 390). The major sources of medicines given to the children was hospital/clinic, 57. 26 % (223 / 390). Most of the children, 81 % were given more than one medicine at a time. The majority, 62. 3 % (243 / 390) of the care takers who gave the children medicine during the recent illness were not aware of any medicine (s) that should not be given to children. The predictors of non-prescription use of antimicrobial medicines in managing symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections in children included, medicines obtained from drug shop (PR: 1. 45, CI: 1. 14 - 1. 85), medicines at home (PR: 1. 8, CI: 0. 83 - 1. 198) and type of medicine (antimalarial) (PR: 2. 8, CI: 1. 17 - 6. 68).
