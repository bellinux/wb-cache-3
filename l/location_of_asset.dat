We argue that it is the combination of asset poverty and exclusion (market and social) that generates the poverty traps that allow ‘natural ’ shocks to create the irreversibilities that make social protection so important. Knowledge of the nature and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> thresholds is essential to effective design of productive safety nets and social protection. Over the longer term, policy needs to both reduce the impact of exogenous risk (through technological change or insurance devices) and to reduce exclusion from available social and market-mediated risk management devices...|$|E

40|$|Real-Time Locating Systems (RTLS) {{belong to}} a class of {{locating}} systems capable of remotely determining the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> tagged <b>assets</b> in an environment within {{a relatively short time}} frame (real-time). Signals from tags are received wirelessly by readers, which use information about the signal, to continuously determine the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the tag relative to each reader. Using readers positioned at several locations around a tag offers multiple location readings, which can be compiled together at a central host to estimate the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> a tag in a two or three dimensional space. Location information from several vantage points also reduces the chance <b>of</b> false <b>location</b> estimates <b>of</b> a tag when one or more readers' location estimates contain some error. Indoor asset tracking is a unique specialty of many types of RTLS, as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have difficulty providing asset locations within buildings. RTLS deployments generally address the problems <b>of</b> determining the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> equipment and products in a warehouse or even tracking employees and files in an office. The most common RTLS uses a Wi-Fi infrastructure to determine the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> tagged <b>assets.</b> These systems employ Time-of-Arrival (ToA) or Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) techniques to wirelessly determine asset location. Scaling up a system that uses a Wi-Fi infrastructure to localize large numbers of tags introduces a significant wireless traffic burden, reducing data throughput for other users of the same Wi-Fi network. Both ToA and RSSI methods of localization suffer from significant inaccuracies in reported <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and often are unable to determine which room an asset resides. This thesis presents a new method for determining asset location that offers better accuracy than systems using ToA and RSSI techniques, and an RTLS that uses existing Wi-Fi infrastructures and commercial off-the-shelf parts (COTS) without placing excessive need on the Wi-Fi networks...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive {{security}} systems aim to protect critical {{assets in the}} face of changes in their operational environment. We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment’s topology enables reasoning on the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive {{security systems}} by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configu- ration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment - including <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated using a substantive example concerned with physical access control...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on the international <b>location</b> decisions <b>of</b> U. S. financial services firms. The Act included rule changes that made it substantially more difficult for U. S. firms to defer U. S. taxes on overseas financial services income held in low-tax jurisdictions. These same rule changes were not applied to other forms of income; in particular, income generated from active manufacturing operations was still eligible for deferral after the Act. We use information from the tax returns of U. S. corporations to examine how local taxes affect the allocation <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> held abroad. We find that, before the Act, the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> in financial subsidiaries was responsive to differences in host country tax rates across jurisdictions. However, after the Act, differences in host country tax rates no longer explain the distribution <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> held in financial services subsidiaries abroad. In contrast, we find that assets held in manufacturing subsidiaries have become more sensitive to variations in tax rates. Our results suggest that the tightening of the anti-deferral provisions applicable to financial services companies has been successful in neutralizing the effect of host country income taxes on investment location decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the railway}} {{transportation}} Industry moving actively towards automation, accurate <b>location</b> and inventory <b>of</b> wayside track <b>assets</b> like traffic signals, crossings, switches, mileposts, etc. is of extreme importance. With the new Positive Train Control (PTC) regulation coming into effect, many railway safety rules will be tied directly to <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> like mileposts and signals. Newer speed regulations will be enforced based on <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the Train {{with respect to}} a wayside asset. Hence it is essential for the railroads to have an accurate database of the types and <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> these <b>assets.</b> This paper talks about a real-world use-case of detecting railway signals from a camera mounted on a moving locomotive and tracking their locations. The camera is engineered to withstand the environment factors on a moving train and provide a consistent steady image at around 30 frames per second. Using advanced image analysis and deep learning techniques, signals are detected in these camera images and a database <b>of</b> their <b>locations</b> is created. Railway signals differ a lot from road signals in terms of shapes and rules for placement with respect to track. Due to space constraint and traffic densities in urban areas signals are not placed {{on the same side of}} the track and multiple lines can run in parallel. Hence there is need to associate signal detected with the track on which the train runs. We present a method to associate the signals to the specific track they belong to using a video feed from the front facing camera mounted on the lead locomotive. A pipeline of track detection, region of interest selection, signal detection has been implemented which gives an overall accuracy of 94. 7 % on a route covering 150 km with 247 signals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Real-time {{locating}} systems (RTLS, {{also known}} as real-time location systems) have become {{an important component of}} many existing ubiquitous location aware systems. While GPS (global positioning system) has been quite successful as an outdoor real-time locating solution, it fails to repeat this success indoors.

This paper provides a condensed primer of RTLS in healthcare, briefly covering the many options and technologies that are involved, as well as the various possible applications of RTLS in healthcare facilities and their potential benefits, including capital expenditure reduction and workflow and patient throughput improvements. The key to a successful RTLS deployment lies in picking the right RTLS option(s) and solution(s) for the application(s) or problem(s) at hand. Where this application-technology match has not been carefully thought of, any technology will be doomed to failure or to achieving less than optimal results. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} {{measures of}} {{flows and stocks}} of FDI view FDI as a financial flow and its accumulation as a stock, but most uses of FDI data require measures of employment, payrolls, capital inputs, and output from FDI. Judging by data for the United States, the flow and stock data provide rough approximations to country distributions of FDI sources and destinations, but are poor approximations to industry distributions of FDI and to changes over time in country and industry distributions. One important reason for the poor match between {{the two types of}} measures is that more and more of production is the output from intangible and financial <b>assets,</b> the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> which is determined by the firm itself, and not easily subject to outside verification. That development is combined with the increasing use of holding companies and chains of ownership to reduce tax burdens on the firms without necessarily altering the physical <b>location</b> <b>of</b> inputs or production. These developments have drawn the attention of tax authorities and led to some proposals that would reduce firms' ability to manipulate the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and profits. However, these maneuvers also lead to ambiguities in the meaning of economic measures, such as the balance of payments and national product.
