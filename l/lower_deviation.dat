5000|$|Fundamental deviation: {{the minimum}} {{difference}} in size between a component {{and the basic}} size. This {{is identical to the}} upper deviation for shafts and the <b>lower</b> <b>deviation</b> for holes. If the fundamental deviation is greater than zero, the bolt will always be smaller than the basic size and the hole will always be wider. Fundamental deviation is a form of allowance, rather than tolerance.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if a shaft with {{a nominal}} {{diameter}} of 10 mm {{is to have}} a sliding fit within a hole, the shaft might be specified with a tolerance range from 9.964 to 10 mm (i.e. a zero fundamental deviation, but a <b>lower</b> <b>deviation</b> of 0.036 mm) and the hole might be specified with a tolerance range from 10.04 mm to 10.076 mm (0.04 mm fundamental deviation and 0.076 mm upper deviation). This would provide a clearance fit of somewhere between 0.04 mm (largest shaft paired with the smallest hole, called the [...] "maximum material condition") and 0.112 mm (smallest shaft paired with the largest hole). In this case the size of the tolerance range for both the shaft and hole is chosen to be the same (0.036 mm), meaning that both components have the same International Tolerance grade but this need not be the case in general.|$|E
50|$|The {{bioactive}} structures (native or 3D conformation or shape) of {{the isolated}} protein molecules do not undergo any significant conformational changes. Thus, active metal cofactor-containing proteins can be isolated reproducibly {{in the same}} fractions after a PAGE run (see figure Electropherogram). A shifting peak in the respective electropherogram (here: different from peak maximum in fraction 24) may either indicate that a denatured metalloprotein is available in a complex protein mixture to be separated or the standardized time of gel polymerization (69 hr, RT) is not implemented in a PAGE experiment. A <b>lower</b> <b>deviation</b> of the standardized polymerization time (< 69 hr) stands for incomplete polymerization, and thus, for inherent instability due to gel softening during the cross-linking of polymers as the material reaches swelling equilibrium, whereas exceeding this time limit (> 69 hr) is an indicator of gel aging (see figures Electropherogram and Hydrolysis, cf. section Principle). Under standard conditions excluding denaturing pre-analytical steps, metalloproteins with different molecular mass ranges and isoelectric points have been recovered in biologically active form at a quantitative yield of more than 95%.|$|E

This work {{presents a comparison between}} these models in the background of anhydrous ethanol production. The evaluated system is a ternary one (water, ethanol and salt – potassium acetate or calcium chloride) whose experimental data were taken from the literature.

These properties are used to investigate experimentally the applicability of neural networks for cost estimation in early phases of product design.

The cost estimation performance is compared to conventional methods, i. e. linear and non-linear parametric regression. Neural networks achieve <b>lower</b> <b>deviations</b> in their cost estimations. Beyond the use of standard neural architectures, simple modifications for a performance improvement are suggested and tested.

40|$|There is a {{well-known}} sequence of constants c_n describing the growth of supercritical Galton-Watson processes Z_n. With 'lower deviation probabilities' we refer to P(Z_n=k_n) with k_n=o(c_n) as n increases. We give a detailed picture of the asymptotic behavior of such <b>lower</b> <b>deviation</b> probabilities. This complements and corrects results known from the literature concerning special cases. Knowledge on <b>lower</b> <b>deviation</b> probabilities is needed to describe large deviations of the ratio Z_{n+ 1 }/Z_n.

40|$|Brittle porous {{materials}} (BPMs) {{are used for}} battery, fuel cell, catalyst, membrane, filter, bone graft, and pharmacy applications due to the multi-functionality of their underlying porosity. However, {{in spite of its}} technological benefits the effects of porosity on BPM fracture strength and Weibull statistics are not fully understood–limiting a wider use. In this context, classical fracture mechanics was combined with two-dimensional finite element simulations not only to account for pore-pore stress interactions, but also to numerically quantify the relationship between the local pore volume fraction and fracture statistics. Simulations show that even the microstructures with the same porosity level and size of pores differ substantially in fracture strength. The maximum reliability of BPMs was shown to be limited by the underlying pore–pore interactions. Fracture strength of BMPs decreases at a faster rate under biaxial loading than under uniaxial loading. Three different types of deviation from classic Weibull behavior are identified: P-type corresponding to a positive <b>lower</b> tail <b>deviation,</b> N-type corresponding to a negative <b>lower</b> tail <b>deviation,</b> and S-type corresponding to both positive upper and <b>lower</b> tail <b>deviations.</b> Pore-pore interactions result in either P-type or N-type deviation in the limit of low porosity, whereas S-type behavior occurs when clusters of low and high fracture strengths coexist in a fracture data. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{develops}} heuristic {{process capability}} indices (PCIs) using distribution-decomposition methods and evaluates the performances. The heuristic methods decompose the variation of a quality charac-teristic into upper and <b>lower</b> <b>deviations</b> {{and adjust the}} value of the PCIs using decomposed deviations in accordance with the skewness. The weighted variance(WV), new WV(NWV), scaled WV(SWV), and weighted standard deviation(WSD) methods are considered. Methods: The performances of the heuristic PCIs are investigated under the varied situations such as various skewed distributions, sample sizes, and specifications. Results: WV PCI is the best under the normal populations, WSD and SWV PCIs are the best under the low skewed populations, NWV PCI is the best under the moderate and high skewed populations.

40|$|Usual {{terminology}} in {{the current}} debate on contemporary mythologizing writings enligtens – with the reiteration of the prefix meaning <b>lowering,</b> <b>deviation,</b> subtraction – the intentions of modern mythographers: deconstruction, demythicizing, demystification. Moving from invariants persistence, a complex of recompositions emerges, tending to reduce, through the disassembly of the premises, the assumed epic or heroic or allegorical potential of the particular mythical episode or character. Four different rewritings of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice are here analysed, by Cesare Pavese, Alberto Savinio, Italo Calvino and Salman Rushdie – whose “The Ground Beneath Her Feet” shows a texture of intertextual relations with Calvino's “Cosmicomiche”.

40|$|Contrary to {{conventional}} wisdom, this article argues that trade liberalization may facilitate collusion and reduce welfare. With {{the help of}} a duopoly model in which firms interact repeatedly in multiple markets, we first show that, if trade costs (i. e., tariffs/transport costs) and discount factors are not too high, efficient cartel agreements necessitate the cross-hauling of goods, as that entails <b>lower</b> <b>deviation</b> incentives. In this setting, we then demonstrate that reciprocal trade liberalization always raises total output when trade costs are within a range whose lower bound exceeds a threshold level, but may reduce total output (and thus be pro-collusive) when trade costs are below that threshold level.

30|$|The above {{figures show}} that at SNR < 10 dB, TTD and MDM are more robust than HOC against the change in HF noise model. It is true in general that η {{decreases}} as SNR increases. However, for MPSK signals, the instantaneous amplitude feature has <b>lower</b> <b>deviation</b> for SNR < 30 dB. This is intuitively not surprising because the difference between FAWGN and Fbi-kappa relative to FAWGN in this SNR range is smaller than that of higher SNR values. Another observation is that the wavelet based features have maintained almost the same values of η for all considered modulations. In addition, the proposed MDM have shown excellent performance {{in the sense that}} they have the lowest deviation as compared to other features.|$|E
40|$|A {{position}} {{sensitive detector}} (PSD) is frequently {{used for the}} measurement of a one-dimensional position along a line or a two-dimensional position on a plane, but is more often used for measuring static or quasi-static positions. Along with its quick response when measuring short time-spans in the micro-second realm, a PSD is also capable of detecting the dynamic positions of moving objects. In this paper, theoretical modeling and experiments are conducted to explore the frequency characteristics of a vibrating string while moving transversely across a one-dimensional PSD. The theoretical predictions are supported by the experiments. When the string vibrates at its natural frequency while moving transversely, the PSD will detect two frequencies near this natural frequency; one frequency {{is higher than the}} natural frequency and the other is <b>lower.</b> <b>Deviations</b> in these two frequencies, which differ from the string’s natural frequency, increase while the speed of motion increases...|$|R

We prove the convergence in probability (with respect to random couplings) of surface tension and analyze its large deviations: upper deviations occur at volume order while <b>lower</b> <b>deviations</b> occur at surface order. We study the asymptotics of surface tension at low temperatures and relate the quenched value τ q of surface tension to maximal flows (first passage times if d = 2). For a broad class of distributions of the couplings we show that the inequality τ a � τ q – where τ a is the surface tension under the averaged Gibbs measure – is strict at low temperatures. We also describe {{the phenomenon of}} phase coexistence in the dilute Ising model and discuss some {{of the consequences of}} the medi...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} whether {{managers}} use information included in stock prices when making labor investment decisions. Specifically, we examine whether stock price informativeness affects labor investment efficiency. We {{find that a}} higher probability of informed trading (PIN) is associated with <b>lower</b> <b>deviations</b> of labor investment from the level justified by economic fundamentals i. e., higher labor investment efficiency. This finding is robust to using alternative proxies for stock price informativeness and labor investment efficiency, when we control for earnings quality and mispricing, and when we address endogeneity issues. Furthermore, we examine how the impact of stock price informativeness on labor investment efficiency depends on labor union and financial constraints. Particularly, we find stock price informativeness helps mitigating the adverse effects of labor union and financial constraints on labor investment, respectively. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of information included in stock prices for the investment in human capital. Keywords...|$|R
