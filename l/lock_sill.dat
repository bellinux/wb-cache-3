[...] Most prominently the lock walls remained in place. [...] About halfway along {{the east side of the}} water wall, runs over a jumble of stones, falling about , which marks where the dam once stood. [...] At low water pilings and remains of wooden revetments were visible. [...] Parts of the lock gates still lay on the lock floor just above the lower <b>lock</b> <b>sill.</b> [...] The original concrete walkway along the top of the east bank slope still remained, and offered a good view of the lock. [...] The lock keeperâ€™s house, on the east side of the river, still existed in 1991, but was not included in the proposal for registration, as it was in private ownership and the property holders did not wish it to be included.|$|E

There was [...] depth of water over the <b>lock</b> <b>sills,</b> so that any boat that could pass the Willamette Falls Locks could also transit the new lock on the Yamhill.|$|R
50|$|The Warwick and Napton Canal and the Birmingham and Warwick Canal both faced stiff {{competition}} from the railways, and declared themselves bankrupt in the early 1850s. The companies were reconstituted by the receiver, and continued to trade. From 1917, they were managed jointly, and on 1 January 1929, were sold to the Regent's Canal, and with the Grand Junction Canal, {{became part of the}} Grand Union Canal. In order to effectively compete, the new company wanted to upgrade the canals so that wide barges could be used between London and Birmingham. Their aim was to accommodate barges 12.5 ft wide immediately, and ultimately to make the route suitable for 14 ft barges. 52 locks on the two Warwick canals were converted into weirs, and 51 new locks, each 83.5 by 15 ft were built. There was one less because the flight of six at Knowle was replaced by five. In order to give a depth of 5.5 ft, the height of weirs were raised or <b>lock</b> <b>sills</b> were lowered. As part of the work, the top two locks at Bascote were made into a staircase pair. Although the Duke of Kent performed an opening ceremony on 30 October 1934 at the top lock of the Hatton flight, to mark the completion of the project, work continued until 1937. One 12.5 ft boat was built, but without widening the bottom of the canal, there were many places where two such boats could not pass, and the new locks were used by pairs of narrow boats.|$|R
