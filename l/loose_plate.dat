60|$|It {{was on the}} Christmas day following, in the evening, that, {{to finish}} a long train of wickedness, I went abroad to see what might offer in my way; when going by a working silversmith's in Foster Lane, I saw a tempting bait indeed, and not be {{resisted}} by one of my occupation, for the shop had nobody in it, as I could see, {{and a great deal}} of <b>loose</b> <b>plate</b> lay in the window, and at the seat of the man, who usually, as I suppose, worked at one side of the shop.|$|E
60|$|That seeing nobody I the shop, I knocked with my foot {{very hard}} to make the people hear, and had also called aloud with my voice; 'tis true, there was <b>loose</b> <b>plate</b> in the shop, but that nobody could say I had touched any of it, or gone near it; that a fellow came running into the shop out of the street, and laid hands on me in a furious manner, in the very moments while I was calling {{for the people of the}} house; that if he had really had a mind to have done his {{neighbour}} any service, he should have stood at a distance, and silently watched to see whether I had touched anything or no, and then have clapped in upon me, and taken me in the fact. 'That is very true,' says Mr. Alderman, and turning to the fellow that stopped me, he asked him if it was true that I knocked with my foot? He said, yes, I had knocked, but that might be because of his coming. 'Nay,' says the alderman, taking him short, 'now you contradict yourself, for just now you said she was in the shop with her back to you, and did not see you till you came upon her.' Now it was true that my back was partly to the street, but yet as my business was of a kind that required me to have my eyes every way, so I really had a glance of him running over, as I said before, though he did not perceive it.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although {{perforation}} of the esophagus, in {{the anterior}} cervical spine fixation, is well established, cases with delayed onset, especially cases that present pseudodiverticulum, are not common. In addition, {{management of the}} perforation in this situation is debated.  Case Report:   Delayed esophageal pseudodiverticulum was managed in two patients {{with a history of}} anterior spine fixation. Patients were operated on, the <b>loose</b> <b>plate</b> and screws were extracted, the wall of the diverticulum was excised, the perforation on the nasogastric tube was suboptimally repaired, and a closed suction drain was placed there. The NGT was removed on the 7 th day and barium swallow demonstrated no leakage at the operation site; therefore, oral feeding was started without any problem.  Conclusion:  In cases with delayed perforation, fistula, or diverticulum removal of anterior fixation instruments, gentle repair of the esophageal wall without persistence on definitive and optimal perforation closure, wide local drainage, early enteral nutrition via NGT, and antibiotic prescription is suggested...|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, {{the authors}} present the survey {{project of the}} Italian-Greek project, begun in June 2007, and {{illustrate}} its first results. The mission includes Maria Bredaki, former ephor of Hiraklion and {{now director of the}} Institute of Cretan Studies, Fausto Longo, assistant professor at the University of Salerno, and Mario Benzi of the University of Pisa, who have worked in close collaboration with the Italian Archaeological School in Athens directed by Emanuele Greco. In this article, the directors of the mission present their project and the state of research on the site, then trace the general historico-topographical context of their surveys. Vincenzo Amato provides a geomorphological overview of the coastal plain of the Messara and publishes two new maps of the morpho-stratigraphic units: one of the whole western coastal plain of the Messara, the other of the settlement of Festos itself. This work provided an indispensable foundation for our field study, allowing us to take account of ongoing erosion and colluvial processes, and adjust the initial phases of our research accordingly. The team of topographers led by Vladimiro Achilli of the University of Padua describe their topographical survey campaigns. The team has drawn up a new geodetic reference grid within which all georeferenced elements can be inserted, including surveyed archaeological structures and field boundaries. The new map of Festos and its surrounding area, built from a recent orthophotograph of 1994 at a 1 : 18, 000 scale showing archaeological structures, is published as a <b>loose</b> <b>plate</b> attached to their article. This map {{is one of the most}} significant contributions of the team and, more in general, of our whole research. Amedeo Rossi conducted an aereotopographic study to record the features of the contemporary landscape and recognize changes occurred over the last 80 years, detecting surviving traces of the ancient settlement, such as urban routes, and of its surrounding area (the study of the latter is being conducted by Alfonso Santoriello). The in-detail reports on individual zones of the urban survey are authored by the coordinators of field work (Simone Foresta for Zone A, Amedeo Rossi for Zones B and C) and of pottery study (Emanuela Santaniello and Valeria Lenuzza). The authors present their principal results, highlighting the peculiarities of each zone and giving a preliminary report on the characteristics and distribution of the pottery. The article then continues with a very short summary by Amedeo Rossi of the results of the geophysical investigations conducted by Rosa Di Maio of the Federico II University and her team. Rossi summarizes the results achieved in Zone A, which had been recognized from the first year of research as especially interesting, since its characteristics as regards geomorphology and pottery distribution make it likely that the town walls went through it in historical times. Geophysical investigations later confirmed this working hypothesis. This led to an excavation campaign in 2010, which produced extraordinary results. The excavation revealed a vast stretch of the western walls of Festos, briefly discussed by Fausto Longo and Maria Bredaki in the final pages of the article, where the authors also report on their ongoing study of an exposed section with Proto-Palatial material and give a brief chronological overview of the principal chronological phases of the site: the Palatial city; the Greek city; and the Roman and Late Antique phase...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe chaotic {{dynamics}} of heat exchanger tubes impacting on the generally <b>loose</b> baffle <b>plates</b> is studied using an analytic model that involves delay differential equations. The critical flow velocity {{for the local}} instability of the flexible cylinder near the static equilibrium position is obtained by assuming a harmonic solution in the discretized linearized model and solving the resulting algebraic equations. Numerical solutions show that, with increasing flow beyond the critical, the amplitude of motion grows until impacting with the loose support occurs; more complex motions then arise, leading to chaos for a sufficiently high flow velocity. A Lyapunov exponent technique is developed for delay differential equations and {{is applied to the}} present model, showing definitely and unequivocally for the first time for this system-that chaotic motions do occur. To understand the system behaviour better, a one-degree-of-freedom, forced, negatively damped impact oscillator is studied. The response is quite complex and results in chaos in certain parameter regions. The analysis is performed by finding periodic solutions and determining their stability and bifurcations with the Poincare map technique...|$|R

Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) composites can provide an retrofitting alternative for URM buildings. This paper presents results of dynamic tests investigating the in-plane behavior of URM walls retrofitted with FRP. Five half-scale walls were built, using half-scale brick clay units, and retrofitted on a single side. Two aspect ratios (1. 4 and 0. 7), two mortar types (M 2. 5, and M 9), three composite materials (carbon, aramid, and glass FRP), three fibre structures (<b>plates,</b> <b>loose</b> fabric, and grids), and two retrofitting configurations (diagonal “X ” and full surface shapes) were investigated. The test specimens were subjected {{to a series of}} synthetic earthquake motions on an uni-axial earthquake simulator. The retrofitting technique improved the lateral resistance of the URM walls by a factor of 2. 9. However, the improvement in the lateral drift was less significant. Moreover, covering the full surface with composites worked better than the diagonal “X ” retrofitting configuration. ...|$|R
