5|$|The {{cetaceans}} (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are {{marine mammal}} descendants of <b>land</b> <b>mammals.</b> The pakicetids are an extinct family of hoofed mammals {{that are the}} earliest whales, whose closest sister group is Indohyus from family Raoellidae. They lived in the Early Eocene, around 53 million years ago. Their fossils were first discovered in North Pakistan in 1979, at a river {{not far from the}} shores of the former Tethys Sea. Pakicetids could hear under water, using enhanced bone conduction, rather than depending on tympanic membranes like most <b>land</b> <b>mammals.</b> This arrangement does not give directional hearing under water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Land</b> <b>mammals</b> sighted in Glacier Bay are: blue bears (glacier), moose, Sitka black-tailed deer, {{mountain}} goat, wolf, coyote, lynx, wolverine, marmots, {{land and}} river otters, weasels, ermine, mink, squirrels, beaver and red fox. Porcupines, voles, shrews, hares, and bats are also found.|$|E
5|$|No <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> {{are known}} to be native to North Island, but the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) {{occasionally}} hauls out on the island's beaches, and {{it has been suggested that}} the island once had a native population of tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii).|$|E

50|$|The Messinian {{overlaps}} the Turolian European <b>Land</b> <b>Mammal</b> Mega Zone (more precise MN 12 and 13) and the Pontian Central European Paratethys stage. It also overlaps {{the late}} Huayquerian and early Montehermosan South American <b>Land</b> <b>Mammal</b> Ages, and falls inside the more extensive Hemphillian North American <b>Land</b> <b>Mammal</b> Age.|$|R
5|$|Populations {{of large}} <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> such as caribou, moose, deer, elk, have been declining {{dramatically}} since the reintroduction of wolves. Species almost entirely gone {{that were once}} common in the area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short-horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon. After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.|$|E
5|$|There are no native <b>land</b> <b>mammals,</b> {{but there}} are native insects, land crabs, and birds, {{including}} the endemic Nauru reed warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships. The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island, as well as SCUBA diving and snorkelling.|$|E
5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E

5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that {{a small number of}} birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} cannot survive on islands where <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> such as rats and cats have been introduced, and it suffers natural {{predation}} from gulls, skuas, owls and falcons. Although the population may be declining slightly, this petrel is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern {{due to its}} high total numbers. Its presence in rough weather at sea has led to various mariners' superstitions, and, by analogy, to its use as a symbol by revolutionary and anarchist groups.|$|E
5|$|Their nocturnal {{approach}} to the breeding sites means that Zino's petrels avoid the attentions of gulls or diurnal raptors, and the only owl on the island, the barn owl, is a rodent hunter. Other than bats, there are no native <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> on Madeira, although {{there are a number}} of introduced species, two of which will take birds or chicks. These are brown rats and feral domestic cats. Even the high mountain nest sites of the Zino's petrel are not safe from these adaptable predators, ten adults being killed by cats in 1990. Feather lice found on Zino's petrels include Trabeculus schillingi, Saemundssonia species and an unnamed species of Halipeurus.|$|E

5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
5|$|Other {{indigenous}} {{animals are}} represented by reptiles (tuatara, skinks and geckos), frogs, spiders, insects (weta) and snails. Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique {{that they have been}} called living fossils. Three species of bats (one since extinct) were the only sign of native <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique, mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old. Marine mammals however are abundant, with almost half the world's cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters. Many seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the country. More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country.|$|E
5|$|Smeerenburg {{was one of}} {{the first}} settlements, {{established}} by the Dutch in 1619. Smaller bases were also built by the English, Danish and French. At first the outposts were merely summer camps, but from the early 1630s, a few individuals started to overwinter. Whaling at Spitsbergen lasted until the 1820s, when the Dutch, British and Danish whalers moved elsewhere in the Arctic. By the late 17th century, Russian hunters arrived; they overwintered to a greater extent and hunted <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> such as the polar bear and fox. After British raids into the Barents Sea in 1809, Russian activity on Svalbard diminished, and ceased by the 1820s. Norwegian hunting—mostly for walrus—started in the 1790s. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast Sámi people from the Hammerfest region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795. Norwegian whaling was abandoned about the same time as the Russians left, but whaling continued around Spitsbergen until the 1830s, and around Bjørnøya until the 1860s.|$|E

5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} rear end of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{pinnipeds}} have fur coats, {{the exception}} being the walrus, {{which is only}} sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are less haired than most <b>land</b> <b>mammals.</b> In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as lanugo, can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm. Pinnipeds are typically countershaded, and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally, which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water. The pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their Arctic environment. Some species, such as ribbon seals, ringed seals and leopard seals, have patterns of contrasting light and dark coloration. All fully furred species molt; phocids molt once a year, while otariids gradually molt all year. Seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat known as blubber that is particularly thick in phocids and walruses. Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting. It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped's body weight. Pups are born with only {{a thin layer of}} blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
