40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate development of a low-cost liquid natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> storage tank with low fuel boil-off, low tank pressure, and high safety margin. One of the largest contributors to the cost of converting a vehicle to LNG is the cost of the <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. To minimize heat leak from the surroundings into the low-temperature fuel, these tanks are designed as cryogenic dewars with double walls separated by an evacuated insulation space containing multi-layer insulation. The cost of these fuel tanks is driven by this double-walled construction, both in terms of materials and labor. The primary focus of the analysis was to try to devise a fuel tank concept that would allow for the elimination of the double-wall requirement. Results of this study have validated the benefit of vacuum/MLI insulation for <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks and the difficulty in identifying viable alternatives. The thickness of a non-vacuum insulation layer would have to be unreasonably large to achieve an acceptable non-venting hold time. Reasonable hold times could be achieved by using an auxiliary tank to accept boil-off vapor from a non-vacuum insulated primary tank, if the vapor in the auxiliary tank can be stored at high pressure. The primary focus of the analysis was to try to devise a fuel tank concept that allowed for the elimination of the double-wall requirement. Thermodynamic relations were developed for analyzing the fuel tank transient response to heat transfer, venting of vapor, and out-flow of either vapor or liquid. One of the major costs associated with conversion of a vehicle to <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> is the cost of the <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. The cost of these tanks is driven by the cryogenic nature of the fuel and by the fundamental design requirements of long non-venting hold times and low storage pressure...|$|R

40|$|Cummins Westport Incorporated (CWI) has {{designed}} {{and developed a}} liquefied natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> system that includes a reciprocating pump with the cold end submerged in LNG contained in a vacuum-jacketed tank. This system was tested and analyzed under the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced LNG Onboard Storage System (ALOSS) program. The pumped <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> system developed by CWI and tested under the ALOSS program is a high-pressure system designed for application on Class 8 trucks powered by CWI's ISX G engine, which employs high-pressure direct injection (HPDI) technology. A general ALOSS program objective was to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a pumped <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> system relative to on-vehicle fuel systems that require the LNG to be ''conditioned'' to saturation pressures that exceeds the engine fuel pressure requirements. These advantages include the capability to store more fuel mass in given-size vehicle and station tanks, and simpler lower-cost LNG refueling stations {{that do not require}} conditioning equipment. Pumped <b>LNG</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> systems are an alternative to conditioned LNG systems for spark-ignition natural gas and port-injection dual-fuel engines (which typically require about 100 psi), and they are required for HPDI engines (which require over 3, 000 psi). The ALOSS program demonstrated the feasibility of a pumped <b>LNG</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> system and the advantages of this design relative to systems that require conditioning the LNG to a saturation pressure exceeding the engine <b>fuel</b> pressure requirement. <b>LNG</b> tanks mounted on test carts and the CWI engineering truck were repeatedly filled with LNG saturated at 20 to 30 psig. More fuel mass was stored in the vehicle tanks as well as the station tank, and no conditioning equipment was required at the fueling station. The ALOSS program also demonstrated the general viability and specific performance of the CWI pumped <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> system design. The system tested as part of this program is designed to be used on Class 8 trucks with CWI ISX G HPDI engines. Extensive test cart and engineering truck tests of the pump demonstrated good durability and the high-pressure performance needed for HPDI application. The LNG tanks manufactured by Taylor-Wharton passed SAE J 2343 Recommended Practice drop tests and accelerated road-load vibration tests. NER and hold-time tests produced highly consistent results. Additional tests confirmed the design adequacy of the liquid level sensor, vaporizer, ullage volume, and other fuel system components. While the testing work performed under this program focused on a high-pressure pumped <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> system design, the results also validate the feasibility of a low-pressure pumped fuel system. A low-pressure pumped fuel system could incorporate various design refinements including a simpler and lighter-weight pump, which would decrease costs somewhat relative to a high-pressure system...|$|R
30|$|Det Norske Veritas (2012) {{provides}} forecasts from 2012 to 2020, {{based on}} a set of four scenarios. Each of these scenarios represents a level of economic growth, and a degree of regulatory and stakeholder pressure. <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption in 2020 varies between 7 million tonnes for the low-growth scenario and 33 million tonnes under the high-growth scenario.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to evaluate the potential for growth in use of liquid natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>fueled</b> trucks.. A system dynamics model was constructed for the analysis {{and a variety of}} scenarios were investigated. The analysis considers the economics of <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> {{in the context of the}} trucking industry to identify barriers to the increased use of LNG trucks and potential interventions or leverage points which may overcome these barriers. The study showed that today, LNG use in trucks is not yet economically viable. A large change in the savings from fuel cost or capital cost is needed for the technology to take off. Fleet owners have no way now to benefit from the environmental benefits of <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> nor do they benefit from the clean burning nature of the fuel. Changes in the fuel cost differential between diesel and LNG are not a research issue. However, quantifying the improvements in reliability and wear from the use of clean fuel could support increased maintenance and warranty periods. Many people involved in the use of LNG for trucks believe that LNG has the potential to occupy a niche within the larger diesel truck business. But if LNG in trucks can become economic, the spread of fuel stations and technology improvements could lead to LNG trucks becoming the dominant technology. An assumption in our simulation work is that LNG trucks will be purchased when economically attractive. None of the simulation results show LNG becoming economic but then only to the level of a niche market...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) to study the thermodynamic response enhanced by sloshing inside liquefied natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks. An existing numerical solver provided by OpenFOAM is used to simulate sloshing in a model scaled tank of similar form to an <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. The interface area has been estimated for different sloshing regimes on three different numerical grids representing the tank in 3 D. Estimating the interface area is done by performing a grid-independence study. In the most severe sloshing conditions, convergence is not achieved. By combining the results from experiments and CFD, {{it is found that}} the interface area and the condensation mass flow rate are in phase for the most severe sloshing condition. The existing CFD solver is modified to determine the pressure drop. The simulation results are compared to the experimental data, and the results are acceptable and thereby show a potential in applying CFD to predict the thermodynamic response due to sloshing. By plotting the temperature contours, indications are found that the exchange of cold bulk and saturated liquid due to sloshing has a significant influence on the thermodynamic response...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{on the use of}} {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) to produce electricity. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from a conventional <b>LNG</b> <b>fuel</b> cycle in which CO 2 is released to atmosphere are compared to emissions from the same cycle modified to capture CO 2 at the power station. The increase in cost of electricity due to capture and storage of CO 2 is calculated. The study is the first stage in a full fuel cycle (FFC) assessment. Subsequent work will establish the climate change damages avoided by capture of CO 2 at the powever station they will be compared to emissions avoided and the 'private' costs of capture as reported here.

A Norwegian fiscal tax on NOx emissions prompted {{the establishment of the}} Business Sector’s NOx fund that in exchange for a minimized tax on NOx, offered financial support to companies that implemented NOx reducing measures.
