5000|$|An {{application}} of the quantity-theory approach aimed at removing monetary policy {{as a source of}} macroeconomic instability was to target a constant, low growth rate of the money supply. [...] Still, practical identification of the relevant money supply, including measurement, was always somewhat controversial and difficult. As financial intermediation grew in complexity and sophistication in the 1980s and 1990s, it became more so. To mitigate these problem, some central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, which had targeted the money supply, reverted to targeting interest rates. Starting 1990 with New Zealand, more and more central banks started to communicate inflation targets as the primary guidance for the public. Reasons were that interest targeting {{turned out to be a}} less effective tool in low-interest phases and it did not cope with the public uncertainty about future inflation rates to expect. The communication of inflation targets helps to anchor the public inflation expectations, it makes central banks more accountable for their actions, and it reduces economic uncertainty among the participants in the economy. But monetary aggregates remain a <b>leading</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicator.</b> with [...] "some evidence that the linkages between money and economic activity are robust even at relatively short-run frequencies." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{recession}} {{that began in}} March 2001 differed in many ways from other recessions {{of the past three}} decades. The twin recessions of the early 1980 s occurred when the Federal Reserve Board, under Chairman Paul Volcker, acted decisively to halt the steady rise of inflation during the 1970 s, despite the substantial employment and output cost to the economy. Although monetary tightening had reduced the growth rate of real activity in 1989, the proximate cause of the recession of 1990 was a sharp fall in consumption, a response by consumers to the uncertainty raised by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and the associated spike in oil prices (Blanchard 1993). In contrast, the recession of 2001 started neither in the shopping mall nor in the corridors of the Federal Reserve Bank, but in the boardrooms of corporate America as businesses sharply cut back on expenditures—most notably, investment associated with information technology—in turn leading to declines in manufacturing output and in the overall stock market. Because it differed so from its recent predecessors, the recession of 2001 provides a particularly interesting case in which to examine the forecasting performance of various <b>leading</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicators.</b> In this article, {{we take a look at}} how a wide range of <b>leading</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicators</b> performed during this episode.
