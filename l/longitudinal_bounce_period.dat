The form of the bounce-averaged diffusion equation is found regardless of details of the mirror geometry, suggesting that the numerical schemes developed for solving the modified two-dimensional (2 -D) Fokker-Planck equation in a magnetic dipole should be feasible for similar computation efforts on modeling wave-induced particle diffusion processes in any non-dipolar magnetic field. However, <b>bounce</b> <b>period</b> related terms and bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients are required to be computed in realistic magnetic fields. With the application to the Dungey magnetosphere that {{is controlled by the}} intensity of southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), we show that with enhanced southward IMF the normalized <b>bounce</b> <b>period</b> related term decreases accordingly, and bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients cover a broader range of electron energy and equatorial pitch angle with a tendency of increased magnitude and peaking at lower energies. The compression of the Dungey magnetosphere can generally produce scattering loss of plasma sheet electrons ~ 100 keV on a timescale shorter than that in a dipolar field, and induce momentum diffusion at high pitch angles closer to 90 °. Correspondingly, the strong diffusion rate drops considerably as a product of changes in both the equatorial loss cone and the <b>bounce</b> <b>period.</b> The extent of differences in all the parameters introduced by the southward IMF intensification also becomes larger for a field line with higher equatorial crossing.

To understand this process we have developed a time-dependent two-stream model, which uses field line geometries and drift paths calculated by a three-dimensional multi-fluid model of Titan’s plasma interaction. The boundary conditions of the model account for the time-dependent reduction or increase in electron flux along Saturn’s magnetic field lines because of the loss or production of electrons in Titan’s atmosphere. The modification of the auroral electron flux depends on the electron <b>bounce</b> <b>period</b> in Saturn’s outer magnetosphere; therefore, we also calculate electron <b>bounce</b> <b>periods</b> along several Kronian field lines accounting for both the magnetic mirroring force and the field-aligned electric potential in Saturn’s plasma sheet.

We find that the flux of higher energy (>> 50 eV) electrons entering Titan’s atmosphere is strongly reduced over time, resulting in smaller ionization and energy deposition rates below ∼ 1300 km altitude.

A peaked distribution thus diffuses in pitch angle on the time scale of many bounces. It is argued in this paper that spatial diffusion is a further consequence when the magnetodisc has a longitudinal asymmetry. A general expression for DLL, the diffusion of equatorial crossing radii, is derived.

40|$|Axisymmetric mirrors have no {{collision}} free radial transport, but such magnetic fields may {{have problems with}} plasma stability (the tearing instability in particular). There are some means to improve plasma stability in axisymmetric mirrors by magnetic expander tanks or axisymmetric divertors, but plasma stability can still be a challenge in axisymmetric mirrors. An alternative is to use quadrupolar magnetic fields as a robust method to overcome the stability issues. A price may then be increased radial transport if the magnetic field design is done without strict consideration of asymmetries, which could result from manufacturing errors. The computations have been done with a hybrid reactor scenario in mind. Such a case have less demands for confinement, but the demands are still challenging. Confinement for about 200 <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bounces</b> is required in a hybrid reactor. The computations carried out here have confirmed that axial asymmetry may become dangerous for plasma confinement in quadrupolar mirror machines.

The computational results made in this paper may suggest that if the manufacturing error is kept below 0. 15 % relative error throughout the plasma confinement region, there is then a some margin for sufficient radial confinement quality. Such accuracies ought to be possible to achieve in the manufacturing process, possible combined with compensating magnetic fields to maintain a precise magnetic field design.

Calculated sweeping rates for ions and electrons are typically two or three orders of magnitude less than the strong-diffusion loss rate.

A unitless figure of merit, the "bounce number" N_B = 1 /(nu_d tau_B), encapsulates this condition and defines a trapping threshold amplitude for which N_B= 1. The detrapping rate is found for convective loss (transverse and longitudinal) out of a spatially finite Langmuir wave. Simulations of driven waves with a finite transverse profile, using the 2 D- 2 V Vlasov code Loki, show trapping nonlinearity increases continuously with N_B for transverse loss, and is significant for N_B ~ 1. The detrapping rate due to Coulomb collisions (both electron-electron and electron-ion) is also found, with pitch-angle scattering and parallel drag and diffusion treated in a unified manner. A simple way to combine convective and collisional detrapping is given. Application to underdense plasma conditions in inertial confinement fusion targets is presented. The results show that convective transverse loss is usually the most potent detrapping process in a single f/ 8 laser speckle.

In this scenario we distinguish four distinct phases: a <b>bouncing</b> <b>period,</b> a radiation era, an acceleration era and a re-bouncing. It has already been shown that in NLED a strong magnetic field can overcome the inevitability of a singular region typical of linear Maxwell theory; on the other extreme situation, that is for very weak magnetic field it can accelerate the expansion. The present model goes one step further: after the acceleration phase the universe re-bounces and enter in a collapse era. This behavior is {{a manifestation of the}} invariance under the dual map of the scale factor a(t) → 1 / a(t), a consequence of the corresponding inverse symmetry of the electromagnetic field (F → 1 / F, where F ≡ F^μνF_μν) of the NLED theory presented here.

The electrons subject to such scattering extends to lower energies and higher equatorial pitch angles when the southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) increases in the Dungey magnetic model. Furthermore, we find that changes in the diffusion coefficients are the dominant factor responsible for variations in the modeled temporal evolution of plasma sheet electron distribution. Our study demonstrates that the effects of realistic ambient magnetic fields need to be incorporated into both the evaluation of resonant diffusion coefficients and the calculation of Fokker-Planck diffusion equation to understand quantitatively the evolution of plasma sheet electron distribution and the occurrence of diffuse aurora, in particular at L > 5 during geomagnetically disturbed periods when the ambient magnetic field considerably deviates from a magnetic dipole...|$|R

Remarkable consequences are inferred at the heuristic level of effective dynamics: first, consistency of the constraint algebra regarding the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints fixes the improved quantization scheme {{to be of the}} form reminiscent of the improved scheme in LQC which preserves scaling invariance; second, consistency regarding two Hamiltonian constraints further demands the inclusion of higher order holonomy corrections and fixes a ratio factor of 2 for the improved scheme.

This mechanism related to current sheet scattering (CSS) provides a specific energy–latitude dispersion pattern near the equatorward boundary of proton isotropic precipitation (isotropy boundary, IB), with precipitation sharply decreasing at higher (lower) latitude for protons with lower (higher) energy. However, this boundary maps {{to the inner}} magnetosphere, where wave-induced scattering may provide different dispersion patterns as recently demonstrated by Liang et al. (2014). Motivated by the potential usage of the IBs for the magnetotail monitoring {{as well as by}} the need to better understand the mechanisms forming the proton IB, we investigate statistically the details of particle flux patterns near the proton IB using NOAA-POES polar spacecraft observations made during September 2009. By comparing precipitated-to-trapped flux ratio (J 0 / J 90) at > 30 and > 80 keV proton energies, we found a relatively small number of simple CSS-type dispersion events (only 31 %). The clear reversed (wave-induced) dispersion patterns were very rare (5 %). The most frequent pattern had nearly coinciding IBs at two energies (63 %). The structured precipitation with multiple IBs was very frequent (60 %), that is, with two or more significant J 0 / J 90 dropouts. The average latitudinal width of multiple IB structures was about 1 °. Investigation of dozens of paired auroral zone crossings of POES satellites showed that the IB pattern is stable on a timescale of less than 2 min (a few proton <b>bounce</b> <b>periods)</b> but can evolve on a longer (several minutes) scale, suggesting temporal changes in some mesoscale structures in the equatorial magnetosphere.

Precipitating suprathermal ions enhance ionospheric plasma density structure and constitute a possible source for the enhanced echo occurrence observed by ground-based radars in the SAPS region. Satellite energy spectrometer data often show multiple bands of suprathermal particles with enhanced number and energy flux, and with an energy increase with increasing latitude. The present work examines the hypothesis that these signatures are the result of thermal secondary ions that have been accelerated out of the auroral ionosphere over the short time scales characterizing bursts of intense auroral electron precipitation. The analysis of three events of energy-dispersed ion signatures was facilitated by three-dimensional ion tracing software developed for this thesis. The short-lived acceleration hypothesis can account for the energy-dispersed ion signatures if there exist inter-hemispheric field aligned potentials of the order of 100 V. If the source of the ions is within the auroral zone, the suprathermal ions observed in the SAPS region {{are most likely to be}} O+ ions. The long <b>bounce</b> <b>period</b> of O+ (compared to H+) allows convection to transport O+ auroral ions equatorward through a convection reversal, into the SAPS region during a single half-bounce...|$|R
40|$|In an open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space background, {{we study}} the {{classical}} and quantum cosmological {{models in the}} framework of the recently proposed nonlinear massive gravity theory. Although the constraints which are present in this theory prevent it from admitting the flat and closed FRW models as its cosmological solutions, for the open FRW universe, it is not the case. We have shown that, either in the absence of matter or {{in the presence of a}} perfect fluid, the classical field equations of such a theory adopt physical solutions for the open FRW model, in which the mass term shows itself as a cosmological constant. These classical solutions consist of two distinguishable branches: One is a contacting universe which tends to a future singularity with zero size, while another is an expanding universe having a past singularity from which it begins its evolution. A classically forbidden region separates these two branches from each other. We then employ the familiar canonical quantization procedure in the given cosmological setting to find the cosmological wave functions. We use the resulting wave function to investigate the possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum effects. It is shown that the quantum expectation values of the scale factor, although they have either contracting or expanding phases like their classical counterparts, are not disconnected from each other. Indeed, the classically forbidden region may be replaced by a <b>bouncing</b> <b>period</b> in which the scale factor bounces from the contraction to its expansion eras. Using the Bohmian approach of quantum mechanics, we also compute the Bohmian trajectory and the quantum potential related to the system, which their analysis shows are the direct effects of the mass term on the dynamics of the universe.

40|$|The dayside {{magnetosphere}} {{contains a}} region where the field strength has a local maximum. This region, located just inside the magnetopause around the equatorial plane and between the cusps, has a width of 2 [...] 3 Re. When a drift shell with a sufficiently small mirror field intersects this region, it will bifurcate into two branches near local noon, each branch going across one cusp and joining together at the symmetrical local time. The particle then drifts around the Earth over a single branch until {{it comes back to}} local noon. In the neighborhood of the bifurcation points, the <b>bounce</b> <b>period</b> tends to infinity, and thus the adiabaticity of the bounce motion is broken there, but not elsewhere. This breaking causes a small but finite jump Delta I in the second invariant. Repeated crossings lead to a random walk in second invariant space, and thus to radial diffusion. We use theory and simulations to determine the magnitude of DeltaI. Our study is limited to static magnetic fields, but it can be extended to general fields. Our results indicate that DeltaI is sensitively dependent on bounce phase at bifurcation, and it can grow significantly for some initial conditions. When the initial second invariant I 0 is much larger than the mirror gyroradius rhom, we use separatrix crossing theory. The average of DeltaI over bounce phases is zero, and the rms DeltaI is of the order of rho m. When I 0 is comparable to rhom, the equation of bounce motion is approximated as the second Painleve equation, whose asymptotic solutions are used to determine Delta I. In this limit, the rms DeltaI is still O (rhom); however, the average is nonzero, in the form exp(- I 0 /rhom). Drift-shell bifurcation leads to significant radial diffusion. For MeV electrons, the diffusion coefficient can be several R e per day. Also, because of bifurcation, some quasitrapped particles can remain in the magnetosphere for a finite number of drifts before they leave permanently. Such behavior leads to metastable particles, a new kind of trapping. These results can be useful for radiation-belt modeling efforts...|$|R
