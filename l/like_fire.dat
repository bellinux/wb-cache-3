5|$|Not {{all aspects}} of {{existence}} were seen as deities. Although many deities were connected with the Nile, no god personified {{it in the way}} that Ra personified the sun. Short-lived phenomena, like rainbows or eclipses, were not represented by gods; neither were elements <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> and water or many other components of the world.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E

25|$|The guru is {{considered}} to form a single Self (atman) with his disciples. As such, he leads the disciples {{to the discovery of}} their own Atman with his own consciousness, exalted into the supreme state. <b>Like</b> <b>fire</b> kindled from a candle to another candle, the revelation of the self is passed from master to disciple directly, not through words or exterior practices, but mediated by the direct transfer of śakti.|$|E

5000|$|The USERRA also protects {{a member}} of the armed {{services}} from employment discrimination relating to one's military service. Under USERRA an employee must show that his or her military service was a [...] "substantial” or “motivating factor” in the employer’s adverse employment action, <b>like</b> <b>firing</b> or demotion. Since employers rarely tell reservist/employees that they are being fired because of their military service, the USERRA allows a party to establish discrimination by, among other things, examining the proximity in time between the adverse act (<b>like</b> <b>firing)</b> and the military service event (like an employee informing an employer of the employee's military obligation), whether the employer followed its internal policies, and whether the military employee was treated differently than other non-military employees. http://servicememberlaw.com/the-law/ ...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to modern equipment, Chinese weapons, <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> arrows, light mortars, dadao swords, matchlocks, bows and arrows, crossbows, and halberds {{continued to be}} used alongside the western weaponry. Chinese gingal guns firing massive shells were used accurately, and inflicted severe wounds and death on the Allied troops during the Boxer Rebellion. In some cases, primitive weapons like Chinese spears were more effective than British bayonets in close quarter fighting.|$|E
25|$|Many {{firefighters are}} sworn {{officers}} with command structures {{similar to the}} military and police. They do not have general police powers (some firefighters in the United States have limited police powers, <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> police departments, while certain fire marshals have full police powers, i.e. {{the ability to make}} warantless arrests, and authority to carry a firearm on and off-duty), but have specific powers of enforcement and control in fire and emergency situations.|$|E
25|$|The brand itself {{expanded}} in the 1950s and 1960s {{and could be}} found {{on a variety of}} products <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s. In 1991, the company went public before becoming completely independent in 1995.|$|E

He was the founder and editor of Thai weekly magazine and Anna daily newspaper in Tamil. He {{was the owner of}} Sathya Studios and Emgeeyar Pictures (willed to charity) which produced many of the films he acted in. He had gifted a golden sword weighing half a Kilogram to Mookambika temple in Kollur, Udupi district.|$|E
25|$|The mode {{of worship}} was {{worship of the}} {{elements}} <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> and rivers, worship of heroic gods like Indra, chanting of hymns and performance of sacrifices. The priests performed the solemn rituals for the noblemen (Kshatriyas) and wealthy commoners Vaishyas. People prayed for abundance of children, rain, cattle (wealth), long life and an afterlife in the heavenly world of the ancestors. This mode of worship has been preserved even today in Hinduism, which involves recitations from the Vedas by a purohita (priest), for prosperity, wealth and general well-being. However, the primacy of Vedic deities has been seconded to the deities of Puranic literature.|$|E
25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} the first viable {{technology}} {{in the history of}} man was fire. By the control of fire, it was possible for man to burn a forest, or all forests. It was also possible to cook food and to obtain warmth and protection. Inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus, the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, Georgescu terms fire 'the first Promethean recipe'. According to Georgescu, a later important Promethean recipe (technology) of the same (first) kind was animal husbandry, feeding on grass and other biomass (<b>like</b> <b>fire</b> does).|$|E

25|$|There is {{no trace}} of reason in God because reason is desire and God lacks nothing. Adam was not created in reason. Had it been otherwise, his problem could have been healed by natural {{learning}} {{and there would be}} no need of Christ and no need of faith. The worldly case against reason is that its products do not last: a great remedy for some human problem is devised but soon lost patience with and a new novelty is again demanded. Thus thy wisdom is thy woe. Reason should not be discarded but placed as subservient to faith. Reason, <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> and water, is a bad master but a good servant. Above all, one cannot use reason to seek out the Lord.|$|E
25|$|Many {{tactical}} RPGs {{can be both}} extremely {{time-consuming and}} extremely difficult. Hence, the appeal of most tactical RPGs is to the hardcore, not casual, computer and video game player. Traditionally, tactical RPGs have been quite popular in Japan but have not enjoyed {{the same degree of}} success in North America and elsewhere. However, the audience for Japanese tactical RPGs has grown substantially since the mid-90s, with PS1 and PS2 titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Suikoden Tactics, Vanguard Bandits, and Disgaea enjoying a surprising measure of popularity, as well as hand-held war games <b>like</b> <b>Fire</b> Emblem. (Final Fantasy Tactics for the PS1 is often considered the breakthrough title outside Japan.) Older TRPGs are also being re-released via software emulationsuch as on the Wii Virtual Consoleand on handheld game consoles, giving games {{a new lease on life}} and exposure to new audiences. Japanese video games such as these are as a result no longer nearly as rare a commodity in North America as they were during the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Cooch Behar is a well-planned town, and the {{municipality}} {{is responsible for}} providing basic services, such as potable water and sanitation. The water is supplied by {{the municipality}} using its groundwater resources, and almost all the houses in the municipal area are connected. Solid waste is collected every day by the municipality van from individual houses. The surface drains, mostly uncemented, drain into the Torsa River. Electricity is supplied by the West Bengal State Electricity Board, and the West Bengal Fire Service provides emergency services <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> tenders. Most of the roads are metalled (macadam), and street lighting is available throughout the town. The Public Works Department is responsible for road maintenance and on the roads connecting Cooch Behar with other towns in the region. Health services in Cooch Behar include a government-owned District Hospital, a Regional Cancer Centre, and private nursing homes.

25|$|Other related Old Norse Tales {{are those}} such as King Hrolfr Kraki, where the main protagonist King Hrolfr of Denmark is tricked into marrying his own daughter. Yet the most {{striking}} similarity to Tolkien's work are the tales of swords such as Tyrfing, that appears in the Hervarar Saga. Svafrlami was the King of Gardariki, and a grandson of the god Odin. He caught the dwarves, Dvalin and Durin, and forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that would never miss a stroke, would never rust and would cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes. The dwarves made the sword, and it shone and gleamed <b>like</b> <b>fire.</b> However, in revenge they cursed {{it so that it}} would kill a man every time it was used {{and that it would be}} the cause of three great evils. They also cursed it so that it would in the end, kill Svafrlami himself. Then there is Dáinsleif, a sword from the legend of the eternal battle Hjaðningavíg, made by the dwarf Dain. Like Tyrfing, Dainsleif gave wounds that never healed and once drawn it could not be sheathed again without killing a man.|$|E
25|$|During this stage, he is a {{said to have}} practised some {{technique}} of meditation that would seemingly help him control elements (called tattva) <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> and {{water out of the}} total 36 such elements enumerated in Kashmir Shaivism. He started the practice of blowing air at live charcoals in his fire pot (called kanger in local language) sometimes for hours together. He was found talking to and directing invisible people at times. Various parts of his body like his shoulders and knees were seen shuddering at times. He spiritually initiated a Sikh disciple who had come to see him from some other state and lived at his home for 3 months. He also initiated Pandit Maheshwar Nath Zutshi of Mallapore locality of Srinagar by offering him his pipe. He also started the practice of transfixing his gaze on water filled in a tumbler kept inside a brass basin filled with water. This brass basin was placed over an earthenware pot which too was filled with water. It was also during this time that majority of his miracles were recorded and people started flocking him, seeking solutions to their worldly problems. It was sometime during the period between 1946–56 that he came to be called as Bhagwan by his devotees. He regularly visited the shrines of the deities of Mata Sharika Bhagwati and Mata Ragnya Bhawani during this period. Sometime after 1957, on every Sunday afternoon, musical concerts were held at his place by known local musicians who would play local and Indian classical music for him. Some of the other shrines visited by him during the initial and final stages of his spiritual practice were Jwala Ji at Khrew, Bhadrakali at Handwara, Jyestha Bhagwati at Srinagar, Gupt Ganga near Nishat Bagh, Tushkaraja Bhairav at Srinagar and Amarnath.|$|E
500|$|The player {{character}} {{may receive}} damage, {{which can be}} healed with restore items. Herbs, which restore character health, can be combined {{with other types of}} herbs to become more effective. Too much damage will result in a game over. At this point, the game must be continued from the last save point. A partner's death will also result in a game over. Some weapons are better suited for battling certain enemies, some of which have weaknesses to elements <b>like</b> <b>fire</b> or acid. Once the game is beaten once, [...] "Battle Mode" [...] is unlocked. This mode gives the player character infinite ammo and places them in random locations with different enemies.|$|E
