Two series of demonstrator engine tests, the first in April-May 2006 and the second in March-April 2007, have demonstrated in excess of 10 : 1 throttling of the hydrogen/oxygen expander cycle engine.

The simulation consisted of inserting the throttling flanges to the air intake duct before compressor, limiting duct cross-sectional area by 20 % and 60 % respectively.

40|$|While 3 D stacked multi-processor {{technology}} {{offers the potential}} for significant computing advantages, these architectures also face the significant challenge of small, localized hotspots with very large heat fluxes due to the placement of asymmetric cores, heterogeneous devices and performance driven layouts. In this thesis, a new thermal management solution is introduced that seeks to maximize the performance of microprocessors with dynamically managed power profiles. To mitigate the non-uniformities in chip temperature profiles resulting from the dynamic power maps, solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs) with an embedded heat spreader network are strategically positioned near localized hotspots, resulting in a large increase in the local thermal capacitance in these problematic areas. Theoretical analysis shows {{that the increase in}} local thermal capacitance results in an almost twenty-fold increase in the time that a thermally constrained core can operate before a power gating or core migration event is required. Coupled to the PCMs are solid state coolers (SSCs) that serve as a means for fast regeneration of the PCMs during the cool down periods associated with throttling events. Using this combined PCM/SSC approach allows for devices that operate with the desirable combination of <b>low</b> <b>throttling</b> frequency and large overall core duty cycles, thus maximizing computational throughput. The impact of the thermophysical properties of the PCM on the device operating characteristics has been investigated from first principles in order to better inform the PCM selection or design process. Complementary to the theoretical characterization of the proposed thermal solution, a prototype device called a "Composite Thermal Capacitor (CTC) " that monolithically integrates micro heaters, PCMs and a spreader matrix into a Si test chip was fabricated and tested to validate the efficacy of the concept. A prototype CTC was shown to increase allowable device operating times by over 7 X and address heat fluxes of up to ~ 395 W/cm 2. Various methods for regenerating the CTC have been investigated, including air, liquid, and solid state cooling, and operational duty cycles of over 60 % have been demonstrated.

40|$|Modern VVA systems {{offer new}} {{potentialities}} {{in improving the}} fuel consumption for spark-ignition engines at low and medium load, meanwhile they grant a higher volumetric efficiency and performance at high load. Recently introduced systems enhance this concept through the possibility of concurrently modifying the intake valve opening, closing and lift leading {{to the development of}} almost “throttle-less” engines. However, at very low loads, the control of the air-flow motion and the turbulence intensity inside the cylinder may require to select a proper combination of the butterfly throttling and the intake valve control, to get the highest BSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) reduction. Moreover, a <b>low</b> <b>throttling,</b> while improving the fuel consumption, may also produce an increased gas-dynamic noise at the intake mouth. In highly “downsized” engines, the intake valve control is also linked to the turbocharger operating point, which may be changed by acting on the waste-gate valve. Depending on the valve lift and the actual exhaust pressure, different internal-EGR levels can be achieved, requiring a variation in the spark advance as well. Of course, the introduction of new degrees of freedom to the engine control poses new problems in terms of engine calibration and tuning. To best exploit the potential offered by these systems, new methodologies and development tools must be utilized as well. In this paper, an optimization procedure is presented, aiming to select the best combination of four control parameters (intake valve closure angle, butterfly valve opening, waste-gate opening and spark advance) of a twin-cylinder turbocharged engine in different operating conditions. A detailed 1 D simulation model of the whole engine is firstly developed and validated against the experimental data in WOT conditions and in predefined low load operating points. The model is developed within GT-Power™ commercial code environment, but employs an in-house routine that is implemented to simulate the combustion process. This routine takes into account the effects on the heat release induced by the variations of the in-cylinder flow field, turbulence and internal-EGR. These, in fact, are substantially modified by the actual strategy specified for the engine control. An external module is implemented to evaluate the intake valve lift profile {{as a function of the}} closure angle and the engine speed. The 1 D prediction of the gas-dynamic noise at the intake mouth is further validated through the comparison with the results obtained by the unsteady 3 D CFD analysis of the flow field within the air-box device. The 1 D computed pressure profile downstream the device is utilized as boundary condition for the 3 D model. The validated 1 D model of the turbocharged engine is then coupled to a multipurpose commercial optimizer (ModeFRONTIER™). The optimization procedure identifies the best combinations of the previously selected control parameters with the goal of minimizing both the fuel consumption and the gas-dynamic noise, for defined low-load lowspeed operating points. The procedure is validated against the experimental data obtained by a calibration of the engine at the test-bed. The values of the control parameters selected by the optimizer well agree with the experimentally identified ones. Alternative settings are also proposed with the aim to substantially reducing the radiated noise with limited or no penalty for the BSFC. The optimization results are also verified by a 3 D CFD analysis. Therefore, the procedure allows for the pre-calibration of a VVA turbocharged SI ICE on completely theoretical basis and proves to be very helpful in reducing the experimental costs and the engine time-to-market...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} the first {{investigation}} {{on the effect of}} flow control methods on the part load performance in a spark ignition engine. For comparison of the methods, two control devices, port throttling and masking, were applied to a conventional engine without any design change of the intake port. Steady flow evaluation shows that steady flow rates per unit opening area and swirl ratio are very low compared with the port throttling and saturated from mid-stage valve lift, however, swirl increases slightly as the lift is higher in case of 1 / 4 masking control. In the part load performance, the effect of simple port throttling on lean misfire limit expansion is limited and insufficient; on the other hand a masking improves the limit considerably without any port modification for increasing swirl. Also the results show that the intake flow control improves the combustion with following two mechanisms: stratification induced by the combination of the flow pattern and the fuel injection timing attribute to ignition ability and the intensified flow ensure fast burn. In addition fuel consumption reduces under the flow controls and the reduction rate is different according to the operation conditions and control methods. At the Stoichiometric and/or low speed and <b>low</b> load the <b>throttling</b> method is more advantageous; however vice versa at lean and high load condition.
