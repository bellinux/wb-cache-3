5|$|Several {{procedures}} {{enable the}} Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister {{or members of}} the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's <b>legislative</b> <b>programme</b> for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} {{committees}} of the National Assembly. Committee membership {{is determined by}} the National Assembly. They are responsible for the studying and examination of bills, legislative initiatives, drafts of ordinances and other drafts of legal documents and reports assigned by the National Assembly or the Standing Committee. The committees provide the National Assembly and its Standing Committee with their opinions on the <b>legislative</b> <b>programme.</b> The committees supervise and conduct investigations within their respective competency and exercise powers which are stipulated by law. The National Assembly elects the Ethnic Council, which consists of a Chairman, Deputy Chairmen and other members. The Ethnic Council studies and recommends actions to the National Assembly; the National Assembly has to consult with the Ethnic Council before issuing any decisions on ethnic policy. The Chairman of the Ethnic Council has to attend meetings of the Government which concern ethnic policy. The powers of the Ethnic Council are comparable to those of the committees.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} growing {{influence}} {{of human rights}} issues on land rights, administration, management and tenure. In the last few decades, attention focussed on integrating economic and environmental considerations to achieve sustainable land use. The World Trade Organisation began in 1995. As a condition of membership, nations undertook <b>legislative</b> <b>programmes</b> aimed at reducing price distortions and barriers to international trade. Reducing trade barriers has direct effects on agricultural production as a major land use. Similarly, as signatories to the 1992 Rio Declaration, nations undertook caring for and reporting {{on the state of}} the environment. However, quality of life is also an issue in deciding what is sustainable development. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed in 1948, provided a framework for a series of international human rights conventions. These conventions now influence national <b>legislative</b> <b>programmes.</b> The purpose of this paper is to review some of the implications of human rights on rights in land and the production and use of spatial information...|$|R

25|$|In 1906, the Liberal party, led by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, won an {{overwhelming}} victory {{on a platform}} that promised social reforms for the working class. With 379 seats compared to the Conservatives' 132, the Liberals could confidently expect to pass their <b>legislative</b> <b>programme</b> through the Commons.

40|$|The present {{analysis}} heeds recent {{calls for}} a refocusing and reconceptualising of the substantive representation of women (SRW). It examines the parliamentary scrutiny of Westminster governments' <b>legislative</b> <b>programmes.</b> The findings show that whilst the proportion of SRW legislative proposals remains small (< 1 %), {{there has been a}} substantial increase in the amount of attention/visibility given to the SRW. Interventions are made by male and female parliamentarians (numerically more men; proportionately more women). Whilst the number of actors making such interventions has increased over time, the more striking finding is the increase in the substance and detail of interventions. This suggests: (a) the extent, quality and focus of SRW interventions are shaped by the interplay of ‘critical actors’ and overall presence of women parliamentarians; and (b) ‘critical actors’ need to be seen more in terms of the key role of particular individuals rather than all who act to bring about women-friendly policy change...|$|R
25|$|Friends of the Earth's Big Ask Campaign {{was one of}} {{the factors}} that {{influenced}} the government to include the Climate Change Bill in their <b>legislative</b> <b>programme.</b> The organisation demanded that the Bill should include legally binding targets for a reduction of at least 3% a year, amounting a total cut of around 80% by 2050. They considered that a 60% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 was not a sufficient contribution from developed countries to the international action on climate change.|$|E
25|$|Several {{partisan}} {{roles are}} filled by elected members. The Prime Minister {{is the head}} of government.

However, in September 2011, Low Thia Khiang, the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party of Singapore, which holds the most opposition seats in Parliament, {{said that he would}} not be accepting the title. Some of Parliament's work is carried out by select committees made up of small numbers of MPs. Standing Select Committees are permanently constituted to fulfil certain duties, and ad hoc Select Committees are established from time to time to deal with matters such studying the details of bills. In addition, selected PAP backbenchers sit on Government Parliamentary Committees that examine the policies, programmes and proposed legislation of government ministries.|$|E

5000|$|Youth Unlimited (abbreviated YU, {{formerly}} known as the American Federation of Reformed Young Men's Societies, the Young Calvinist League, and then the Young Calvinist Federation) is a youth ministry in Canada and the United States that was formed in September 1919. The organization {{has its roots in the}} Christian Reformed Church in North America, but partners with other Christian denominations. Youth Unlimited is one of three youth ministries under the Dynamic Youth Ministries umbrella organization, the other two being GEMS Girls' Clubs and the Calvinist Cadet Corps. In August 1950, the organization, which was then called the Young Calvinist Federation (YCF), released a report calling for the institution of educational programs and <b>legislative</b> <b>programmes</b> in order to afford African Americans [...] "rights and opportunities equal to those enjoyed by other members of society." [...] The American Federation of Reformed Young Women's Societies, which was founded in May 1932, merged into the YCF in December 1955. In August 1967, the YCF held an international convention in Edmonton, Alberta. From December 30, 1982 until January 2, 1983, the YCF co-sponsored a conference with members of local churches in Calgary. The name of the organization changed to Youth Unlimited (YU) in 1992. In 1998, the Ellensburg, Washington chapter of the organization spent three days removing graffiti from various parts of the city.

40|$|The 1945 - 50 Labour Government {{introduced}} one of {{the most}} extensive <b>legislative</b> <b>programmes</b> of the twentieth century, including a number of measures to take a wide range of industries into public ownership, which werc publicly opposed by the Conservatives. The Conservatives still had a permanent and insurmountable majority in the largely unreformed House of Lords, yet unlike the period of 1906 - 14 when they had last faced a large majority in the Commons of another political colour, they did not undertake a campaign of obstruction. The Lords challenged the final decision of the Commons only once, by insisting that the enactment of the controversial Iron and Steel Nationalisation Bill be delayed until after the 1950 general election. The period following the Second World War has been described as witnessing a political consensus between the parties, which was forged by their co-operation in the Wartime Coalition and although the policy of nationalisation has been seen as' a dividing line between Labour and the Conservatives, {{it has been argued that}} little real difference existed in principle even with regard to state ownership. This thesis will consider whether the Lords' cooperation was the result of little real conflict between the parties or whether the timidity of the peers might be better explained by the weak constitutional position they occupied. It will also assess the extent to which the Lords had become a revising chamber and the extent to which its members were still prepared to a party-political role. In doing so, it will consider the dramatic shift in the British political landscape that occurred in 1947 and suggest that the Lords' apparent constitutionalism should be understood within the context of a wider Conservative effort to regain the centre.

40|$|Effective {{functioning}} of the lobbying phenomenon facilitates economic development for every country. However this form of political participation can weaken economic growth {{if it is not}} properly controlled. In order to do that the Polish Parliament passed the Law on lobbying. This act introduced new legal terms (lobbying activity, professional lobbying activity) and new institutions (the Polish Lobbying Register, the <b>Legislative</b> Work <b>Programme,</b> a public hearing). It turned out that this statute had been a total failure in practice. Although many entities entered into the Polish Lobbying Register, there were few professional lobbying activities exercised in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, the Ministries, the Sejm and the Senate between 2006 and 2010. Other new institutions were used rarely as well. The Law on lobbying hinders development of lobbying phenomenon in the Republic of Poland and should be changed immediately...|$|R
