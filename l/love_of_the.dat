5|$|Halo.Bungie.Org is {{the most}} widely read Halo fansite. In 2007, it {{received}} about 600,000 page views a day. The site covers game news and rumors, strategy, fan-made machinima, stories and art, contests and forums. In the site's early years, it received {{only a small amount}} of fan-submitted material, which has ballooned since and made constant site maintenance a challenge. Errera attributes the site's longevity {{to the fact that it}} provided fans with not just Halo news but a place to share their <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> franchise. At a time when there was no easy video sharing via YouTube, Halo.bungie.org posted and categorized Halo films that fans submitted.|$|E

5|$|In Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, Lúthien was {{the most}} {{beautiful}} of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and forsook her immortality for her <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the Dark Lord Morgoth, Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking wolfhound Huan. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar, the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.|$|E

5|$|Lawless was {{attracted}} to the show because of her appreciation for its writing and after hearing the description of her role. She was prominently featured in promotional materials for Salems second season.

She avoided portraying Ingrid as a villain to focus on making her a more complex character.|$|E
5|$|On March 24, 1917, Baker {{played his}} last hockey {{game at the}} Winter Garden at Exposition Hall in Pittsburgh. The game pitted an amateur all-star team from Philadelphia, led by Baker, against an all-star team from Pittsburgh's amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team {{defeated}} Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3–2. Baker scored all three Philadelphia goals to net a hat trick. Baker began to tire of playing hockey after 1915; the constant physical play of opposing players on the ice had taken its toll, and the growing professionalism of the sport went against his belief that sports should be played for the <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E

Her mother was a nurse practitioner whose specialty was women's health. The Roffey family, including Sally and her three siblings, enjoyed the outdoors, and Sally went sailing and hiking from a young age. A two-week camping trip to teach children ecology inspired her <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outdoors when she was nine years old. She graduated in 1973 from Renton High School.|$|E

He seeks out the island's pirate leaders, who set him three trials that must be {{completed}} to become a pirate: winning a sword duel against Carla, the island's resident swordmaster, finding a buried treasure, and stealing a valuable idol from the governor's mansion. These quests take Guybrush throughout the island, where he hears of stories of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck, who apparently died in an expedition to the mysterious Monkey IslandTM, an act that was meant to win the <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governor Elaine Marley. Guybrush meets several characters of interest, including a local voodoo priestess, Stan the Used Boat Salesman, Carla the Sword Master, a prisoner named Otis, and Meathook, whose hands have been replaced by hooks.|$|E

5|$|Chappell {{grew up in}} the beachside {{suburb of}} Glenelg and {{attended}} the local St Leonard's Primary School where he played his first competitive match at the age of seven. He was later selected for the South Australian state schoolboys team. He then enrolled at Prince Alfred College, a private secondary school noted for producing many Test cricketers, including the Australian captains Joe Darling and Clem Hill. His other sporting pursuits included Australian football and baseball: Chappell's performances for South Australia in the Claxton Shield won him All-Australian selection in 1964 and 1966 as a catcher. He credits Vic Richardson, who had represented both SA and Australia in baseball during the 1920s, for his <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport. At the age of 18, his form in grade cricket for Glenelg led to his first-class debut for South Australia (SA) against Tasmania in early 1962. Chappell replaced West Indian Gary Sobers who was selected for a Test match in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cooper {{stayed with the}} Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about good food and vintage wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among Europe's nobility and upper classes. After guiding him through the great art museums and {{galleries}} of Italy, she accompanied him on a ten-week big-game hunting safari {{on the slopes of}} Mount Kenya in East Africa, where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes. His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wilderness. After returning to Europe, he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras. Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of his}} life, Rimsky-Korsakov {{combined}} his {{composition and}} teaching with {{a career in the}} Russian military—at first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea might have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and Scheherazade. Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law, Maximilian Steinberg.|$|E
