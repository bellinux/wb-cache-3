In this study, we investigate the effect of four different preprocessing methods to fault-proneness prediction using nine datasets from NASA Metrics Data Programs (MDP) and ten classification algorithms. Our experiments indicate that log transformation rarely improves classification performance, but discretization affects the performance of many different algorithms. The impact of different transformations differs. Random forest algorithm, for example, performs better with original and <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> set. Boosting and NaiveBayes perform significantly better with discretized data. We conclude that no general benefit can be expected from data transformations.

One of the more robust methods, quantile normalization, is commonly used in transcript (mRNA) studies and was therefore used for normalizing the first microRNA expression profiles of the NCI- 60 cell panel, published in 2007. In this study the appropriateness of VSN-Inv, a recently proposed alternative normalization method, to the NCI- 60 dataset is verified. VSN-Inv normalization results in much increased inter-sample correlations among control groups, and significantly higher intra-chip correlations of duplicate probes, versus quantile and no normalization. Furthermore, VSN-Inv normalization was found to have favorable performance for hierarchical clustering and discovery of miRNA-mRNA interactions, and a lower misclassification rate for predictive analysis based on tissue of origin when using <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> (median 0. 19, best 0. 12) ...|$|E

The results from the VAR model revealed that agriculture contributed about 58 % to GDP while industry contributed about 32 % to GDP in Nigeria. The study further revealed from the SVAR models that agriculture and industry contributed to the structural innovations of GDP in Nigeria but more contribution resulting from agriculture.

40|$|Every year, {{the federal}} {{government}} regulates how many pounds of summer flounder (while these fish are called summer flounder, they are caught throughout the year) can be caught along the eastern seaboard. Annually, {{the federal government}} sets the total allowable landings (TAL) based on biological considerations and the each state gets {{a percentage of the}} TAL as a quota. The percentage of TAL each state receives is based on historical landings. Each state can then allocate its quota among the months. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to establish an optimization model to maximize the annual revenue from catching summer flounder by allocating their annual quota among twelve months. The first stage of this research is to specify and estimate a model to predict monthly summer flounder prices with an inverse demand function. Since the federal government sets the TAL, the total supply of fluke and summer flounder is fixed each year. The market price at equilibrium clears this pre-determined quantity. Two major approaches to estimation are compared in terms forecasting accuracy. The first approach is the structural model approach using <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data.</b> The second approach is time series modeling, which includes ARIMA and VAR models. In the time series approach, both original and <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> are evaluated. The forecasting accuracy evaluation and out of sample testing of all models with both approaches, resulted in the structural model producing the best results. Regression analysis on the out-of-sample residuals for the structural model indicates that its forecasting is optimal and efficient. Diagnostic tests show that the model is statistically adequate. The structural model selected is a <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> model, which is applied in the second stage to maximize the revenue of summer flounder landings. The estimated log transformed model of the monthly real prices for summer flounder is as follows: the log of monthly real prices of summer flounder is a function of the log of monthly landing quantities of summer flounder, the log of monthly landing quantities of Atlantic flounder, the log of monthly landing quantities of winter flounder, the log of monthly landing quantities of yellowtail flounder, the log of monthly imports of frozen flounder, interaction and quadratic terms, yearly dummy variables, and a quantity index. Atlantic flounder, winter flounder, yellowtail flounder and total imported frozen flounder are substitutes for summer flounder in the structural model. In the second stage of the project, a revenue maximizing nonlinear programming problem is solved with different scenarios based on different monthly landing constraints for summer flounder. In each scenario, sensitivity analyses of the optimized revenue to the monthly substitute quantities from 1991 through 2005 are conducted. In all scenarios, the total revenue of summer flounder landings is least sensitive to the winter flounder landings. To study revenue change with the application of the optimization model, historical total annual landings are put into the optimization model as quota constraints. Total annual revenues for various scenarios from 1991 through to 2005 are higher than the historical revenues. In the various scenarios, the largest 15 year total increase is $ 46. 60 million and the lowest total increase is $ 36. 54 over actual landings. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

3000|$|Use of {{different}} independent variables for developing biomass models {{are still a}} subject of empirical debate (Sileshi 2014). Diameter at breast height (D) and total tree height (H) have been used widely for modelling scaling relationships between tree biomass components, H and DBH assuming different physical and biological first principles (Sileshi 2014). In this study first we developed the relationship between D 200 (here after D) and H as well as biomass components with D, H and stand density (StD). First we explored the appropriateness of a simple power-law relationship between AGB, D and H. This is because power-law scaling is supported by emergent theories of macroecology and thus recommended in biomass estimation to reduce the ambiguity about allometric relationships (Sileshi 2014, 2015). Initially we also explored the use of stand age as a covariate. However, we found stand age to be inappropriate due statistical complications such as collinearity that arise when combined with D and H. In addition, we explored stand-level variables especially stand density (StD) as a biological meaningful and potentially more predictive variable than stand age. Finally, we compared {{the performance of the}} power-law model with three other models involving D alone, H alone and their combination with StD.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundFaecal egg counts are {{a common}} {{indicator}} of nematode infection and since it is a heritable trait, it provides a marker for selective breeding. However, since resistance to disease changes as the adaptive immune system develops, quantifying temporal changes in heritability could help improve selective breeding programs. Faecal egg counts can be extremely skewed and difficult to handle statistically. Therefore, previous heritability analyses have log transformed faecal egg counts to estimate heritability on a latent scale. However, such transformations {{may not always be}} appropriate. In addition, analyses of faecal egg counts have typically used univariate rather than multivariate analyses such as random regression that are appropriate when traits are correlated. We present a method for estimating the heritability of untransformed faecal egg counts over the grazing season using random regression. ResultsReplicating standard univariate analyses, we showed the dependence of heritability estimates on choice of transformation. Then, using a multitrait model, we exposed temporal correlations, highlighting the need for a random regression approach. Since random regression can sometimes involve the estimation of more parameters than observations or result in computationally intractable problems, we chose to investigate reduced rank random regression. Using standard software (WOMBAT), we discuss the estimation of variance components for <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> using both full and reduced rank analyses. Then, we modelled the untransformed data assuming it to be negative binomially distributed and used Metropolis Hastings to fit a generalized reduced rank random regression model with an additive genetic, permanent environmental and maternal effect. These three variance components explained more than 80 % of the total phenotypic variation, whereas the variance components for the <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> accounted for considerably less. The heritability, on a link scale, increased from around 0. 25 {{at the beginning of the}} grazing season to around 0. 4 at the end. ConclusionsRandom regressions are a useful tool for quantifying sources of variation across time. Our MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm provides a flexible approach to fitting random regression models to non-normal data. Here we applied the algorithm to negative binomially distributed faecal egg count data, but this method is readily applicable to other types of overdispersed data...|$|E
40|$|Intraspecific or ontogenetic {{analyses}} of mass-metabolism relationships do not often {{conform to the}} same allometric correlations as those seen in interspecific analyses. A commonly cited reason for this discrepancy is that ontogenetic studies examine smaller mass ranges than interspecific studies, and are therefore not statistically comparable. In this study the metabolic rate of yellowtail kingfish was measured from 0. 6 mg- 2. 2 kg, a mass range comparable to that between a mouse and an elephant. Linear regression of the <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> resulted in a scaling exponent of 0. 90 and high correlation coefficient. Statistical and information theory comparisons of three other models showed that a segmented linear regression and curvilinear quadratic function were an improvement over a simple linear regression. This confirmed previous observations that the metabolic scaling exponent of fish changes during ontogeny. Ammonia excretion rates were also measured and scaled linearly with an exponent of 0. 87. The data showed that the metabolism of yellowtail kingfish during ontogeny did not scale with the commonly cited ⅔ or ¾ mass exponent. This demonstrates that differences between interspecific and ontogenetic allometries are not necessarily statistical artefacts...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the project "Validation of PESTLA" the Schaijk data set was used to analyse PESTLA model performance. The Schaijk data set contains field data on bentazon behaviour in a coarse textured humic gley soil cropped with maize. PESTLA model input parameters were derived from this data set and model simulations were performed. Comparison of model predictions with field measurements of bentazon concentrations in groundwater and contents in topsoil was done using graphical and statistical methods. The statistical method that was applied was the factor-of-f approach. This method acknowledges that both measurements and model simulations yield variable output. Variability implies that measurements and simulations are uncertain. This uncertainty is quantified and used to test the hypothesis that PESTLA model calculations are, or are not, sufficiently close to measurements. Application of the factor-of-f approach led to the conclusion that PESTLA simulated bentazon behaviour in Schaijk well. The hypothesis 'model is good' was never rejected and the hypothesis 'model is false' was rejected for almost all combinations of allowed uncertainty. The results given above were obtained with a value for bentazon half life as calculated using the standard method of linear regression on <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> dissipation <b>data.</b> However, calculation of bentazon half life using non-linear regression yielded a value that was almost twice as small.

40|$|SummaryFractional exhaled {{nitric oxide}} (FeNO) is a {{non-invasive}} biomarker of eosinophilic airway inflammation. Our {{aim was to}} study associations between FeNO in Chinese children in two cities and asthma, asthmatic symptoms, rhinitis, eczema, and selected childhood and home environmental factors. A random sample of children in Shanghai (n =  187) and Taiyuan (n =  127), and additional randomly selected children reporting current wheeze (n =  115) were invited for FeNO measurements by NIOX MINO. A questionnaire survey was performed among all subjects (12 – 14  y) in 59 classes in Shanghai and 44 in Taiyuan. Associations were studied using multiple linear regression using 10 <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> FeNO <b>data</b> and mutual adjustment. The geometric mean FeNO in the random sample (GM ± GSD) was higher in Shanghai (16. 2  ±  1. 9  ppb) as compared to Taiyuan (12. 8  ±  1. 6  ppb) (P <  0. 001). In the total material (n =  429), Shanghai residency (P =  0. 001), male gender (P =  0. 02), parental asthma/allergy (P =  0. 04), doctors' diagnosed asthma (DDA) (P <  0. 001) and current wheeze (P <  0. 001) were associated with higher FeNO levels. In non-wheezers (n =  291), Shanghai residency (P =  0. 007), male gender (P =  0. 002), DDA (P =  0. 04), current rhinitis (P =  0. 004) and reported pollen/furry pet allergy (P =  0. 04) were positively associated with FeNO. In wheezers (n =  138), DDA was the only significant factor (P =  0. 009). In conclusion, male gender, current wheeze, DDA, parental asthma/allergy, current rhinitis, pollen/furry pet allergy can be independent determinants of increased FeNO. The lower level of FeNO in Taiyuan is in agreement with previous studies showing lower prevalence of asthma and allergy in Taiyuan as compared to Shanghai...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Normalization is an {{important}} step for microarray data analysis to minimize biological and technical variations. Choosing a suitable approach can be critical. The default method in GeneChip expression microarray uses a constant factor, the scaling factor (SF), for every gene on an array. The SF is obtained from a trimmed average signal of the array after excluding the 2 % of the probe sets with the highest and the lowest values. Results Among the 76 U 34 A GeneChip experiments, the total signals on each array showed 25. 8 % variations in terms of the coefficient of variation, although all microarrays were hybridized with the same amount of biotin-labeled cRNA. The 2 % of the probe sets with the highest signals that were normally excluded from SF calculation accounted for 34 % to 54 % of the total signals (40. 7 % ± 4. 4 %, mean ± sd). In comparison with normalization factors obtained from the median signal or from the mean of the <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> signal, SF showed the greatest variation. The normalization factors obtained from <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> signals showed least variation. Conclusions Eliminating 40 % of the signal data during SF calculation failed to show any benefit. Normalization factors obtained with <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> signals performed the best. Thus, it is suggested to use the mean of the logarithm <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> for normalization, rather than the arithmetic mean of signals in GeneChip gene expression microarrays. </p...|$|R

40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between culture and {{molecular}} analytical methodologies of Enterococcus bacteria from water samples collected in western Broward County, Florida. Samples were collected monthly at 9 sites from May through July 2015. Cultures were prepared by membrane filtration EPA Method 1600 {{on the day}} of collection. Aliquots ranging from 300 to 900 mL were filtered through a 0. 45 um membrane filter and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results of colony forming units (cfu) and genome copies of target DNA (gDNA) were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis. Using <b>log</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>data,</b> results from regression analysis show a positive correlation between methods (r = 0. 49). ANOVA analysis was performed with log transformed cfu and gDNA values to test the null hypothesis that means for both methods were equal. A comparison between methods for all data points show that the overall results are statistically significant with a p value 3 ̆c 0. 05 (p = 1. 4 x 10 - 8). Monthly comparisons made between methods also show that results are statistically significant with a p value 3 ̆c 0. 05 (May p = 0. 02, June p = 1. 1 x 10 - 4, July p = 0. 02). Although both methodologies are used to determine the amount of enterococci present in a sample, this test rejects the null hypothesis that the values achieved by both methods are equal...|$|E

In order to assess changes in rhizobacterial community structure between different plant species, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on Bray Curtis similarity measure was applied to analyze unbalanced data of ARISA matrices with {{a high number of}} 0 and non-Gaussian distribution of peaks’ height/area. NMDS avoids the assumption of linear relationships among variables, and it is reported to be the most effective ordination method for ecological community data (Clarke 1993).|$|R
40|$|Individuals of Mytilus chiloensis (Hupè, 1854) and Nacella magellanica metalica (Rochebrune and Mabille, 1885) were {{evaluated}} as possible biomonitors of trace metal baseline contamination in the Beagle Channel, Tierra de Fuego (Argentina). The selected species {{have the necessary}} prerequisites for use as biomonitors. They are well distributed in all coastal areas of the Beagle Channel and other regional seas, {{they are easy to}} identify and available all year round. The first aim of this preliminary survey is to evaluate the concentrations of Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn present in soft tissues of the selected species in order to have more information on the use of these selected species as possible cosmopolitan biomonitors. Samples were collected in seven stations situated along 170 km of the coast in the tidal zone. The validity of these two species as bioaccumulators was tested. Significant differences between metal concentrations in molluscs from different stations were tested by ANCOVA on <b>log</b> 10 <b>transformed</b> <b>data</b> with body weight as covariate. Multiple comparison tests (MCT) were conducted when significant differences were detected among the stations. In M. chiloensis metal concentrations decreased in the order: Zn > Cu > Pb ≥ Cr while for Nacella metal concentrations decreased in the order: Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb showing good bioaccumulation ability. At present, they can be considered as good candidates as trace metals biomonitors for the studied area. From all the obtained data and statistical analysis (ANCOVA, MCT) the results showed clearly that there is no one site univocally more contaminated (with clearly high levels of metals accumulation in biomonitors) than any other. Thus the possible hypothesis of the Ushuaia Harbour as being the most contaminated site must be reconsidered. Metal concentrations recorded may be used for background levels for intraspecific comparison within the Patagonian seas...|$|R
