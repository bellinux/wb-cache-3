5|$|Some of the {{properties}} that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the <b>linguistic</b> sign, meaning {{that there is no}} predictable connection between a <b>linguistic</b> sign and its meaning; the duality of the <b>linguistic</b> system, meaning that <b>linguistic</b> structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which <b>linguistic</b> signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the <b>linguistic</b> system, meaning that the finite number of <b>linguistic</b> elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{orangutan}} symbolic capability was conducted from 1973 to 1975 by zoologist Gary L. Shapiro with Aazk, a juvenile female orangutan at the Fresno City Zoo (now Chaffee Zoo) in Fresno, California. The study employed {{the techniques of}} psychologist David Premack, who used plastic tokens to teach <b>linguistic</b> skills to the chimpanzee, Sarah. Shapiro continued to examine the <b>linguistic</b> and learning abilities of ex-captive orangutans in Tanjung Puting National Park, in Indonesian Borneo, between 1978 and 1980.|$|E
5|$|By {{introducing}} {{a distinction between}} diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid {{the foundation of the}} modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of <b>linguistic</b> analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary <b>linguistic</b> theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).|$|E

5|$|The <b>Linguistic</b> Society of America (LSA) is {{a learned}} {{society for the}} field of linguistics. Founded {{at the end of}} 1924 in New York City, the LSA works to promote the {{scientific}} study of language. The Society publishes two scholarly journals, Language and the open access journal Semantics and Pragmatics. Its annual meetings, held every winter, foster discussion amongst its members through the presentation of peer-reviewed research, as well as conducting official business of the Society. Since 1928, the LSA has offered training to linguists through courses held at its biennial <b>Linguistic</b> Institutes held in the summer. The LSA and its 3,500 members work to raise awareness of <b>linguistic</b> issues with the public and contributes to policy debates on issues including bilingual education and the preservation of endangered languages.|$|E
5|$|The Mayan {{language}} {{family has}} no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families.

5|$|The editors {{have not}} {{published}} a comprehensive {{catalogue of the}} <b>linguistic</b> papers {{they are working on}} and that were not published by Christopher Tolkien in the History of Middle-earth; new Tolkienian <b>linguistic</b> material continues to emerge, although the pace of publication is irregular.|$|E
5|$|The {{first meeting}} of the <b>Linguistic</b> Society of America (LSA) took place on 28 December 1924, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The Society met biannually until 1982, meeting once in the summer in {{conjunction}} with the <b>Linguistic</b> Institute and once in the winter. Since 1982, the LSA has met annually in the winter. The meetings took place in December until 1990 when the meetings were moved to early January.|$|E
5|$|Training {{can help}} the user make use of their AAC system to {{communicate}} effectively with others, to control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions and mistakes. Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas: <b>linguistic,</b> operational, social and strategic. <b>Linguistic</b> competence refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} <b>linguistic</b> code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Various <b>linguistic</b> or poetic devices {{provide for}} rhymes in some accents.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. <b>Linguistic</b> differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} <b>linguistic</b> system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E

5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most <b>linguistic</b> signs is based on social convention, <b>linguistic</b> signs can be considered arbitrary, {{in the sense that the}} convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a <b>Linguistic</b> Institute was first {{proposed}} {{in the spring of}} 1927 by Reinhold Saleski. The fledgling Society was hesitant at first, but Edgar Sturtevant was keen on the idea. Sturtevant molded Saleski's idea into a model still used today: a gathering of scholars in conjunction with coursework. The Executive Committee voted to authorize the first <b>Linguistic</b> Institute, to be held 1928, along with authorization for a second institute in 1929. After the fourth Institute in 1931, the program took a four-year hiatus due to the great depression. Institutes were held every year concurrently with summer meetings of the LSA until 1988 when, due to increasing costs, the Society announced that the <b>Linguistic</b> Institutes would be held every other year. It was at that same time that the summer meeting of the LSA was also discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The next {{period in}} the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and <b>linguistic</b> standardisation.|$|E

25|$|The {{degree and}} depth of <b>linguistic</b> relativity. Perhaps a few {{examples}} of superficial differences in language and associated behavior are enough to demonstrate the existence of <b>linguistic</b> relativity. Alternatively, perhaps only deep differences that permeate the <b>linguistic</b> and cultural system suffice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Linguistic</b> rights {{became more}} and more {{prominent}} throughout the course of history as language came to be increasingly seen as a part of nationhood. Although policies and legislation involving language have been in effect in early European history, these were often cases where a language was being imposed upon people while other languages or dialects were neglected. Most of the initial literature on <b>linguistic</b> rights came from countries where <b>linguistic</b> and/or national divisions grounded in <b>linguistic</b> diversity have resulted in <b>linguistic</b> rights playing a vital role in maintaining stability. However, {{it was not until the}} 1900s that <b>linguistic</b> rights gained official status in politics and international accords.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>linguistic</b> {{intelligence}} {{is based on}} several complex skills, there are many disorders and injuries that can affect an individual's <b>linguistic</b> intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Lenneberg's main {{criticism}} of Whorf's works {{was that he}} never showed the connection between a <b>linguistic</b> phenomenon and a mental phenomenon. With Brown, Lenneberg proposed that proving such a connection required directly matching <b>linguistic</b> phenomena with behavior. They assessed <b>linguistic</b> relativity experimentally and published their findings in 1954.|$|E
25|$|The <b>linguistic</b> stage {{from the}} 13th to the 15th centuries is usually known as Galician-Portuguese (or Old Portuguese, or Old Galician) as an {{acknowledgement}} of the cultural and <b>linguistic</b> unity of Galicia and Portugal during the Middle Ages, as both <b>linguistic</b> varieties differed only in dialectal minor phenomenons, and were considered by contemporaries as just one language.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally {{governments and}} <b>linguistic</b> {{institutions}} of both Quebec and France have undertaken strenuous efforts to eradicate Anglicisms, often by suggesting French replacements with French phonology and morphology. Although efforts in Quebec {{have been met}} with some success (ex: fin de semaine for week-end), attempts by the Académie française have largely been unsuccessful. Sociolinguists have attributed these failures to the general inability of <b>linguistic</b> institutions to enforce a <b>linguistic</b> norm. The Académie française regularly updates a list of prescribed <b>linguistic</b> norms, many of which include using suggested French replacements instead of anglicisms (ex: mot-dièse for hashtag).|$|E
25|$|<b>Linguistic</b> {{competence}} {{is the system}} of <b>linguistic</b> knowledge possessed by native speakers of a language. It is distinguished from <b>linguistic</b> performance, {{which is the way}} a language system is used in communication. Noam Chomsky introduced this concept in his elaboration of generative grammar, where it has been widely adopted and {{competence is}} the only level of language that is studied.|$|E
25|$|Mesoamerican {{languages}} are the languages indigenous to the Mesoamerican cultural area, which covers southern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize {{and parts of}} Honduras and El Salvador and Nicaragua. The area is characterized by extensive <b>linguistic</b> diversity containing several hundred different languages and seven major language families. Mesoamerica is also an area of high <b>linguistic</b> diffusion in that long-term interaction among speakers of different languages through several millennia {{has resulted in the}} convergence of certain <b>linguistic</b> traits across disparate language families. The Mesoamerican sprachbund is commonly referred to as the Mesoamerican <b>Linguistic</b> Area.|$|E

25|$|The {{most basic}} {{definition}} of <b>linguistic</b> rights {{is the right}} of individuals to use their language {{with other members of}} their <b>linguistic</b> group, regardless of the status of their language. They evolve from general human rights, in particular: non-discrimination, freedom of expression, right to private life, and the right of members of a <b>linguistic</b> minority to use their language with other members of their community.|$|E
25|$|The strongest form of {{the theory}} is <b>linguistic</b> determinism, which holds that {{language}} entirely determines the range of cognitive processes. The hypothesis of <b>linguistic</b> determinism is now generally agreed to be false.|$|E
25|$|While the {{capabilities}} of the physical structures used are large factors in determining <b>linguistic</b> intelligence, there have been several genes that have been linked to individual <b>linguistic</b> ability. The NRXN1 gene has been linked to general language ability, and mutations of this gene has been shown to cause major issues to overall <b>linguistic</b> intelligence. The CNTNAP2 gene is believed to affect language development and performance, and mutations in this gene is thought to be involved in autism spectrum disorders. PCDH11 has been linked to language capacity, and it is believed {{to be one of the}} factors that accounts for the variation in <b>linguistic</b> intelligence.|$|E
