[...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>try</b> to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} commended by several critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "I've {{never met anyone}} like Forrest Gump in a movie before, {{and for that matter}} I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to {{describe}} him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>try.</b> It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film [...] "reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland's {{voice is}} {{classified}} as a three-octave lyric mezzo-soprano, and her music includes various styles of musical genres such as contemporary R, pop, hip hop, soul, rock and dance. Her debut solo album Simply Deep (2002) followed an adult-alternative rock sound, while her second album Ms. Kelly (2007) featured an urban sound. In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two albums she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>try</b> a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it...And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] Her third album Here I Am (2011) consisted of a pop and R sound, with subtle influences of dance. Rowland stated that meeting David Guetta had influenced her to record dance music. During production of the album, Rowland stated {{that part of the}} reason for the new sound on Here I Am was wanting to do something different, saying [...] "I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of George Martin, [...] "At that stage 'Please Please Me' was a very dreary song. It was like a Roy Orbison number, very slow, bluesy vocals. It was {{obvious to me that}} it badly needed pepping up. I told them to bring it in next time and we'd have another go at it." [...] He asked the Beatles to {{consider}} making major changes to it, including increasing its tempo. By the time it was brought back into the studio on 26 November 1962, its arrangement had been radically altered, and it took 18 takes to record what George Martin immediately predicted would be their first major hit. Paul McCartney in Anthology stated: [...] "We sang it and George Martin said, 'Can we change the tempo?' We said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Make it a bit faster. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>try</b> it.' And he did. We thought, 'Oh, that's all right, yes.' Actually, we were a bit embarrassed that he had found a better tempo than we had." ...|$|E

And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted {{to make sure it was}} a look that was all me, you know?." [...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!." [...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." ...|$|E

40|$|Preface Having finally {{completed}} this thesis, I {{would like to}} thank my supervisors, Jan Holst and BengtJohansson, for their enthusiasm and patience, and for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>try</b> out strange ideas, even when, as it turned out, none of us really understood them. I also direct a collective "thanks " to the various peoplein Mattehuset who have happily answered my sometimes mysterious questions. A special thanks to my father/professor Georg Lindgren, for having the idea of using a "MonteCarlo Blob Generator", and my sister, Anna, for providing invaluable linguistic suggestions. Also, this work {{would not have been possible}} without the company of the many merry musiciansin two fabulous orchestras, Akademiska Kapellet and Lunds Nya Kammarorkester, where I have been allowed to play the cello to my hearts content. Finally, I {{would like to thank}} mahler and Mahler 1, the vital computer for patiently performing tedious tasks, and the late composer for writing the long symphonies that have entertained the formerduring her work...|$|R

60|$|With all his {{attention}} bent {{in this new}} direction, Darwin soon noticed that a good deal was occurring in an entirely unmystical and even unmeaning way of which the older speculative Deist-Evolutionists had taken little or no account. Nowadays, when we are turning in weary disgust and disillusion from Neo-Darwinism and Mechanism to Vitalism and Creative Evolution, {{it is difficult to}} imagine how this new departure of Darwin's could possibly have appealed to his contemporaries as exciting, agreeable, above all as hopeful. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> therefore <b>try</b> to bring back something of the atmosphere of that time by describing a scene, very characteristic of its superstitions, in which I took what was then considered an unspeakably shocking part.|$|R

30|$|If status rights – remuneration, {{intrinsic}} job quality, security – are {{the main}} components of the dependent variable, what are the components of the independent variable? Leaving aside the important question of how the remuneration of investors, entrepreneurs, and managers is to be explained and justified (standard answers refer to the need to compensate them for refraining from consumption, to dividends being a premium for the risks they undergo, or to rewards for the performance of highly skilled and demanding entrepreneurial tasks), I  concentrate on the remuneration and other aspects of the organizational status of non-managerial employees. The determinants that enter into the negotiation and definition of their hierarchical status include skills, experience, seniority, gender, time, and “responsibility”. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> briefly <b>try</b> to disentangle some of the ambiguities inherent in this set of independent variables.|$|R
60|$|I placed {{before you}} in a few words, some little time ago, a {{statement}} of the sum and substance of Milton's hypothesis. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>try</b> to state as briefly, the effect of the circumstantial evidence bearing upon the past history of the earth which is furnished, without the possibility of mistake, with no chance of error as to its chief features, by the stratified rocks. What we find is, that the great series of formations represents a period of time of which our human chronologies hardly afford us a unit of measure. I will not pretend to say how we ought to estimate this time, in millions or in billions of years. For my purpose, the determination of its absolute duration is wholly unessential. But that the time was enormous there can be no question.|$|R

The magazines and papers of the day have indeed been liberal enough in this respect. Most of these essays have been regularly reprinted twice or thrice a year, and conveyed to the public through the kennel of some engaging compilation. If there be a pride in multiplied editions, I have seen some of my labors sixteen times reprinted, and claimed by different parents as their own. I have seen them flourished at the beginning with praise, and signed at the end {{with the names of}} Philautos, Philalethes, Phileleutheros, and Philanthropos.
