50|$|The numbers {{detailed}} {{above are}} only general indications. The space allocated to animals on <b>livestock</b> <b>carriers</b> is officially regulated {{according to their}} size and weight ranges. Larger and heavier animals are allocated proportionately more space per head.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} three {{decades of the twentieth century}} there was a {{progressive}} trend towards large vessels carrying greater numbers of animals. Prior to that, a significant limitation had been fresh water storage capacity on ships.To maintain condition, average-sized cattle require at least forty litres of water per head, per day. Sheep require at least four litres per head - per day.Developments in water production technology (salt water evaporators or reverse-osmosis systems) eventually led to <b>livestock</b> <b>carriers</b> with equipment capable of producing up to 600 tonnes of fresh water per day.Sheep and cattle also require fodder amounting to at least 2% of their body weight per day. <b>Livestock</b> <b>carriers</b> are required to carry sufficient feedstuffs for the maximum length of the voyage plus adequate reserves for emergencies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Livestock</b> <b>carriers</b> {{carry more}} crew members than {{conventional}} cargo ships {{of a similar}} size. Experienced stockmen are {{an essential part of}} the crew. The total number of stockmen required varies according to the number of animals and also depends on factors such as the arrangement of the livestock pens and the extent of automated systems installed for feeding and watering.|$|R

50|$|In practice, natural {{ventilation}} alone isn't adequate for all situations. One obvious limiting factor {{would be in}} following wind conditions at sea, when the air moves {{at the same speed}} as the ship. In that condition the natural air flow ventilating the animal pens can be insufficient. On most open <b>livestock</b> <b>carriers</b> there is also some type of supplementary mechanical ventilation installed in critical zones, along with appropriate back-up equipment for emergencies.|$|R
50|$|Subject to {{appropriate}} regulation, live animals may be transported {{as part of}} the cargo on various classes of ship. That particular method of transportation is more common on short sea crossings (e.g. ferries) and usually involves relatively small numbers of animals.Livestock carriers are those ships, which specialise exclusively in the transportation of large numbers of live animals together with their requirements for the voyage. (food, water, sawdust bedding, medication, etc.).Voyages on <b>livestock</b> <b>carriers</b> generally last from three days to three to four weeks.|$|R
50|$|Open <b>livestock</b> <b>carriers</b> - {{in which}} all, or most, {{of the animal}} pens are {{installed}} on open decks. In theory, this provides continuous natural ventilation of the pen areas and avoids reliance on mechanical ventilation systems. Ventilation is {{a key factor in}} the transport of live animals. When animal pens become poorly ventilated, oxygen depletion and a build-up of toxic gases, develops very rapidly. Circumstances vary according to ambient conditions but a failure of ventilation systems in some tropical conditions can result in asphyxiation of animals in as little as two or three hours.|$|R

40|$|AbstractStaphylococcus aureus {{has long}} been {{associated}} with livestock. <b>Livestock</b> can be <b>carriers</b> of S. aureus, but can also become infected.

ST 398 is pandemic. Whole genome sequencing and other genetic analyses have shown that livestock-associated strains are distinct from human-derived strains. However, {{there is also an}} exchange of strains between the reservoirs. Livestock-associated and human-associated strains share virulence factors, but have also distinct virulence factors that appear to be important in host adaptation. Exchange of genes encoding these virulence factors between strains may expand the host range and thereby threaten public health.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied, yet it remains unclear why certain individuals continually carry the bacteria while others do not. Livestock workers {{are known to be}} at an increased risk of S. aureus colonization, but have not been as studied as other high risk groups, including hospitalized patients, have been. Culture based studies have shown other bacteria may decrease the likelihood of S. aureus colonization. Here, we utilize 16 s rRNA sequencing to better characterize the ecologic relationships between S. aureus and the other microbes in the nares and oropharynx in a population of livestock workers. A cross-sectional, epidemiological study was conducted enrolling 59 participants (26 of which had livestock contact) in Iowa. Participants were enrolled in one of four ways: from an existing prospective cohort study (n= 38), from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources Animal Feeding Operations database (n= 17), through Iowa county fairs (n= 3), and through snowball sampling (n= 1). We collected two sets of swabs from the nares and oropharynx of each participant. The first set of swabs was used to assess the microbiome via 16 s rRNA sequencing and the second was used to culture S. aureus. We observed livestock workers to have greater diversity in their microbiomes compared to those with no livestock contact. In the nares, there were 26 operational taxonomic units found to be different between livestock workers and non-livestock workers with the greatest difference seen with Streptococcus and Proteobacteria. In the oropharynx, livestock workers with swine exposure were more likely to carry several pathogenic organisms. We also observed colonized livestock workers to be more likely to carry P. gingivalis which may act as a bridge allowing S. aureus to adhere to Streptococcus in the oral cavity. While we observed no significant differences when comparing colonized persons to non-colonized persons in either the nares or oropharynx, Corynebacterium was more abundant in the colonized persons. Colonized individuals also had greater diversity in their nasal microbiome compared to non-colonized individuals. However, when comparing persistently colonized persons to intermittently colonized persons, we found Corynebacterium argentorantense to be more abundant in the persistently colonized individuals. We hypothesized the genera present in the nares and oropharynx of S. aureus carriers would be different from that of non-carriers and there would be differences in the nasal and oropharyngeal microbiomes based on <b>livestock</b> contact and <b>carrier</b> state (persistent, intermittent, and non-carrier). While {{there were no significant differences}} between carriers and non-carriers, we were able to identify several operational taxonomic units that were different between <b>livestock</b> worker <b>carrier</b> and non-carriers as well as differences by carrier state. The results of this study are the first to characterize the livestock worker nasal and oropharyngeal microbiomes. Additionally, the results shed light onto several organisms that may be influential in S. aureus carriage. However, further studies are needed to better understand these relationships and determine causality...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} three decades wild boar populations have grown rapidly and the range of the species has {{increased}} steadily, covering almost the whole European continent today. The huge spread of the wild boar and the high population densities pose major problems, particularly to agriculture. Wild boars cause considerable damage to fields and grassland, but also pose a potentially high threat to <b>livestock,</b> as <b>carrier</b> of the pathogen of the classical swine fever, which may be transmitted to domestic pigs and can cause huge losses. To prevent economic problems by high wild boar populations, an effective wild boar management has to be established. Besides the regulation of the populations by means of hunting, vulnerable crop fields have to be protected adequately. Crop protection is usually achieved by the use of electric fences. Alternatively, various methods are available that claim effective deterrence of wild boars, however, most of which lacking scientific proof of effectiveness. This thesis, based on a field study conducted in the Canton Basel-Land, northwestern Switzerland, presents research results on the effectiveness of three different deterrent systems: solar-powered blinkers, an odour repellent, and a gustatory repellent. The aims of the study were: (1) to investigate three means to deter wild boars from agricultural land representative for other deterrents based on optic, olfactory, or gustatory effects; (2) to provide relevant and evidence-based data, which contribute to the policy and practice of wild boar management and damage prevention in the Canton Basel-Land, also applicable to other regions. I discussed the results in a broader context, also considering the role of hunting in damage prevention. Solar blinkers and the odour repellent, which were investigated at baited luring sites, reduced the probability of wild boar visits by 8. 1...|$|R
