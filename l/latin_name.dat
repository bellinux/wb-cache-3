5|$|The Channel Islands are {{mentioned}} in the Antonine Itinerary as the following: Sarnia, Caesarea, Barsa, Silia and Andium, but Jersey cannot be identified specifically because none corresponds directly to the present names. The name Caesarea {{has been used as}} the <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> for Jersey (also in its French version Césarée) since William Camden's Britannia, and is used in titles of associations and institutions today. The <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> Caesarea was also applied to the colony of New Jersey as Nova Caesarea.|$|E

5|$|Ajtony's {{ethnicity}} is debated. Historian Paul Stephenson {{described him}} as a Magyar chieftain; according to historian László Makkai, he was of Kabar origin and his Turkic name may imply {{that he was a}} Pecheneg. In Romanian historiography, Ajtony has been considered the last member of a Romanian dynasty descended from Glad; historian Alexandru Madgearu wrote that the <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> of Ajtony's seat (urbs Morisena) preserved a Romanian form.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, dragonflies and damselflies are {{sought out}} as a hobby similar to birding and butterflying, known as oding, from the <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> of the {{dragonfly}} order, Odonata.

5|$|Hafnium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and {{is found in}} many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, {{though it was not}} identified until 1923, by Coster and Hevesy, making it the last stable element to be discovered. Hafnium is named after Hafnia, the <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|In the mid 19th century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick, used their {{studies of the}} geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. From the <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> for Wales, Cambria (derived from Cymru), was derived {{the name of the}} earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian. After much dispute, the next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after pre-Roman Celtic tribes of Wales, the Ordovices and Silures.|$|E

Day changed her name to Sabrina Sidney: Sabrina, the <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> for the River Severn, which her orphanage overlooked; and Sidney after Algernon Sidney, one of Day's heroes. Day became a benefactor, and subsequently governor, of the Foundling Hospital, and on 20 September 1769 he chose another girl for his experiment, renaming her Lucretia after the Roman matron.|$|E

5|$|The name {{cerebellum}} is {{a diminutive}} of cerebrum (brain); {{it can be}} translated literally as little brain. The <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> is a direct translation of the Ancient Greek παρεγκεφαλίς (parencephalis), which {{was used in the}} works of Aristotle, the first known writer to describe the structure. No other name is used in the English-language literature, but historically a variety of Greek or Latin-derived names have been used, including cerebrum parvum, encephalion, encranion, cerebrum posterius, and parencephalis.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of Ely's name have always been {{regarded}} as obscure by place-name scholars, and are still disputed. The earliest record of the name is in the Latin text of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, where Bede wrote Elge. This is apparently not a <b>Latin</b> <b>name,</b> and subsequent Latin texts nearly all used the forms Elia, Eli, or Heli with inorganic H-. In Old English charters, and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the spelling is usually Elig.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} was first was {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Alauda spinoletta (characterised as A. rectricibus fuscis : extimis duabus oblique dimidiato-albis). The current genus Anthus was created for the pipits by German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1805. Anthus is the <b>Latin</b> <b>name</b> for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific spinoletta is a local dialect word for a pipit from the Florence area of Italy.|$|E
