40|$|<b>Life</b> <b>saving</b> {{appliances}} {{are used}} throughout Canada {{and around the}} world every day by a large number of individuals who work or travel over open water. Personnel rely on these <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> appliances to help provide protection from harsh environments, and reduce the risk of injury or death {{in the event of a}} marine accident. Due to their importance in helping to save lives at sea, <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> appliances are built and tested according to specific standards and regulations to ensure that they provide the level of performance required. Unfortunately, <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> appliances do not always perform as expected which can lead to unexpected injuries or loss of life. Given that <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> appliances must meet specific performance goals as prescribed by standards and regulations, it is often these goals that fall short of what is actually needed during a marine accident. A knowledge gap is created when the testing conditions, as outlined in a standard or regulation, do not accurately reflect those conditions found during a marine accident. As a result, a <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> appliance will often meet performance goals that are below those required to prevent an injury or loss of life during an actual marine accident. The Canadian regulation: 'Life Saving Equipment Regulations' C. R. C., c. 1436 was reviewed and possible knowledge gaps with respect to human factors were identified. The goals and requirements for <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> appliances in the regulation were compared against existing work done in the area of marine safety to determine if what was prescribed adequately reflected what could be found during a marine accident. There were many gaps identified in the regulation, commonly caused by prescriptive wording specifying conditions not commonly found during a marine accident. These knowledge gaps will widen as conditions become more severe than what is prescribed in the regulations possibly leading to even further decrease in <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> appliance performance than what is already measured.
