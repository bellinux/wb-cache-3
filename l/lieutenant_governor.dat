5|$|Seven other Democratic {{candidates}} for <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> entered the race, {{the most formidable}} being sitting attorney general John B. Breckinridge. While Combs lost to Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> partly {{on the strength of}} the Eastern Kentucky votes he gained from his association with Combs. Carroll went on to defeat Republican Jim Host in the general election for <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor.</b> As <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> Carroll chaired the Legislative Research Commission and the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> of the same party.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> {{was created in}} 1868, {{abolished}} in 1875, and recreated in 1901. According to the current constitution, should the governor {{be out of the}} state for more than 20 days, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes acting governor, and if the office of governor becomes vacant the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> ascends to the governorship. Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor, but the official listing includes these as full governors. The governor and <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> are not elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{original}} {{terms of the}} state constitution, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> was elected for a two-year term on a separate ticket from the governor; because of this, the Governor and <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> of Wisconsin {{have not always been}} of the same party. After a 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted upon, as a single ticket. Another 1967 amendment increased the terms of both the governor and <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> to four years. There is no limit to the number of terms a <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> may hold.|$|E

5|$|If the {{governor}} becomes incapacitated, then the <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> of Indiana becomes acting-governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become incapacitated during their terms, and current precedent is that {{the governor}}'s office is to notify the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> who will then {{make the decision to}} become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes governor. If the office of the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E

Further, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governors</b> (as well as the territorial commissioners) present the Vice-Regal and Commissioners' Commendation to individuals who offer their service—paid or volunteer—to the viceregal offices. It was originally {{intended to be a}} distinction in place of appointment to the Royal Victorian Order, regularly granted to those who aided the monarch or governor general with distinction, but nominees from the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governors</b> were frequently overlooked by staff at Rideau Hall. However, after 1984, suggestions from the lieutenant governors' offices for membership in the Royal Victorian Order were more readily accepted and the Vice-Regal and Commissioners' Commendation became an award for one or more commendable acts benefiting the viceroy.|$|R
5|$|If {{the office}} of {{governor}} becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes governor {{for the remainder of}} the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor. The position of <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> could actually become governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the {{president}} of the state senate acted as governor should that office be vacant. The 1865 and 1868 constitutions created the office of <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> who would similarly act as governor. This office was abolished in 1885, with {{the president}} of the senate again taking on that duty. The 1968 constitution recreated the office of <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> who now becomes governor in the absence of the governor. The governor and <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes governor. If both the offices governor and <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> are vacant, the line of succession moves down through the {{senior members of the}} state senate and state house of representatives of the same party as the governor. The <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> was elected separately from the governor until a 1968 amendment to the constitution made it so that they are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> of New Jersey is {{an elected}} {{constitutional}} {{officer in the}} executive branch of the state government of New Jersey in the United States. The <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> is the second highest-ranking official in the state government and is elected concurrently on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Because the position itself does not carry any powers or duties other than to be next in the order of succession, the state constitution requires that the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> be appointed to serve as the head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration.|$|E

5|$|The <b>lieutenant</b> <b>{{governor}}</b> of Indiana {{serves as}} acting governor when the governor becomes incapacitated. In the state's early history, lieutenant governors {{would serve as}} acting governor while the governor was away from the capital. Christopher Harrison was the first <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> to serve as acting governor while Jonathan Jennings negotiated treaties far from the capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the powers exercised by the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> are statutory and have been assigned by the Indiana General Assembly. The first additional powers granted to the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> were added in 1932 when the office holder was made {{the head of the}} state's agricultural commission. The office's powers have since expanded to include the chairmanship of the Office of Community and Rural Affairs, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, Office of Energy and Defense Development, and the Office of Tourism Development. As head of the various office and committees, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> controls many patronage positions and is permitted to fill them by appointment. Important positions filled by the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> include the members of the Corn Marketing Council, the Main Street Council, Steel Advisory Commission, and the Indiana Film Commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} constitution made {{no provision}} for a vacancy {{in the office of}} the lieutenant governor; in the event of the lieutenant governor's death or resignation, the lieutenant governorship usually remained vacant until the end of the term. In 1938, following the resignation of <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> Henry Gunderson, Governor Philip La Follette appointed Herman Ekern <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> to fill the vacancy. This appointment was challenged in court, and ruled valid in the case State ex rel. Martin v. Ekern. In 1979 the constitution was amended to explicitly allow this: in the event of a vacancy {{in the office of the}} <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> the governor nominates a candidate who becomes <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> for the remainder of the term upon his approval by the Wisconsin Assembly and Wisconsin State Senate.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} has provided since 1777 {{for the election}} of a <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> who is also ex officio president of the state senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> would become acting governor {{until the end of the}} yearly legislative term, the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 constitution, the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> become vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate performs all the duties of the <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> until the vacancy is filled either at the next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president pro tempore acts as governor, with the office of <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> remaining vacant. Should the presidency pro tempore be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the speaker of the assembly is next in the line of succession. The <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> is elected on the same ticket as the governor, since 1954 with a single joint vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.|$|E
5|$|To become <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> of Indiana, a {{candidate}} {{must have been}} a United States citizen and lived within Indiana for the period of five consecutive years before the election.
