The most severe complication in children is fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), estimated {{to occur in}} 0. 4 % of cases; patients with FHF often require a liver transplant (LT). Following another outbreak of HAV infection in Argentina during 2003 &ndash; 2004, a one-dose HAV universal immunization (UI) program was started in 2005, resulting in {{a reduction in the}} incidence of HAV infection. We have investigated the impact of HAV UI on the trends in the occurrence of FHF and LT in children. Methods: All pediatric cases of FHF admitted to four pediatric centers in Buenos Aires during March 1993 &ndash;July 2005 were retrospectively reviewed, and data of cases during August 2005 &ndash;December 2008 were collected. Information about demography, HAV infections and vaccination status, diagnostic data for FHF using the Pediatric Acute <b>Liver</b> <b>Failure</b> <b>criteria,</b> clinical laboratory results, encephalopathy, the severity of liver disease using the Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease score, assessment of patients on the LT waiting list using King&# 39;s College Criteria for LT, treatment given for FHF (pre- and post-transplant), and clinical outcome were collected using a case report form. The frequency and outcomes of HAV-associated FHF and LT cases before and after UI were analyzed. Results: During the pre-immunization period, March 1993 &ndash;July 2005, 54. 6 % (N = 165) of FHF cases were caused by HAV; HAV-associated FHF cases peaked during 2003 &ndash; 2004. During the post-immunization period, August 2005 &ndash;December 2008, only 27. 7 % (N = 18) of FHF cases were caused by HAV infection; only one of these patients had received the HAV vaccine (one dose only). The number of HAV-associated FHF cases decreased from 2005, and no cases were reported from November 2006 &ndash;December 2008. Multivariate analyses showed that the association of FHF with HAV infection rather than other etiologies decreased with increasing age (P = 0. 03), UI against HAV (P = 0. 002), and anti-actin antibodies (P = 0. 002), and increased with increasing weight (P = 0. 0004). Conclusions: The number of children with HAV-associated FHF in Argentina has strongly decreased since the initiation of the UI program. Further monitoring is required to confirm the long-term health and economic benefits of UI against HAV infection. Keywords: hepatitis A vaccine, fulminant hepatic failure, immunizatio...|$|E

40|$|Therapeutic apheresis {{has been}} used for ABO-incompatible liver {{transplantation}} and for liver support therapy during liver transplantation. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis of the clinical indicator of the post operative <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> concluded that the bilirubin between postoperative day (POD) 4 and 28 (a short-term follow-up period) might be the best predictor of liver prognosis (length of hospital stay > 100 days, re-transplantation, or death). Liver transplantation patients whose post operative <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> was treated with apheresis after their bilirubin raised above 22. 3 mg/dL maintained the increase of bilirubin after apheresis, while apheresis before the bilirubin levels were below 22. 3 mg/dl ameliorated the increase of bilirubin. In order to treat the post operative <b>liver</b> <b>failure,</b> the inclusion <b>criteria</b> of apheresis might be recommended to be around 20 mg/dl bilirubin, because the bilirubin level where apheresis therapy might be effective was considered under 22. 3 mg/dl and the inclusion criteria should include safety margin from 22. 3 mg/dl. There are several possible mechanisms that apheresis can improve liver function during liver transplantation. One is to supply the essential proteins which can ameliorate the patients’ entire condition. Second mechanism is the removal of the many toxic substances, such as bilirubin, anmonium, cytotoxic substances, inflammatory cytokines, and antibody. Artificial and bioartificial liver support devices have been developed. In the clinical use of these devices, the same inclusion criteria, that is around 20 mg/dl bilirubin, can be applied...|$|R

The etiology and prognosis of elderly patients with <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> were analyzed retrospectively. Results　Elderly patients with <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> accounted for 13. 21 % {{of the total number of}} <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> patients in 2003, and 16. 01 % in 2013. The most frequent causes leading to <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> were, in order of frequency, hepatitis B(68. 06 %), unknown causes (7. 22 %), hepatitis C (5. 30 %), hepatitis E (4. 98 %) and drug (4. 65 %). Acute or chronic <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> (85. 23 % vs 90. 56 %) was the main type in the two groups.

Results 　LFUE accounted for 6. 50 % of the total <b>liver</b> <b>failure,</b> and its incidence was {{lower than that of}} HBV-related <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> and alcohol-related <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> LFUE was presented mainly as subacute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> (39. 88 %), followed by acute-on-chronic <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> (36. 50 %) and acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> (23. 62 %), while other types of <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> (known etiology) were presented mainly as acute-on-chronic <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> (92. 16 %). Compared with HBV-related acute-on-chronic <b>liver</b> <b>failure,</b> the deterioration of liver function in LFUE patients was worse (ALT, AST and TBIL were higher and PTA was lower), ALP and the average level of white blood cells were also much higher. LFUE occurred mainly in adult patients (≥ 18 years, < 60 years, accounting for 56. 13 %), followed by adolescent patients (< 18 years old, accounting for 28. 53 %) and elderly patients (≥ 60 years old, accounting for 15. 34 %). LFUE showed a poor prognosis. The overall improvement rate was only 26. 07 %, and improvement rate was 31. 18 %, 25. 14 % and 20. 00 % in adolescent patients, adult patients and elderly patients, respectively. In the three types of <b>liver</b> <b>failure,</b> improvement rate was 12. 99 %, 34. 62 % and 25. 21 % for acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure,</b> sub-acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> and acute-on-chronic <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> patients, respectively. Conclusions 　The incidence of LFUE has been on the increase in recent 10 years, mainly presented as sub-acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure,</b> and it has a predilection for young adult and adolescents with a poor prognosis.

40|$|International audienceBackground: The {{prognosis}} for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> is unknown. Aim: To examine whether paracetamol-induced acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> increases long-term mortality. Methods: We followed all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver injury hospitalized in a Danish national referral center during 1984 - 2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from one year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury {{led to an}} acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> and those in whom it did not. Results: We included 641 patients. On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol-induced liver injury had caused an acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 2. 85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> died from <b>liver</b> disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. These observations speak against long-term effects of acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> Conclusions: Paracetamol-induced acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> did not affect long-term mortality.

40|$|Background: Posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> is a feared {{complication}} after hepatic resection and a {{major cause}} of perioperative mortality. There is currently no standardized definition of posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> that allows valid comparison of results from different studies and institutions. The aim of the current article was to propose a definition and grading of severity of posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> Methods: A literature search on posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> after hepatic resection was conducted. Based on the normal course of biochemical liver function tests after hepatic resection, a simple and easily applicable definition of posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> was developed by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery. Furthermore, a grading of severity is proposed based on the impact on patients' clinical management. Results: No uniform definition of posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> has been established in the literature addressing hepatic surgery. Considering the normal postoperative course of serum bilirubin concentration and International Normalized Ratio, we propose defining posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> as the impaired ability of the liver to maintain its synthetic, excretory, and detoxifying functions, which are characterized by an increased international normalized ratio and concomitant hyperbilirubinemia (according to the normal limits of the local laboratory) on or after postoperative day 5. The severity of posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> should be graded based on its impact on clinical management. Grade A posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> requires no change of the patient's clinical management. The clinical management of patients with grade B posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> deviates from the regular course but does not require invasive therapy. The need for invasive treatment defines grade C posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> Conclusion: The current definition of posthepatectomy <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> is simple and easily applicable in clinical routine. This definition can be used in future studies to allow objective and accurate comparisons of operative interventions in the field of hepatic surgery. © 2011 Mosby, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The study showed a significant reduction in early mortality in the MARS group compared to that of the standard medical therapy (SMT) group on day 7 (0 % vs. 18.5 %, respectively, p[*]<[*] 0.01) and day 14 (6.4 % vs. 27.8 %, p[*]<[*] 0.05). This effect disappeared at day 21, which could be explained by the interruption of therapy (in the MARS group, extracorporeal therapy was performed almost daily, with a median of three sessions per patient). The 14 -day mortality was especially reduced among patients with two or more organ failures (9.5 % in MARS group vs. 50 % in SMT group, p[*]<[*] 0.01). Furthermore, in Kaplan–Meier estimates of the 28 -day survival rate in this subgroup of patients, MARS was associated with improvement (logrank p[*]<[*] 0.05). Similarly, the authors performed a secondary analysis of the RELIEF trial data (36) using the CLIF-C criteria and showed a benefit from MARS in regard to the 14 -day mortality in the subgroup of patients with two or more organ failures, but this was without statistical significance. Despite its limitations, this study suggests the necessity for further trials targeting those more severe patients suffering from AoCLF, who may especially benefit from the technique.|$|R

40|$|<b>Liver</b> <b>failure</b> is {{the cause}} of death for over 30, 000 {{patients}} each year in the United States alone. When this process occurs in healthy individuals with normal livers, it is termed acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> (ALF). Loss of liver function that complicates chronic liver disease is termed acute-on-chronic <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> <b>Liver</b> transplantation is curative for ALF and acute-onchronic <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> 1 - 6 Over the years, survival after transplantation has improved with advances in both patient management and surgical techniques, but the procedure is not always available in a timely fashion, 7 - 9 prompting new surgical approaches such as split-liver transplantation, procurement from living donors, and auxiliary liver transplantation. 10 The problem of organ shortage is compounded by difficulty in predicting the outcome of <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> The King’s College prognostic criteria have been adopted by most centers, 11 althoug...|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} number of patients with <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> are admitted to the intensive care unit; thus {{a thorough understanding of}} the prevention and treatment of complications in such patients is imperative. The management of <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> is demanding and often involves the combined efforts of many specialists. Critically ill patients with hepatic failure encompass a broad spectrum of disease, ranging from acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> in a patient with no prior history of liver disease, to acute on chronic <b>liver</b> <b>failure.</b> The initial assessment and management of acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> are reviewed with an emphasis on the prevention and treatment of brain edema in the pretransplant setting. The current treatment of compli-cations resulting from decompensated chronic liver disease such as portal hypertensive bleeding; infection, renal failure, and hepatic encephalopathy are then discussed...|$|R
40|$|Acute <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> is most {{frequently}} caused by viralhepatitis, drugs, or toxins. 1, 2 Drugs {{that have been}} im-plicated in causing <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> include acetaminophen, halogenated hydrocarbons, tricyclic antidepressants, neu-roleptics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, valproic acid, phenytoin, isoniazid, and antibiotics such as eryth-romycin, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines. 3 - 5 While eryth-romycin has been described 4, 5 {{as a cause of}} fulminant <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> in several patients, few such reports exist for other macrolide antibiotics. For clarithromycin, a macrolide with a broad application due to its activity against bacteria caus-ing pneumonia and Helicobacter pylori, 3 reports 6 - 8 of pa-tients with fulminant <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> {{can be found in the}} litera-ture.

40|$|<b>Liver</b> <b>failure</b> {{progresses}} rapidly, {{and patients}} with this disease are {{usually in a}} critical condition. The medical treatment of <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> has unsatisfactory results, leading to a high mortality. How to accurately judge the {{prognosis of patients with}} <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> according to their clinical manifestations and laboratory test results is a very good guide for clinical treatment strategies and donor liver allocation. The prognostic models for <b>liver</b> <b>failure,</b> such as CTP score, MELD and its derivative scoring system, KCH criteria, SOFA score, APACHE scoring system, SMSVH score, Clichy criteria, and ANN, are reviewed.

In addition, the prognostic values of these models for <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> and their differences are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Liver</b> <b>failure</b> in {{neonates}} {{is a rare}} {{but often}} fatal disease. Trisomy 21 is not usually associated with significant infantile liver disease. If present, hepatic dysfunction in an infant with Trisomy 21 {{is likely to be}} attributed to transient myeloproliferative disorder with hepatic infiltration by hematopoietic elements and may be associated with secondary hemosiderosis. A less commonly recognized cause of <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> in neonates with Trisomy 21 is neonatal hemochromatosis (NH); this association has been reported in nine cases of Trisomy 21 in literature. NH is a rare, severe liver disease of intra-uterine onset that is characterized by neonatal <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> and hepatic and extrahepatic iron accumulation that spares the reticuloendothelial system. NH is the most frequently recognized cause of <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> in neonates and the commonest indication for neonatal liver transplantation. Although porto-pulmonary hypertension (PPH) has been reported as a complication of <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> in adults and older children, this has not been reported in neonates with <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> of any etiology. This is probably due to the rarity of <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> in newborns, delayed diagnosis and high mortality. The importance of recognizing PPH is that it is reversible with liver transplantation {{but at the same time}} increases the risk of post-operative mortality. Therefore, early diagnosis of PPH is critical so that early intervention can improve the chances of successful liver transplantation. We report for the first time the association of <b>liver</b> <b>failure</b> with porto-pulmonary hypertension secondary to NH in an infant with Trisomy 21...|$|R
