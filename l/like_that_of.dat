5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> A.dobsonii. Flower colour is <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E

40|$|Skin thicking {{simulating}} scleroderma is not rare in {{diabetes mellitus}} (about 2 % among patients with diabetes mellitus), {{however it is}} not well known to rheumatologists and endocrinologists. The basis of the syndrome are the abnormalities of collagen and glycosaminoglycans metabolism accompanying by the acid mucopolysaccharides accumulation in the deep part of the reticular dermis. Three cases of pseudosclerodrma in patients with long-standing complicated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are presented. The main clinical manifestations of pseudoscleroderma were marked cutaneous induration of the neck, body and proximal parts <b>of</b> extremities <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> scleredema of Buschke (2 patients), and primary paraarticular induration leaded to the flexion contractures <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> paraneoplastic scleroderma (I patient). Possible mechanisms of development, clinical and morphological peculiarities and treatment for this syndrome are discussed...|$|R

5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a fish, then in turn <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 {{that there was no}} linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E

5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E

Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married.
