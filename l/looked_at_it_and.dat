500|$|Nirvana {{originally}} wanted Kevin Kerslake, who {{had directed}} the videos for the band's singles [...] "Come as You Are", [...] "Lithium", [...] "In Bloom", and [...] "Sliver", {{to direct the}} [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] music video. Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But then I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> I thought that actually it was pretty good. I was very amazed by somebody writing a song and having those ideas as precise as he did." ...|$|E
500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan. She {{credited}} Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as an inspiration, saying [...] "Well, when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' I knew right then and there I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} cast in roles which recurred {{throughout}} the seven seasons {{on television and}} into the four feature films. Majel Barrett, referred to as [...] "The First Lady of Star Trek" [...] due to her marriage with Roddenberry, appeared both {{as the voice of}} Starfleet computers and as Lwaxana Troi. The part of Lwaxana was specifically created for her. She had appeared in The Original Series and two Star Trek films as Christine Chapel, and as Number One in the original pilot [...] "". John de Lancie was cast as Q despite missing his first audition as it conflicted with a play he was in at the time. A second audition was arranged, where de Lancie impressed Roddenberry, who told him that [...] "You make my words sound better than they are." [...] Colm Meaney was originally cast as an unnamed Ensign in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but was subsequently cast as the Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, appearing in 52 episodes in that role. Whoopi Goldberg approached the producers and asked for a role in the show, resulting in Roddenberry writing her the part of Guinan. She credits Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as inspiring her, saying [...] "when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' I knew right then and there I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] She made her first appearance in the second series episode [...] "" [...] and went on to appear in a total of 28 episodes plus both Star Trek: Generations and [...]|$|E

2500|$|She then studied medieval {{history at}} Bryn Mawr College in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. There she {{discovered}} the furniture of designers and filmmakers Charles and Ray Eames, which inspired her to switch her focus to modern design. Oppewall {{said of the}} Eames designs, [...] "I was so attracted by the contemporary feeling, the shapely sexy lines: totally different from the Sears, Roebuck middle-class stuff I'd grown up with. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> said, 'This is me.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Channel Nine, after {{viewing the}} {{completed}} film, chose to not broadcast it. A new contract was negotiated with all DVD sales going to Byrne's companies (Prime Time and The Secret LLC). In hindsight, Len Downs of Channel Nine commented, [...] "we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> we didn't deem it as having broad, mass appeal". The film was eventually broadcast by Channel Nine at 10:30 pm on Saturday, 3 February 2007. Downs reported that [...] "it didn't {{do all that}} well". The film was sold on DVD and also broadcast online through streaming media.|$|E
