40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{reduction}} of solutions of acidified <b>molybdate</b> <b>leads</b> {{to the formation}} of a family of nanostructured molybdenum blue (MB) wheels which are linked together in a series of complex reaction networks. These networks are complex because the species which define the nodes are extremely labile, unstable, and common to many different networks. Herein, we combine gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to investigate the effect of the pH and the ratio of reactants and reducing agents, R (R = [S 2 O 4 2 −]/[MoO 4 2 −]), on the complex underlying set of equilibria that make up MBs. By mapping the reaction parameter space given by experimental variables such as pH, R, solvent medium, and type of counterion, we show that the species present range from nanostructured MB wheels (comprising ca. 154 Mo atoms) to smaller molecular capsules, [(SO 3) 2 Mo...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{capacitors}} {{can replace}} or complement batteries, while storing energy through ion adsorption and fast surface redox reactions. There {{is a growing}} demand in developing nanostructured materials as electrodes for hybrid systems that can enhance the specific capacitance by ion desolvation in the nanopores. Here, we demonstrate that rescaling the pore diameter {{with the aid of}} biopolymer at an optimal level during the synthesis of metal <b>molybdate</b> <b>leads</b> to high capacitance 124 F g− 1 giving robust capacitance retention of 80 % over 2000 cycles for a constructed device (activated carbon vs. metal molybdate). The presence of biopolymer (l-glutamic acid) in the metal molybdate acts as a complexing agent of the metal ion while enhancing the mass transport and hence it's improved electrochemical performance. However, XPS and other elemental analyses illustrated no evidence for N doping but traces of other surface functional groups (i. e. C and O) could be present on the molybdate surface. The biopolymer synthetic approach has the advantage of yielding nanostructured material with a relatively narrow pore size distribution controlled by l-glutamic acid. This study will provide a generic route to rescale other metal molybdate, phosphate or oxide counterparts and be an added value to the database...|$|R

30|$|As a mixed salt, {{molybdate}} orange generally contains only about 10  % <b>lead</b> <b>molybdate</b> [18]. Because the tinting strength of {{molybdate orange}} is strong, {{the proportion of}} this colorant added to the paint {{also appears to be}} low, hence the weak intensity of the Mo peak when the pigment is admixed with another lead containing pigment. Additionally, this low concentration of molybdate orange obscures the distinctive Raman signature of this colorant (vide infra) when {{in the presence of the}} strongly scattering chrome yellow, therefore it was not observed in the Raman analysis for this passage of paint.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of nitriding conditions upon the ammonia synthesis activities and structures of cobalt molybdenum and nickel molybdenum-based catalysts has been compared. Ammonolysis of cobalt molybdate is observed {{to produce a}} more active catalyst than H 2 /N 2 pre-treatment. Post-reaction XRD analysis shows a pure Co 3 Mo 3 N phase in the former case and a mixed phase, containing some Co 3 Mo 3 N, in the latter. Both ammonolysis and N 2 /H 2 pretreatment of nickel <b>molybdate</b> <b>lead</b> to a mixture of Ni 2 Mo 3 N and Ni, with the latter pretreatment leading to catalysts of higher activity. The reactivity of lattice nitrogen in η- 6 carbide structure Co 3 Mo 3 N and the β-Mn structure Ni 2 Mo 3 N has been investigated. In both cases, lattice nitrogen {{is found to be}} reactive towards both H 2 and C 6 H 6 and comparisons demonstrate Co 3 Mo 3 N to be the more reactive. For Co 3 Mo 3 N, reaction with benzene yields Co 3 Mo 3 C and graphite whereas a carbonitride and graphite is produced with Ni 2 Mo 3 N. In the case of reaction with H 2, the nickel molybdenum system reacts to form Ni 2 Mo 3 N 1 −x, whereas comparable conditions with Co 3 Mo 3 N produce a novel Co 6 Mo 6 N phase...|$|R

The parallel effects of templation and reduction on the self-assembly process are discussed, taking into consideration the Lewis basicity of the template, the oxidation state of the Mo centers, and the polarity of the reaction medium.

The solid-state structure of 2 has been elucidated by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 react with alkyl- or aryllithium compounds to form lithium molybdate(VI) derivatives, of which [Li(DME) Mo(NAr) 2 (C-N) (Me) (p-tolyl) ] (10), {{formed by the}} reaction of 2 with [Li(p-tolyl) ], has been structurally (X-ray) characterized. Thermal activation of these lithium <b>molybdates</b> <b>leads</b> {{to the formation of}} paramagnetic lithium molybdate(V) compounds instead of the anticipated molybdenum(VI) alkylidenes. The actual temperature (between - 10 and 80 C) at which paramagnetic Mo(V) radical anions are formed is dependent on both the type of alkyl or aryl substituent (introduced via LiR') and the solvent. The synthesis of [LiMo(NAr) 2 (C-N) 2] (11) by reaction of 7 with n-BuLi is described. The initially formed lithium molybdate(VI) compound [Li(DME) nMo(NAr) 2 (C-N) 2 (n-Bu) ] is not stable at room temperature and converts directly to the lithium molybdate(V) derivative 11. The solid-state structure of 11 has been elucidated by single-crystal X-ray analysis. None of the lithium molybdate(VI) nor -(V) derivatives described herein are active catalysts for ROMP, as thermal activation does not lead to the formation of a molybdenum alkylidene complex but to electron transfer and formation of a lithium molybdate(V) instead. However, upon treatment of a solution of any of the molybdate(V) derivatives with dry air, catalytic ROMP is observed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{experiments}} on propagation of picosecond acoustic wave packets in condensed matter {{have opened up}} a new, exciting area of soliton physics. Single cycle strain pulses as short as several picosec-onds can be generated in a thin metallic film, yielding local strain fields {{of the order of}} 10 − 4. The combination of phonon dispersion and anhar-monicity of the atomic interaction potential may give rise to strongly nonlinear, but stable propagation of the wave packets over a distance of the order of several millimeters in a single crystalline material. We present new results on nonlinear propagation of acoustic wave packets created by nJ femtosecond optical pulses in a <b>lead</b> <b>molybdate</b> single crystal, employing the Brillouin scattering technique as a local probe of acoustic strain. Studies of diffraction of narrow discs of acoustic strain show anomalous diffraction of the various Fourier components constitut-ing the wave packet. Propagation of virtually one-dimensional nature is studied by exciting the metal film over a large area using an amplified femtosecond laser. We show that these data can be interpreted by means of the Korteweg-de Vries equation and strongly suggest the development of acoustic solitons. ...|$|E
40|$|The spin-lattice {{relaxation}} time, T 1, for 207 Pb in solid lead compounds {{has been investigated}} {{in an effort to}} understand the mechanism of relaxation. The 207 Pb T 1 relaxation times for lead nitrate are independent of magnetic field strength and inversely proportional to the square of the temperature. These are signatures of relaxation by a spin-phonon Raman scattering mechanism. We propose a coupling mechanism in which phonons create a local magnetic field by modulating the valence electron shell motion relative to the nuclear/electron core. We also measured the 207 Pb {{spin-lattice relaxation}} times for <b>lead</b> <b>molybdate,</b> lead tungstate, and a series of BaxPb 1 −x(NO 3) 2 solid solutions and found the T 1 times to be proportional to the square of the temperature in all cases. The proposed spin-phonon mechanism should contribute to relaxation in other heavy spin-½ nuclei. We have measured the T 1 relaxation time of 195 Pt in potassium hexacyanoplatinate and found that it is also independent of the magnetic field strength and proportional to the square of the temperature, suggesting that the spin-phonon mechanism is the source of relaxation. Literature data suggests that spin-phonon scattering is a common relaxation pathway for 199 Hg, 203 Tl, and 205 Tl as well. ...|$|E

Field emission scanning electron microscopy images were employed to observe the shape and monitor the crystal growth process. The optical properties were investigated by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements.

40|$|For this study, <b>lead</b> <b>molybdate</b> (PbMoO 4) microcrystals were {{prepared}} by the co-precipitation method and processed using a conventional hydrothermal method at 100 °C for 10 min with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the capping agent. These microcrystals were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-Raman spectroscopy, and their morphology was investigated by field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM). The optical properties were analyzed by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. XRD patterns and MR spectrum indicate that the PbMoO 4 microcrystals have a scheelite-type tetragonal structure. FE-SEM images reveal that the PVA promotes the aggregation of several octahedrons {{and the formation of}} large porous stake-like PbMoO 4 microcrystals which are related to the oriented attachment growth process. Moreover, the effect of the capping agent hinders the growth of a large amount of micro-octahedrons which can be verified with by several nanocrystals on large crystals. Intense green PL emission was observed at room temperature for PbMoO 4 microcrystals which are related to structural defects at medium range and intermediary energy levels between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB). Photocatalytic activity was observed for PbMoO 4 as a catalyst in the degradation of the rhodamine B (RhB) dye, achieving total degradation after 90 min under UV-light.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} {{in the use of}} light as an information and energy carrier has led to an increasing demand for new materials, characterised by particular photoelectrochemical properties. The aim of this work is to introduce a wide band gap semiconductor – PbMoO 4 with a detailed description of its synthesis procedure and product characterisation. The emphasis was put on its electronic structure and photoelectrochemical properties in order to evaluate the mechanism of the photoelectrochemical photocurrent switching effect (the PEPS effect). This phenomenon may be utilized in the construction of simple logic devices (e. g. logic gates or switches) or more complex optoelectronic circuits. <b>Lead</b> <b>molybdate</b> in the form of fine powder was obtained via a microwave assisted hydrothermal route. It was found that the composition of the reaction mixture (i. e. the ratio between lead and molybdate ions) influences the morphology and the electronic structure of the semiconductor. The photoelectrochemical characterization revealed that PbMoO 4 {{in the presence of the}} Ce 4 +/Ce 3 + redox couple exhibits the PEPS effect regardless of the presence of oxygen in the electrolyte. This may be explained in terms of oxidation/reduction processes of cerium(III) /cerium(IV) species. An attempt to modify the surface via the adsorption of alizarin onto PbMoO 4 was also made. The spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations performed for such an organic–inorganic hybrid material revealed that the dye binds to MoVI centres which are exposed on the surface. Alizarin adsorbed onto PbMoO 4 strongly enhances the cathodic photocurrent generation. At the same time, however, the anodic photocurrent diminishes. Therefore, literally no switching effect occurs for such a system. Nonetheless, the generation of intense cathodic photocurrent may be utilized in photocatalysis, e. g. during the photoreduction of metal ions or the generation of reactive oxygen species and/or solar fuels...|$|E
