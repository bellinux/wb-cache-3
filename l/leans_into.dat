The foliation/grain elongation always <b>leans</b> <b>into</b> the direction of shear, i.e. in a dextral shear zone, the foliation leans {{to the right and}} therefore dips to the left, and vice versa for sinestral shear. Combined with other shear sense indicators such as δ-objects, oblique foliations establish the movement sense quite clearly.|$|E

50|$|In Low-Speed Mode, {{the vehicle}} is upright, and moves around at 'walking pace' at similar {{eyesight}} height to pedestrians, without taking up {{a large amount of}} space. In High-Speed Mode, the Toyota extends in length by leaning back and extending the single rear wheel to improve aerodynamics and stability, thus being able to achieve a speed of 18.6 mph, or 30 km/h. It <b>leans</b> <b>into</b> corners, like other tall, one-man vehicles such as the Segway, to prevent it from tipping over.|$|E

The C217 introduced an update to the hydraulic fully active Magic Body Control suspension (which debuted on the W222 sedan model), called Active Curve Tilting. This new system allows the vehicle to lean up to 2.5 degrees into a turn, {{similar to the way}} a motorcycle <b>leans</b> <b>into</b> a turn. The leaning is intended to counter the effect of centrifugal force on the occupants and is available only on rear-wheel drive models.|$|E

The epidermis is scraped off the outside of the hide to achieve a soft finish. The membrane is scraped off the flesh side.|$|E
5000|$|Film critic Stephen Holden, {{writing for}} The New York Times, had mixed {{views of the}} film but did like the acting.

If his Hurricane is an inspiring portrait of nobility, it is because the actor never conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his character's forcefully articulate surface." ...|$|E
5000|$|Taste of Country {{reviewed}} the song, saying, [...] "Musically this song {{relies on the}} stormy production she <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> heavily on her Blown Away album. There’s a colorful thread that’s tied everything Underwood has done {{over the last five}} years together and she hasn’t been afraid to <b>lean</b> <b>into</b> it again and again." [...] AXS gave a positive review of the song, writing, [...] "By far, [...] "Dirty Laundry" [...] is one of the singer's boldest and most musically adventurous singles of her career. There is an intensity and fury as inescapable as [...] "Blown Away" [...] and [...] "Two Black Cadillacs," [...] but the story is fresh and windswept." ...|$|R
50|$|Several of {{the songs}} from the album became live staples of the band, and have since been {{included}} in various live albums. The group followed up the album with <b>Lean</b> <b>Into</b> It in 1991, which represented a critical breakthrough.|$|R

Before Moe leaves, he grabs Smithers and kisses him, afterward saying [...] "Like frisbee golf, I'm glad I tried it once". The credits end as Mo's is renovated back to the old Moe's Tavern again.|$|E
5000|$|New Miserable Experiences {{initial release}} had {{completely}} different packaging. The albums original cover artwork depicted the Arizona desert. Songs on the album, such as [...] "Mrs. Rita", {{a song about}} a local psychic from the Gin Blossoms hometown of Tempe, Arizona, were also written with references to the area, people and events surrounding the band at the time. The majority of the songs rely on a melody-driven pop style while the final track, [...] "Cheatin", <b>leans</b> <b>into</b> country music. The album was re-released in late summer 1993, in conjunction with A&Ms newfound support of the album. To celebrate the albums tenth anniversary, a deluxe edition containing an extra disc of demos, outtakes and live performances was released by the label in 2002.|$|E

Eventually, Cristian finds July, tied to the pillars of a small gazebo, bleeding profusely. He leads her back to the house, where they find José's burnt body in the fireplace. Hearing noises outside, July hides in a kitchen cupboard, while Cristian goes to the front door. An axe blade bursts through the door and Cristian runs upstairs to hide.|$|E

5000|$|The {{editors of}} TV Guide have placed No Tomorrow eighth {{among the top}} ten picks for the most {{anticipated}} new shows of the 2016-2017 season. In its review, Sadie Gennis writes [...] "Tori Anderson and Joshua Sasse are infectiously charming in this offbeat romantic comedy {{about a woman who}} discovers that her dream man is an apocalypse truther. It's a weird premise, sure, but No Tomorrow <b>leans</b> <b>into</b> its own absurdity, populating the show with surreal, strange characters (including one who speaks so quietly he needs subtitles) and delightful prop comedy that is rarely seen in one-hour shows. And while it's unlikely that No Tomorrow will help the CW continue its Golden Globes streak, it fits in perfectly on the network alongside fellow genre-pushing rom-coms Jane the Virgin and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend." ...|$|E
5000|$|Describing the albums in 2001 to Exclaim Magazine, Spookey states: [...] "Bed is {{the slower}} songs, Breakfast is the fast songs," [...] he begins. [...] "Bed is red and Breakfast is green, like stop and go. Breakfast has this '80s digital watch its back cover and Bed has the old cuckoo clock. The {{production}} is kinda like that Bed is more towards the '70s and Breakfast <b>leans</b> <b>into</b> the '80s. Breakfast is {{the short and}} sweet poppy songs, Bed is deeper, the lyrics are heavier and the songs are slower. inside booklets Breakfast is cartoons and Bed is this heavy dictionary. Bed should be listened to completely in the dark. For ideal listening pleasure, Breakfast ought to be dubbed to a cassette on an original Sony Walkman {{and you should be}} on a treadmill with your leg warmers on." [...] Each track relates to a time period between 1:00am - 23:00pm ...|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Popmatters, Zachary Houle said, [...] "Well, Live at the Lizard Lounge, {{which was}} {{recorded}} {{earlier this year}} at a hometown show, has an amazing soundtrack but a rather underwhelming video to accompany it. So you’d be both in {{the right and the}} wrong to pick this one up. But we should focus on the positives first. The soundtrack largely culls material from Lake Street Dive, with three choice, intriguing covers thrown into the mix: the old soul and R&B standard “This Magic Moment” (first recorded by the Drifters in 1960, but then covered by unlikely acts such as Lou Reed and the Misfits), George Michael’s “Faith” and Hall and Oates’ “Rich Girl”. While the band’s recorded output <b>leans</b> <b>into</b> folk, soul and jazz territory, Live at the Lizard Lounge is a much more rocking affair, largely focusing on the guitar and trumpet finesse of Mike Olson.".|$|E
