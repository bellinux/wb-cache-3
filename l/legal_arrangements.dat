25|$|Unger's work on law {{has sought}} to denaturalize the concept of law {{and how it is}} {{represented}} through particular institutions. He begins by inquiring into why modern societies have legal systems with distinctions between institutions, such as legislature and court, as well as a special caste of lawyers possessing a method of reasoning about social problems. Whereas thinkers such as Marx and Weber had argued that such <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> were a product of economic necessity to secure property rights and the autonomy of the individual, Unger shows that this liberal legal order emerged in Europe {{as a result of the}} indeterminate relations between monarchy, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie. It took the particular form that it did by emerging out of the long tradition of natural law and universality, rather than of necessity.|$|E

The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the trust deed, the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, {{but this was not}} evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model {{and the way in which}} plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.|$|E

40|$|Resumé: In my {{rigorous}} work I {{dealt with}} the <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the special working conditions of juveniles and minors. These conditions are being legally arranged since over two centuries. One of the characteristical signs {{in the development of}} this <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> is enlarging the legal protection of working minors as well as of juveniles resulting namely in shortening the working hours for minors, determinations of the minimal age for taking a job, determinations of the obligatory school attendance duration as well as the inhibition of certain works and workplace which are dangerous for juveniles. The development of the <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the above mentioned working conditions is strongly affected by legal documents from the field of the european as well as international law arranging the fundamental human, social and economical rights. These international documents complete and enlarge the Czech <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the special working conditions of the juveniles. The Labour code no. 262 / 2006 Sb. with the relating legal rules provide a special legal protection since these juveniles are not yet physically and mentally adult enough and thus their sound and safe development has to be protected.

2500|$|Named after Frits Bolkestein, the Directive on {{services}} in the internal market aims at enabling a company from a given member-state to recruit workers in other European Union countries using the law of its home country. It triggered huge protests in Europe. This directive was voted in the European Parliament in March 2006 and the MEPs proposed amendments to the provisional text. The [...] "principle of origin", which stipulates that workers are employed under the <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> of their own state of residence, {{was replaced by a}} new [...] "freedom" [...] principle – freedom to provide services, meaning that administrative obstacles should be removed. The compromise allowed the draft Directive to continue to exist. However, {{there was a great deal}} of concern about its effect on social standards and welfare, triggering competition between various parts of Europe. This led to significant protests across Europe against the directive including a notable protest at the European Parliament in Strasbourg by port workers which led to damage to the building. MEPs eventually reached a compromise on the text and the Parliament adopted it on 12 December 2006; 2 years after Bolkestein left office, under the Barroso Commission.|$|E
2500|$|Previously, on February 24, 2004, Bush {{called for}} an {{amendment}} which would have outlawed same-sex marriage, and which would have disallowed states from recognizing or enforcing same-sex civil unions.

[...] The White House partly clarified Bush's position in a February 24, 2004 press conference with White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan, who stated that by calling on the FMA to permit states the possibility of creating other [...] "legal arrangements," [...] Bush specifically meant to permit states the chance of enacting civil unions. (McClellan also stated, however, that Bush did not personally support civil unions.) Similarly, at the February 25, 2004 press conference, McClellan stated that the White House intended to work with Congress to develop language for the FMA that permitted states to enact civil unions. Although Bush frequently spoke about FMA on the campaign from February and November 2004, he avoided mention of the phrase [...] "civil unions" [...] until an ABC News interview of October 26, 2004, aired one week before the election.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{weakening}} {{phase of the}} Ottoman Empire in the 19th century and the global dominance of western colonialism, purchases without constraint and effective surveillance of real estate by the nationals and companies of western powers {{was one of the}} issues on which the Ottoman state had been subjected to the direst foreign pressures. As a consequence of these pressures, The Ottoman Land Code of 1858 was passed. An 1858 firman on [...] "Reform" [...] had announced a grant of permission in this respect, but the necessary <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> had been delayed till 1868. With the enactment of the 1868 regulation, according to one estimate, British capitalist-farmers (see Levantine mansions of İzmir) had almost immediately emerged as having acquired one third of all arable lands in the entire vilayet of İzmir (Aydın in name), possibly held in an indirect manner till then, and by 1878, the majority of the arable land in the same province. This trend coincided with the influx of refugees from lands lost for the Ottoman Empire, and the migrants often saw themselves having to buy property from foreigners in their own country. A further law in 1913 also allowed foreign legal entities (companies, foundations etc.) to purchase property in Ottoman lands, with decisive effects for the early foundations of the state of Israel. A partial face-about by the Committee of Union and Progress, simultaneous to the outbreak of the World War I in Europe, was one of the causes for the deterioration of relations between Turkey and the Allied powers Britain, France and Italy. The Treaty of Lausanne which established modern Turkey laid a ground based on a strict understanding of reciprocity in the matter, on a bilateral and contractual bases as concluded with individual countries at first, and full legal reciprocity after 1934.|$|E
