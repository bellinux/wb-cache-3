5|$|In the arts, {{silicon carbide}} {{is a popular}} {{abrasive}} in modern <b>lapidary</b> due to the durability and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining processes such as grinding, honing, water-jet cutting and sandblasting. Particles of silicon carbide are laminated to paper to create sandpapers and the grip tape on skateboards.|$|E
5|$|Fluorite or {{fluorspar}} {{is called}} Blue John in the Peak District, the name allegedly {{coming from the}} French Bleu et Jaune which describes the colour of the bandings. Blue John is now scarce, {{and only a few}} hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and <b>lapidary</b> use. The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave; mining still takes place in the nearby Treak Cliff Cavern.|$|E

In 1997 the Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals officially opened. In June 2000, 94 pieces from the F. John Barlow collection of crystallized gold were added to the museum. The facility opened an exhibit in 2001 dedicated to the <b>lapidary</b> arts, and by that time the museum had grown to more than 4,000 items.|$|E

5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} <b>lapidary</b> work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rocks}} and {{minerals}} are housed in glass cases along the walls in the basement. Before opening to the public an elevator {{was added to the}} home. The museum includes a <b>lapidary</b> and arts gallery, agate gallery, petrified wood gallery, oddities gallery, crystal gallery, Northwest gallery, and fossil gallery. There is also an educational room and gift shop, while the outside grounds include a walk that features sandstone, columns of basalt, and a pile of rocks for children to climb over to find stones. This walk includes a 1,200 pound (540kg) rock made of pumice.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lapidary</b> is {{an open-air}} museum of {{primarily}} stone artworks, both originals and copies, which formerly decorated buildings {{that no longer}} exist. Some are set into the walls around a 1969 terrace, while others are freestanding at various locations in the park. For example, in {{the walls of the}} terrace there are fragments of five carved heads from the keystones over windows, supposed to be from the Old City Hall of Berlin in Spandauer Straße and attributed to Georg Gottfried Weiyhenmeyer; two allegorical reliefs; 17th- and 18th-century building signs; a late Gothic vault keystone; and a 16th-century sandstone relief from the Stadtschloß.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{museum in}} Skopje is the Museum of Macedonia which details {{the history of}} the country. Its icons and <b>lapidary</b> {{collections}} are particularly rich. The Macedonian Archeological Museum, opened in 2014, keeps some of the best archeological finds in Macedonia, dating from Prehistory to the Ottoman period. The National Gallery of Macedonia exhibits paintings dating from the 14th to the 20th century in two former Turkish baths of the Old Bazaar. The Contemporary Art Museum of Macedonia was built after the 1963 earthquake thanks to international assistance. Its collections include Macedonian and foreign art, with works by Fernand Léger, André Masson, Pablo Picasso, Hans Hartung, Victor Vasarely, Alexander Calder, Pierre Soulages, Alberto Burri and Christo.|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining <b>lapidary</b> apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|In 1858/59 Inselstraße was {{extended}} {{through the garden}} to connect Köpenicker Straße to the city centre, and the Lodge was forced to sell the larger, eastern portion of the site to the city. The Köllnisches Gymnasium was then built there. How to use {{the remainder of the}} site was discussed for years; a desire to preserve the trees led to the rejection of several commercial proposals. On 15 April 1869, the Assembly of City Deputies (Stadtverordnetenversammlung) decided to establish a public playground (probably one of the first in the city) and 'promenade location' there on plans drawn up by the first city director of gardens, Gustav Meyer, dedicated the necessary funds, and urged rapid execution of the plan. The plan involved some new plantings, fencing, and benches. This renovation was completed in 1873. The park reached its current dimensions in 1883 after the ditch was filled in. Ludwig Hoffmann, the architect of the Märkisches Museum (completed in 1907), then made some changes including creating views across the park to the new museum. The last major modification of the park took place in 196971 to designs by Eberhard Jaenisch, Stefan Rauner and Roswitha Schulz: a mound which remained {{on the site of the}} bastion was levelled, a children's playground was added, a terrace was built behind the museum, and the <b>Lapidary</b> was created.|$|E

5|$|The Great Seal: The Great Seal of Fordham University was {{designed}} to acknowledge {{the presence of the}} Society of Jesus on campus, hence the order's coat of arms in the seal's center. The coat of arms bears the Greek letters of the <b>lapidary</b> form of Jesus Christ (IHS), with the Cross resting on the center of the H and the three nails of the Crucifixion beneath the epigraph. These figures, dressed in gold, lay in a field framed in maroon, the color of the university, with silver fleur-de-lis at the edge. The fleur-de-lis symbolize the French Jesuits who arrived at Fordham in 1846. Immediately above the central shield rests the laurel crown, enclosing the university's pedagogical disciplines: arts, science, philosophy, medicine, and law. Below the shield is a blue scroll with the university's motto, Sapientia et Doctrina. The scroll rests on a gold field emblematic of learning (doctrina) and is surrounded by the fiery tongues of the Holy Spirit, a symbol of wisdom (sapientia). In a circular maroon field embroidered with beads is Fordham's official title, Universitas Fordhamensis; at the field's lower edge is the date of the university's founding, 1841. Finally, surrounding the entire seal is a heraldic belt, which is employed as a stylistic decoration. The University of Oxford, the only other tertiary institution in the world that uses a belt in its seal, however, maintains that without the belt, the seal is not official.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} manuscripts on the {{treatment}} of man's ills was available to healers of the Middle Ages. Knowledge of therapeutics, set down by ancient scholars, was supplementedl by contemporary theories and observations. The lore of healing was expounded not only in conventional medical texts but occasionally in bestiaries(l) and to a much greater extent in herbals. Additional repositories were the <b>lapidaries,</b> the manuscripts about precious and common stones and their virtues. Althouglh little known to modern readers, in the Middle Ages these works were popular and influential, playing perhaps {{a larger role in}} medicine than did the herbals(2, 3). Specific curative powers were ascribed to a long list of stones. A number of tlhem, for example, were held to be valuable in pregnancy and childbirth(4). One of the more curious litlhotlherapeutic items was the toad stone, of which there were said to be several forms, both real and imaginary. 1 The earliest mention I have found is a very brief reference to the batrachites, one of the numerous names for the toad stone, in the Etymologies of Bishop Isidore of Seville, dating {{from the beginning of the}} seventh century(5). There were much earlier <b>lapidaries,</b> but they seem to have had little medical content. Nearly five centuries later another bishop, MIarbode of Rennes, wrote a popular and much copied lapidary(3, 7). (It must be remembered that almost all the educated men of that time were clerics.) 1 Iarbode's work was a compilation of material from earlier authorities. From his manuscript and Isidore's, say Evans and Serjeantson, "the main * Professor of Anatomy. 'For this reviewv I have drawn on a large number of printed <b>lapidaries</b> but have used fewv of those others, reportedly much more numerous(3), that exist only in manuscript form.

40|$|Silicosis {{continues}} to be an important occupational disease in South Africa, particularly in small, poorly regulated industries. A case series is described of six workers who developed silicosis whilst involved in the processing of semi-precious gem stones. They had been employed as stone sculptors in <b>lapidaries</b> where they processed tigers' eye, rose quartz, amethyst, quartz crystal {{and a variety of other}} locally occurring semi-precious stones. In five of the cases exposure was in small and poorly regulated <b>lapidaries</b> without specific dust control measures. The sixth was detected during the course of a health and hygiene survey (including dust sampling) that I conducted in one of two <b>lapidaries</b> still operating in the Western Cape. These workers developed serious disease. Progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) was noted in 4 of the 6 cases, three of whom had progression of their disease after cessation of exposure. With the development of PMF the initial restrictive pulmonary function abnormalities were followed by steadily worsening airflow obstruction. Lung biopsies confirmed silicosis in one case and were suggestive in a further two. Tuberculosis was confirmed in two cases and suspected and treated in a third. Workmen's' Compensation was awarded in five cases. The survey confirmed that in semiprecious gem stone processing, the risk of silicosis appears to be confined to stone sculptors. Tried and proven techniques of general and local exhaust ventilation combined with water or oil to control dust at source were capable of effectively reducing dust emission to acceptable levels...|$|R
25|$|In his {{treatise}} On Stones (Περὶ λίθων), {{which was}} {{to be used as a}} source for other <b>lapidaries</b> until at least the Renaissance, Theophrastus classified rocks and gems based on their behavior when heated, further grouping minerals by common properties, such as amber and magnetite, which both have the power of attraction.

25|$|To {{learn the}} Tironian note system, scribes {{required}} formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; by the Classical period (c. 7th century BC to 5th century AD), the number increased to some 5,000 symbols {{and then to}} some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD); the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. Sigla were mostly used in <b>lapidary</b> inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused {{to the extent that}} some are indecipherable.|$|E
25|$|Dadivank Monastery (13th century) {{is one of}} {{the most}} architecturally and {{culturally}} significant Monasteries in Artsakh.

Dadivank is named after St. Dadi, a disciple of Apostle Thaddeus who preached the Holy Gospel in Artsakh in the 1st century. St. Dadi's tomb was later discovered by archeologists in 2007. The monastery is in the Shahumian District.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the C2RMF {{researchers}} published {{results of}} further investigations to establish when the Paris skull had been carved.

25|$|Abbreviated writing, using sigla, arose {{partly from}} the {{limitations}} of the workable nature of the materials (stone, metal, parchment etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability.
