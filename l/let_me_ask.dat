2500|$|... "Many calculating {{politicians}} {{are worried about}} what revealing the complete truth would do. Some of them fear that the Vatican will have a spiritual collapse like the Berlin Wall. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask,</b> why don't the CIA, the Sismi, the Sisde and other intelligence agencies reveal {{the truth about the}} Orlandi case? ...|$|E
2500|$|Hamlet {{contains}} many elements {{that would later}} show up in Gothic literature. From the growing madness of Prince Hamlet, to the violent ending to the constant reminders of death, to, even, more subtly, the notions of humankind and its structures and the viewpoints on women, Hamlet evokes many things that would recur in what {{is widely regarded as}} the first piece of Gothic literature, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, and in other Gothic works. Walpole himself even wrote, in his second preference to Otranto: That great master of nature, Shakespeare, was the model I copied. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> if his tragedies of Hamlet and Julius Cæsar would not lose a considerable share of their spirit and wonderful beauties, if the humour of the grave- diggers, the fooleries of Polonius, and the clumsy jests of the Roman citizens, were omitted, or vested in heroics? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad, Mrs. Bold, to {{have the}} {{opportunity}} of having ten minutes' conversation with you alone," [...] began Mr. Slope. [...] "Will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> openly <b>ask</b> you a plain question?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Leyla, Leyla, Leyla ... Everyone is Leyla, Yavuz! Literally! I guess only {{my mom is}} {{not named}} Leyla ... Actually, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go <b>ask</b> her ..." [...] says Mecnun in one episode. These are the series' {{significant}} Leylas, in chronological order: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her hair? Now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see. You <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> what colour is her hair. Well, {{you might}} call it auburn ... or russet ... or {{you might call}} it Titian...." ...|$|R
60|$|And now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> your {{attention}} {{to two or three}} closing remarks.|$|E
6000|$|Q. Did you--However, we {{can never}} get this matter straight. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> about {{something}} else. What was the date of your birth? ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir John. These are rogues, sir, I plainly {{perceive}} it; pray <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> him one question--Which way did {{you come}} home, sir? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not {{quiet and}} nice, but I'll come, if Mother will <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> I'll go <b>ask</b> her. Shut the window, {{like a good}} boy, and wait till I come." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{stood in}} silence, Paula {{apparently}} {{much interested in}} the manoeuvring of a raft which was passing by. 'Dear Miss Power,' he resumed, 'before I go and join your uncle above, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>ask,</b> Do I stand any chance at all yet? Is it possible {{you can never be}} more pliant than you have been?' ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> here <b>ask</b> you {{especially}} {{to take account}} of that origin of the true bearing of the Flag of England, the Red Rose. Her own madness defiled afterwards alike the white and red, into images of the paleness, or the crimson, of death; but the Saxon Rose was the symbol of heavenly beauty and peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave {{and generous}} friend, will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you one last question? I am very ignorant, and it {{troubles}} me--just a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're worth {{a bushel}} of diamonds--when you cook 'em. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you something--is your old dad as fierce as Uncle Dan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I don't think it's funny at all,' said Sam. 'But jes <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you one thing: what's {{the name}} of the toll-gate woman?' ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>ask</b> a {{question}} which {{everyone else who}} has been faithfully attending these sessions is surely burning to ask. If some rules you have described constitute universal constraints on all languages, yet they are not learned, nor are they somehow logically necessary a priori, how did language get that way? Stevan Harnad, in a conference question to Noam Chomsk...|$|R
6000|$|Do you ask, reader, why {{all this}} order? why this despotic admiral, {{and all this}} unity of action? why not [...] "every man for himself"? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> reply by <b>asking</b> you to think for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{believe you}} are. Well, I {{am going to}} ask a favor of you. I {{would like to go}} and see Miss Lavendar if she will <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> Will you <b>ask</b> her if I may come?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{when you}} come down to-morrow night, don't call out! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you a parting question. What made you cry, 'Halloa! Below there!' to-night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Don Felix. Nay, dear lady--But sit thee {{down and}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell thee why I came. [He leads {{her to a}} sofa.] Thou knowest I have been with thee from a child. I stood beside thee at the altar, {{and was the first}} to cheer and comfort thee when thou wast left deserted and alone. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>ask</b> thee, Wouldst thou not gladly change thy sad lot here for a gay and joyous life with one who loves thee fondly? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the name}} of Heaven, my lord, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> then <b>ask</b> you," [...] said Jerningham, [...] "what merit you claim, or what {{advantage}} you expect, from having embroiled everything in which you are concerned to a degree which equals {{the chaos of the}} blind old Roundhead's poem which your Grace is so fond of? To begin with the King. In spite of good-humour, he will be incensed at your repeated rivalry." ...|$|R
60|$|May I {{ask those}} who have not {{differed}} with me to join with me in this same spirit towards {{those who have}}? And now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> close by <b>asking</b> three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and skillful commanders.|$|R

60|$|If {{any such}} shall {{chance to see}} these words, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> them to {{consider}} with me that one word Hero, and what it means.|$|E
60|$|In conclusion, Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you not {{to force}} on me this {{continued}} correspondence by daily attacks. It is a trouble and a nuisance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might ask}} you," [...] she persisted, [...] "to {{allow me to}} mind my own business. But I am {{incapable}} of making an ungrateful return for the interest which you take in my medical welfare. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> venture to <b>ask</b> if you {{understand the value of}} time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will your Highness take my life?" [...] he cried. [...] "It is his--his freely; but do not, O do not! <b>let</b> him <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to countenance {{so terrible}} a risk." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{have heard}} {{all that you}} have said, so I will come, but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> you where are all my men which I have sent to the Cape, such as Maffett and Jonny and James, and after that the three men—Gobogobo, Mantose and Goebo—whom I sent.

And now it is all useless--all because of you, who have no fear, because you have no heart, no feeling, no-- (She breaks off, and throws herself on her knees.) Ah, General, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go: <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go without <b>asking</b> any questions. You shall have your despatches and letters: I swear it.|$|R
5000|$|Dear young people, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>ask</b> you a question... How are {{you using}} the gifts {{you have been}} given, the “power” which the Holy Spirit is even now {{prepared}} to release within you? What legacy will you leave to young people yet to come? What difference will you make? Pope Benedict XVI On 18 July, there was a live re-enactment of the Stations of the Cross at major city landmarks with an estimated 270,000 participants.
