5|$|After World War II, North Philadelphia {{suffered}} from the failure of its industries, and the PRR reduced both local and long-distance service due to competition from private autos, further reducing {{the importance of the}} station. Escalators and a new drop ceiling were added around 1955, the former due to the insistence of the city council. The surrounding parking <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> ground were rearranged in 1968.|$|E

5|$|After the {{decision}} was taken to cancel all the stories previously commissioned for Season 23, new stories were sought for the shortened 14 episode series. The plan was for three production blocks, divided up into two four-episode <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> one block of six episodes. Robert Holmes was assigned the opening four-part story and Philip Martin the second four-part story. The final six episodes were to be broken up into three two-part stories.|$|E
5|$|Front-end loaders are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking <b>lots,</b> <b>and</b> other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck. Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E

5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant <b>lots,</b> <b>and</b> tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol â€“ hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking <b>lots,</b> <b>and</b> other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E
5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing <b>lots,</b> <b>and</b> alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E

5|$|Old Louisville's {{boundaries}} are Kentucky Street to the north, Avery Street (Cardinal Boulevard) to the south, I-65 to the east, the CSX railroad tracks to the west. Originally, the neighborhood extended {{all the way}} to Broadway on the north, Attwood Street on the south, and Floyd Street on the East; but the northern part was mostly razed for parking <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> light industry, the southern area between Attwood and Avery Streets (now Cardinal Blvd) was razed when the University of Louisville doubled the size of its main campus, and I-65 was built through the area in the 1960s, which created a physical barrier between it and Shelby Park neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|San Marco, which {{eventually}} gave {{its name to}} the former area of South Jacksonville, broke ground in 1925 as the city's most ambitious development. It was constructed over 80 acres of the former Villa Alexandria estate, which had deteriorated after Martha Reed Mitchell's death in 1902. The developer was Telfair Stockton, who had previously established the exclusive Avondale neighborhood {{on the other side of}} the river. San Marco, designed as a fashionable, upscale development in keeping with Villa Alexandria's reputation, comprised 250 <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> a commercial district. It was remarkably successful from the beginning; apparently driven by land speculation, San Marco shattered local records by selling every lot within three hours of putting them up for sale, even though very little work had begun.|$|E
5|$|The Macdonald family {{obtained}} complete {{ownership of}} the park in 1951. After leaving Idlewild, the Mellon family also abandoned the Ligonier Valley Railroad, in decline after the closing of area coal mines and decreased passenger traffic. The railroad ceased operations in 1952. Although the park originally depended on the railroad, its closing had no effect. In 1913, the Lincoln Highway had been established as the first cross-country auto route, stretching from Times Square, New York City, to Lincoln Park, San Francisco. It passed directly by Idlewild on what is now U.S. Route 30. As automobile traffic to the park increased, several parking <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> a Gulf Oil gas station, a Mellon company, were added in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought {{residential}} development on the hilltops {{to the west and}} east of Valley. On September27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863â€“1916) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop the hill to the west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into <b>lots,</b> <b>and</b> the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J.H. Newhouse, and Harmison set aside two lots on a bluff for the site of a future hospital, which he planned to deed to any entity willing to build one.|$|E
5|$|The western {{county of}} Augusta in Virginia {{could no longer}} {{serve the needs of}} the far flung pioneers along the New River, and so in 1769, the county of Botetourt was created. Trigg was one of several {{appointed}} as its first justices of the peace, which was a judge presiding over misdemeanors and other civil cases. From 1770 to 1771, he served as magistrate, Justice of the County Court in Chancery and a Justice of Oyer and Terminer, which was a criminal court. When the town of Fincastle, Virginia was forming in 1770, Trigg was instrumental in its development, helping to sell <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> build the town's prison along with a courthouse with his father-in-law, Israel Christian.|$|E
5|$|After that junction, NY22 bends {{back to the}} north, {{paralleling}} I-684 as a narrow, shaded meandering two-lane rural {{route through}} the Westchester countryside of large wooded <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> houses well-screened from the road. In downtown Bedford, the first settlement since White Plains, the highway overlaps with NY172 for a few blocks, then intersects NY121 at its southern terminus. Route22 itself follows a due-north heading from the hamlet, passing the John Jay Homestead State Historic Site (the first National Historic Landmark along the highway), and Harvey School, before it briefly widens at a major intersection with NY35 near Katonah. Two miles north of that junction, NY22 becomes parallel to I-684 into the Town of Somers and the hamlet of Goldens Bridge. On {{the other side of}} the interstate, accessible via NY138, is the Goldens Bridge train station on Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, which begins a long parallel alignment with NY22 at this point.|$|E
