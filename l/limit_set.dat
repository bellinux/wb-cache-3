5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row at the top of the screen whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time <b>limit,</b> <b>set</b> by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E
5|$|By solving Apollonius' problem {{repeatedly}} {{to find the}} inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an Apollonian gasket, {{also known as a}} Leibniz packing or an Apollonian packing. This gasket is a fractal, being self-similar and having a dimension d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a regular (or rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less than that of a plane (d = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle. The Apollonian gasket also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the <b>limit</b> <b>set</b> of Kleinian groups.|$|E

40|$|<b>Limit</b> <b>setting</b> is {{a concept}} {{familiar}} to most mental health clinicians, but much less familiar to staff not specifically trained in mental health care. This paper presents guidelines developed for rehabilitation staff on the strategy of <b>limit</b> <b>setting.</b> The aim of these guidelines {{was to provide a}} starting point for ongoing education on <b>limit</b> <b>setting</b> and behavioural management for staff working in a non-psychiatric rehabilitation environment. <b>Limit</b> <b>setting</b> is presented, not only as a response to challenging behaviour, but also as fundamental to all patient care within the rehabilitation context. The guidelines draw on the concepts of <b>limit</b> <b>setting,</b> acting out, therapeutic relationships and therapeutic milieu as described in the psychiatric literature. A humanistic framework for helping people underpins the guidelines. Principles for selecting and enforcing limits are described. Finally, a list of clarification prompts is provided for clinicians to use when faced with challenging patient behaviour...|$|R

25|$|The risk {{of hearing}} damage {{also depends on}} the {{exposure}} time. The higher the volume, the faster hearing loss occurs. According to OSHA work safety guidelines, workers should be exposed to 90dBA noise for a maximum of 8 hours to avoid hearing loss. An increase to just 95dBA cuts the safe exposure to only 4 hours. But {{there seems to be}} no specific consensus on the level of exposure. NIOSH has an 8-hour recommended exposure <b>limit</b> <b>set</b> to 85dBA. Additionally, an increase to 93dBA instead of 95dBA halves the safe exposure time to 4 hours.|$|E

40|$|<b>Limit</b> <b>setting</b> is an {{intervention}} that is frequently used by mental health nurses. However, <b>limit</b> <b>setting</b> is poorly conceptualized, {{its purpose is}} unclear, and there are few evidence-based guidelines to assist nurses to <b>set</b> <b>limits</b> in a safe and effective manner. What is known is that {{the manner in which}} nurses <b>set</b> <b>limits</b> influences patients' perceptions of the interactions and their emotional and behavioural responses. In this qualitative study, 12 nurses and 12 patients participated in personal, semistructured interviews that aimed to explore <b>limit</b> <b>setting</b> and to propose principles to guide practice. The findings suggested that: (i) <b>limit</b> <b>setting</b> is important to safety in mental health hospitals; (ii) engaging patients in an empathic manner is necessary when <b>setting</b> <b>limits</b> (when nurses engage in an empathic manner, the therapeutic relationship {{is more likely to be}} preserved and the risk of aggressive responses is reduced); and (iii) an authoritative (fair, respectful, consistent, and knowledgeable), rather than authoritarian (controlling and indifferent), limit-setting style enhances positive outcomes with regards to adherence, reduced likelihood of aggression, and preservation of the therapeutic relationship. In conclusion, a limit-setting style characterized by empathic responding and an authoritative, rather than authoritarian interpersonal, style is recommended. Elucidating the components of this style is critical for effective training and best practice of mental health nurses, and to reduce aggressive responses from <b>limit</b> <b>setting...</b>|$|R

25|$|The European Union (EU) uses {{a linear}} dose {{response}} curve at low-levels of exposure, below {{the point where}} there are epidemiological data. In other words, the EU assumes there is no safe level of dioxins and PCBs. Accordingly, the European Union sets extremely stringent limits for dioxin and dioxin like PCBs in food, set just above the usual background levels found in various food categories e.g. fish, poultry, beef, pork etc. The <b>limit</b> <b>set</b> for dioxins in pork fat and meat is 1 pg/g TEQ i.e. 1 parts per trillion (ppt) (see swimming pool illustration).
