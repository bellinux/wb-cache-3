25|$|The six spoiler {{actuators}} {{were sent}} to the Royal Norwegian Air Force's facility at Kjeller for examination. Radiographic examinations confirmed that they were all in a closed and <b>locked</b> <b>position.</b> A simulation was carried out in a flight simulator to see if, given the conditions, a 146 could land at Sørstokken without operative spoilers. It concluded that this would be possible with a dry runway, but not if it is wet. An extensive investigation of the spoiler system was carried out by Aviation Engineering, who published their findings on 10 May 2011. AIBN quickly started working out from a hypothesis that the spoilers did not deploy and investigated three possible causes: a mechanical failure in the lever, a failure in two thrust lever micro switches, and an open circuit breaker in the lift spoiler system. In the latter it would have been necessary for two of four to fail, although one could have failed without being detected.|$|E
2500|$|Without {{the benefit}} of the cargo door to inspect, the NTSB looked to circumstantial {{evidence}} including prior incidents that involved cargo doors. [...] In 1987, Pan Am Flight 125, another Boeing 747, outbound from London Heathrow Airport, encountered pressurization problems at , causing the crew to abort the flight and return to the airport. After the safe landing, the aircraft's cargo door was found to be ajar by about [...] along its ventral edge. When the aircraft was examined in a maintenance hangar, all of the locking arms were found to be either damaged or sheared off entirely. Boeing initially attributed this to mishandling by ground crew. To test this concern, Boeing instructed 747 operators to shut and lock the cargo door with the external handle, and then activate the door-open switch with the handle still in the <b>locked</b> <b>position.</b> Since the S-2 switch was designed to deactivate the door motors if the handle was locked, nothing should have happened. Some of the airlines reported the door motors did indeed begin running, attempting to force the door open against the locking sectors and causing damage to the mechanism.|$|E

30|$|The use of {{syndrome}} coding in steganographic schemes {{tends to}} reduce distortion during embedding. The more complete model {{comes from the}} wet papers (J. Fridrich et al., 2005) and allow to <b>lock</b> <b>positions</b> which cannot be modified. Recently, binary BCH codes have been investigated and seem to be good candidates in this context (D. Schönfeld and A. Winkler, 2006). Here, we show that Reed-Solomon codes are twice better {{with respect to the}} number of locked positions; in fact, they are optimal. First, a simple and efficient scheme based on Lagrange interpolation is provided to achieve the optimal number of <b>locked</b> <b>positions.</b> We also consider a new and more general problem, mixing wet papers (<b>locked</b> <b>positions)</b> and simple syndrome coding (low number of changes) in order to face not only passive but also active wardens. Using list decoding techniques, we propose an efficient algorithm that enables an adaptive tradeoff between the number of <b>locked</b> <b>positions</b> and the number of changes.|$|R

50|$|Examination of the {{aircraft}} and the cargo door, which was recovered largely intact in Windsor, demonstrated that the latches had never rotated to their <b>locked</b> <b>position.</b> In their <b>locked</b> <b>position,</b> pressure on the door presses the latches further shut, and no force is transmitted into the actuator system that closes and opens them. With the latches only partially closed, forces on the door were transmitted back into the actuator, eventually overwhelming it at about 6,600 lbf. The rapid depressurization when the door broke off caused the floor above it to partially cave in, which pulled the rudder cable to its extension limit and severed several other operating cables.|$|E

30|$|We {{have shown}} in this paper that Reed-Solomon codes are good {{candidates}} for designing efficient steganographic schemes. They enable to mix wet papers (<b>locked</b> <b>positions)</b> and simple syndrome coding (small number of changes) in order to face not only passive but also active wardens. If we compare them to the previous studied codes, as binary BCH codes, Reed-Solomon codes improve the management of <b>locked</b> <b>positions</b> during embedding, hence ensuring a better management of the distortion; {{they are able to}} lock twice the number of positions. Moreover, they are optimal {{in the sense that they}} enable to lock the maximal number of positions. We first provide an efficient way to do it through Lagrange interpolation. We then propose a new algorithm based on Guruswami-Sudan list decoding, which is slower but provides an adaptive tradeoff between the number of <b>locked</b> <b>positions</b> and the average number of changes.|$|R
