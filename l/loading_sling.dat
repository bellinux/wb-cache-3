Specifically discussed are the rotorcraft-load aeroservoelastic stability, load-on handling qualities, effects of automatic flight control system failure, load suspension system failure, and load stability at speed. Based on past experience and treatment of these phenomena, criteria are proposed to form a package for airworthiness qualification. The desired end objective is a set of operational flight envelopes for the rotorcraft with intended loads that can be provided to the user to guide operations in the field.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the analytical investigations {{which have been}} performed in preparation for flight testing of a flight director for helicopter with <b>sling</b> <b>load.</b> The flight director developed at DLR gives the pilot a convenient aid to effectively damp the load pendulum motion and to allow manoeuvring without exciting oscillatory load modes. Swinging helicopter external <b>sling</b> <b>loads</b> often lead to dangerous situations which not only {{can result in a}} total loss of the transported load itself but also can endanger the safety of the helicopter and its crew. The flight director was flight tested on DLR's BO 105 using mainly two different types of external load: a relatively heavy tree log with a basic stable behaviour and a relatively light aerodynamic effective body with only marginal stability properties prone to a coupled lateral pendulum-yaw mode. The analysis base on a non-linear dynamic and aerodynamic load model developed for these investigations...|$|R

40|$|Helicopter {{external}} air transportation {{plays an important}} role in today's world. For both military and civilian helicopters, external <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> operations offer an efficient and expedient method of handling heavy, oversized cargo. With the ability to reach areas otherwise inaccessible by ground transportation, helicopter external load operations are conducted in industries such as logging, construction, and fire fighting, as well as in support of military tactical transport missions. Historically, helicopter and load combinations have been qualified through flight testing, requiring considerable time and cost. With advancements in simulation and flight test techniques there is potential to substantially reduce costs and increase the safety of helicopter <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> certification. Validated simulation tools make possible accurate prediction of operational flight characteristics before initial flight tests. Real time analysis of test data improves the safety and efficiency of the testing programs. To advance these concepts, the U. S. Army and NASA, in cooperation with the Israeli Air Force and Technion, under a Memorandum of Agreement, seek to develop and validate a numerical model of the UH- 60 with <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> and demonstrate a method of near real time flight test analysis. This thesis presents results from flight tests of a U. S. Army Black Hawk helicopter with various external loads. Tests were conducted as the U. S. first phase of this MOA task. The primary load was a container express box (CONEX) which contained a compact instrumentation package. The flights covered the airspeed range from hover to 70 knots. Primary maneuvers were pitch and roll frequency sweeps, steps, and doublets. Results of the test determined the effect of the suspended load on both the aircraft's handling qualities and its control system's stability margins. Included were calculations of the stability characteristics of the load's pendular motion. Utilizing CIFER(R) software, a method for near-real time system identification was also demonstrated during the flight test program...|$|R
40|$|Helicopter {{slung load}} {{operations}} {{are common in}} both military and civil contexts. The slung load adds load rigid body modes, <b>sling</b> stretching, and <b>load</b> aerodynamics to the system dynamics, which can degrade system stability and handling qualities, and reduce the operating envelope of the combined system below that of the helicopter alone. Further, {{the effects of the}} load on system dynamics vary significantly among the large range of <b>loads,</b> <b>slings,</b> and flight conditions that a utility helicopter will encounter in its operating life. In this context, military helicopters and loads are often qualified for slung load operations via flight tests which can be time consuming and expensive. One way to reduce the cost and time required to carry out these tests and generate quantitative data more readily is to provide an efficient method for analysis during the flight, so that numerous test points can be evaluated in a single flight test, with evaluations performed in near real time following each test point and prior to clearing the aircraft to the next point. Methodology for this was implemented at Ames and demonstrated in slung load flight tests in 1997 and was improved for additional flight tests in 1999. The parameters of interest for the slung load tests are aircraft handling qualities parameters (bandwidth and phase delay), stability margins (gain and phase margin), and load pendulum roots (damping and natural frequency). A procedure for the identification of these parameters from frequency sweep data was defined using the CIFER software package. CIFER is a comprehensive interactive package of utilities for frequency domain analysis previously developed at Ames for aeronautical flight test applications. It has been widely used in the US on a variety of aircraft, including some primitive flight time analysis applications...|$|R
