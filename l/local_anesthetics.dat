5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|The Racz {{procedure}} {{employs a}} wire-bound or spring loaded catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibroids, that have formed around the nerve roots, {{and allows for}} <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics,</b> saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area. This procedure was assigned a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics,</b> saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
25|$|Buprenorphine also blocks {{voltage-gated}} sodium channels via the <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> binding site, {{and this}} underlies its potent <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> properties.|$|R
25|$|In addition, both propoxyphene and its {{metabolite}} norpropoxyphene have <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> effects at concentrations about 10 times those {{necessary for}} opioid effects. Norpropoxyphene {{is a more}} potent <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> than propoxyphene, and they are both more potent than lidocaine. <b>Local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> activity appears {{to be responsible for}} the arrhythmias and cardiovascular depression seen in propoxyphene poisoning.|$|R
50|$|Articaine is {{a dental}} amide-type <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic.</b> It {{is the most}} widely used <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> in a number of European {{countries}} and is available in many countries around.|$|R
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics)</b> cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E

30|$|Various {{studies have}} {{compared}} ultrasound-guided TAP block with trocar site <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> infiltration. The results varied from significant reduction [33] to non-significant reduction [34] in cumulative morphine use at 24  h with TAP blocks compared with <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> infiltration. A recent trial [35] {{has reported that}} ultrasound-guided TAP block has no significant clinical benefit over trocar site <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> infiltration in laparoscopic nephrectomy.

40|$|Patients with {{a history}} of adverse {{reactions}} to a <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> may often be incorrectly labeled as “allergic. ” Determining if a patient is allergic to a <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> is essential in the selection of appropriate pain control techniques. <b>Local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> allergy testing may be performed safely and with reasonable accuracy by a knowledgeable practitioner.

25|$|Topical anesthesia: <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> {{that are}} {{specially}} formulated to diffuse through the mucous membranes or skin {{to give a}} thin layer of analgesia to an area (e.g. EMLA patches).|$|E
25|$|In {{some forms}} of neuropathy, {{especially}} post-herpetic neuralgia, the topical application of <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> such as lidocaine is reported to provide relief. A transdermal patch containing lidocaine is available commercially in some countries.|$|E
40|$|Bupivacaine {{toxicity}} is {{a recognized}} complication of procedures done under <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> infiltration. While <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> toxicity is rare, it is potentially catastrophic and life-threatening. A 20 % lipid emulsion {{has been used}} to resuscitate patients after bupivacaine overdose or inadvertent intravascular injection. While the use of lipid emulsion for <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> toxicity has been reported extensively in the anesthesia literature, it has not yet been reported in the cardiology literature. We report a case of <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> toxicity resulting in pulseless electrical activity during an electrophysiology procedure that was successfully treated by infusion of 20 % lipid emulsion...|$|R
50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> nerve block (<b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> {{regional}} nerve blockade, or often simply nerve block) is {{a short-term}} nerve block involving the injection of <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> {{as close to}} the nerve as possible for pain relief. The <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> bathes the nerve and numbs the area of the body that is innervated by that nerve. The goal of the nerve block is to prevent pain by blocking the transmission of pain signals from the surgical site. The block provides pain relief during and after the surgery. The advantages of nerve blocks over general anesthesia include faster recovery, monitored anesthesia care vs. intubation with an airway tube, and much less postoperative pain.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of this complication is considered as multifactorial. The cause of complete ONB, in this case, was considered {{due to the}} intraabdominal dissemination of the <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> mixture after the peritoneal dissection around the pubis. The obturator nerve, along with the obturator artery and vein, runs toward the superior pubic ramus and pierces the obturator internus muscle. The injected <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> was estimated to infiltrate into the abdominal cavity and affect the obturator nerve, adjacent to the incision at this point. The {{mechanism of}} FICB is considered {{to the spread of}} the <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> toward the lateral edge of the psoas major muscle between the transversus abdominis muscle and the continuum of the transversalis fascia/fascia iliaca [5]. Ultrasound has also revealed that a large volume of the <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> can spread into the femoral triangle [4]. The slow and incomplete effect of the FICB in this case could be the result of the relatively small amount of the injected <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic.</b> Three hours after the administration of the <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> is extraordinarily late for the onset of a block. The frequent active movement of the hip joint by the patient after he noticed the muscle weakness of the adductors could have facilitated the spread of the small amount of <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> toward the psoas major muscle.|$|R
25|$|Vasoconstrictors {{are present}} in most <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics,</b> and are {{intended}} to increase the length of analgesia by reducing blood supply to the region which reduces the amount of local anesthetic solution that is absorbed into the circulation and carried from the local tissues. Hence, use of <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> with vasoconstrictors is {{associated with an increased}} risk of dry socket occurring. However, frequently use of local anesthetic without vasoconstrictors would not provide sufficient analgesia, especially in the presence of acute pain and infection, meaning that the total dose of local anesthetic may need to be increased. Adequate pain control during the extraction is balanced against an increased risk of dry socket.|$|E
25|$|Of {{these first}} famous anesthetics, only nitrous oxide is still widely used today, with {{chloroform}} and ether having {{been replaced by}} safer but sometimes more expensive general anesthetics, and cocaine by more effective <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> with less abuse potential.|$|E
25|$|Clinical LAs {{belong to}} one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics.</b> Synthetic LAs are {{structurally}} related to cocaine. They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have a very low abuse potential and do not produce hypertension or (with few exceptions) vasoconstriction.|$|E

25|$|Diphenhydramine is a first-generation {{antihistamine}} used {{to treat}} a number of conditions including allergic symptoms and itchiness, the common cold, insomnia, motion sickness, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Diphenhydramine also has local anesthetic properties, and {{has been used as}} such in people allergic to common <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> such as lidocaine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> {{can block}} almost every nerve between the {{peripheral}} nerve endings {{and the central}} nervous system. The most peripheral technique is topical anesthesia to the skin or other body surface. Small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually (peripheral nerve block) or in anatomic nerve bundles (plexus anesthesia). Spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia merge into the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|When pain {{is blocked}} from {{a part of}} the body using <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics,</b> it is {{generally}} referred to as regional anesthesia. There are many types of regional anesthesia either by injecting into the tissue itself, a vein that feeds the area or around a nerve trunk that supplies sensation to the area. The latter are called nerve blocks and are divided into peripheral or central nerve blocks.|$|E

30|$|Hypocapnia induced {{following}} the accidental intravenous infusion of a <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> can mitigate anesthetic toxicity, but {{the effects of}} hypocapnia induced prior to <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> infusion are unknown.

25|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} {{associated with}} overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic {{is characterized by}} hypotension, atrioventricular conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, bupivacaine avidly blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> (especially the esters) are not uncommon, but true allergy is very rare. Allergic {{reactions to}} the esters is usually due to a sensitivity to their metabolite, para-aminobenzoic acid, and does not result in cross-allergy to amides. Therefore, amides {{can be used as}} alternatives in those patients. Nonallergic reactions may resemble allergy in their manifestations. In some cases, skin tests and provocative challenge may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of allergy. Also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur, which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} are allergic {{to the common}} <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> like lidocaine and probably should not consider lip injections. Some react badly to the skin test that patients must take before receiving collagen. Other patients who should not forego procedures to the lip include those who have active skin conditions like cold sores, blood clotting problems, infections, scarring of the lips or certain diseases like diabetes or lupus that cause slower healing. Patients with facial nerve disorders, severe hypertension or recurrent herpes simplex lesions should also eschew lip augmentation. As in all surgeries, smokers complicate completion of their procedure {{as well as the}} speed of healing.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the clinical pain during <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> injection using such intra-oral device. Study Design: A comparative split-mouth clinical study to evaluate clinical pain was conducted among the subjects who required bilateral <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> intra-oral injections. Results: A total of 99 subjects {{participated in the}} study out of which 39 were female. A total of 256 <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> injections were administered to all the subjects with at least one pair of similar <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> injections. Comparison of mean VAS score for anticipated pain in without vibration group was significantly higher in all types of nerve blocks when compared to that of with vibration. Similarly, the comparison of mean VAS score for actual pain in without vibration group was significantly higher in all types of nerve blocks when compared to that of with vibration. No significant difference in the mean VAS score was seen between anticipated and actual pain in without vibration group with respect to inferior alveolar (p = 0. 673), infra-orbital (p = 0. 175) and palatal (p = 0. 343) <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> injections. The mean VAS score was significantly lower for actual pain when compared to anticipated pain in vibration group with respect to inferior alveolar (p < 0. 001) and infra-orbital (p = 0. 002) <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> injections.
