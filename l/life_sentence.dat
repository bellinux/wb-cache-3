5|$|The {{administration}} of Cristina Kirchner continued {{the trials of}} military personnel involved in the Dirty War, started by her husband. There {{have been more than}} 500 people sentenced, and 1,000 convicted, in a process that was unprecedented in Latin America. De facto president Jorge Rafael Videla, who was convicted and given a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> in 1985 and pardoned years later, received a new <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> in 2010. General Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, who waged war against the leftist guerrillas in the northern Argentine provinces, received a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|After {{one hour}} of jury deliberation, Wise {{was found guilty of}} first-degree murder. The jury urged mercy in sentencing, and the judge sentenced Wise to a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> in prison, under the terms of which she could only be freed by {{executive}} clemency.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's <b>life</b> <b>sentence,</b> after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
5000|$|Mahmud Muhammad Ahmed Atwan (3 <b>life</b> <b>sentences),</b> Musa Daud Muhammad Akari (3 <b>life</b> <b>sentences)</b> and Majid Hassan Rajab Abu Qatish (3 <b>life</b> <b>sentences)</b> - militants {{that killed}} the Israeli {{policeman}} Nissim Toledano in 1992.|$|R

5|$|The French {{intended}} to deport Long to French Guiana, but {{the outbreak of}} World War I in 1914 interrupted their plans. As a result, Long remained in Saigon Central Prison, serving his <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> with hard labour. The French were unaware that Long was still in contact with his supporters.|$|E
5|$|The verdict (8 November 2013) and {{sentence}} (6 December 2013) {{were both}} {{delivered at the}} Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. The judge advocate (the civilian judge heading the panel at a court-martial) was Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett. The verdict carried with it a mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence,</b> so {{it was only in}} the judge advocate's and court-martial board's power to decide on the minimum sentence once the board had found Blackman guilty. He was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison. On 22 May 2014, at the Courts Martial Appeal Court, its most senior judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, upheld the <b>life</b> <b>sentence,</b> but reduced Blackman's minimum term to 8 years.|$|E
5|$|After {{the trial}} it was {{disclosed}} that pornographic images of {{children had been}} found on Tabak's laptop. In December 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service {{announced that he would}} be prosecuted for possessing the images. On 2 March 2015, Tabak pleaded guilty to possessing more than 100 indecent images of children, and was sentenced to 10 months in prison, to run concurrently with his existing <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> for murder.|$|E
5000|$|In {{judicial}} practice, back-to-back <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> are {{two or more}} consecutive <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> {{given to}} a felon. This penalty is typically used to prevent the felon from ever getting released from prison.|$|R
25|$|On April 14, 1998, the Mafiosi Gaspare Spatuzza, Nino Mangano, Cosimo Lo Nigro and Luigi Giacalone {{received}} <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> for {{the killing}} of Puglisi. The Graviano brothers also received <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> for ordering the killing.|$|R
50|$|The final {{decision}} as to whether a <b>life</b> <b>sentenced</b> prisoner is released rests solely with the Minister, and as such, the length of time spent in custody by offenders serving <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> can vary substantially.|$|R
5|$|Also, in 2006, Moussaoui, who some {{originally}} suspected {{might have}} been the assigned 20th hijacker, was convicted for the lesser role of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and air piracy. He is serving a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> without parole in the United States. Mounir el-Motassadeq, an associate of the Hamburg-based hijackers, is serving 15 years in Germany for his role in helping the hijackers prepare for the attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Negron is the {{defendant}} {{in a court}} proceeding, facing a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> for his killing of Rodolfo. He is successfully defended by a powerful executive attorney {{acting on behalf of}} a unknown wealthy man. Hector is brought to the Bahamas and is reunited with the Head of the Primavera, accompanied by its new owner who takes out a rosary and reveals himself as an adult Angelo. They both hold Hector's rosary and happily burst into tears.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the U.S. conferred the 2014 Human Rights Defender Award on Askarov. The Kyrgyz {{government}} protested {{this decision}} and formally terminated a 1993 agreement on {{cooperation between the}} U.S. and Kyrgyzstan. On 12 July 2016, the Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan revoked the <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> against Askarov and sent his case to the Chui Oblast Court for review. He was resentenced for life on 24 January 2017.|$|E
50|$|Other {{countries}} either allow multiple concurrent <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> {{which can}} be served {{at the same time}} (e.g. Russia), or allow multiple consecutive <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> with a single minimum term (e.g. Australia), thus allowing earlier release of the prisoner.|$|R
50|$|During sentencing, Dritan and Shain Duka {{received}} <b>life</b> <b>sentences</b> for {{the conspiracy}} conviction, {{with an additional}} 30 years for related weapons charges. Eljvir Duka and Mohamad Shnewer both received <b>life</b> <b>sentences,</b> and Serdar Tatar was sentenced to 33 years in prison.|$|R

5|$|Gordimer's {{homage to}} Fischer extends to using {{excerpts}} from his writings and public {{statements in the}} book. Lionel Burger's treason trial speech from the dock is taken from the speech Fischer gave at his own trial in 1966. Fischer {{was the leader of}} the banned SACP who was given a <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> for furthering the aims of communism and conspiracy to overthrow the government. Quoting people like Fischer was not permitted in South Africa. All Gordimer's quotes from banned sources in Burger's Daughter are unattributed, and also include writings of Joe Slovo, a member of the SACP and the outlawed ANC, and a pamphlet written and distributed by the Soweto Students Representative Council during the Soweto uprising.|$|E
5|$|Hayes is {{an inmate}} of the Connecticut Department of Correction. His {{criminal}} history shows him sentenced {{for his first}} offense {{at the age of}} 16. Subsequent to sentencing for the Petit murders, and up until August 16, 2016 (when he was transferred to a correctional facility in Pennsylvania as part of an interstate corrections compact), he was incarcerated in the Northern Correctional Institution, which houses the state's death row for men, in Somers, Connecticut. The method of execution employed by Connecticut was lethal injection, and the state execution chamber was located in the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers. This sentence became an automatic <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> when Connecticut abolished the death penalty in 2015.|$|E
5|$|He was {{subsequently}} arrested and prosecuted {{on charges of}} creating mass disturbances, incitement of ethnic hatred, and complicity in murder. Following a trial protested by several international human rights groups for irregularities—including alleged torture and the courtroom intimidation of witnesses by police—Askarov was given a <b>life</b> <b>sentence,</b> which he is currently serving. In November 2010, Askarov's health {{was reported to be}} rapidly deteriorating {{as a result of his}} confinement. Numerous groups have advocated on his behalf, including Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, People In Need, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Amnesty International, the latter of which designated him a prisoner of conscience.|$|E

5|$|Philip Marc Smith (born July 10, 1965 in Willenhall , England) is an English spree killer {{serving a}} <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> {{for the murders}} of three women in Birmingham. A former {{fairground}} worker employed at the Rainbow public house in the Digbeth area of the city, Smith killed his victims over a four-day period in November 2000, befriending two {{of them at the}} Rainbow before carrying out the crimes. All three victims were mutilated almost beyond recognition, but Smith was quickly identified as the killer because of the overwhelming evidence linking him to the deaths.|$|E
5|$|When President Day {{retired in}} July 1996, SDSU's {{incoming}} freshman had a 38% success rate in {{graduating from the}} university within six years. Day {{was replaced by the}} university's seventh president, Stephen Weber.

5|$|Youtsey, who {{received}} a <b>life</b> <b>sentence,</b> did not appeal, but after two years in prison, he turned state's evidence. In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. He backed the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions {{in the details of}} Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E
5|$|At Shakur's {{sentencing}} {{hearing on}} April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33years in state prison (10 to 12 {{for the four}} counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence.</b> However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently narrowed {{the application of the}} law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for contempt of court, concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom. To become eligible for parole, Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.|$|E
5|$|Giuseppe Elia Pace, an {{advocate}} and {{close friend of}} Mikiel Anton Vassalli, {{was found guilty of}} treason during the reign of de Rohan and was sentenced for flogging in Valletta followed by a permanent exile out of Malta. Vassalli was imprisoned at the Klistanija {{at the end of the}} rule of the Order of St. John, and was accused of plotting revolutionary ideas during the magistracy of Grand Master Hompesch. Vassalli denied the accusations and remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, he received visits from the father of Fortunato Panzavecchia. While dining together around a table with prison guards, Panzavecchia took notes from conversations he had with Vassalli. These notes shed more light on the life of Vassalli, who after his death became the national Maltese linguistic. Though given a <b>life</b> <b>sentence,</b> he either managed to escape or was released after the expulsion of the Order from Malta.|$|E
