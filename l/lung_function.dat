The objective {{of the study was}} to study the association of underweight on dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> in Gujarati Indian adolescents. Methodology: A cross sectional study was conducted on 85 Gujarati Indian adolescents boys of 17 - 21 years age group. The nutritional status of the participants was assessed by measuring BMI and they were grouped into normal weight and underweight boys. Total body fat % and fat mass were measured by Omron Body Fat Monitor HBF- 302. Dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> (FEV 1, FEV 6, FEV 1 /FEV 6 and PEFR) were recorded, using Piko- 6 and Wrightâ€™s Peak flow meter. Results: FEV 1 (P &lt; 0. 01), FEV 6 (P &lt; 0. 01) and PEFR (P &lt; 0. 01) were found to be significantly lower in the underweight boys in comparison to the normal weight boys. BMI showed a significant positive correlation with dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>functions.</b> Amongst underweight boys body mass index and fat mass index were directly associated with dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>functions.</b> Conclusion: We may conclude that nutritional status plays a major role in dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> in Gujarati Indian adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 40 - 60 % of {{patients}} remain sufferers of sequela of obstructive, restrictive or mixed patterns of lung disease despite treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The prevalence of these abnormalities in Tanzania remains unknown. A descriptive cross-sectional study {{was carried out}} among 501 patients with PTB who had completed at least 20 weeks of treatment. These underwent spirometry and their <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> were classified as normal or abnormal (obstructive, restrictive or mixed).

5|$|<b>Lung</b> <b>function</b> {{testing is}} carried out by {{evaluating}} a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the residual volume. Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Several {{factors such}} as {{respiratory}} muscle strength, lung compliance, resistance to airflow etc., affect the <b>lung</b> <b>functions.</b> Studies on pulmonary functions in relation to body composition are lacking. We hypothesized that <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> both in the obese and the undernourished subjects would be reduced due to mechanical disadvantages. Therefore, {{the present study was}} designed with the aim to compare some aspects of <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> in humans with varying body fat content and fat free mass. A large number of young college students of both sexes included in the study were classified into normal (N), undernourished (UN) and overweight (OW) groups based on their body mass index (BMI). Body fat (BF) and lean body mass (LBM) were estimated in each subject using Futrex- 5000 A. The body fat varied from 13 % to 25 % in male subjects and 26 % to 35 % in females as BMI increased.

5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their <b>lung</b> <b>function.</b> Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> may be permanent.|$|E

Aims and Objectives: The present study is undertaken to assess the change in <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> in apparently healthy young adult habitual smokers compared to their age matched controls. Materials and Methods: A random sample of apparently healthy young adult habitual smokers (n= 40) and nonsmokers (n= 40) between age group 17 - 35 years with history suggesting of pack years of 2 - 10 years were selected from students & employeeÂ’s of B. L. D. E. UÂ’s Sri B. M. Patil Medical College,Hospital & Research Centre Bijapur (Karnataka), India. Spirometric <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> recorded were forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), FEV 1 %, Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and Maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). Results: The results suggested that inapparently healthy habitual smokers there was significant decrease in FEV 1 (L) (- 13. 34 %, p< 0. 001), FEV 1 % (- 10. 76 %, p< 0. 001), PEFR (- 45. 26 %, p< 0. 0001) and MEP (- 35. 51 %, p< 0. 0001) compared to nonsmokers and decrease in FEV 1 was negatively correlated withpack years in smokers (r 2 = 0. 063, p= 0. 001). Reduced <b>lung</b> <b>functions</b> and negative correlation to pack years may be attributed todecreased airway diameter & reflex broncho- constriction in response to inhaled smoke particles. Conclusions: In conclusion young adulthabitual smokers who were apparently healthy are more prone for respiratory dysfunction than their nonsmoker counterparts. FEV 1 reduction in relation to pack years acts as an important determinant for detecting lung dysfunction in the early stage of the disease. As the risk of having smoking related diseases depends mainly on number of pack years, it is suggested that quitting smoking earliest helps to get greatest health benefits in apparently healthy young adult habitual smokers...|$|R

Body dimensions included lengths, breadths, circumferences, skinfolds, and Heath-Carter somatotype, while fitness tests included measures of health- and performance-related fitness, and cardiovascular and <b>lung</b> <b>functions.</b> Age-specific correlations were calculated between SA and anthropometric dimensions, fitness tests and cardiovascular and <b>lung</b> <b>functions,</b> while age-specific stepwise multiple regressions were used to investigate the relative {{importance of}} SA, CA, ST and WT in explaining fitness and cardiovascular and <b>lung</b> <b>functions.</b> SA is most highly correlated with lengths and then with breadths, circumferences and skinfolds in this order. SA per se or in interaction with CA is the only significant predictor of somatic characteristics. Among fitness items, physical working capacity and static strength correlate highest with SA. Bent arm hang, leg lifts and sit-ups correlate negatively with SA but values are low, while all other components correlate at non-significant or low levels. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that, with few exceptions, CA, SA, ST and WT and their interactions explain less than 10 % of the variance in most physical fitness items.

Ten to 14 days after acute exposure to some agents (e.g. ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury), some patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans progressing to ARDS. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia can ensue when granulation tissue accumulates in the terminal airways and alveolar ducts during the body's reparative process.
