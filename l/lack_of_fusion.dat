25|$|In Western music, dissonance is {{the quality}} of sounds that seems {{unstable}} and has an aural need to resolve to a stable consonance. Both consonance and dissonance are words applied to harmony, chords, and intervals and, by extension, to melody, tonality, and even rhythm and metre. Although there are physical and neurological facts important to understanding the idea of dissonance, the precise definition of dissonance is culturally conditioned—definitions of and conventions of usage related to dissonance vary greatly among different musical styles, traditions, and cultures. Nevertheless, the basic ideas of dissonance, consonance, and resolution exist in some form in all musical traditions that have a concept of melody, harmony, or tonality. Dissonance being the complement of consonance it may be defined, as above, as non-coincidence of partials, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> or pattern matching, or as complexity.|$|E

500|$|Further {{developments}} in welding steel with GMAW {{led to a}} variation known as short-circuit transfer (SCT) or short-arc GMAW, in which the current is lower than for the globular method. As {{a result of the}} lower current, the heat input for the short-arc variation is considerably reduced, making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing the amount of distortion and residual stress in the weld area. As in globular welding, molten droplets form on the tip of the electrode, but instead of dropping to the weld pool, they bridge the gap between the electrode and the weld pool {{as a result of the}} lower wire feed rate. [...] This causes a short circuit and extinguishes the arc, but it is quickly reignited after the surface tension of the weld pool pulls the molten metal bead off the electrode tip. This process is repeated about 100 times per second, making the arc appear constant to the human eye. This type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than the globular variation, and allows for welding in all positions, albeit with slower deposition of weld material. Setting the weld process parameters (volts, amps and wire feed rate) within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc: generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications. Also, using short-arc transfer can result in <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials, due to the lower arc energy and rapidly freezing weld pool. Like the globular variation, it can only be used on ferrous metals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Laser {{additive}} technology (LAT) uses {{a laser beam}} which locally melts the target material surface. The technology has been widely used for high value and critical components mainly in the aerospace and the biomedical industries. Due to its favourable properties, titanium has become a workhorse metal, particularly the grade 5 titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V). Recent years have seen increased research and development studies on {{the application of the}} laser {{additive technology}} in the production of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V components. These ranged from free form fabrication, materials processing, manufacturing, maintenance and repairs. Attempts to use the laser additive technology for the repair of cracks in Ti alloy components have been recently reported where V-grooves have been recommended. Further attempts to use narrow U-grooves for crack repairs were not successful and hence not widely adopted. There is limited published work on the use of narrow rectangular grooves for crack repairs in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. There is therefore a need to further investigate the potential repairing of U-cracks using LAT. This research work established through experimental design, mechanical and metallographic characterization, a process that was used for the laser additive repair of cracks in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V components. The preliminary repairs were made without laser re-melting. They were analysed for defects using the optical microscopy (OM) and their macrographs revealed <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sidewall <b>fusion,</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interlayer <b>fusion,</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> intralayer <b>fusion,</b> unmelted powder and porosity. The matrix used for the preliminary repairs was then optimised using the observations made during the preliminary phase. It was from this preliminary phase optimization that the final experimental matrix of the research was developed. Controlled laser re-melting, reduction of the spot size diameter and lowering of the scanning speed were introduced as main process parameters of the optimized matrix. The optimized repairs were further characterized using the optical microscopy (OM) and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The optimized repairs were observed to have very limited defects. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses revealed that the deposits were dominated by Ti, Al and V which were the main compositions of the material. The Vickers microhardness tests, microhardness-tensile strength correlations and the Charpy impact tests obtained results confirmed mechanically sound repairs with good evolving microstructural properties [...] .

However the main difficulty in ultrasonic testing is that the precise recognition of the defect type. In conventional ultrasonic A-scan methods recognition of the defect type (porosity, slag, crack etc.) is ascertained by a series of movement of the probe as rotational, orbital, lateral and transverse to observe the echo pattern. Here the human eye perceives many facts simultaneously by moving a transducer in infinite increments in 3 D to seek out additional information-the mind sorts and processes the accumulated real-time facts and combines them with empirical data from experience and case history before making final decision on the defect. These uultrasonic echo patterns are quite complex since those may contain many signals other than defect echoes, same defect may display different echo patterns, different defects may display similar echo patterns and the amplitude and shape of the signal may change due to slight movement of the testing probe. Therefore the interpretation of defects using this technique is very complicated and totally depends on the experience of the operator who carries out the testing. Hence only well-experienced NDT personnel can identify defect type using this method. This is one of the main drawbacks related to Ultrasonic A-scan technique. The objective of this research is to study the relationship between type of defect and echo amplitude in single-V butt welded steel plates and to propose a new concept to identify defect type with the help of a self developed software which will be cheep, portable and simple to understand by the operator.

The palate is mineralized, suggesting that the specimen was still at least a subadult. Adult individuals would have grown up to twice the length of the type specimen.|$|E
30|$|The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{in vitro}} <b>fusion</b> {{activity}} for human ATL 1 {{suggests that it}} may be a less active fusion enzyme than Drosophila ATL, but its activity is elevated by unclear mechanisms in vivo. These two ATLs behave differently in cells in at least two respects. First, depletion of Drosophila ATL causes ER fragmentation (Orso et al., 2009), but depletion of human ATL does not. Second, Drosophila ATL tends to form puncta around the junctions of the tubular ER network (Moss et al., 2011), but human ATL 1 is evenly distributed along ER membranes. Whether these differences are linked to the different in vitro activities of the two ATLs remains to be investigated.|$|R
40|$|Welding defects {{detection}} and classification {{is very important}} to guarantee the welding quality. Over the last 30 years, there has been a large amount of research attempting to develop an automatic (or semiautomatic) system for the {{detection and}} classification of weld defects in continuous welds using radiography. In this paper, we describe an automatic system for classification of welding defects from radiographic images and compare with KNN and SVM classifiers. We classify and recognize the linear defects such as <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> penetrations, incomplete <b>fusion</b> and external undercut. Experimental results have shown the classification method is useful for the lengthy defects and obtained through our method is better than the two classifiers methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of reconstructing algorithms like the Ultrasonic Synthetic Aperture Focussing Method allows to image defects in components. How close an "image" approaches {{the shape of}} a "real defect" depends on the quality of data. With a software package " 3 D-Ray-Tracing" the propagation of SH-, SV-, and longitudinal waves could be visualized including mode conversion at the seams of the weld. The weld has been modeled by its elastic constants and grain orientation. Two types of defects have been simulated: a surface connected crack and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> side wall <b>fusion.</b> Simulating different insonification angles, it could be shown, that the 60 ø probe is superior to that of the 45 ø probe...|$|R
