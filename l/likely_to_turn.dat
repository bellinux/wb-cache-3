Arguing in support for SNAP, the Food Research and Action Center argued that “putting more resources quickly {{into the hands of}} the people most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> around and spend it can both boost the economy and cushion the hardships on vulnerable people who face a constant struggle against hunger.” Researchers have found that every $1 that is spent from SNAP results in $1.73 of economic activity. In California, the cost-benefit ratio is even higher: for every $1 spent from SNAP between $3.67 to $8.34 is saved in health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office also rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-effective of all spending and tax options it examined for boosting growth and jobs in a weak economy.|$|E

This article uses data from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances to compare the borrowing experience of small firms owned by black men to those owned by white men. Results reveal that black firm owners were more dependent on loans from non-bank sources than white owners. Black men were significantly more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been <b>turned</b> down for their most recent loan and were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be discouraged from applying for loans. Results also reveal that black men were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> down for trade credit.

Consistent growth and improvement is the key here, and looks <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> Miley Cyrus into a long-term pop star." [...] Lamb did, however, state that the ballads on The Time of Our Lives were throwaways. Heather Phares of Allmusic thought otherwise, saying that the EP's highlights came when Cyrus [...] "lets her inner rock chick and ballad-singing diva come to the fore." [...] Phares stated that [...] "If Breakout began to establish Miley Cyrus as a singing star in her own right, free of Hannah Montana baggage, then this Walmart Exclusive EP is another confident step in that direction." [...] Phares concluded that the EP was a good representation of Cyrus's vocal growth and presumed that her vocal abilities would enhance further as she grew into an adult. Mikeal Wood of Entertainment Weekly graded The Time of Lives a B+ because of its execution of various musical styles and genres.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} not without its detractors. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's {{a measure of how}} the film {{operates}} that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims.... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did, however, describe it as [...] "the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun". Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that [...] "Jaws is too gruesome for children, and <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the stomach of the impressionable at any age.... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written." [...] Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws [...] "is eminently worth seeing for its second half", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was [...] "often flawed by its busyness". William S. Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as [...] "a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons" [...] and [...] "filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort"; Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a [...] "scare machine that works with computer-like precision.... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy". The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that [...] "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up", and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, [...] "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide stated that [...] "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster." ...|$|E

He jealously guarded his own opinions on controversial issues and remained enigmatic, provoking powerful exchanges of views. [...] Former students of Shepherd have stated that he was a [...] "challenging, provocative and inspiring teacher". He was renowned for his single-minded dedication to the scientific method and his incisive analytical skills, and hostility to vague speculation.

2500|$|There is a {{trend to}} believe in pseudoscience more than {{scientific}} evidence. Some people believe the prevalence of pseudoscientific beliefs is due to widespread [...] "scientific illiteracy". Individuals lacking scientific literacy {{are more susceptible to}} wishful thinking, since they are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to immediate gratification powered by System 1, our default operating system which requires little to no effort. This system encourages one to accept the conclusions they believe, and reject the ones they don't. Further analysis of complex pseudoscientific phenomena require System 2, which follows rules, compares objects along multiple dimensions, and weighs options. These two systems have several other differences which are further discussed in the dual-process theory. The scientific and secular systems of morality and meaning are generally unsatisfying to most people. Humans are, by nature, a forward-minded species pursuing greater avenues of happiness and satisfaction, but we are all too frequently willing to grasp at unrealistic promises of a better life.|$|E

This paper introduces to the liquidity constraint literature the ratio of a household's debt payments to its disposable personal income, the debt service ratio (DSR). We find that a household with a high DSR is significantly more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> down for credit than other households. Also, the consumption growth of likely constrained households, identified using the DSR along with the liquid-asset-to-income ratio, is significantly more sensitive to past income than that of other households, confirming the DSR's value in identifying constrained households.
