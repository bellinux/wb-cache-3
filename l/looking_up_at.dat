5|$|The second {{piece of}} art is Jonathan Borofsky's Humanity in Motion. Located in the glass atrium of the winter garden, Humanity in Motion shows ten life-size human figures walking across ten {{horizontal}} poles positioned {{at different levels of}} the atrium. At ground level, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the stainless steel figures, are two more figures shaped to look like a father and son.|$|E
5|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called PlanetX, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which {{appeared}} in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident. The idea originated from claims of channeling alien beings and is widely ridiculed. Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the night sky.|$|E
5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his head as it floats over them).|$|E
6000|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him; it was {{the very}} spot on which a couple of hours before she had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her mother. [...] "You're free--you're free." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{distances}} {{mentioned above}} are horizontal distance. There is also vertical distance that communicates something between people. In this case, however, vertical distance is often understood {{to convey the}} degree of dominance or sub-ordinance in a relationship. <b>Looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> or down on another person can be taken literally in many cases, with the higher person asserting greater status.|$|E
25|$|In Paris {{there is}} a full length marble statue by Pierre Julien, now in the Louvre, that was {{commissioned}} in 1781 and exhibited at the 1785 Salon. The writer is represented in an ample cloak, sitting in contemplation on a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes is climbing. On his knee is the manuscript of the fable of the fox and the grapes, while at his feet a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. Small scale porcelain models were made of this by the Sèvres pottery and in polychrome porcelain by the Frankenthal pottery. In the following century small models were made of the bronze statue by Etienne Marin Melingue, exhibited in Paris in 1840 and in London in 1881. In this the poet is leaning thoughtfully against a rock, hat in hand. Also in the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre is the 1857 standing stone statue by Jean-Louis Jaley.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s {{through the}} 1960s as {{abstract}} painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Post painterly abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Minimal art, shaped canvas painting, and Lyrical Abstraction. Other artists reacted {{as a response}} to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the Bay Area Figurative Movement in the 1950s and new forms of expressionism from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, Giorgio Morandi was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced Realism and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like Milton Avery, John D. Graham, Fairfield Porter, Edward Hopper, Andrew Wyeth, Balthus, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud, Leon Kossoff, Philip Pearlstein, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Grace Hartigan, Robert De Niro, Sr., Elaine de Kooning and others. Along with Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, and other 20th-century masters. The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's painting, Christina's World, currently in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. This tempera work, done in a realist style, is nearly always on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.|$|E

500|$|Two guides deserted Reed and McCutchen {{with some}} of their horses, but they pressed on farther up the valley to Yuba Bottoms, walking the last mile on foot. Reed and McCutchen stood <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Emigrant Gap, only [...] from the top, blocked by snow, {{possibly}} {{on the same day}} that the Breens attempted to lead one last effort to crest the pass from the east. Despondent, they turned back to Sutter's Fort.|$|E
500|$|Laura Claridge said, [...] "The American {{ideal that}} the {{painting}} is meant to encapsulate shines forth brilliantly {{for those who have}} canonized this work as among Rockwell's great pictures. For those who find the piece less successful, however, Rockwell's desire to give concrete form to an ideal produces a strained result. To such critics the people <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the speaker have stars in their eyes, their posture conveying celebrity worship, not a room full of respectful dissent." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 20, 2009, {{the crew}} of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.

500|$|During the Liverpool Biennial in 2004, Ono {{flooded the}} city with two images on banners, bags, stickers, postcards, flyers, posters and badges: one of a woman's naked breast, the other of the same model's vulva. (During her stay in Lennon's city of birth, {{she said she was}} [...] "astounded" [...] by the city's renaissance.) The piece, titled My Mummy Was Beautiful, was {{dedicated}} to Lennon's mother, Julia, who had died when he was a teenager. According to Ono, the work was meant to be innocent, not shocking; she was attempting to replicate the experience of a baby <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> its mother's body, those parts of the mother's body being a child's introduction to humanity.|$|E
500|$|Madonna trained herself {{physically}} with aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from [...] "True Blue", [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita". The stage was huge, with four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Leonard became the music director and encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of rearranging her older songs and presenting them in a new format. Madonna named the tour 'Who's That Girl', after <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a gigantic image of herself projected on a screen on the stage during rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|Posin {{stated that}} one {{theme of the}} film is that [...] "the adults in this world tend to be {{immature}} or childish and the kids tend to be very mature and adult and sophisticated for their age". He shot the teenage characters slightly below eye level to create the impression of <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> an adult, and shot the adults slightly above eye level as if the viewer were looking down at a child. He said that hypocrisy was [...] "at the top of the list" [...] of the themes he wanted to explore in the story. While all of the adults in the film are attempting to live perfect lives, they cannot see that their children are driven to suicide, antidepressant addiction and kidnapping [...] for instance, Terri is so obsessed with her upcoming wedding that she does not realize her son is missing.|$|E

500|$|After {{their return}} to Indianapolis, Augustus' health worsens. He is taken to the ICU and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time {{together}} for anything, since he [...] "gave me a forever within the numbered days." [...] Augustus dies eight days later and Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. He tells her that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral {{to make up for}} the spoiled trip. Van Houten tells her that the novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. He gives Hazel a piece of paper which she crumples up asking him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads his words accepting his death and about his love for her. She lies on her back on her lawn <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says: [...] "Okay." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Who's That Girl", [...] "Causing a Commotion," [...] and [...] "The Look of Love" [...] on her 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour. It was {{her second}} concert tour and supported her third studio album, True Blue (1986), {{as well as}} the soundtrack. It was Madonna's first world tour, reaching Asia, North America and Europe. Musically and technically superior to her previous Virgin Tour, the Who's That Girl tour incorporated multimedia components to make the show more appealing. Madonna trained herself physically with aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to cope with the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from [...] "True Blue", [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita".

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{religious}} or spiritual views, Seeger replied: [...] "I feel most spiritual when I’m out in the woods. I feel part of nature.

2500|$|Typical of Brewster's portraits is [...] "Francis O. Watts with Bird" [...] (1805), showing [...] "an {{innocent}} looking {{boy with}} manly features" [...] wearing a nightslip {{and holding a}} bird on his finger and with a string. The surrounding landscape is [...] "strangely low and wildly out of scale—the young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains. He looks like a giant," [...] Genocchio has written. Or he {{looks as if the}} viewer must be lying down, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the child from the ground. Brewster always struggled with the relationship of his figures to the background.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{penultimate}} episode, Drake asks Hunt if {{he killed}} Sam Tyler, with Hunt explaining that Tyler had been acting [...] "weird" [...] {{and asked for}} Hunt's help in faking his own death. However, the vision that Drake has of the police officer with injuries {{to the side of}} his face is connected to Tyler's presumed death, and a roll of undeveloped film apparently reveals where the policeman is supposedly buried. Along with this, Shaz, Ray and Chris all have visions of stars, as if <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky, and hear strange voices as described by Chris as Nelson (Tony Marshall), the publican from Life on Mars, asking him what he would like to drink.|$|E
