5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower <b>lip,</b> while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper <b>lip</b> under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower <b>lip</b> by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E

In 2003, the entire back-catalogue (except Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper <b>Lip)</b> was remastered and re-released. Ballbreaker was eventually re-released in October 2005; Stiff Upper <b>Lip</b> was later re-released in April 2007. Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} comprises {{at least}} two known subspecies; one is the nominate subspecies Laevistrombus canarium canarium, {{and the other is}} Laevistrombus canarium guidoi. L.canarium guidoi distinguishes itself from the other subspecies by its solid white colour, the outline of the posterior canal and a more prominent posteriorly protruding outer <b>lip.</b> The presence of a freely protruding <b>lip</b> at the posterior portion of the columella is also a distinctive character.|$|E
30|$|To {{apply this}} method, an {{automatic}} round <b>lips</b> detector {{is necessary to}} select round <b>lips</b> from the image sequence which contains all kinds of <b>lips</b> shapes. A similar method with closed <b>lips</b> filter in the above section is applied to detect round <b>lips.</b> Firstly, a round <b>lips</b> DCT template is trained from several round <b>lips</b> images. DCT coefficients are calculated from <b>lips</b> ROI. Secondly, this template scans through all the images, and {{the distance between the}} current image and template is computed. <b>Lips</b> are considered as round <b>lips</b> if its distance is less than a threshold which is determined experimentally. The performance of the automatic round <b>lips</b> detector is evaluated on 3184 <b>lips</b> images (10 repetitions of the first speaker). Only 42 round <b>lips</b> are mistaken among 467 round <b>lips</b> images (about 9 % error rate).|$|R

30|$|For {{correcting}} the A parameter, a periodical spline interpolation is proposed based on six CLNF inner <b>lips</b> landmarks for round <b>lips</b> (like [o] and [y]).

5|$|The <b>lip</b> {{position}} and pressure, shaping of the vocal tract, choice of reed and mouthpiece, amount of air pressure created, and evenness of the airflow account {{for most of}} the clarinetist's ability to control the tone of a clarinet. A highly skilled clarinetist will provide the ideal <b>lip</b> and air pressure for each frequency (note) being produced. They will have an embouchure which places an even pressure across the reed by carefully controlling their <b>lip</b> muscles. The airflow will also be carefully controlled by using the strong stomach muscles (as opposed to the weaker and erratic chest muscles) and they will use the diaphragm to oppose the stomach muscles to achieve a tone softer than a forte rather than weakening the stomach muscle tension to lower air pressure. Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with the tone being produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen conch}} is herbivorous {{and lives in}} {{seagrass}} beds, although its exact habitat varies by development stage. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy shell, with knob-like spines on the shoulder, a flared thick, outer <b>lip</b> and a characteristic pink-coloured aperture (opening). The flared <b>lip</b> is absent in younger specimens. The external anatomy of the soft parts of L.gigas {{is similar to that}} of other snails in its family; it has a long snout, two eyestalks with well-developed eyes, additional sensory tentacles, a strong foot and a corneous, sickle-shaped operculum.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{characterized}} by its very small peridia (dimensions 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth x 2–4mm tall) with a color that may range from white to grey to pale buff, but never yellow – helping distinguish it from C. laeve. The peridia are , thin-walled (150–180µm at the <b>lip,</b> approximately 300µm thick {{at the edge of}} the <b>lip),</b> tomentose on the outer side and smooth on the inner side, and taper to a narrow base. The peridioles range in width between 0.5–1.25mm broad. Basidiospores have dimensions of 4–5 by 7–8µm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{automatic}} <b>lips</b> {{detection and}} tracking {{system based on}} watershed segmentation and H approach is presented. For some of the <b>lips</b> detection systems, skin/non-skin detection is a prerequisite step to localise the face region and the <b>lips</b> region is then detected from the face region. In this paper, a direct <b>lips</b> detection technique using watershed segmentation without needing preliminary face localisation is proposed. The watershed algorithm segments the input image into regions. Consequently, the cubic spline interpolant <b>lips</b> colour modelling and symmetry detection are used to detect the <b>lips</b> region from the segmented regions. The position of the segmented <b>lips</b> is passed to the H tracking system to predict {{the location of the}} <b>lips</b> in the succeeding video frame. The simulation results have revealed a good performance of the proposed method.

5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of women aged 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose and ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The eyebrow, <b>lip</b> and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were more common than nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, <b>lip</b> and genitals.|$|E

30|$|Several {{approaches}} to extracting <b>lips</b> contour in audiovisual speech processing {{have been investigated}} in the literature. One {{of the most widely}} used techniques is model-based <b>lips</b> detection. Active Shape Model (ASM) [3] and Active Appearance Model (AAM) [4] were proposed to segment <b>lips</b> contour. The shape and appearance of <b>lips</b> are learned from training data with manually annotated faces, and <b>lips</b> configurations are described by a set of model parameters. Bandyopadhyay [5] investigated a <b>lips</b> feature extraction technique combined with ASM and used the contrast between the <b>lips</b> and face to segment <b>lips</b> contour. In the early time, for model-based techniques, a large training set and good initial condition are necessary even if it may not be efficient. Stillitano et al. [6] used both active contours and parametric models for <b>lips</b> contour extraction. This method needs prior knowledge of <b>lips</b> shape. Another technique is based on segmentation in color spaces [7, 8]. Color-based clustering assumes that there are only two classes, i.e., skin and <b>lips,</b> and this technique may not be efficient if facial hair or teeth exist. Currently, deep learning is very popular in the feature extraction field. Hlavac presented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for <b>lips</b> landmark detection in [9], which achieves a sub-pixel accuracy in landmark detection, but some errors remain since no robust features around the chin can be locked.|$|R
