The flame was then passed to Piero Gros, then Deborah Compagnoni before the Olympic Flame was lit by former Italian cross-country skier Stefania Belmondo. Belmondo paused to show the torch to the cheering crowd one last time before placing it on the arched <b>lighting</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The flame initiated a series of fireworks before lighting the top of the 57-meter high Olympic Flame, the highest {{in the history of the}} Olympic Winter Games.|$|E

2500|$|The {{light was}} built in 1887 by the colonial {{government}} of Spain {{to serve as a}} 3rd order lighthouse.

50|$|On September 20, 1870, the <b>light</b> <b>apparatus</b> of the {{lighthouse}} {{was replaced with}} a new fixed red light with a shorter visibility because of its color, but easily distinguishable from the other lights of the city than the former white.

50|$|The lighthouse, also {{commonly}} known as Kap Sing Lighthouse, was put into service on 29 April 1912; {{it is one of}} the five surviving pre-war lighthouses in Hong Kong. It is a skeletal steel tower of 11.8 metres high with a white lantern on top. The steel tower and <b>light</b> <b>apparatus</b> were obtained from England. The lighthouse, unmanned and automated, is now under the management of Marine Department.|$|R
25|$|James Balfour, at {{the time}} marine {{engineer}} to the Otago Provincial Council and later to the Colonial Government of New Zealand, was commissioned during 1863 to design the lighthouse.

2500|$|The tower {{designed}} by Balfour was [...] tall. It had {{a diameter of}} [...] at its base, and [...] below the balcony. The lantern was placed at a height of [...] Two dwellings, also {{designed by}} Balfour, were constructed for the lighthouse keepers and their families. The total cost came to £10,480-12s-8d, which was significantly {{more than the average}} cost of between [...] £4,000 and £6,000 at the time. The <b>light</b> <b>apparatus</b> was specifically designed for the remoteness of the location. Instead of the usual central burner system with one lamp, sixteen lamps were used arranged in four, each with their own mirror behind it. The lamps were mounted on a frame with a square base that completed a revolution powered by a massive clockwork every two minutes, thus achieving a beam every 30 seconds. The reason behind the arrangement was redundancy; even if one of the lamps failed, the other three pointing in the same direction would still produce a, albeit somewhat weaker, beam. The light mechanism was also reasonably simple to repair should the need arise. It was the first revolving <b>light</b> <b>apparatus</b> in New Zealand.|$|R
60|$|Another mode of holophotally {{producing}} the intermittent light {{has been suggested}} by my father, and is shown in Fig. 5. It consists of alternate and opposite sectors of dioptric spherical mirror, MM, and of Fresnel's fixed <b>light</b> <b>apparatus,</b> AA. By the revolution of this composite frame about the burner, the same immediate alternation of light and darkness is produced, the first when {{the front of the}} fixed panel, and the second when the back of the mirror, is presented to the eye of the sailor.|$|R

50|$|Cape Martin Lighthouse is a {{lighthouse}} located on Cape Martin near Beachport {{at the north}} end of Rivoli Bay in South Australia. It was first lit in 1960. It replaced the Penguin Island Lighthouse whose <b>light</b> <b>apparatus</b> was reused in the new tower. The lighthouse was converted to mains power electricity in 1974. The original tower had a height of 4.5 m. However, the gradual build up of sand dunes obscured the light. This problem was rectified in 1980 when the tower was raised to a height of 12 m.|$|R
50|$|Foulis {{founded the}} province's first iron foundry in 1825 {{and a school}} of arts in 1838.

It was while he was walking home on a foggy night and his daughter was playing her piano. He couldn't hear any of the notes except for very low ones. He thought that could fix all the problems that were causing ships to crash in the fog.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{high-performance}} face recognition terminal for access control systems is described.

To determine design {{of an image}} input device, we evaluate similarity values and their changes for three types of <b>lighting</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> Our basic experiment indicates {{that a combination of}} the upper-right lamp and the lower lanip accomplishes the best performance. Though an experiment using 100 individuals, we explain that the face recognition terminal achieves a competitive performance compared with other biometrics devices and offers better user-interfaces such as contact-less verification and remote monitoring. ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{they were}} {{unsuccessful}} in destroying the tower, nevertheless, the damaged inflicted was substantial, necessitating a complete rebuild {{of the tower}} immediately following the war. During this subsequent rebuild, the tower was heightened to its present focal plane of 82 ft above sea level, and the original <b>lighting</b> <b>apparatus</b> was restored.|$|E
50|$|The current {{tower is}} unpainted, and built of the rich-coloured local sandstone. The {{original}} <b>lighting</b> <b>apparatus</b> was a fixed red dioptric of 700 candlepower with 4 oil wick burners.

25|$|By 1821 Hick was {{managing}} partner of the Union Foundry, that later became Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell. After Peter Rothwell's death on 2 August 1824, the company continued with Peter Rothwell Jr (1792–1849) as Rothwell, Hick & Co. They made stationary steam engines, (a number of which were featured by John Farey in the second volume of his Treatise on the Steam Engine, 1827) as well as general engineering products including cast iron dockyard cranes. Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell were listed in Baines' directory as supplying steam engines, hydraulic presses, weighing machines, gas <b>light</b> <b>apparatus,</b> mill machinery, sugar mills and constructors of fire proof buildings.|$|R
50|$|After the wrecks of the Emma Prescott in 1867 and the {{schooner}} Orson in 1884, {{a lighthouse}} was commissioned to be constructed on Table Cape to aide navigation into {{the port of}} Wynyard on the Inglis River. Table Cape Lighthouse was designed by Huckson and Hutchinson of Hobart, the <b>light</b> <b>apparatus</b> was sourced from the Chance Brothers of England and was constructed by a local builder, John Luck. The project suffered from delays due to poor quality roads {{leading up to the}} construction site on Table Cape, and bricks of insufficient quality sourced from the specially-constructed kiln in the nearby town of Burnie, instead, bricks had to be imported interstate from Victoria.|$|R
