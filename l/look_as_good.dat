5|$|Jimsy Augustine, a young college student, goes to Bhavana Studio. She tells Mahesh {{that she}} wants to {{participate}} in Vanitha cover competition and asks him to make her <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as possible. Perplexed at the unusual request, Mahesh conducts the photo shoot. Jimsy's photograph turns out to be dull and unimpressive, and her irritation makes Mahesh question his skill as a photographer. Upset, he turns to his father for advice. Vincent explains photography as an art to his son. Mahesh goes through his father's photograph collection, finally understanding their angles and lighting, and gets an idea.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} criticised for its {{technical}} issues. Carter called its climbing animations stiff, noting that some gameplay bugs would hinder player progress. According to Wallace, the game's load times were too long. Leack {{noted that the}} game had a graphic downgrade, and the actual game did not <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as the 2013 demonstration. Senior, Phipps and Ingenito noted frame rate issues; although Ingenito thought it did not impact the gameplay, Phipps called it a persistent problem which overshadowed many of the game's achievements.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. VanOrd was not impressed, {{stating that}} the environments do not <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> viewed from a top-down perspective, but he praised the art style {{and some of the}} game's [...] "eye-catching" [...] landmarks. Tan liked that the environments were varied and unique, saying that each level felt [...] "vast" [...] and filled with details. Villoria found its visual quality lacking when compared with that of Mass Effect 2, adding that the facial animation can feel wooden at times. However, he found the combat animation rewarding and satisfying. He further criticized the sex sequences as [...] "off-putting". Yin-Poole said that the game's graphics were boring and generic, and called the sex scenes [...] "anti-climatic" [...] and poorly-executed. Both Villoria and Yin-Poole felt that the six-year development time was too long, considering the game's mediocre graphics.|$|E

500|$|There was {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} producer's {{decision}} to avoid depicting the two battles between the Starks and Lannisters. Ryan criticized it and confessed being [...] "a little disappointed that many of the major characters are caught up in a war and we're not seeing it." [...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd get a few epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, but I also respect the demands of time and budget here. Those kinds of sequences cost a fortune, and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that we spent in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as it did, than for the episode to have given us one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{directed}} by Wim Wenders, produced by Debbie Mason, and edited by Jerry Chater. The video was filmed in Berlin {{over the course of}} three days, primarily in black-and-white but with some sequences in colour. It contains cameos of some of the actors who appeared in Faraway, So Close!, including Otto Sander, as well as Wenders' nephew. Several scenes are taken directly from Faraway, So Close! and Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, which also served as the principal inspiration for the video's premise. Wenders noted that [...] "making a video is really a very different ballgame. You have the script, so to speak, because you have the song, and everything you do is in order to help the song shine... You want to make that song <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as possible and sound as good as possible and as interesting as possible." [...] Several shots depict the band members standing on the statue of Victoria, a monument {{at the top of the}} Berlin Victory Column; a model of the angel was created for those scenes. Leftover military equipment from the Cold War, including the Soviet MiG, were included in the background.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "I felt {{occasionally}} that Owen's rumpled performance {{is in danger}} of becoming a little one-note ... but this is still an unexpectedly well–made thriller with brainpower as well as firepower". Philip French, in his review for The Observer, called the film a [...] "slick, fast-moving conspiracy thriller" [...] and the gunfight in the Guggenheim [...] "spectacular". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn wrote, [...] "It's reasonably efficient, passably entertaining, and strenuously playing catch-up with the Bourne movies: flat-footed Owen doesn't <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as Matt Damon sprinting through city streets, and the editing doesn't match Paul Greengrass's whiplash pace". The New Yorker magazine's David Denby wrote, [...] "And there's a big hole {{in the middle of the}} movie: the director, Tom Tykwer, and the screenwriter, Eric Warren Singer, forgot to make their two crusaders human beings". In his review for The New York Post, Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "There, an anticlimactic rooftop chase reminds us that Tykwer, the German director who reinvented the Euro thriller with Run, Lola, Run a decade ago, has been far surpassed by Paul Greengrass and the Bourne adventures, yet thankfully lacking the rampant and nonsensical roller-coaster style of editing, where no shot lingers for longer than a nano-second.". A.O. Scott, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "The International, in contrast, is so undistinguished that the moments you remember best are those that you wish another, more original director had tackled". Citing the climatic shoot-out in the Guggenheim, hailed by other critics as spectacular, Scott wonders if another, such as Brian de Palma could have [...] "turned into a fugue of architectural paranoia"? ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Juan Castro {{scored the}} game 8.5 out of 10. He too praised the graphics, writing [...] "EA did a {{magnificent}} job {{of bringing the}} grandeur of Middle-earth into The Third Age." [...] However, he was critical of the difficulty, claiming [...] "from the moment they brandish a weapon in-game, RPG veterans will most likely tell that EA {{went to great lengths}} to make The Third Age as accessible as possible." [...] He also criticized the story, writing [...] "gamers will be hard pressed to find an ounce of character development throughout the entire adventure," [...] and calling the characters [...] "soulless archetypes." [...] However, he concluded [...] "For the most part, The Third Age rips gamers from their living rooms and dumps them in a detailed rendition of Middle-earth. EA Redwood Shores has faithfully recreated everything from the glowing majesty of Rivendell to the murky depths of Helm's Deep. Suffice to say, this is one of the best looking games based on Tolkien's classic trilogy. But, as gamers everywhere know, looks aren't everything. It's one thing to have video games <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as the movies they're based on, but what good is any of it if the actual gameplay isn't enough to keep you playing. Thankfully, this combat heavy RPG delivers the goods, although some die hard RPG fans may be put off by its overly streamlined approach." ...|$|E

This has been another mantra of conservation but is now being questioned.|$|E
50|$|Vond-Åsmund Rygnestad or Åsmund {{the angry}} (or evil), is {{a legend in}} the history of Setesdal. He built and lived at the farm Rygnestadstunet.

He was a real Viking and a chief in Setesdal.

5000|$|Praise for the [...] "darkly comic caper", as Keith Watson {{described}} it for Metro, centred around both the moody, heavily stylised visual {{feel of the}} overall production and the contrasting comic chemistry between its two leads. [...] "The mismatched buddy dynamic between the pair - nerdy, neurotic everyman and chubby gung-ho sidekick - was reminiscent of the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost Britcoms or a Coen Brothers flick," [...] wrote Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph. Ellen Jones from The Independent said: [...] "Thanks to slick direction and, one suspects, {{a large chunk of}} the BBCs autumn budget, it certainly <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> a Hollywood thriller." ...|$|R
