50|$|She is {{a former}} chair of the Salt Lake City's East Central Community Council and {{also served as a}} member of the Human Rights Commission of Salt Lake City. Johnson is a lesbian and served as one of three openly LGBT members of the Utah legislature, {{alongside}} Senator Scott McCoy and Rep. Jackie Biskupski. She {{is a former}} board member of Equality Utah and her campaigns have won the support of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund. and Emily's List. Representative Johnson served as an advocate for the environment, LGBT equality, women's reproductive rights and election transparency. She served on the House Judiciary, Economic Development, Revenue and Taxation and Speaker appointed Tax Review Commission. During the 2010 legislative session, she negotiated a highly controversial <b>legislative</b> <b>moratorium</b> on anti-gay bills with then Senate President Michael Whaddoups.|$|E
40|$|The {{approval}} of the Code of Public Contracts, in implementation of the European Directives, has changed the traditional approach of the Italian legislator to the regulation of public contracts. However the public contracts sector is still unstable from a legislative perspective {{and the application of}} the rules is characterised by uncertainty and variations. All this has negative repercussions on the activities of the contracting authorities, the undertakings and, more generally, legal operators. The author calls for a <b>legislative</b> <b>moratorium</b> in order to stabilise and complete the regulatory framework...|$|E
40|$|Oil and gas leasing {{has been}} {{prohibited}} {{on most of}} the outer continental shelf (OCS) since the 1980 s. Congress has enacted OCS leasing moratoria for each of fiscal years 1982 - 2006 in the annual Interior Appropriations bill, allowing leasing only in the Gulf of Mexico (except near Florida) and parts of Alaska. President George H. W. Bush in 1990 issued a Presidential Directive ordering the Department of the Interior not to conduct offshore leasing or preleasing activity in areas covered by the annual <b>legislative</b> <b>moratoria</b> until 2000. In 1998 President Clinton extended the offshore leasing prohibition until 2012. This report provides background on the issues and examines the current status of relevant legislation...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} sand as {{aggregate}} for concrete {{for the construction}} industry and as sediment for artificial beach replenishment at tourist destinations on Oahu has increased following a <b>legislative</b> <b>moratorium</b> on the mining of beach sand. Concern for future shortfalls of sand supply prompted prospecting for offshore deposits. Sand channels extend offshore from major valleys and coastal embayments on Oahu. Most of these accumulations join sinuous deposits of sediment ponded on ancient terraces that parallel the coastline. Sand cores were collected from these mapped deposits. Statistical analysis of particle size distributions of 279 samples from these cores reveals local areas that are promising for future exploitation. In some areas, variations of grain size {{can be related to}} water depth and distance from shore, but in most areas, grain sizes are not simply related to the geographic distribution of sampled sand. Along the leeward Oahu coast, size distributions are related to depth in core : 5 ft of fine sand covers medium and coarse sand. Comparisons between samples from different locales reveals relationships primarily to submarine geomorphology and secondarily to coastal wave climate...|$|E
40|$|In Eldred v. Reno the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit {{held that}} the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), which extends the {{copyright}} term for present and future works for twenty years, was a constitutional exercise of Congress 2 Ì† 7 s copyright power. The CTEA thus puts an end (at least for two decades) to a policy in effect {{for more than two}} centuries, since the Copyright Act of 1790, that the copyright of a work expires {{at the end of a}} stated term defined at the time the copyright was granted. Since works were copyrighted annually, the policy meant that each year a certain number of copyrighted works entered the public domain, as the copyright terms ended seriatim. The mandate of the CTEA is that no copyrighted work in the United States will go into the public domain before year 2018. The Eldred case thus constitutes judicial approval of the <b>legislative</b> <b>moratorium</b> of the constitutional mandate that copyright protect the public domain, a policy in partial fulfillment of the fact that copyright, as the U. S. Supreme Court has repeatedly stated, is primarily to benefit the public, only secondarily to benefit the author (as copyright holder). Arguably, the CTEA serves the interest of no one except that of publishers (and other copyright holders) and their heirs...|$|E
