The experimental design consisted of T 1, TAA control; T 2 and T 3, 0. 75 % and 1. 5 % protein reduction by 3 % and 6 % DORB incorporation, respectively by replacing soybean meal with supplemental <b>limiting</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> to meet TAA requirement; T 4, SIDAA control, T 5 and T 6, 0. 75 % and 1. 5 % protein reduction by DORB incorporation (3 % and 6 %) with supplemental <b>limiting</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> on SIDAA basis. A total of 360 d-old fast growing broiler chicks (Vencobb- 400) were divided into 36 homogenous groups of ten chicks each, and six dietary treatments described were allocated randomly with six replications. During 42 days trial, the feed intake was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced by TAA factor compared to SIDAA factor and protein factor significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced the feed intake at 1. 5 % reduction compared to normal protein group. This was observed only during pre-starter phase but not thereafter. The cumulative body weight gain (BWG) was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced in TAA formulations with protein step-down of 1. 5 % (T 3, 1, 993 g) compared to control (T 1, 2, 067 g), while under SIDAA formulations, BWG was not affected with protein reduction of 1. 5 % (T 6, 2, 076 g) compared to T 4 (2, 129 g). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced in both TAA and SIDAA formulations with 1. 5 % protein step-down (T 3, 1. 741; T 6, 1. 704) compared to respective controls (T 1, 1. 696; T 4, 1. 663). The SIDAA formulation revealed significantly (p< 0. 05) higher BWG (2, 095 g) and better FCR (1. 684) compared to TAA formulation (2, 028 g; 1. 721). Intake of crude protein and all <b>limiting</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (SID basis) was higher in SIDAA group than TAA group with resultant higher nitrogen retention (4. 438 vs 4. 027 g/bird/d). The nitrogen excretion was minimized with 1. 5 % protein reduction (1. 608 g/bird) compared to normal protein group (1. 794 g/bird). The serum uric acid concentration was significantly reduced in T 3 (9. 45 mg/dL) as compared to T 4 (10. 75 mg/dL). All carcass parameters were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in SIDAA formulation over TAA formulation and 1. 5 % protein reduction significantly reduced carcass, breast and thigh yields. In conclusion, the dietary protein can be reduced by 0. 75 % with TAA formulation and 1. 5 % with SIDAA formulation through DORB incorporation and supplementation of <b>limiting</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and among formulations, SIDAA formulation was better than TAA formulation...|$|R

Calves received decreasing amounts of supplemental energy in the form of volatile fatty acids and dextrose as amino acid infusion increased in order for treatments to remain isoenergetic. Nitrogen balance increased as amino acid supply increased, indicating that amino acids other than methionine limited protein deposition.

At a fixed growth rate, corresponding to a generation of time of 84 min, and with the pH maintained constant at 7. 4, the bacterial turbidity was made dependent on the concentration of one of the amino acids of the defined medium. Under these conditions, the extracellular concentration of the <b>limiting</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> is fixed by the preset growth rate. The steady-state concentration of each of 14 essential l-amino acids was measured by means of C 14 -labeled amino acids in such limited cultures.

The results of two experiments showed that methionine and arginine were the first and second most <b>limiting</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively, in YSCP for chick growth and feed efficiency. On a calculated basis, YSCP seemed to be deficient in leucine, but leucine supplementation of YSCP diets did not improve chick performance. Weight gain and feed efficiency of chicks fed YSCP diets supplemented with <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> were inferior to those of chicks fed diets in which soy protein was used. When feed intake was equalized by pair-feeding the soy protein diet with the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> supplemented-YSCP diet, chick performance was similar irrespective of protein source. Also, the use of a granular form of YSCP in diets improved chick performance as compared with the use of YSCP in powder form.
