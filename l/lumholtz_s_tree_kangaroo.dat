40|$|The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Matschie 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (Dendrolagus matschiei) {{population}} is {{at a critical}} point for assessing long-term viability; they have endured a founder effect and have low mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity. The mean kinship (MK) strategy is used to preserve their genetic diversity by minimizing the overall kinship of the population; however, the MK strategy has not been evaluated in an AZA population. Wild D. matschiei is listed as endangered and genetically unique populations may warrant management as separate conservation units. My objectives were to: (i) develop molecular markers to facilitate genetic analyses, (ii) assist AZA and wild D. matschiei management decisions, and (iii) further resolve Dendrolagus molecular systematics. To achieve my objectives I analyzed DNA extracted from AZA, captive held, and wild D. matschiei, and three additional Dendrolagus taxa using microsatellite markers and two mtDNA genes. AZA D. matschiei have similar nuclear DNA genetic diversity as captive and wild D. matschiei from Papua New Guinea, and the MK strategy has maintained their genetic diversity as well as predicted by theoretical expectations. AZA D. matschiei {{should continue to be}} managed by their studbook analyses and the MK strategy. Wild D. matschiei showed evidence of phylogeographic structure, but should be managed as one conservation unit. Preliminary genetic evidence suggests D. matschiei and Lowland <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (Dendrolagus spadix) are sister taxa, and supports the reclassification of Golden-mantled <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (D. goodfellowi pulcherrimus) and Ifola (D. dorianus notatus) as species. An improved understanding of Dendrolagus genetics will contribute substantially to their conservation. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> (Marsupialia: Macropodidae, Dendrolagus) {{are some}} of Australasia's least known mammals. Basic {{questions}} concerning the population and conservation status of many species remain unanswered. However, there is sufficient anecdotal evidence of population decline and local extinctions to designate <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> as New Guinea's most endangered mammal group. <b>Tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> home ranges were sampled at one site in Papua New Guinea (Wasaunon). Radio telemetry analyses were used to estimate home range sizes, which were estimated to be 81. 8 ± 28. 8 ha for males and 80. 8 ± 20. 3 ha for female Huon <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> (Dendrolagus matschiei). Food plants species for Huon <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> (D. matschiei), were collected at Wasaunon {{with the aid of}} landowners, and later identified by botanists in Papua New Guinea and Australia. The collections support Australian data that <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> are browsers, with the largest proportion of their diet coming from leaves and shoots {{from a wide variety of}} plants from at least 18 families for the Huon <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos,</b> and at least 40 families from a previous study conducted in the same region (Dendawang) approximately 35 km southeast of Wasaunon. Landowners from different areas of the region were in agreement that <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> prefer eating leaves and stems of plants, with fruits and flowers comprising a relatively minor proportion of the animals' diets. Additional information on <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> biology and conservation status was obtained through the use of informal landowner interviews. Interviews did not produce quantifiable results, but they did give some insights into <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> food plant species and human utilisation. The responses indicated that over 70 species of food plants were being utilized by the Huon <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos,</b> D. matschiei, at Wasaunon, and an additional 91 species from Dendawang...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> (Macropodidae, Dendrolagus) {{are some}} of Australasia's least known mammals. However, there is {{sufficient}} evidence of population decline and local extinctions that all New Guinea <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> are considered threatened. Understanding spatial requirements is important in conservation and management. Expectations from studies of Australian <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> and other rainforest macropodids suggest that <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> should have small discrete home ranges {{with the potential for}} high population densities, but there are no published estimates of spatial requirements of any New Guinea <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> species. Home ranges of 15 Huon <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos,</b> Dendrolagus matschiei, were measured in upper montane forest on the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea. The home range area was an average of 139. 6 ± 26. 5 ha (100 % MCP; n = 15) or 81. 8 ± 28. 3 ha (90 % harmonic mean; n = 15), and did not differ between males and females. Home ranges of D. matschiei were 40 – 100 times larger than those of Australian <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> or other rainforest macropods, possibly due to the impact of hunting reducing density, or low productivity of their high altitude habitat. Huon <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> had cores of activity within their range at 45 % (20. 9 ± 4. 1 ha) and 70 % (36. 6 ± 7. 5 ha) harmonic mean isopleths, with little overlap (4. 8 ± 2. 9 %; n = 15 pairs) between neighbouring females at the 45 % isopleth, but, unlike the Australian species, extensive overlap between females (20. 8 ± 5. 5 %; n = 15 pairs) at the complete range (90 % harmonic mean). Males overlapped each other and females {{to a greater extent than}} did pairs of females. From core areas and overlap, the density of female D. matschiei was one per 19. 4 ha. Understanding the cause of this low density is crucial in gaining greater understanding of variations in density of <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> across the landscape. We consider the potential role of habitat fragmentation, productivity and hunting pressure in limiting <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> density in New Guinea rainforests...|$|R

40|$|The National Zoological Park has {{maintained}} a breeding colony of Matschie's tree kan-garoos (Dendrolagus matschiei) since 1975 with a documented history and continued prevalence of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections.

TKSSP's annual breeding recommendations to preserve genetic diversity are based on mean kinship strategy (in order to retain adaptive potential and avoid inbreeding's disadvantages).
