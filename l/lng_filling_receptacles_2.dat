40|$|Following {{a general}} {{description}} {{and analysis of}} the fundamental criteria for the dynamic design concerning dynamic stiffness, strength and environment issues, it is considered that the natural characteristics of the dynamic system and the dynamic responses of the system subject to various dynamic loads are two key critical issues in the dynamic design. Therefore, for the dynamic design of a <b>LNG</b> tank <b>filled</b> with liquid and operated on seaway, it is necessary to accurately predict its natural characteristics and dynamic response considering fluid structure interactions. To address these two key issues in the dynamic design stage, the developed computer software based on a mixed displacement–pressure finite element model to complete fluid-structure interaction analysis is introduced. An integrated internal liquid-tank-external water interaction system investigated by numerical simulations is summarised to consider the two issues involving the dynamic design of LNG tanks. The five studied cases include: i) 50 % <b>filled</b> <b>LNG</b> liquid in a fixed rigid tank, ii) elastic tank only, iii) 50 % <b>filled</b> <b>LNG</b> liquid-elastic tank interaction, iv) empty elastic tank-external sea water interaction and v) internally 50 % <b>filled</b> <b>LNG</b> liquid-elastic tank-external sea water interaction. The calculated results are compared to reveal the coupling effects on the dynamic design of LNG tanks. To further demonstrate the effects of the natural characteristics affected by different interactions on the dynamic responses involving the dynamic strength, stiffness and vibration environment problems considered in dynamic design, the numerical simulations of the studied systems subject to regular sea wave excitations and earthquake excitations are carried out. The dynamic displacements for stiffness analysis, the dynamic stress for strength analysis and vibration level for dynamic environment analysis are presented and discussed. Guidelines provided in this paper maybe useful for dynamic designs of LNG tank operating in complex marine environments. <br/...|$|R

All four new traps used a large collecting receptacle containing detergent-laced water, and three presented a prominent visual silhouette above the <b>receptacle.</b> <b>2</b> In total, 27 336 large woodborers were captured from 10 June to 30 September in an experiment in the southern interior of British Columbia, and 4737 from 6 June to 27 July in an experiment in northern Alberta. The woodborers captured in the British Columbia experiment were mainly beetles in the families Cerambycidae (79 %) and Buprestidae (15 %), and woodwasps in the family Siricidae (6 %). Most woodborers, e. g. three Monochamus spp. and Xylotrechus longitarsus (the predominant cerambycids), were captured throughout the summer, with peak captures in August. 3 Cross-vane, pipe and stacked-bottomless-¯ower-pot traps were generally superior to pan and multiple-funnel traps for insects in nine taxa, but cross-vane traps were the most effective overall, trapping 32 % of all insects captured. 4 The large number of target insects captured in {{a relatively small number}} of traps in the two experiments suggests that employment of an ef®cacious trap with a large vertical silhouette and a wide, escape-proof collecting receptacle could make mass trapping of large woodborers in timber processing areas operationally feasible. 5 Because the most effective traps were unstable in the wind, and the detergent-laced water captured unacceptably high numbers of small mammals, design mod-i®cations are necessary.

In particular, road freight transport contributes to approximately 7 % of global energy-related emissions (Mattila and Antikainen, 2010). To reduce this impact, low-carbon technologies are being developed. In this thesis we focus on the dual-fuel truck. This new product has the potential to contribute to GHG emissions reduction in the freight {{transport sector}}. Even though this product is technically available and economically feasible it is facing difficulties to diffuse in the European market. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the main barriers, and suggest solutions, to the successful introduction and diffusion of dual-fuel trucks on the European market. In order to address this question we use the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework. Our analysis reveals that the TIS is facing five mechanisms blocking the development of the system. These main barriers include the lack of European standards and regulations for the dual-fuel trucks and the <b>LNG</b> <b>filling</b> stations; the lack of customers‘ experience and familiarity with a dual-fuel truck; the current small market size of LNG for vehicles which is not attractive for oil/gas companies; the ―chicken and egg‖ dilemma regarding the launching of trucks and the construction of filling stations; and, the concerns about the fossil origin of LNG which might affect customer‘s acceptance of the dual-fuel truck. Using the results of our analysis we develop strategy recommendations for Volvo Truck. These solutions could help weaken/remove the five blocking mechanisms and speed up the diffusion of the dual-fuel truck in the European market. First, in order to accelerate the creation of standards and regulations Volvo Truck could join existing groups working at the EU level. Second, in order to alleviate the lack of experience and familiarity with the dual-fuel truck Volvo should prioritize demonstration programs and adopt a clear communication strategy. Third, in order to stimulate the LNG demand from the transport sector Volvo Truck should support the use of this fuel in other transport modes. Fourth, in order to solve the ―chicken and egg‖ dilemma Volvo could establish formal and informal networks with key actors at the national level. Finally, Volvo should adopt a PR and marketing strategy considering the country-specific environmental concerns about the fossil origin of LNG...|$|R

Petals free or united with each other. Ovary free, or adnate to the calyx. ” What has generally been regarded as the lower portion of the gamosepalous calyx, and is described as such in many recent systematic works, is in reality the hollow upper portion of the receptacle. In this work the term receptacular-cup (receptacular-tube) has been adopted, a term which indicates {{the true nature of}} the organ. The foregoing description may, therefore, be modified to read: “Receptacle broadened into a flat or more or less concave or even tubular calyx-like structure, bearing on its margin the sepals, petals. and stamens, which are free or seldom more or less united; ovaries free, united with each other, or even imbedded in the hollow <b>receptacle.</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 Bentham and Hooker modified the Candollean Calyciflorae, taking out the families constituting the sub-orders Celastrales and Sapindales, and making of these and the orders Geraniales and Olacales, the series Disciflorae. Hooker gives the reason for so doing in his edition of LeMaout and Decaisne, p. 993 : 2 ̆ 2 The great obstacle to the recognition of the thalamifloral and calycifloral series lies in the fact that (putting aside the many cases of hypogynous orders containing perigynous genera) there are many orders of which it is difficult to say to which they belong. Thus Brongniart regards as hypogynous Anacardiaceae, Connaraceae, Burseraceae, and Celastraceae, all of which are regarded as perigynous by DeCandolle; and as perigynous, Caryophylleae, Elatineae, and Olacineae, which DeCandolle and Lindley regard as hypogynous. To reduce this difficulty, Mr. Bentham and I, observing that a highly developed staminiferous disk prevailed in the orders that intervened between the manifestly perigynous and hypogynous orders, collected them into a division of Polypetalae called series Disciflorae. In doing this we did not look on the disk as a proof of affinity, but as a guide to that amount of affinity which certainly exists between the orders included under that series. 2 ̆ 2 The difficulty seems to have been remedied very little, however. Whatever relationship there may be between the Geraniales and Celastrales, there is a much nearer one between the former and the Caryophyllales. Linaceae among the Geraniales is in the closest relationship to Caryophyllaceae, from which it differs mainly in the position of the ovules. The affinities of the Celastrales are nearly all among the calycifloral families. Rhamnaceae and Celastraceae are nearly related to groups of plants now generally included in Saxifragaceae, but formerly placed in either of those families. The systematic position of the Umbellales has been very uncertain. While their close relationship to the Rubiales among the Gamopetalae has been recognized, indeed, strongly emphasized, their affinities among the other calycifloral orders have been very uncertain. The isostemonous flowers, the few, united, 1 - 2 -ovuled carpels, the copious albumen, and the generally thick, fleshy disk at the margin of which the stamens are fastened are all characters common to the Umbellales and the Celastrales. The difference between the two is rather of degree than of kind. In the Celastrales, the ovary is generally superior, in the Umbellales, inferior, i. e., sunken into the receptacle. But, in some genera of Rhamnaceae and Celastraceae, the ovary is partly sunken in the receptacle, scarcely less so than in some representatives of Araliaceae, as for instance, Hedera helix. If the fleshy disk that gave the name to the Disciflorae is used as the characteristic feature of the series,the Umbellales should be included in Disciflorae, and the Geraniales excluded, as the disk, if present, is of a different character. If, however, it is to take in the families on the border line between the Thalamiflorae and the Calyciflorae, then such families should be included as Crassulaceae and Saxifragaceae proper, in which the calycifloral character is generally obsolete. This is also the case in many genera in most families of the Rosales. It is, therefore, best to leave Calyciflorae as originally constituted...|$|R

The full understanding of the physical phenomena and the accurate evaluation of the local loads in sloshing-induced slamming events occurring in completely, partially or barely filling conditions, is a challenge of the research field. Violent free-surface motions in a sloshing tank generally occur when the energy spectrum of the ship motion is focused in the frequency region close to the lowest sloshing mode of the tank. Slamming events may occur originating impulsive and large local loads that undermine the integrity of the structure. Depending on the local flow features before the impact, several and complex scenarios can characterize the physical evolutions of a wave impact in a sloshing flow. For example, when the impact angle between water and body is small, air entrapment may occur making important the compressibility of the air and its interaction with the free surface. In contrast, for an incipient breaking wave approaching a vertical wall, flip-through event may happen causing localized and large loads without any air-entrapment or flat-impact may occur. In all these cases, when the typical temporal duration of the local load is comparable with the lowest natural period of the structure, hydroelasticity matters affecting the integrity of the structure.

The compressibility of the second phase is especially important for more violent flow conditions, when two-phase phenomena such as air entrapment and air entrainment occur frequently Particular attention in the numerical method {{has been paid to the}} treatment of the flow variables around the interface, especially the density. The fluid is convected by means of a first- or second-order upwind scheme. The behaviour of the sloshing fluid strongly depends upon the regularity of the tank motion and the filling ratio of the tank. Video frames, wave probes and pressure transducers have been used to compare the fluid flow of simulation and experiment. Two-phase effects such as air entrapment are more common for increasing tank filling ratios and for more irregular tank motion. A realistic simulation of these effects is possible by modeling two-phase flow, especially when using a relatively fine grid and applying the less-dissipative second-order upwind scheme. Compared to the earlier paper on the numerical simulation of sloshing in LNG tanks [8], where the numerical method was validated for regular sway motion, more extensive attention is paid to the accuracy of the applied discretisation schemes in space and time. The results of different schemes are now evaluated for both regular and irregular sway and roll motion of LNG tanks...|$|R

About 46. 9 % of the individuals (75 of 160 crabs) had mutilated or regenerating appendages, more frequent in males (56. 8 %) than in females (28. 2 %), which may reflect both inter- and intraspecific agonistic interactions. A continuous reproductive pattern is suggested for this population, although ovigerous females occurred unevenly during the year, with 58. 82 % of them being collected in winter. There was evidence of multiple spawning, since the ovigerous females with an initial egg mass showed mature ovaries as well as seminal <b>receptacles</b> <b>filled</b> with sperm. C. hellerii is well established in the estuary-bay complex, but is concentrated in intertidal and shallow subtidal rocky shores, where it may compete with and replace other species such as the portunid Cronius ruber. This study also highlights the importance of systematic monitoring studies to evaluate the effects of the introduction of non-indigenous species on ecologically similar natives.

40|$|With {{the trend}} towards {{offshore}} LNG production and offloading, sloshing of <b>LNG</b> in partially <b>filled</b> tanks {{has become an}} important research subject for the offshore industry. LNG sloshing may induce impact pressures on the containment system and may affect the motions of the LNG carrier. So far, LNG sloshing has been studied mainly using model experiments with an oscillation tank. However, the development of Navier-Stokes solvers with a detailed handling of the free surface allows the numerical simulation of sloshing. It should be investigated, however, how accurate {{the results of this}} type of simulations are for this complex flow problem. The paper first presents the details of the numerical model, an improved Volume Of Fluid (iVOF) method. The program has been developed initially to study the sloshing of liquid fuel in satellites. Later, the numerical model has been used for calculations of green water loading and the analysis of anti-roll tanks, including the coupling with ship motions. Recently, the model has been extended to incorporate two-phase flow. This extension improves its ability to simulate the effect of gas bubbles of different sizes. Gas bubbles are present in virtually all relevant offshore situations; not only at LNG sloshing but also during green water events, bow slamming and water entry. In a two-phase flow model, both the liquid and the gas phase can have their own continuity and momentum equations. The handling of the compressibility of the gas phase is a major issue in the design of a two-phase flow model. However, as a first step in the modeling process, the gas phase is considered as incompressible. For a dambreak experiment, results of the one-phase model, the incompressible two-phase model and model experiment results have been compared. It is shown that the physics are more accurately simulated with the incompressible two-phase model. Furthermore, the paper will show results of the incompressible model for LNG sloshing. The physics of LNG sloshing and several other applications can be approached better by taking the compressibility into account. Therefore, as a second step, a compressible model is currently under construction, involving adiabatic compression of the gas phase. ...|$|R
40|$|The role of auxin in {{ripening}} strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa) fruits {{has been}} {{restricted to the}} early stages of development where the growth of the receptacle is dependent on the delivery of auxin from the achenes. At later stages, during enlargement of the receptacle, other hormones have been demonstrated to participate to different degrees, from the general involvement of gibberellins and abscisic acid to the more specific of ethylene. Here we report the involvement of auxin at the late stages of receptacle ripening. The auxin content of the receptacle remains constant during ripening. Analysis of the transcriptome of ripening strawberry fruit revealed the changing expression pattern of the genes of auxin synthesis, perception, signaling and transport along with achene and receptacle development from the green to red stage. Specific members of the corresponding gene families show active transcription in the ripe receptacle. For the synthesis of auxin, two genes encoding tryptophan aminotransferases, FaTAA 1 and FaTAR 2, were expressed in the red <b>receptacle,</b> with FaTAR <b>2</b> expression peaking at this stage. Transient silencing of this gene in ripening receptacle was accompanied by a diminished responsiveness to auxin. The auxin activity in the ripening receptacle is supported by the DR 5 -directed expression of a GUS reporter gene in the ripening receptacle of DR 5 -GUS transgenic strawberry plants. Clustering by co-expression of members of the FaAux/IAA and FaARF families identified five members whose transcriptional activity was increased with the onset of receptacle ripening. Among these, FaAux/IAA 11 and FaARF 6 a appeared, by their expression level and fold-change, as the most likely candidates for their involvement in the auxin activity in the ripening receptacle. The association of the corresponding ARF 6 gene in Arabidopsis to cell elongation constitutes a suggestive hypothesis for FaARF 6 a involvement in the same cellular process in the growing and ripening receptacle...|$|R
