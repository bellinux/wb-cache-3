5|$|Further inland, another serious {{attack was}} made on the British <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> from Ramleh by units of both the Ottoman 16th Division on the plain and the 19th Division in the hills. The aim of this counterattack was the {{destruction}} of two British Empire divisions in the hills by cutting their <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amman was an {{important}} city on the Ottoman <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> All of the supplies and reinforcements for the Ottoman army force defending the line on {{the eastern edge of}} the Jordan Valley had passed through it. Now the city was on the main line of retreat.|$|E
5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by the Japanese to sever the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided {{to land the}} rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the investigation, <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> were set up between the Navy and the Air Force. The Air Force knew nothing of Operation Market Time and did not {{routinely}} communicate with Naval Forces, Vietnam. To avoid a repetition of the incident, aircraft patrolling near the DMZ were instructed not to attack vessels without first contacting CSC Da Nang for clearance.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, the Prussians did not {{retreat to}} the east, along their own <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> Instead, they, too, fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within {{supporting}} distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on Bülow's IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of Wavre.|$|E
5|$|German {{reaction}} to the second airborne landings involved mortar barrages and small arms fire, but casualties were negligible. Generalmajor Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division watched the gliders descending and, believing the arriving force would threaten his <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> ordered those elements of the division that had reached the beaches to withdraw {{to the north of}} Caen. The gliders' arrival had inadvertently stopped the only German armoured attack on D-Day.|$|E

5|$|In the English Civil War the {{majority}} of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London {{was surrounded by a}} defensive perimeter wall known as the <b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication.</b> The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.|$|E
5|$|More than 40 {{hours after}} the {{fighting}} began, the EEF XXI Corps had forced the Ottoman Eighth Army from the coastal Plain of Sharon, and the Desert Mounted Corps had cut the Ottoman Seventh and remnants of the Eighth Armies main <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and retreat at Jenin on the Esdrealon Plain.|$|E
5|$|Ominously, PAVN and the Pathet Lao did not {{withdraw}} to North Vietnam {{during the rainy}} season. Previously during the conflict, air mobility by STOL aircraft into the Lima Sites had provided the Hmong with an advantage over the road-bound PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. This advantage was {{now going to be}} overcome by road improvement and the prepositioning of supplies which allowed the communists to maintain year-round use of their <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

5|$|Samakh was {{regarded}} by both Allenby, the British {{commander of the}} Egyptian Expeditionary Force, and the German General Otto Liman von Sanders, commander of the Yildirim Army Group, as a key strategic point. The town controlled the most direct road to Damascus on the Ottoman <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and the Palestine Railways which ran across a series of bridges across the Jordan River from Deraa.|$|E
5|$|The Anzac Mounted Division's <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> {{were now}} fully extended, and the {{difficulties}} of supplying the mounted troops from Romani {{made it impossible for}} the British Empire mounted force to consider any further advance at that time. Arrangements were made to hold and garrison the country decisively won by this series of indecisive engagements, from Katia eastwards to Bir El Abd.|$|E
5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} {{found themselves in}} a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Program, which {{represents}} the most significant contribution that the 18th Engineer Brigade had made to the economic growth of Vietnam, consisted of about 1,500 kilometers of road upgrade from 1967 to 1972. After a slow start {{in the beginning of}} this work, the Brigade finished some 560 kilometers of highway reconstruction, and improvement in 1970 and another 450 kilometers were scheduled for completion in 1971 by Brigade units.|$|E
5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west. The 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment were {{driven out of}} Shilta, but infantry from the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{in the process of}} being relieved, returned to the front, closed the gap, and pushed the Ottoman soldiers back out of the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles Eaton {{was born}} on 21December 1895 in Lambeth, London, the son of William Walpole Eaton, a butcher, and his wife Grace.

Attached to a bicycle company in the 24th Battalion of the 47th Division, he arrived at the Western Front in March 1915. He took part in trench bombing missions and attacks on enemy <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> seeing action in the Battles of Aubers Ridge, Festubert, Loos, and the Somme.|$|E

5|$|During {{the week}} {{beginning}} 27 November the Ottoman Army launched {{a series of}} infantry attacks employing shock tactics {{in the hope of}} breaking the British lines during the period of destabilisation created by troop reinforcements and withdrawals. Counterattacks were launched by the Ottoman 16th and 19th Divisions in the Judean Hills on Nebi Samweil and on the Zeitun plateau. Attacks were also launched against British <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> via a gap between the British forces on the maritime plain and those in the Judean Hills and also against several British units spread out on the maritime plain.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Berlin, No.467 Squadron {{began to}} {{concentrate}} on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> prior to {{the invasion of the}} continent. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of No.5 Group RAF in an assault on Toulouse, striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The bombing was highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no losses on the raid.|$|E
5|$|From 1972 through 1974, {{the war was}} {{conducted}} along FANK's lines of communications {{north and south of}} the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the Mekong River and Route 5, the Republic's overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.|$|E
