25|$|The Parable of the Prodigal Son {{is also a}} {{recurring}} theme {{in the works of}} Rainer Maria Rilke, who interpreted the parable in a different way to the conventional reading. His version of the parable was not so concerned with redemption and the forgiveness of family; the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In loving the family less, the Son can love God more, even if this <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> returned.|$|E
25|$|In her {{dressing}} room, Raoul implores Christine to reconsider {{her decision to}} sing and asks her to leave with him at once if she still loves him. When Raoul leaves her alone to think, the Phantom enters and tells Christine that Raoul knows his <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough, and that she must sing for him once more. When he departs, Christine recalls the fateful night at the Paris Opera House {{when she had to}} make the difficult decision between the respectable and comfortable life offered by Raoul and the passionate rush of the Phantom and his music ("Before the Performance").|$|E
25|$|That Susan was Kane's {{wife and}} Marion was Hearst's {{mistress}} {{is a difference}} more important than might be guessed in today's changed climate of opinion. The wife was a puppet and a prisoner; the mistress was never less than a princess. Hearst built more than one castle, and Marion was the hostess in all of them: they were pleasure domes indeed, and the Beautiful People of the day fought for invitations. Xanadu was a lonely fortress, and Susan was quite right to escape from it. The mistress was never one of Hearst's possessions: he was always her suitor, {{and she was the}} precious treasure of his heart for more than 30 years, until his last breath of life. Theirs is truly a love story. <b>Love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the subject of Citizen Kane.|$|E

25|$|Akira is Yukina's cousin. He {{is one of}} the {{few people}} who know Yukina's pen name Yupina; he comes across as quiet boy and holds a love for Yukina since back to when the two of them were kids and his parents died, so she {{protected}} him in many occasions and promised to stay together with him forever. Akira confesses his love to Yukina and wants to be more than just cousins, and can't stand the sight of Shigure around her. Frequently, Yukina comes to Akira for advice. Akira, through a trial date, was chosen by Yukina to be her boyfriend but because Yukina was still confused with her feelings he felt that her <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> that love of a lover but a love like of family so he broke up with her. He is now going out with Mami.|$|E
500|$|Other music {{critics have}} {{compared}} the song to Romeo and Juliet, with society opposing a relationship based on socioeconomic status, or {{called it a}} look into society's view of romantic relationships. Ellie D. Hernández wrote in her book about Chicano culture that [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] addresses [...] "social and cultural desire that transcends the boundaries of romantic love". According to Hernández, the song's central theme is class- and race-based social division [...] "that divides [...] from her beloved" [...] and [...] "suggests [...] hegemonic crisis informing Selena's lamentations." [...] Hernández wrote that the lyrics spoke about modern societal views on romantic relationships, and one must [...] "live in accordance" [...] with those views or face [...] "emotional banishment from [...] family and culture ... Risking everything for this <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> at all an innocent choice but a decision abundant with agency and consciousness that begins {{as a consequence of}} the forbidden." ...|$|E
500|$|Rilke {{uses the}} images of love and of lovers {{as a way of}} showing mankind's {{potential}} and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels. [...] In the Second Elegy, Rilke writes that [...] "Lovers, if they knew how, might utter / wondrous things in the midnight air." [...] (Liebende könnten, verstünden sie's, in der Nachtluft / wunderlich reden.) He depicts [...] "the inadequacy of ordinary lovers" [...] and contrasts a feminine form of [...] "sublime love" [...] and a masculine [...] "blind animal passion." [...] At the time the first elegies were written, Rilke often [...] "expressed a longing for human companionship and affection, and then, often immediately afterwards, asking whether he could really respond to such companionship if it were offered to him..." [...] He notices a [...] "decline in the lives of lovers... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving." [...] Later, during World War I, he would lament that [...] "the world has fallen into the hands of men." [...] In the face of death, life and <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> cheap and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unity—that [...] "the nature of every ultimate love... is only able to reach the loved one in the infinite." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} the actual figures upon the urn, {{the image of the}} lovers depicts the {{relationship}} of passion and beauty with art. In [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode on Melancholy", Keats describes how beauty is temporary. However, the figures of the urn are able to always enjoy their beauty and passion because of their artistic permanence. The urn's description as a bride invokes a possibility of consummation, which is symbolic of the urn's need for an audience. Charles Patterson, in a 1954 essay, explains that [...] "It is erroneous to assume that here Keats is merely disparaging the bride of flesh wed to man and glorifying the bride of marble wed to quietness. He could have achieved that simple effect more deftly with some other image than the richly ambivalent unravished bride, which conveys... a hint of disparagement: It is natural for brides to be possessed physically... it is unnatural for them not to be." [...] John Jones, in his 1969 analysis, emphasises this sexual dimension within the poem by comparing the relationship between [...] "the Eve Adam dreamed of and who was there when he woke up" [...] and the [...] "bridal urn" [...] of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". Helen Vendler expands on the idea, in her 1983 analysis of Keats's odes, when she claimed [...] "the complex mind writing the Urn connects stillness and quietness to ravishment and a bride". In the second stanza, Keats [...] "voices the generating motive of the poem – the necessary self-exhaustion and self-perpetuation of sexual appetite." [...] To Vendler, desire and longing could be the source of artistic creativity, but the urn contains two contradicting expressions of sexuality: a lover chasing after a beloved and a lover with his beloved. This contradiction reveals Keats's belief that such love in general was unattainable and that [...] "The true opponent to the urn-experience of <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> satisfaction but extinction." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his {{introduction}} to Pangborn's posthumous story collection Still I Persist In Wondering, Spider Robinson observed: [...] " [...] said {{again and again in}} his books that <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a condition or an event or even a state of mind—that love is a country, which we are sometimes privileged to visit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Deleuze and Guattari's {{concept of}} {{sexuality}} {{is not limited}} to the interaction of male and female gender roles, but instead posits a multiplicity of flows that a [...] "hundred thousand" [...] desiring-machines create within their connected universe; Deleuze and Guattari contrast this [...] "non-human, molecular sexuality" [...] to [...] "molar" [...] binary sexuality: [...] "making <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just becoming as one, or even two, but becoming as a hundred thousand," [...] they write, adding that [...] "we always make love with worlds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anspacher too, {{interprets the}} idea of time with a similar view stating that <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> time's fool. In other words, even Time, [...] "the most willful and {{absolute}} dictator in the world, cannot treat Love as he would treat his fool or his jester", and eventually [...] must succeed to Nature. As Murray Krieger notes, author of A Window to Criticism; Shakespeare's Sonnets and modern poetics, time's sickle represents an “ignoble reduction of time. A reduction that cannot be produced, no matter the tool nor the wistfulness.|$|E
2500|$|In Christine's {{dressing}} room, Gustave helps {{his mother}} {{get ready for}} the show. Raoul arrives and Christine asks Gustave to wait for his father backstage. Raoul begs Christine not to sing, and to leave New York with him if she really loves him. Christine asks for some time and Raoul leaves. The Phantom enters and tells Christine that Raoul's <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough. That she must sing for him and embrace her destiny ("Before The Performance"). Christine recalls the events at the Opera where she had to decide between Raoul and the Phantom. ("Twisted Every Way") ...|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{telling his}} disciples to be [...] "of one {{mind and heart}} on the way towards God" [...] Augustine of Hippo taught that [...] "Nothing conquers except truth and the victory of truth is love" [...] (Victoria veritatis est caritas), {{and the pursuit of}} truth through {{learning}} is key to the Augustinian ethos, balanced by the injunction to behave with love towards one another. It does not unduly single out the exceptional, especially favour the gifted, nor exclude the poor or marginalised. <b>Love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> earned through human merit, but received and given freely by God's free gift of grace, totally undeserved yet generously given. These same imperatives of affection and fairness have driven the order in its international missionary outreach. This balanced pursuit of love and learning has energised the various branches of the order into building communities founded on mutual affection and intellectual advancement. The Augustinian ideal is inclusive.|$|E
2500|$|The second quatrain argues {{against the}} {{hypothetical}} [...] "if" [...] that the speaker's [...] "dear love" [...] is the [...] "child of state". The speaker's love was created where it cannot be scathed by unpredictable events, an [...] "accident", the [...] "slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune" [...] (Hamlet Act III. Sc.i 3). The sonnet shifts to criticizing the transitory {{nature of the}} society in which the speaker and addressee exist. The <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> subject to, [...] "the whims of the powerful, the anger of tyrants, or the fads of mere fashion". In a historical context, in The Sonnets of Shakespeare, Raymond Alden suggests that, [...] "The time referred to is unmistakably that after the ascension of James; and the gunpowder plot is such a remarkable instance of a plot to strike a 'blow of thralled discontent'. This is also supported by Lee who concurs in his analysis in Shakespeare's Sonnets. A Reproduction in Facisimile of the First Edition (1609). With Introduction and Bibliography by Sidney Lee that the [...] "time" [...] being alluded to mirrors the political unrest that characterized {{the last decade of}} Queen Elizabeth's reign and the first decode of King James I's reign.|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 2009 Palin {{released}} a statement on her Facebook page in which she said, [...] "The America I know and <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have {{to stand in front}} of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care." [...] The Associated Press reported: [...] "Palin and other critics are wrong." [...] The provision of the health care bill to which Palin referred (on page 425) merely authorizes Medicare reimbursement for physicians who provide voluntary counseling about such subjects as living wills. Howard Dean, the former Chair of the Democratic National Committee, said that Palin [...] "just made that up. Just like the 'Bridge to Nowhere' that she supposedly didn't support." [...] Republicans were divided. Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich agreed with Palin, saying that [...] "there are clearly people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards." [...] Palin's [...] "death panels" [...] comment was selected as the [...] "Lie of the Year" [...] by PolitiFact.com, the fact-checking website of the St. Petersburg Times. Palin was also criticized for having invoked her infant for political purposes.|$|E
