During the compaction process, if the <b>loading</b> <b>pressure</b> is increasing straightly, the powder assembly will experience three stages. First of all, particles are filling the voids and set up contacts with the adjacent particles. This stage is termed rearrangement stage. After most contacts are set up, the initial compaction started. Elastic deformation and plastic deformation happens and the <b>loading</b> <b>pressure</b> increases sharply.

30|$|Sequences of {{experiments}} were done {{to study the}} influence of <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> on rock damage as shown in Table  6. A round piston was placed {{at the top of}} the PPGs inside the round tube and the PPGs were compacted by the piston with 300 psi as a <b>load</b> <b>pressure.</b> After the gel was compressed, the permeability of each core was determined at the flow rates of 0.5, 0.75, and 1  mL/min. These lower flow rates were used because the stabilized pressure around the sandstone core increased so much after the gel was compressed and the core was damaged further. To confirm the level to which the injection pressure influenced the damage to various cores, the <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> tests were needed. Table  6 displays the DQ gel effect on the core damage as well as the core permeability reduction. The core permeability was determined before and after the PPGs were compressed.

50|$|The active {{pressure}} sensor and the integrated sensor array {{based on the}} triboelectric effect have several advantages over conventional passive {{pressure sensor}}s. First, the active sensor is capable of both static pressure sensing using the open-circuit voltage and dynamic pressure sensing using the short-circuit current, while conventional sensors are usually incapable of dynamic sensing to provide the loading rate information. Second, the prompt response of both static and dynamic sensing enables the revealing of details about the <b>loading</b> <b>pressure.</b> Third, the detection limit of the TENG for dynamic sensing is as low as 2.1 Pa, owing to the high output of the TENG. Fourth, the active sensor array presented in this work has no power consumption and could even be combined with its energy harvesting functionality for self-powered pressure mapping. Future works in this field involve the miniaturization of the pixel size to achieve higher spatial resolution, and {{the integration of the}} TEAS matrix onto fully flexible substrate for shape-adaptive pressure imaging.|$|E

The shear stress increases with the <b>loading</b> <b>pressure</b> whereas the coefficient of friction shows a contrasting propensity. The shear stress and coefficient of friction increase with shear rate; and decrease with higher surface temperature.

The {{field test}} {{results show that}} {{existing}} double-pump confluence hydraulic system with constant displacement pump of wheel loader could only save some energy while the <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> is rather high(> 15 Mpa in the tests). However, the <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> is usually low, especially when the wheel Loader is working on bulldozing operation or just steering and running. Thus, an optimized double-pump confluence hydraulic system was designed by adding a proportional valve and adjust operation rule, so that the output oil of steering pump flow into tank by the proportional valve while the <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> is low and the relative position of joystick is not large(< 72 %), {{and in this way}} the throttle losses is reduced.

40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{experiments}} have been attempted to investigate the lubrication of aqueous copolymer lubricant, which is applied widely in metalworking operations, a comprehensive theoretical investigation at atomistic level is still lacking. This study addresses the influence of <b>loading</b> <b>pressure</b> and copolymer concentration on the structural properties and tribological performance of aqueous copolymer solution of poly(propylene oxide) -poly(ethylene oxide) -poly(propylene oxide) (PPO-PEO-PPO) at mixed lubrication using a molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. An effective interfacial potential, which has been derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, was employed for the interactions between the fluid 2 ̆ 7 s molecules and iron surface. The simulation results have indicated that the triblock copolymer is physisorption on iron surface. Under confinement by iron surfaces, the copolymer molecules form lamellar structure in aqueous solution and behave differently from its bulk state. The lubrication performance of aqueous copolymer lubricant increases with concentration, but the friction reduction is insignificant at high <b>loading</b> <b>pressure.</b> Additionally, the plastic deformation of asperity is dependent on both copolymer concentration and <b>loading</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the wear behavior shows a linear dependence of friction force {{on the number of}} transferred atoms between contacting asperities...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the seizure phenomena at welded interface during steel pipe friction welding. The relationship between friction speed and initial torque was clarified, {{and the relationship}} between relative speed and seizure temperature at the welded interface was estimated from the experimental results. The seizure phenomenon of the base metal was clarified by a constant temperature friction test in which he friction surfaces were rubbed together at various temperatures and <b>loaded</b> <b>pressures</b> in an electric furnace. Then, the seizure temperature at the friction surface was obtained by constant temperature friction tests. The experiments produced the following summarized results. (1) The friction torque curve had wear and seizure stages until the initial torque when pipes were welded at low friction speed. The wear stage time decreased with increasing friction speed. The initial torque decreased with increasing friction speed when pipes were welded at the same friction pressure, and increased with increasing friction pressure. (2) The seizure temperature at the welded interface was calculated by using the relationship between the torsional shear strength of base metal at its seizure temperature and the measured initial torque. The seizure temperature for a low relative speed at the welded interface was lower than that for a high relative speed. (3) The maximum friction torque increased with increasing friction temperature at the same <b>loaded</b> <b>pressure,</b> and they increased with increasing <b>loaded</b> <b>pressure</b> at the same friction surface temperature by constant temperature friction tests.

40|$|The {{effects of}} heavy case loads upon the {{operations}} of criminal courts in Illinois, {{as well as in}} almost every other state in the nation, {{have been the subject of}} much concern for over fifty years. Indeed, much of the existing empirically oriented, research on criminal courts attempts to outline the effects of case <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> upon various aspects of court operations'. Criminal court practitioners (judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and other courtroom personnel) are usually portrayed as overworked officials adapting to adverse conditions and doing the best they can to administer criminal justice fairly and efficiently. As pervasive as the notion of case <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> has been, however, the effects of variations in this pressure on {{the operations of}} criminal courts have not been examined rigorously and systematically Coupled with this situation are recent challenges to traditional views on criminal courts. Many contemporary criminal justice researchers question the relationship between case <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> and criminal court malfunctioning, as well as the utility of resolving criminal court problems by simply increasing court manpower. In their view, case loads provide a convenient explanation ??? a "nonreactive cause" ??? for. what takes place in criminal courts. That is, unlike judges or prosecutors, case loads cannot respond to accusations. Here, elements of this controversy are addressed. First, a brief overview of the historical development of the case load controversy is given, with particular emphasis upon Illinois and Cook County. Then, the results of a limited empirical examination of the effect of variations in case <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> upon the operations of Cook County felony trial courts are reported. These results show that variations in case loads have no impact upon some of the most important aspects of trial court operations.
