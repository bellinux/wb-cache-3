5|$|After Jack Bauer {{fails to}} obtain a {{confession}} from Logan, she screams in public {{that he is a}} murderer during Palmer's funeral. Afterwards, President Logan hits her, and threatens to put Martha in an asylum for life. During his tirade, Logan acknowledges all of his misdeeds, unaware that there is a small <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> on his pen. The confession quickly reaches the Attorney General, who orders the U.S. Marshals to arrest Logan. As Charles is escorted away by agents, he turns to stare at Martha, who smiles at him in triumph.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} prompts the ESU team into action. They plan {{to storm}} {{the bank and}} use rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and release the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props for faking the execution, but no money or valuables {{appear to have been}} stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case.|$|E
5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E

The FBI found no evidence that O'Brien's phone was bugged. However, it was determined that an effective <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> had been installed in Oliver's phone.|$|E
25|$|The kunai {{was a heavy}} pointed tool, {{possibly}} {{derived from}} the Japanese masonry trowel, which it closely resembles. Although it is often portrayed in popular culture as a weapon, the kunai was primarily used for gouging holes in walls. Knives and small saws (hamagari) were also used to create holes in buildings, where they served as a foothold or a passage of entry. A portable <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> (saoto hikigane) was used to eavesdrop on conversations and detect sounds.|$|E

While older vaults employed various weapons against burglars, such as blasts of steam or tear gas, modern vaults instead use technological countermeasures. They can be wired with a <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> that picks up unusual sounds, or observed with a camera. An alarm is often present to alert local police if the door or lock is tampered with.|$|E
25|$|Assistive {{listening}} devices include FM, infrared, and loop assistive listening devices. This type {{of technology}} allows people with hearing difficulties {{to focus on}} a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions, making places like auditoriums, classrooms, and meetings much easier to participate in. The assistive <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmission, IR (Infra Red) transmission, IL (Induction Loop) transmission, or other transmission methods. The person who is listening may use an FM/IR/IL Receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his/her preferred volume.|$|E
25|$|Meehan {{became the}} United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 17, 2001, {{six days after}} the September 11, 2001 attacks. He was {{appointed}} by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate. Meehan headed an office of over 200 lawyers and staff backed up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Office. As U.S. Attorney, Meehan made terrorism, gang-related crime, child internet safety, and public corruption priorities for his criminal division.

25|$|This {{was brought}} to {{national}} attention on October 7, 2003 when Philadelphia Police conducted a sweep of Mayor John F. Street’s office and found an electronic <b>listening</b> <b>device.</b> It was later discovered that the “bug” had been planted by the FBI {{as part of a}} city corruption investigation. Street was never charged in the investigation. Philadelphia officials and the mayor were outraged, especially with the timing coinciding with the Philadelphia mayoral election on November 4, 2003. Street’s campaign spokesman {{went so far as to}} accuse the federal government of attempting to influence the election (which Street ended up winning anyway). Meehan was applauded in the press and in the city for his handling of the situation, which resulted in twelve indictments including that of Street confidant Ronald White (who died before he could stand trial) and city treasurer Corey Kemp, who was convicted and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} World Trade Center bombing in February 1993, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began to {{investigate}} Abdel-Rahman {{and his followers}} more closely. An Egyptian informant wearing a <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> for the FBI managed to record Abdel-Rahman saying he preferred attacks be concentrated on US military targets, but also stating acts of violence against civilian targets were not illicit. The most startling plan, the government charged, was to set off five bombs in 10 minutes, blowing up the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and a federal building housing the FBI. Government prosecutors showed videotapes of the defendants mixing bomb ingredients in a garage before their arrest in 1993. Abdel-Rahman was arrested on 24 June 1993, along with nine of his followers. On 1 October 1995, {{he was convicted of}} seditious conspiracy, solicitation to murder Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, conspiracy to murder President Mubarak, solicitation to attack a U.S. military installation, and conspiracy to conduct bombings; in 1996 he was sentenced to life in solitary confinement without parole.|$|E

He commented that much like every song on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the song [...] "contains an underscore as ambitious as the beats upfront", concluding that tracks [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] and [...] "So Appalled" [...] alone [...] "carry enough auditory sugar to make listening to this album on any regular sort of <b>listening</b> <b>device</b> almost a fool's errand." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} seven amateur scuba divers solved the mystery in November 2006, when they found a small {{submarine}} sitting upright on the seabed, [...] below sea level and approximately [...] from Bungan Head, off Sydney's Northern Beaches. Commander Shane Moore, the officer responsible for the Royal Australian Navy's heritage collection, confirmed that the wreck was M-24 after viewing footage from multiple dives, along with measurements the group had taken. The wreck had several bullet holes in it, most likely from Chicagos quadruple machine-gun mount. The location of the wreck was kept secret by both the divers and the navy, with Defence Minister Brendan Nelson promising to have the wreck protected as a war grave. The wreck was gazetted on 1 December 2006 as a heritage site. A [...] exclusion zone was established around the wreck site, and any vessel entering the zone is {{liable to a fine}} under New South Wales law of up to A$1.1 million, with additional fines and confiscation of equipment under Commonwealth law.
