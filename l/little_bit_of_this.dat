[...] On [...] "Palace", ASAP Rocky demonstrates alliterative lyricism and [...] cadence and flow. His flow patterns have been compared by writers to those of Cleveland-based hip hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times writes that [...] "his reserved, steely delivery owes equal debts to Houston's syrup daze and Dipset's uptown intensity". He addresses his rapping style on [...] "Purple Swag": [...] "I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow". On [...] "Leaf", he addresses hip-hoppers' criticism of his style: [...] "They say I sound like André / mixed with Kanye / {{a little bit of}} Max / a little bit of Wiz / {{a little bit of that}} / a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> / get off my dick".|$|E
2500|$|Another type of {{stripped}} down and raw {{music with a}} variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma. It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> {{and a little bit of}} that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey." [...] East Texan Al Dexter had a hit with [...] "Honky Tonk Blues", and seven years later [...] "Pistol Packin' Mama". These [...] "honky tonk" [...] songs associated barrooms, were performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan, Floyd Tillman, and the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams, would later be called [...] "traditional" [...] country. Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll, such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, as well as Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones. Webb Pierce was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.|$|E

As groups of economists have the objective to get a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the action, a key strategy seems to be to label oneself differently, say X, so that all customers can be told that if they want the real thing then they need X. What to think of labels like "realistic economics", "heterodox economics" and the "post-autistic economics network" ? If you don't join, are you non-realistic, orthodox and autistic ? Economics is in danger of turning into a zoo. As the animals have taken over the zoo too, there is nothing to control them but common sense. Common sense can be taxed needlessly. The preferred strategy is to provide quality, and then add proper labels that advance understanding. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Consider {{the problem}} of {{estimating}} the entries of a large matrix, when the observed entries are noisy versions of a small ran-dom fraction of the original entries. This problem has received wide-spread attention in recent times, especially after the pioneering works of Emmanuel Candès and collaborators.

Surprisingly, <b>this</b> simple estimator achieves the minimax error rate up to a constant factor. The method is applied to solve problems related to low rank matrix estimation, blockmodels, distance matrix completion, latent space models, positive definite matrix completion, graphon esti-mation, and generalized Bradley–Terry models for pairwise comparison. 1...|$|R
