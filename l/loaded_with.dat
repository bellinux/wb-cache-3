One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight.

One was secretly <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E

The emphasis is on a comparison of acceleration course of <b>loads.</b> Two <b>loads</b> <b>with</b> entirely different shape-a <b>load</b> <b>with</b> a cuboid shape and one with a cylinder shape, were chosen. Improved mathematical theory for the start of an electric hoist with three degrees of freedom is used.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{requirement}} of renewable clean energy and low-carbon society, hydroelectric engineering has gained rapid development in China. To ensure the stable and reliable operation of hydropower stations, the effect of electric <b>loads</b> <b>with</b> different characteristic should be further analyzed. Based on the mathematical model of hydraulic system and mechanical system, the <b>load</b> models <b>with</b> different characteristic are introduced and the numerical analytical model with state equations is built. Then, the effect of load characteristic on operation stability is investigated in detail. For a built single-unit and single-pipe hydropower station running <b>with</b> static <b>load</b> or dynamic load, the obtained solution and dynamic curves is identical with that of experimental research. Moreover, the effect of load characteristic is further studied for different static <b>loads</b> <b>with</b> another given case. The results indicate that, electric <b>loads</b> <b>with</b> different characteristic obviously have different impact on operation stability, and regulation performance of unit running <b>with</b> dynamic <b>load</b> is superior to that of static <b>loads</b> <b>with</b> different characteristic...|$|R
