5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main reason was that the police was {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable reason was that the striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus <b>like</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not <b>like</b> <b>themselves</b> tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

People who do not <b>like</b> <b>themselves</b> tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

5|$|The {{intermittent}} Roman {{presence in}} Scotland {{coincided with the}} emergence of the Picts, a confederation of tribes who lived {{to the north of the}} Forth and Clyde from Roman times until the 10th century. They are often assumed to have been the descendants of the Caledonians though the evidence for this connection is circumstantial and the name by which the Picts called themselves is unknown. They are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on their monumental stones. The Gaels of Dalriada called the Picts Cruithne, and Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much <b>like</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|The narrator, Charles, {{lives with}} his friend Juste in a large boarding-house {{populated}} almost entirely with students <b>like</b> <b>themselves</b> (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn {{that he is a}} copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people <b>like</b> <b>themselves.</b> The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E

50|$|Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts {{investigated}} how {{the effect}} held up under {{threat to the}} self. Earlier research by Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis had already shown that the name-letter effect is influenced by threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts first made some participants write about a personal flaw and then gave all participants the number-preference task and the letter-preference task. What they found was consistent with previous findings: people who <b>liked</b> <b>themselves</b> a lot <b>liked</b> the numbers in their birthday and the letters of their name extra when under threat. This was predicted by the unconscious self-enhancement theory. It can't {{be explained by the}} mere exposure theory.|$|R

25|$|Naturally, in a polygynic {{society of}} swarm-founding {{individuals}} {{with so many}} queens, kin selection becomes a challenge. With so many queens, {{it is expected to}} have a lower relatedness between workers and the larvae for which they care.

25|$|Rome had an {{affinity}} {{for the people of}} Campania, who, <b>like</b> <b>themselves,</b> traced their backgrounds to the Etruscans. The Samnite Wars were instigated by the Samnites when Rome attempted to ally itself with the city of Capua in Campania. The Italic speakers in Latium had long ago been subdued and incorporated into the Roman state. They were responsible for changing Rome from a primarily Etruscan to a primarily Italic state.|$|E
25|$|Many {{midwives}} of {{the time}} bitterly opposed the involvement of men in childbirth. Some male practitioners also opposed the involvement of medical men <b>like</b> <b>themselves</b> in midwifery, and even {{went as far as}} to say that men-midwives only undertook midwifery solely for perverse erotic satisfaction. The accoucheurs argued that their involvement in midwifery was to improve the process of childbirth. These men also believed that obstetrics would forge ahead and continue to strengthen.|$|E
25|$|By 1919 or 1920, {{while still}} {{spending}} winters in Manhattan and summers on Cape Cod, the sisters came to consider Provincetown their formal place of residence.

Le Challeux and six others of the company decided to {{make their way to the}} coast in the hope of being rescued by the ships which had {{remained}} below in the river. They passed the night in a grove of trees in view of the sea, and the following morning, as they were struggling through a large swamp, they observed some men half hidden by the vegetation, whom they took to be a party of Spaniards come down to cut them off. But closer observation showed that they were naked, and terrified <b>like</b> <b>themselves,</b> and when they recognized their leader, Laudonnière, and others of their companions, they joined them. The entire company now consisted of twenty-six.|$|E

Julianna has Clive ditch his wife and meet her at their hotel. At the bar, Claire gives Phil the key to her room. While watching Claire walk way, Phil takes the wrong room key belonging to an older woman who was arranging her purse. He enters the wrong room, sprinkles rose petals on the bed, undresses, and waits on the bed with a bottle of champagne. The older woman then walks in after coming back from the bar. Back at the house, Phil and Claire decide to just act <b>like</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Many Irish nationalists sympathised {{with the}} Boers, viewing {{them to be}} a people oppressed by British imperialism, much <b>like</b> <b>themselves.</b> Irish miners already in the Transvaal {{at the start of}} the war formed the nucleus of two Irish commandos.
