Pearce was no exception, moving to HSV Channel 7 in Melbourne working as a newsreader and quiz show host. Pearce provided the first TV news report for that channel on 4 November 1956. The Argus reviewer F. Keith Manzie described Melbourne's first TV broadcast [...] "I liked Eric Pearce as a compere. His easy-mannered, genial personality came right through the viewing screen in the quiz show, I've Got a Secret ... reading of the news was illustrated with appropriate newsreel shots". In 1956 he was also co-host of the series Eric and Mary, and in 1957 he was host of Be My Guest. Pearce resigned from HSV-7 in the late 1950s. He believed that newsreaders required credibility and that doing anything other than news for a job was ill-advised. When GTV Channel 9 offered him employment as chief news reader without him having to do any other shows, he took it. In 1961, he appeared in <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Read</b> to You, {{in which he would}} read from popular works.|$|E

I was {{impressed}} {{to see that it}} explains Japanese culture clearly, and includes a variety of articles that would appeal to wide range of readers. I am quite inspired and grateful of your determination to introduce Japanese culture to many people and play a great role in the cultural exchange between our countries.|$|R

5000|$|According to Vikernes, the {{anonymous}} interview was planned {{by himself and}} Euronymous {{with the goal of}} spreading fear, promoting black metal and getting more customers for Helvete. Vikernes said of the interview: [...] "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we ... had a good laugh, because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg". He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, [...] "the journalist edited the interview and ... published an insane version of it the following day, without even <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>read</b> through it". Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence.|$|R

I believe," [...] the father said, with a pride that had its pathos, [...] "no one can talk with her and not feel that she has a beautiful mind, that she can think better than most girls of her age. She <b>reads,</b> or she <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>read</b> to her, and until it has time to fade, she appreciates it all more fully than I do. At Genoa, where I took her to the palaces for the pictures, I saw that she had kept her feeling for art. When she plays--you will hear her play--it is like composing the music for herself; she does not seem to remember the pieces, she seems to improvise them. You understand?" ...|$|R

[...] "Harry! you had better do that again," [...] he added warningly. [...] "Be off, out of this window, and <b>let</b> Ethel and <b>me</b> <b>read</b> in peace." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is so {{beautiful}} to be loved as Laurie loves me. He isn't sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he says and does, {{and it makes me}} so happy and so humble that I don't seem to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now, for he <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>read</b> his heart, and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it's mine. He says he feels as if he 'could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast'. I pray he may, and try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets us be together. Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world could be, when two people love and live for one another!" ...|$|R
500|$|Clarke {{arrived in}} Florida {{at the end}} of April. The short story, [...] "The Man Who Ploughed the Sea", {{included}} in the Tales from the White Hart (1957) collection, was influenced by his time in Florida. While in Key Largo in late May, Clarke met Marilyn Mayfield, and after a romance lasting less than three weeks, they travelled to Manhattan and married at New York City Hall. The couple spent their honeymoon in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where Clarke proofread Childhood's End. In July, Clarke returned to England with Mayfield, but it quickly became clear that the marriage would not last as Clarke {{spent most of his time}} reading and writing, and talking about his work. Further, Clarke wanted to be a father, and Marilyn, who had a son from a previous marriage, informed Clarke after their marriage that she could no longer have children. When Childhood's End was published the following month, it appeared with a dedication: [...] "To Marilyn, For <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>read</b> the proofs on our honeymoon." [...] The couple separated after a few months together, but remained married for the next decade.|$|R

6000|$|The other painter whom I {{would give}} you as an {{instance}} of this gentleness {{is a man of}} another nation, on the whole I suppose one of the most cruel civilized nations in the world--the Spaniards. They produced but one great painter, only one; but he among the very greatest of painters, Velasquez. You would not suppose, from looking at Velasquez' portraits generally, that he was an especially kind or good man; you perceive a peculiar sternness about them; for they were as true as steel, and the persons whom he had to paint being not generally kind or good people, they were stern in expression, and Velasquez gave the sternness; but he had precisely the same intense perception of truth, the same marvellous instinct for the rendering of all natural soul and all natural form that our Reynolds had. <b>Let</b> <b>me,</b> then, <b>read</b> you his character as it is given by Mr. Stirling, of Kier:-- ...|$|R
