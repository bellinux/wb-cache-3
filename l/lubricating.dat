40|$|AbstractThis paper {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} dynamic characteristics of a powder <b>lubricated</b> journal bearing. The stiffness and damping coefficients are obtained using finite perturbation method. The stability limit of the rotor speed is obtained for a system consisting of a single rotor disc {{in the middle of}} a flexible shaft having identical plain cylindrical journal bearings at the ends. The threshold speed of instability for a rotor supported on powder <b>lubricated</b> journal bearing is compared with that of oil <b>lubricated</b> journal bearing. The numerical results show that a rotor supported on powder <b>lubricated</b> journal bearings remains stable for a speed limit much higher than that for oil <b>lubricated</b> bearings...|$|R

5|$|The {{third most}} common use of lithium is in greases. Lithium {{hydroxide}} {{is a strong}} base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate. Lithium soap {{has the ability to}} thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature <b>lubricating</b> greases.|$|E

5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (rhenium, for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), emission control devices (palladium), and in self-cleaning ovens (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} <b>lubricating</b> greases, paint dryers, and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the ammonium ion form soluble soaps).|$|E
50|$|For {{a bearing}} to operate properly, {{it needs to}} be <b>lubricated.</b> In most cases the {{lubricant}} is based on elastohydrodynamic effect (by oil or grease) but working at extreme temperatures dry <b>lubricated</b> bearings are also available.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{molecular}} dynamics simulation of three dimensional rough surface contact under different <b>lubricated</b> conditions was carried out. At atomic scale, mixed lubrication involves nano-asperity contact where the load is supported not only by asperities but also by a sufficient amount of confined lubricant. The contact area and pressure distribution of various <b>lubricated</b> conditions, e. g. dry, partially <b>lubricated</b> and fully <b>lubricated,</b> were presented. It {{has been found that}} cavities were formed between upper and lower surfaces under the load, and confined lubricant molecules were able to fill the cavity and support the load, resulting in the decrease of contact area and thus the protection of surface topography...|$|R

5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's <b>lubricating</b> fluids.|$|E
5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used polymorph. It is a good {{lubricant}} at both low and high temperatures (up to 900°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The <b>lubricating</b> properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its <b>lubricating</b> qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
50|$|Nonoxynol-9 {{was once}} {{believed}} to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV) but {{recent studies have}} shown that, with frequent use, nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission. The World Health Organization says that spermicidally <b>lubricated</b> condoms should no longer be promoted. However, it recommends using a nonoxynol-9 <b>lubricated</b> condom over no condom at all. As of 2005, nine condom manufacturers have stopped manufacturing condoms with nonoxynol-9 and Planned Parenthood has discontinued the distribution of condoms so <b>lubricated.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several Internet Typex {{articles}} {{say that}} only Vaseline {{was used to}} <b>lubricate</b> Typex machines and that no other lubricant was used. Vaseline was used to <b>lubricate</b> the rotor disc contacts. Without this there was a risk of arcing which would burn the insulation between the contacts. For {{the rest of the}} machine two grades of oil (Spindle Oils 1 and 2) were used. Regular cleaning and maintenance was essential. In particular, the letters/figures cam-cluster balata discs had to be kept <b>lubricated.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{make the}} hydro power {{application}} more environmentally adapted new EALs such as synthetic esters {{will replace the}} existing mineral oils. This study aims to exploit the EALs potential in boundary lubrication, especially in slow sliding journal bearings with shaft oscillation as those supporting the Kaplan turbine blades. In order to evaluate the performance of different <b>lubricated</b> environmentally adapted journal bearings a test rig was built. Many test rig parameters were set to simulate water turbine conditions. Tests were performed with different bearing and shaft materials and different lubricants suited for water turbine application, EALs, water with and the present used mineral oil reference. Additional <b>lubricated</b> tests in oscillating motion were conducted with a roller on disc and a pin on disc. All tests were performed with oscillating motion. The results showed that synthetic esters affect the contact material to a larger extent than the tested mineral oil. The synthetic esters were also sensitive to the selection of bearing and shaft material. Highly alloyed bronzes were more prone to corrosive wear. A coated shaft showed excellent performance with a low alloyed tin bronze. The comparison of self <b>lubricated</b> bearings with water lubrication to an EAL <b>lubricated</b> tin bronze on stainless steel showed large performance differences between the water <b>lubricated</b> materials. They showed both better and worse friction and wear results than the EAL <b>lubricated</b> tin bronze. The oscillating pin on disc can generate similar contact mechanisms as in a journal bearing. The most important conclusion of this work {{is that it is}} possible to find self <b>lubricated</b> journal bearings better suited for shaft oscillation than EAL <b>lubricated</b> bronze bearings in water turbine application. Water <b>lubricated</b> design of the bearings are the most environmentally adapted solution. EALs such as the tested synthetic esters have a promising future in the hydraulic systems controlling the turbines and can under certain boundary lubrication conditions with bronze show excellent performance.

5|$|Lithium, sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener {{and can be used}} to make <b>lubricating</b> greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as <b>lubricating</b> synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and <b>lubricating</b> greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|E
40|$|Three ES and H-compatible {{lubricants}} (Environment, Safety and Health) {{for single}} race bearing applications and one hybrid-material single race bearings were evaluated and compared against single race bearings with trichlorotrifluoroethane (Freon) deposition of {{low molecular weight}} polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bearing lubricant extracted from Vydax{trademark}. Vydax is a product manufactured by DuPont consisting of various molecular weights of PTFE suspended in trichlorotrifluoroethane (Freon), which is an ozone-depleting solvent. Vydax {{has been used as}} a bearing lubricant in stronglink mechanisms since 1974. Hybrid bearings with silicon nitride balls and molded glass-nylon-Teflon retainers, bearings <b>lubricated</b> with titanium carbide (TiC) on the balls, bearings <b>lubricated</b> with sputtered MoS{sub 2 } on races and retainers, and bearings <b>lubricated</b> with electrophoretically deposited MoS{sub 2 } were evaluated. The bearings were maintained in a preloaded state in bearing cartridges during cycling and vibration tests. Bearings with electrophoretically deposited MoS{sub 2 } performed as well as bearings <b>lubricated</b> with Vydax and were the best performing candidate. All candidates were suitable for low preload applications. Bearings with TiC coated balls and bearings <b>lubricated</b> with sputtered MoS{sub 2 } on the races and retainers performed well at high preloads, though not as well as bearings <b>lubricated</b> with electrophoretic deposition of MoS{sub 2 }.

5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of <b>lubricating</b> oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told {{that they had to}} go. A proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of <b>lubricating</b> oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as <b>lubricating</b> oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{many cases}} {{constant}} supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may {{cease to be}} so. For example, a kosher <b>lubricating</b> oil may be replaced by one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} can be hydrostatically or hydrodynamically <b>lubricated.</b> Hydrostatically <b>lubricated</b> bearings are <b>lubricated</b> by {{an external}} pump that maintains a static amount of pressure. In a hydrodynamic bearing {{the pressure in}} the oil film is maintained by {{the rotation of the}} journal. Hydrostatic bearings enter a hydrodynamic state when the journal is rotating. Hydrostatic bearings usually use oil, while hydrodynamic bearings can use oil or grease, however bearings can be designed to use whatever fluid is available, and several pump designs use the pumped fluid as a lubricant.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the price rose rapidly {{as a result}} of {{increasing}} demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing sinkers, food-processing equipment, free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, <b>lubricating</b> greases, and shot for waterfowl hunting. Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of <b>lubricating</b> serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as <b>lubricating</b> oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E
