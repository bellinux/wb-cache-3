5|$|As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying</b> is an American metalcore {{band from}} San Diego, California. Founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis, the {{establishment}} of the band's first full lineup, which included drummer Jordan Mancino, occurred in 2001. As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying</b> has released six albums, one split album, and two compilation albums.|$|E
5|$|Although As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying</b> {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying</b> song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying</b> started {{recording}} {{a new album}} titled An Ocean Between Us, which was released on August 21, 2007. Debuting at No.8 on the Billboard 200 and No.1 on the Top Rock chart, with first-week sales of 39,000 units, the album was the highest charting release for the band.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} band's formation, Pluto Records offered As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying</b> a {{recording}} contract and, after accepting the offer, the band entered the studio {{one month later}} to record their first album Beneath the Encasing of Ashes, released in June 2001. The band then recorded five songs for a split album, again through Pluto Records, with San Diego post-hardcore band American Tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the nature}} of their relationship, Domitian seems to have {{displayed}} little sympathy when his brother <b>lay</b> <b>dying,</b> instead making for the Praetorian camp where he was proclaimed emperor. The following day, 14 September, the Senate confirmed Domitian's powers, granting tribunician power, the office of Pontifex Maximus, and the titles of Augustus ("venerable"), and Pater Patriae ("father of the country").|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} band Society's Finest, {{in which he}} played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying</b> in 2000. Starting out as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the {{hardcore}} punk band Point of Recognition. The band's name came from the novel {{of the same name}} by William Faulkner that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{continue}} on without Lambesis, Mancino, along with ex-members Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Gilbert, {{decided to focus}} on a different style of music under a different band name, Wovenwar, with Shane Blay as the vocalist, This project took shape long before Lambesis' plea. although Mancino still remains a member of As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying.</b> During this period of time Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's first exile {{was to be}} a short one.

According to one chronicle, he {{gathered}} some of his most trusted men around him, including Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; and Aymer de Valence, soon to be Earl of Pembroke. Edward entrusted the magnates with the care of his son, and instructed them particularly to prevent the return of Piers Gaveston from exile. Nevertheless, when the King died on 7 July, one of Edward II's first acts as king was to recall his friend. Gaveston returned almost immediately, and the two were reunited by early August.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Nunn's wife Beula {{filed for}} divorce from a {{hospital}} bed where she <b>lay</b> <b>dying</b> of cancer. She claimed {{she was trying to}} preserve some of her estate for her children. A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside. Some property issues were still pending at the time of Beula's death in 1995. During the divorce proceedings, Nunn's son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between him and his father. A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family. The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fiancée, Amanda Ross.|$|E

5|$|Returning {{home from}} the {{legislative}} session, Breckinridge made daily visits with Henry Clay, who <b>lay</b> <b>dying</b> in Lexington, and was chosen to deliver his eulogy in Congress when the next session commenced. The eulogy enhanced his popularity and solidified his position as Clay's political heir apparent. He also campaigned for the election of Democrat Franklin Pierce as president. Although Pierce lost Kentucky by 3,200 votes, Breckinridge wielded more influence with him than he had with outgoing Whig President Millard Fillmore. A week after his inauguration, Pierce offered Breckinridge an appointment as governor of Washington Territory. He had initially sought the appointment, securing letters of recommendation from Powell and Butler, {{but by the time}} it was offered, he had decided to stay in Kentucky and seek re-election to the House.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 2010, {{the actor}} {{acquired}} the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film. It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would be right for the movie, until he learned of Franco's {{desire to be a}} director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side. The actor also has plans to direct a film version of William Faulkner's As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying.</b> Dec. 2010: 286–88 The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In late 2013 Franco starred in This Is the End as a fictionalized version of himself stuck in a house with Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride, also fictionalized versions of themselves, when the Apocalypse happens.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it <b>lay</b> <b>dying</b> were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck bearing down on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E

5|$|Franco had six {{roles in}} 2012 {{none of which}} had much success except the crime-comedy film Spring Breakers, in which he played a gangster to highly {{positive}} reviews. The following year, Franco played the titular role in the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful, and the disaster film This Is the End saw him play a fictional version of himself. For the first one, he was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor - Fantasy.

5|$|In 1032, Barbolano {{himself was}} deposed {{by those who}} wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge <b>lay</b> <b>dying</b> in Constantinople {{and was unable to}} return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, {{attempted}} to seize the throne without waiting for the formality of an election, but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because {{he was the son of}} Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of a son of a Doge.|$|E
5|$|Medina and Carter {{left the}} band soon after; they were {{replaced}} by Brian Khounvichit and Mark Nicks respectively. Carter went on to form the progressive death metal band, Deus Invictus.

An EP, titled Unsung, was released {{at the beginning of}} December. It featured two new tracks and four re-recordings from their debut and was well received among critics. The band played shows with labelmates As Cities Burn, mewithoutYou, and Underoath later that month. Touring continued through 2006 as the band shared a national tour with P.O.D. in spring and garnered a spot in the Sounds of the Underground Tour with As I <b>Lay</b> <b>Dying</b> that summer.
