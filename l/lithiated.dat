An unprecedented selectivity was observed with t-BuLi, which effected a clean lithiation at C- 4.

(1S)-(dimethylamino)ethyl-ferrocene treated with n-BuLi, then quenched with TMSCl produces a planar chirality of (Rp). Treatment of (1R)-(dimethylamino)ethyl-ferrocene under these conditions produces a planar chirality of (Sp). This selectivity is dictated by {{the orientation of the}} methyl substituent on the starting material in the conformation necessary for the nitrogen to be chelated to the <b>lithiate.</b> In one case this methyl substituent suffers from steric interactions with the other Cp ring, and in the other it points away from all other atoms. The high diastereoselectivity is independent of the electrophile used to trap the metalate, providing evidence for the stereoinductive step being lithiation and allowing broad synthetic utility of Ugi’s amine. If the (S,Sp) or (R,Rp) diastereomers are desired, the first metalate can be trapped with TMSCl to block the more favored lithiation position. Subsequent lithiation occurs at the only available, less favored site. Trapping with the desired electrophile and TBAF deprotection of the TMS group will provide the (S,Sp) or (R,Rp) diastereomer.|$|R
