500|$|... "Déjà Vu" [...] is a {{contemporary}} R song, {{performed in a}} moderate hip hop groove. It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are [...] "silky smooth" [...] and that her vocal range <b>leans</b> <b>toward</b> the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] (1980).|$|E

Though written by Diamond, Deep Purple's version musically <b>leans</b> <b>toward</b> the style of Mitch Ryder's recording of [...] "Devil with a Blue Dress On".

Lyrics (a focus in the genre) are typically emotional and often personal, dealing with topics such as failed romance; AllMusic described emo lyrics as [...] "usually either [...] poetry or intimate confessionals". According to AllMusic, early emo bands were hardcore punk bands who [...] "favored expressive vocals over the typical barking rants" [...] of regular hardcore punk; most 1990s emo bands [...] "borrowed from some combination of Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Weezer".

2500|$|The Backstreet Boys' musical {{style has}} evolved over the years. On their debut and second album, they sang a hybrid of R and dance club pop mixed with new jack balladry and hip-hop. With Millennium and Black & Blue, they started to abandon R and shift more toward pop and pop rock, as {{demonstrated}} on songs like [...] "I Want It That Way", [...] "Shape of My Heart", [...] "Larger than Life", and [...] "Not For Me". The group drastically changed their style in 2005 with their comeback album Never Gone, which is an adult contemporary record featuring only live instruments, a departure from their previous pop sound that features a lot of synthesizers. Compared to their previous albums, Never Gone is [...] "more organic, more stripped-down, less harmonies, more instrumentation". Their first album without Richardson, Unbreakable, is similar to Never Gone. It <b>leans</b> <b>toward</b> adult contemporary and contemporary pop music and features interwoven choral harmonies, piano, strings, guitar, and drums, {{with a little bit}} of hip-hop and reggae elements on some tracks, such as [...] "One in A Million". With their seventh studio album, This Is Us, they went back to their original dance-pop beats combined with electropop. It also contains a more R sound compared to Unbreakable. The group's first independent album, In A World Like This, which is also their first album back with Richardson, is a mixture of modern pop, adult contemporary, and dance music, with a hint of singer-songwriter genre as demonstrated on [...] "Try", [...] "Madeleine", and [...] "Trust Me".|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic defined Whitney Houston as [...] "the foundation of diva-pop" [...] and stated that certainly, the ballads such as [...] "Greatest Love of All" [...] and [...] "Saving All My Love for You", provided [...] "the blueprint for decades of divas". However, he gave higher marks to the lighter tracks like [...] "How Will I Know" [...] and [...] "Thinking About You", commenting these tracks [...] "are what really impresses some 20-plus years on" [...] and [...] "turns the album into a fully rounded record, the rare debut that manages to telegraph every aspect of an artist's career in a mere ten songs." [...] Brad Wete, on a feature article to celebrate for Vibe magazine's 15th anniversary in September 2008, wrote [...] "never before has an African-American woman earned such crossover appeal so early in her career. [...] had an explosive solo debut" [...] and commented [...] "Whitney's prodigious pop set [...] was a fresh serving of precocious talent compared to 1985's mildly flavored R buffet." [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post stated that the album [...] "provided a blueprint for the pop/dance/R careers of Mariah Carey and others, and introduced the world to [...] "The Voice", an octave-spanning, gravity-defying melismatic marvel." [...] In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), music journalist J. D. Considine gave the album three out of five stars and stated, [...] "Although utterly calculating, Whitney Houston does have its moments, particularly when Houston <b>leans</b> <b>toward</b> R, as on 'You Give Good Love.'" ...|$|E
