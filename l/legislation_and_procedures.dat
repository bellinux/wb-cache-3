50|$|In 1997, the Royal Commission {{into the}} New South Wales Police Service {{found that the}} use of {{electronic}} surveillance was the single most important factor in achieving a breakthrough in its investigations. Justice Wood concluded that the law lagged well behind technical developments and patterns of crime and recommended a systematic and comprehensive review of <b>legislation</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> to assist the pursuit of law enforcement. The Surveillance Devices Bill 2007 (NSW) was introduced into the New South Wales Parliament on 6 November 2007. The bill replaced the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW) and expanded the application of the legislation so that it also applies to data surveillance devices, optical surveillance devices and tracking devices. The aim of the bill was to implement national model legislation developed by the Joint Working Group of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers’ Council on National Investigation Powers. The Second Reading Speech states that for serious crimes like murder, terrorism, drug manufacture and importation it is essential that law enforcement agencies have every possible tool at their disposal to make their investigations and prosecutions as successful as possible.The Act was assented to on 23 November 2007. The date of commencement was 1 August 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{types of}} paper clips had been {{patented}} in the United States since 1867, but the [...] "Gem" [...] type was not then (and has never been) patented. As {{an employee of}} Bryns patent office in Kristiania, Vaaler was familiar with patent <b>legislation</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> in Norway. His reasons for applying abroad are unknown, {{but it is possible}} that he had an exaggerated confidence in his invention and saw the need to secure the commercial rights internationally. Also, he may have been aware that Norwegian inventors would meet difficulties on the small home market. Quite soon he must have had the disappointment of his life when he was confronted by the [...] "Gem", which was probably introduced in Norway during his own lifetime. He is not known to have tried to contact potential manufacturers in Norway or abroad, and this lack of initiative seems to confirm that he soon learned that a superior clip already existed. His patent was allowed to expire quietly, without a single one of his many proposed designs having ever been manufactured. [...] Meanwhile, the [...] "Gem" [...] conquered the world, including his own country. The Norwegian fish hook manufacturer O. Mustad & Søn AS of Gjøvik has produced Gem-type paper clips since 1928.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the policy and practice of prisoner rehabilitation in Queensland, {{and the extent to which}} they accord with international best practice. Actual practice was identified through interviews and written submissions from 20 ex-prisoners and 18 prisoner service providers (including two past staff members from Queensland prisons), as well as through an examination of reported judicial review decisions and Department of Corrective Services statistics. The results demonstrate that although the <b>legislation</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> suggest that a best practice system of prisoner rehabilitation exists in Queensland, there is a significant gulf between policy and practice. Far from being sufficiently prepared for release, Queensland prisoners are generally released directly from high security facilities into a community which they have great difficulty reintegrating into.
