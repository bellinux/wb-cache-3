40|$|Tube end {{spinning}} process has developed on the grounding of {{experiences in the}} work. This is the method of shaping tubular stock without the application of external heat during the shaping operation which consist in simultaneously relatively rotating the stock and a shaping tool about the axis of the tool while relatively moving the tool and the stock toward one another and while the stock is so heated by shaping tool with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>relief</b> area. Experimental results about torque, thrust and temperature are obtained by using several kinds of conical shape dies and copper tubes, are showing that the portion of relief area {{on the face of}} shaping die is so influence on the workability. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} hypothesis {{for the last}} stage of glaciation in the Černé Lake area in the Bohe-mian Forest (the Šumava Mts.). The hypothesis results from geomorphologic research of the area based on bathymetrical measurements and a diving survey of part of {{the bottom of the}} lake, which was executed in order to verify a hypothesis about the existence of a submerged part of a moraine. The main geomorpholo-gic methods used were: morphometrical and morphographical analysis of DEM performed using GIS tools (analysis of slopes inclination, aspect of slope, shading of <b>relief,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> and cross section, degree of cirque deepening), geomorphologic GPS mapping, particle size analysis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{emersion}} of Betic Cordilleras (Sierra Nevada, Sierra de Gador) {{and associated}} marine neogene basins {{is the result}} of recent tectonic processes. This emersion was followed by the installation of drainage systems (rio Andarax, rio Adra) where detrital products were trapped at their outlets with morphosedimentary shapes as deltas or alluvial fans. Starting from a simple examination of the morphology of the SE Betic area, we can note that some deltaic morphologies as Campo de Dalias (south of the Sierra de Gador) do not correspond with the current upstream drainage network. We suppose, consequently, a reorganization of the drainage network between the formation of deltaic systems, and present. A sediment budget and a geomorphological analysis were performed to study this drainage evolution since this emergence in a context of high uplift (the Sierra de Gador has raised tortonian marine deposits up to 1800 m). The calculated sediment budget shows that the deposits of Campo de Dalias cannot be explained only by a feeding that comes from its current source (the south side of the Sierra de Gador). <b>Longitudinal</b> profiles and <b>relief</b> maps show that rivers have responded to the uplift by incising the landscape with numerous knickpoints and by an eastward shift of the drainage network attested by windgaps in the landscape. We conclude that the morphosedimentary shape of Campo de Dalias could be an abandoned deltaic morphology resulting from a shift of the drainage network toward the east since the Pliocene linked to the uplift of the Sierra de Gador...|$|R
