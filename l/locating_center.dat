40|$|Retrofitting of commercially {{available}} vehicles, which includes mostly sports utility vehicles, to bullet proof vehicle {{is a common}} practice. Retrofitting of {{commercially available}} vehicle into bullet proof vehicle increases overall weight of the vehicle which is unevenly distributed on different portions of the vehicle. This additional weight after installation of bullet proof material in the vehicle, affects not only acceleration and braking performance but also has serious implication on {{the stability of the}} vehicle. Handling response of bullet proof vehicle after retrofitting of commercially available vehicle needs investigation especially with respect to increase in weight and its distribution. Rollover is an important research area of vehicle dynamics which is instigated primarily due to steer input given to the wheels. Roll dynamics of a vehicle is dependent on many vehicle parameters mainly, overall weight of the vehicle, stiffness of the suspension, forces developed during braking and acceleration, variation of center of gravity location of the vehicle and coefficient of friction of road surface. This work offers a preliminary analysis and study of rollover tendency in bullet proof vehicle and offer a suitable solution to avoid expected bullet proof vehicle rollover due to uncertain driving maneuvers. Experimental tests have been performed on converted bullet proof Land Rover 110 to predict rollover propensity present in the vehicle. Specialized apparatus "vehicle roll analyzer" has been developed for real time measurement of different parameters like accelerations in x,y and z direction, displacement of sprung mass during cornering to approximate dynamic load shifting and roll,pitch and yaw angles of the vehicle. Real time vehicle data of the vehicle during testing has been further validated by using software "kinetics". These parameters along with other measured parameters have been utilized for load transfer, CG analysis and skid pad testing. Prevention is suggested by applying hybrid control strategy that is by uniform distribution of weight in the first phase and then subsequently application of active roll angle adjustment in the later stage. After application of suggested control strategy improvement in the rollover behavior of the vehicle has been achieved while attaining improvement in load shifting during cornering and also optimally <b>locating</b> <b>center</b> of gravity of the vehicle...|$|E

This paper presents simple self-stabilizing algorithms for <b>locating</b> <b>centers</b> and medians of trees. Since the algorithms are selfstabilizing they can tolerate transient failures as well as a dynamically changing tree topology. After the presentation of the algorithms, the correctness of the algorithms is proven and upper bounds on their time complexity established. Finally, self-stabilizing algorithms for <b>locating</b> <b>centers</b> and medians in trees with possibly non-unit costs associated with their edges, are presented...|$|R

40|$|Species {{extinction}} rates 100 to 1000 pre-human {{levels are}} threatening the planet’s biodiversity. The Amazon rainforests {{are of particular}} importance to protecting species because of their extremely high levels of biodiversity. Faced with losses from deforestation of 20 % in the last 40 years and expecting to lose another 20 % in the next 20 years, governments and conservationist organizations must begin planning in order to mitigate species extinctions {{and the destruction of}} ecosystems. This master’s project creates a GIS-based planning tool for conservation practitioners that locates and prioritizes new protected areas in the Madre de Dios watershed in southeastern Peru. The tool is based on distributions of bird and mammal species endemic to Peru and Bolivia, ecological systems, and development threats.
