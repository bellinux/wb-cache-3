500|$|The Vauban {{military}} fort {{was built}} in the 17th century during the war between Spain and Portugal that lasted from 1640 to 1668 as a defense measure to counter-attack forces entering the city from the northwest and southeast. It is made of stone, brick and <b>lime</b> <b>concrete.</b> It has eight bastions built on {{the northern part of the}} fort as the Guadiana and Rivilla rivers on the south provided the defense. The bastions are named as the San Pedro, La Trinidad, the Santa María, the San Roque, the [...] San Juan, the Santiago, the [...] San José and the San Vicente.|$|E
500|$|The barracks {{consists}} of two levels, with rifle firing holes on all sides. Iron shutters closed {{on the inside and}} were locked with wooden beams. In 1885 the verandah facing the manning parade was enclosed with wooden shutters to keep the weather out. These shutters were removed during 20th-century restoration work and the verandah returned to original condition. The roof was at first flat timber overlaid by [...] of <b>lime</b> <b>concrete.</b> This first roof leaked and an iron roof was added in 1885. The first floor of the barracks contains the officer's rooms and troop's barracks room. Its eastern (outer) wall is not flat, incorporating a design feature known as [...] "hornwork", which opens the field of fire from the rifle holes. Some of the firing holes were bricked in during the 1930s; this has been only partly rectified during restoration.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the new roof a new floor was laid, including a 3 m wide strip in Blue Lias Stone and 44 cubic meters of <b>lime</b> <b>concrete</b> used to fill the expanses either side. It {{is said to be}} the largest expanse of <b>lime</b> <b>concrete</b> flooring anywhere in Europe.|$|E
50|$|This {{variety of}} brick tiles were of {{moderate}} dimensions {{and could be}} used for reinforcing <b>lime</b> <b>concretes</b> in the structural walls and other thick components. But, as they made mouldings, cornices, plasters, etc. easy to work into a variety of shapes, they were more often used as cladding or decorative material.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic <b>lime</b> <b>concretes</b> {{have been}} in use since Roman times, either as mass {{foundation}} concretes or as lightweight concretes using tufa or pumice as aggregates and {{a wide range of}} pozzolans to achieve different strengths and speeds of set. This meant that lime could be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications including floors and even vaults or domes. An example is the Pantheon in Rome, which has survived for nearly two thousand years. The dome's diameter is equal to its height from the floor. It is constructed from six different lime mixes, which change the properties and lightness of the material.|$|R
40|$|The acidity of {{rainfall}} in major areas of Indonesia is under neutral pH. Average pH {{of rainfall}} is between 3 and 5. Free <b>lime</b> within <b>concrete</b> will react with acid and cause {{a decrease in}} the strength of concrete. A means to anticipate the damage is to reduce the content of free <b>lime</b> within <b>concrete.</b> Silicon oxide contained in rice husk ash can react with free lime to form a new compound that is harder and denser. It became the basis for the use of rice husk ash in concrete mixtures. The mixtures were prepared by replacing 5...|$|R
25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} driver behind the modern use of concrete was Smeaton's Tower, the third Eddystone Lighthouse in Devon, England.

40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{providing}} a multi-scale model {{to estimate the}} effective properties of hemp and <b>lime</b> <b>concretes.</b> The microstructures of such materials are characterized by a relatively high filling rate, platy orthotropic particles distributed {{on a wide range}} of spatial directions, and a high level of porosity at meso and micro scales. An iterative micromechanical modeling is here enhanced with some numerical features allowing to deal with the shape and orientation of the particles and with the resulting effective anisotropy of concretes. The model thus constructed is first put into practice to identify the properties of hemp shives and air-slaked lime for various compaction degrees. The results obtained are then used as input data to estimate the thermal and mechanical properties of both a collection of moderately com-pacted concretes, and a set of concretes with several compaction degrees. Simulations results are eventually confronted with experimental data from the literature...|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{has been}} used since ancient times. Regular Roman {{concrete}} for example was made from volcanic ash (pozzolana), and hydrated <b>lime.</b> Roman <b>concrete</b> was superior to other concrete recipes (for example, those consisting of only sand and lime) used by other nations. Besides volcanic ash for making regular Roman concrete, brick dust can also be utilized. Besides regular Roman concrete, the Romans also invented hydraulic concrete, which they made from volcanic ash and clay.|$|R

5000|$|Construction applications: Superplasticizers with AMPS {{are used}} to reduce water in {{concrete}} formulations. Benefits of these additives include improved strength, improved workability, improved durability of cement mixtures. Redispersible polymer powder, when AMPS is introduced, in cement mixtures control air pore content and prevent agglomeration of powders during the spray-drying process from the powder manufacturing and storage. Coating formulations with AMPS-containing polymers prevent calcium ions from being formed as <b>lime</b> on <b>concrete</b> surface and improve the appearance and durability of coating.|$|R
50|$|A brick is {{building}} material {{used to make}} walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and <b>lime,</b> or <b>concrete</b> materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks.|$|R
50|$|Micro calcite rafts {{have been}} {{observed}} on (soda) straw stalactites solution drops suspended beneath concrete structures. These secondary deposits which form outside the cave environment, are known as calthemites.

5000|$|More {{often than}} not, the {{structures}} {{on which they}} were used, especially the Sikh temples (Gurudwaras), were a combination of two systems: trabeated and post-and-lintel, or based on arches. The surfaces were treated with lime or gypsum plaster which was moulded into cornices, pilasters, and other structural as well as non-structural embellishments. Brick and lime mortar as well as lime or gypsum plaster, and <b>lime</b> <b>concrete</b> were the most favoured building materials, although stone (such as red stone and white marble) were also used {{in a number of}} shrines. Many Fortress were built using such bricks ...|$|E
50|$|COSTFORD uses {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} that were pioneered by Laurie Baker, including rat trap bond walls, filler slab roofing, brick jalli, patch-pointing, and exposed brickwork. COSTFORD strongly believes in preservation of the environmental resources and promotes the use of energy-efficient materials and which minimize the use of energy-intensive materials such as cement, steel, and glass. They use fired bricks or mud blocks stabilized with lime and rice husks for masonry. They also experiment with renewable building materials such as bamboo, which they use as reinforcement for the foundations with <b>lime</b> <b>concrete</b> or for slabs where they use bamboo as an exposed form with concrete on top.|$|E
5000|$|Flowstone {{may also}} form on manmade {{structures}} {{as a result}} of calcium hydroxide being leached from <b>concrete,</b> <b>lime</b> or mortar.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the durability of}} a <b>lime</b> hemp <b>concrete</b> (LHC) wall and its resistance to driving rain, moisture conditions inside the wall have to be modelled. As model input, moisture transport properties were determined. Two LHC mixes were studied. Cup tests provided moisture diffusivity results at relative humidity (RH) values up to 95 %. Capillary water uptake tests provided results for the interval 95 - 100 % RH by means of curve fitting and the simulation tool JAM-KAP. A mix containing more lime showed higher moisture diffusivity at relative humidity > 95 %. (c) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A size-effect {{theory is}} herein {{introduced}} {{to investigate the}} average expansion of <b>concrete</b> containing free <b>lime</b> (CaO) and impurities. By drawing an analogy with the structural size-effect, the phenomenon of CaO hydration shows a characteristic length, whose dimension remains constant at all scales. If a grain of free lime {{is assumed to be}} a sphere, only a thin layer on the external surface hydrates and doubles the volume, as confirmed by the results of 2 D finite element analyses and by some experimental observations. For practical applications, a simplified chemo-mechanical model of CaO hydration is eventually proposed, to predict the consequences of uncombined <b>lime</b> in <b>concrete</b> structure...|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} tasks were early {{identified}} as {{critical to the}} project's success. The first task was the undertaking of a thorough geotechnical examination of the existing tower founding material. This investigation showed quite clearly that the existing footings to the tower were not adequate {{to carry the load}} of the intended tower and spire. Nine metre bore holes were drilled through the existing foundations and a footing/soil profile was established. This soil profile showed that beneath the sandstone and <b>lime</b> <b>concrete</b> footings was a 1.5 to 2.0 metre band of sandy clay, and weathered sandstone, which was judged inadequate to carry the tower loads, particularly under the stress of wind and seismic loading.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first major}} {{renovation}} of the mosque was in 1664 when it was twice transported and rebuilt without any changes to its original appearance. In {{the beginning of the}} 18th century, a spire on top of the mosque was installed. The spire represents the Arabic letter alif, a letter that symbolizes Allah. The second major renovation was in 1895 when a porch was added to the front and to the east of the original mosque. The renovation in 1895 also installed <b>lime</b> <b>concrete</b> reinforcement on the lower side of the wooden wall, and replaced the original coral gravel-layered floor with cement. The 1895 restoration was initiated by a local figure Hamid Iha.|$|E
50|$|Limecrete or <b>lime</b> <b>{{concrete}}</b> is concrete where cement {{is replaced}} by lime.One successful formula {{was developed in the}} mid-1800s by Dr. John E. Park.We know that lime has been used since Roman Times either as mass foundation concretes or as lightweight concretes using a variety of aggregates combined {{with a wide range of}} pozzolans (fired materials) that help to achieve increased strength and speed of set. This meant that lime could be used in a much wider variety of applications than previously such as floors, vaults or domes.Over the last decade, there has been a renewed interest in using lime for these applications again. This is because of environmental benefits and potential health benefits, when used with other lime products.|$|E
50|$|A train {{engineer}} {{took note}} of the rock formations near the community. He came back to develop a huge limestone kiln that produced 1000 bushels of <b>lime</b> a day. <b>Concrete</b> formed the base of this structure that stood 53 feet high with a trestle 200 feet long. The remains can still be seen at the north-west end of 2nd Avenue, just beyond the Senior housing.|$|R
50|$|On the {{southern}} breakwater, barge construction was used. The southern side of Sebastos {{was much more}} exposed than the northern side, requiring sturdier breakwaters. Instead of using the double planked method filled with rubble, the architects sank barges filled with layers of pozzolana <b>concrete</b> and <b>lime</b> sand mortar. The barges were similar to boxes without lids, and were constructed using mortise and tenon joints, the same technique used in ancient boats, to ensure they remained watertight. The barges were ballasted with 0.5 meters of pozzolana concrete and floated out to their position. With alternating layers, pozzolana based and <b>lime</b> based <b>concretes</b> were hand placed inside the barge to sink it and fill {{it up to the}} surface.|$|R
50|$|Probably the {{greatest}} driver behind the modern use of concrete was Smeaton's Tower built by John Smeaton in the 1750s. The third Eddystone Lighthouse (the world's first open ocean lighthouse), Smeaton pioneered {{the use of}} hydraulic <b>lime</b> in <b>concrete.</b> Scotsman Robert Stevenson constructed the Bell Rock Lighthouse in the early 1800s. Situated 11 miles off east Scotland, it is the world's oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse. Portland cement, {{the most common type}} of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, was developed in England in the 19th century. It was coined by Joseph Aspdin in 1824 (he named it after Portland stone), and further developed by his son William Aspdin in the 1840s.|$|R
