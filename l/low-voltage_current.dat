5000|$|The {{most common}} way that ABS systems detect track {{occupancy}} (by a train or obstruction) {{is through the}} use of electrical track circuits. A <b>low-voltage</b> <b>current</b> is sent through the track between the signals and is detected to determine whether the circuit is closed, open, or shorted. A train's metal wheels and axles will pass current from one rail to the other, thereby shorting (shunting) the circuit. If the ABS system detects that the circuit is shorted between two signals, it understands that a train, or obstruction is occupying that block and will [...] "drop" [...] the signals (display a restricting or stop indication) on either side of that block to prevent another train from entering (if the block is governed by a positive stop).

50|$|In 1800 Alessandro Volta {{invented the}} voltaic pile, {{allowing}} for a continuous current of electricity for experimentation. This became a source of a <b>low-voltage</b> <b>current</b> {{that could be used}} to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an electrostatic machine, which with Leyden jars were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity. Another very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the German physician, anatomist and inventor Samuel Thomas von Sömmering in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish polymath and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo. Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von Sömmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message. This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return). Hans Christian Ørsted discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field which will deflect a compass needle. In the same year Johann Schweigger invented the galvanometer, with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current. In 1821, André-Marie Ampère suggested that telegraphy could be done by a system of galvanometers, with one wire per galvanometer to indicate each letter, and said he had experimented successfully with such a system. In 1824, Peter Barlow said that such a system only worked to a distance of about 200 ft, and so was impractical. In 1825 William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet, with a single winding of uninsulated wire on a piece of varnished iron, which increased the magnetic force produced by electric current. Joseph Henry improved it in 1828 by placing several windings of insulated wire around the bar, creating a much more powerful electromagnet which could operate a telegraph through the high resistance of long telegraph wires. During his tenure at The Albany Academy from 1826 to 1832, Henry first demonstrated the theory of the 'magnetic telegraph' by ringing a bell through a mile of wire strung around the room. In 1835 Joseph Henry and Edward Davy invented the critical electrical relay. Davy's relay used a magnetic needle which dipped into a mercury contact when an electric current passed through the surrounding coil. This allowed a weak current to switch a larger current to operate a powerful local electromagnet over very long distances. Davy demonstrated his telegraph system in Regent's Park in 1837 and was granted a patent on 4 July 1838. He also developed an electric relay.|$|E

At the temperature 29 ± 3 °C (non-lethal temperature), the surviving fractions of cells exposed to Alternating Current (AC) were decreased {{with an increase in}} current density for a definite exposure time. At a certain current density, the surviving fractions were decreased proportionally with exposure time. The lethal effect to cells was attributed to the toxicity of hydrogen peroxide and direct effect of alternating current. These surviving fractions were closely related to the amount of H 2 O 2 formed in the cell suspensions. At a definite current density, the amount of H 2 O 2 in the suspension increased with increasing AC-exposure time. At a definite exposure time, the amount of H 2 O 2 increased with increasing current density.

Preventing foreign surface–platelet interaction may improve biocompatibility of implantable medical devices. This study evaluated efficacy of novel technique for electrically modifying surface of conductive biomaterial and attaching blood components to prevent thrombogenesis. Specifically, this new surface modification technology, Forcefield (ATS Medical, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn), was designed to prevent platelet adhesion on pyrolytic carbon. A modulated <b>low-voltage</b> <b>current</b> is directly applied to pyrolytic carbon surfaces to stimulate adherence of a layer of charged proteins from circulating blood components that is resistive to platelet deposition. MethodsFeasibility of Forcefield technology was tested in line with cardiopulmonary bypass circuit in patients undergoing standard cardiac surgery (n =  6). Forcefield treatment was applied to segment of pyrolytic carbon with 15 minutes (n =  3) and 30 minutes (n =  3) of electrically stimulated exposure time, and resulting segments were compared with untreated pyrolytic carbon segment. Platelet adhesion confluence was then quantified by scanning electron microscopy. ResultsConfluence of the Forcefield-treated pyrolytic carbon segments (3. 3 % ± 2. 2 %) was significantly reduced relative to untreated pyrolytic carbon control segments (81. 7 % ± 24 %, P < . 001). There were no discernible differences in cell confluence with Forcefield-treated segments as function of exposure time (15 or 30 minutes).

40|$|Nonvolatile {{electronic}} memory devices that store {{data in the}} form of electrical- resistance values, and memory circuits based on such devices, have been invented. These devices and circuits exploit an electrically-variable-resistance phenomenon that occurs in thin films of certain oxides that exhibit the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) effect. It is worth emphasizing that, as stated in the immediately preceding article, these devices function at room temperature and do not depend on externally applied magnetic fields. A device of this type is basically a thin film resistor: it consists of a thin film of a CMR material located between, and in contact with, two electrical conductors. The application of a short-duration, <b>low-voltage</b> <b>current</b> pulse via the terminals changes the electrical resistance of the film. The amount of the change in resistance depends {{on the size of the}} pulse. The direction of change (increase or decrease of resistance) depends on the polarity of the pulse. Hence, a datum can be written (or a prior datum overwritten) in the memory device by applying a pulse of size and polarity tailored to set the resistance at a value that represents a specific numerical value. To read the datum, one applies a smaller pulse - one that is large enough to enable accurate measurement of resistance, but small enough so as not to change the resistance. In writing, the resistance can be set to any value within the dynamic range of the CMR film. Typically, the value would be one of several discrete resistance values that represent logic levels or digits. Because the number of levels can exceed 2, a memory device of this type is not limited to binary data. Like other memory devices, devices of this type can be incorporated into a memory integrated circuit by laying them out on a substrate in rows and columns, along with row and column conductors for electrically addressing them individually or collectively...|$|E
40|$|Circuit {{breakers}} are {{an important}} safety feature in most electrical circuits, and they act to prevent excessive currents caused by short circuits, for example. <b>Low-voltage</b> <b>current</b> limiting circuit breakers are activated by a trip solenoid when a critical current is exceeded. The solenoid moves two contacts apart to break the circuit. However, {{as soon as the}} contacts are separated an electric arc forms between them, ionising the air in the gap, increasing the electrical conductivity of air to that of the hot plasma that forms, and current continues to flow. The currents involved may be as large as 80, 000 amperes. Critical {{to the success of the}} circuit breaker is that it is designed to cause the arc to move away from the contacts, into a widening wedge-shaped region. This lengthens the arc, and then moves it onto a series of separator plates called an arc divider or splitter. The arc divider raises the voltage required to sustain the arcs across it, above the voltage that is provided across the breaker, so that the circuit is broken and the arcing dies away. This entire process occurs in milliseconds, and is usually associated with a sound like an explosion and a bright ash from the arc. Parts of the contacts and the arc divider may melt and/or vapourise. The question to be addressed by the Study Group was to mathematically model the arc motion and extinction, with the overall aim of an improved understanding that would help the design of a better circuit breaker. Further discussion indicated that two key mechanisms are believed to contribute to the movement of the arc away from the contacts, one being self-magnetism (where the magnetic field associated with the arc and surrounding circuitry acts to push it towards the arc divider), and the other being air flow (where expansion of air combined with the design of the chamber enclosing the arc causes gas flow towards the arc divider). Further discussion also indicated that a key aspect of circuit breaker design was that it is desirable to have as fast a quenching of the arc as possible, that is, the faster the circuit breaker can act to stop current flow, the better. The relative importance of magnetic and air pressure effects on quenching speed is of central interest to circuit design...|$|E
