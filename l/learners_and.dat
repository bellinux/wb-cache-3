5|$|Research {{into the}} atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's Physics Department in the {{international}} spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project. In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College. The college was closed in 1938 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently absorbed into University Extension. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies {{in response to the}} return of GIs after World War II. In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum. Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs—later the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studies—was established to reprise the former role of University Extension. While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong <b>learners</b> <b>and</b> high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} issues encountered in the mainstream correspondence model of distance education is transactional distance, which results from the lack of appropriate communication between <b>learner</b> <b>and</b> teacher. This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the <b>learner</b> <b>and</b> teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in distance education. Distance education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures {{to increase the amount of}} interaction between <b>learner</b> <b>and</b> teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of information and communication technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.|$|R

30|$|This brief {{synopsis}} {{shows that}} even an environment {{as simple as}} that embodied by one <b>learner</b> <b>and</b> one tutor is always full of vast opportunities for flexibility, and may be adapted by both the <b>learner</b> <b>and</b> the teacher through adding or changing aspects of it. There is a constant interplay between the teacher, the <b>learner,</b> <b>and</b> their surrounding environment (of which they are a part) that, all things being equal, combines to lead to better learning than the learner may have been able to achieve alone. But real learning environments, including through one-to-one tutoring, are vastly more complex than this.|$|R

This paper reports an evaluation which showed that casualty rates for <b>learner</b> <b>and</b> first year probationers began to decrease from mid 1979 and continued to do so until the end of 1980.

25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between <b>learners</b> <b>and</b> tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that <b>learners</b> <b>and</b> instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E

25|$|Dogme {{language}} teaching {{is considered to}} be both a methodology and a movement. Dogme is a communicative approach to {{language teaching}} and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the <b>learners</b> <b>and</b> the teacher. It has its roots in an article by the language education author, Scott Thornbury. The Dogme approach is also referred to as “Dogme ELT”, which reflects its origins in the ELT (English language teaching) sector. Although Dogme language teaching gained its name from an analogy with the Dogme 95 film movement (initiated by Lars von Trier), the connection is not considered close.|$|E

The writing can take place between students and the teacher or between language <b>learners</b> <b>and</b> native language speakers. The purposes might be overall language acquisition, development of writing abilities, extension of learning of the language beyond time in class, promotion of ability to transition to academic writing in university classes, and easing of the trauma of transition to life in the United States.|$|E
