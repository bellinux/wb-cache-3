25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
500|$|Seymour {{was trained}} by The Fabulous Moolah in 1975 right after she {{finished}} high school. She was originally from Florida, but because Moolah thought she <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit Hawaiian, Schroeder {{was given the}} ring name Leilani Kai. Her fellow wrestlers also bestowed upon her the nickname [...] "The Hawaiian Princess" [...] during her early career. Four weeks after beginning her training, Moolah sent her on a two-week tour of Alaska. Over {{the next few years}} she worked for promotions throughout the United States, including in Oklahoma, Minnesota, California, and New York. It was in 1979 in North Carolina, that Kai first began working with Judy Martin, who would be her future tag team partner.|$|E
500|$|The British {{drove him}} to a villa, where for four days they tried to stop Moshe Sharett from meeting him. Sharett [...] "fought a battle of {{telephones}} and cables," [...] Bauer writes, and on 11 June he and the Jewish Agency intelligence group were finally introduced to Brand. The discussion lasted several hours. Sharett wrote in a report of 27 June: [...] "I must have <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> incredulous, for he said: 'Please believe me: they have killed six million Jews; {{there are only two}} million left alive.'" [...] At the end of the meeting, Sharett broke the news that the British were insisting Brand not return to Budapest. Brand became hysterical.|$|E

500|$|On November 19, 2012, Aguilera and Shelton {{performed}} [...] "Just a Fool" [...] for {{the first}} time on the third season of The Voice, an American television singing competition on which she is serviced as a coach. Wearing [...] "sharp in dark", [...] "semi-casual" [...] outfits, the couple sang the first verse at opposite sides of the stage, and then came together onstage and shared the second one. During the performance, Aguilera kept belting to a minimum. The duo ended their singing with a hug. Caila Ball from Idolator wrote, [...] "Clumsy cross-promotions and hyperbole aside, it was a night of stellar performances, kicked off by Coaches Christina and Blake making the world debut of 'Just a Fool'". She continued to praise the performance, commenting, [...] "It was a refreshingly stripped down performance from Legendtina – who uncharacteristically took the stage in jeans. Blake, on the other hand, <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> awkward up there without a guitar and a stool".|$|E
500|$|With the {{intention}} of playing the 2015 season in the forward line alongside Jesse Hogan and Chris Dawes, a groin injury hampered Watts' pre-season training for three months heading into the season. He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called {{for him to be}} dropped with David Schwarz stating he [...] "might have to sit out a week" [...] and Dermott Brereton professing [...] "you have to make a stand as to what your team stands for, and that means you can't bring him back in until you are convinced he will not do that again"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting [...] "he can't relapse into these kind of performances", adding [...] "I don't like using the word, but he <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> soft at times".|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{visited his}} {{aunt and uncle}} in Windsor on leave in May 1975, [...] "proudly wearing his uniform", {{journalist}} Tony Wanless writes. Turned out in the RLI's tartan green ceremonial dress and green beret, he was conspicuous walking along Ouellette Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares. Coincidentally, a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandmother along that very street at the same time, leading Edith's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement. The soldier remained oblivious, but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family. [...] "He had the uniform and <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different," [...] Richard told the Windsor Star a year later, [...] "but I never forgot his face." [...] Chaykoski's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused {{to leave the house}} alone. While staying with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time. Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada; in particular he said he [...] "didn't want it associated with his adopted country". He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured, the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital. However, he said, he felt great loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service.|$|E

2500|$|... a kind {{of short}} man who <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like Mister Peepers, spoke slowly with a slight Brooklynese accent, and talked so you could never tell when he was kidding."– Brother-in-law Joseph Browner on his first {{impression}} of the artist; quoted in the Fresno Bee, August 26, 1990.|$|E
2500|$|The castle had low {{buildings}} {{either side}} that <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like wings, and were probably for stables and storage. A sundial dated 1673 survives, {{and may have}} been built to commemorate the completion of the 'modernisation' works. In the walled garden, another stone, [...] dated 1817, bears the inscription W.C. C.H..|$|E
2500|$|At 6–5, things <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more {{promising}} for the visitors. The two-game win streak they took {{into the game}} had gotten them over a [...]500 first half. Momentum clearly was on their side, and the Giants had not beaten the Eagles since the opening game of the 1975 season, three years prior. Still, the Giants were a decent team, and the Eagles knew they could not relax.|$|E

2500|$|The LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, {{moving the}} turn signal {{indicators}} {{to the front}} bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. Interestingly, the front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. [...] The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slimmer than their predecessors. [...] Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was [...] "1970-something" [...] meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days, Wolfman Jack made {{sporadic}} public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies (an [...] "MC") for rock bands at local Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance he <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different because Smith had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show {{him with a}} goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat [...] "ethnic". Other times {{he had a big}} afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. It was not until he appeared in the 1969 film, A Session with the Committee (a montage of skits by the seminal comedy troupe The Committee), that mainstream America got a good look at Wolfman Jack.|$|E
2500|$|Missouri Governor Jay Nixon {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would take over {{policing}} Ferguson from the St. Louis County police, whose tactics were widely criticized, referring to the change as [...] "an operational shift," [...] and that police will use force [...] "only when necessary," [...] and will generally [...] "step back a little bit." [...] Nixon said that Ferguson security will be overseen by Captain Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol. Johnson, an African-American, said he grew up in the community and [...] "it {{means a lot to me}} personally that we break this cycle of violence." [...] Nixon said, [...] "The people of Ferguson want their streets to be free of intimidation and fear" [...] he said, but during the past few days, [...] "it <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more like a war zone and that's not acceptable." [...] St. Louis county prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch criticized the governor's decision, saying [...] "It's shameful what he did today; he had no legal authority to do that. To denigrate the men and women of the county police department is shameful." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Accelerate", Entity FX {{was able}} to create a visual effect of Clark superspeeding through the rain—something Gough and Millar had wanted to see since season one—that {{eventually}} won them a Visual Effects Society award. Gough and Millar had always wanted to see Clark superspeeding through a rain shower, but [...] "the opportunity, [...] money" [...] never presented itself, until now. Entity FX had {{an extended period of time}} to research the kinetics of the cemetery scene, where Clark would speed through rain drops, because there were limited effects done for the episodes [...] "Precipice" [...] and [...] "Witness". Using HoudiniTM, Mat Beck and his team began creating their digital raindrops: [...] "Each raindrop can be thought of as a lens, as a mirror, and an object in itself. The entire backdrop is refracted through it like a lens, and the area behind the camera is being reflected in it. By adjusting those parameters, we were able to give it a brilliant jewel-like magical quality." [...] When trying to decide on the shape of the raindrops, Beck explains: [...] "We figured that round drops weren't that interesting, and teardrop ones <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> silly and over the top, so we settled on this round diamond shape." [...] Entity FX created [...] "collision events" [...] as Clark ran through the raindrops, breaking them up. Beck remembered watching the cars on the freeway, during a rainstorm, [...] "throwing up these loose trails of spray". Eli Jarra added a similar mist trail to Clark as he ran through the cemetery to give a more realistic effect, although Beck admits to taking a few liberties with the final look of the mist. Occasionally, Mat Beck and his team have to stretch the limits of the realistic physics they try and create when illustrating Clark’s abilities. While creating the alley scene in [...] "Prodigal" [...] where Lucas Luthor is attacked by an assassin with an Uzi 9mm, Mat Beck had to [...] "cheat" [...] the realism on the special effects used. First, the length of the alley is exaggerated in order to create enough time to show Clark stopping the bullets from hitting Lucas. Based on the calculations of how fast an Uzi 9mm fires, and the muzzle velocity, they estimated that the bullets would be approximately twenty to thirty feet apart; four alleys would have been needed for Clark to catch up to all of the bullets in time. Second, the bullets themselves were enlarged so that audiences would be able to see them.|$|E
