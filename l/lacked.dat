5000|$|Lacan first {{designated}} a <b>lack</b> of being: what is desired is being itself. [...] "Desire is a relation to being to <b>lack.</b> The <b>lack</b> is the <b>lack</b> of being properly speaking. It {{is not the}} <b>lack</b> of this or that, but <b>lack</b> of being whereby the being exists." [...] (Seminar: The Ego in Freud's Theory) In [...] "The Direction of the Treatment and the Principles of Its Power" [...] (Écrits) Lacan argues that desire is the metonymy of the <b>lack</b> of being (manque à être): the subject's <b>lack</b> of being {{is at the heart}} of the analytic experience and the very field in which the neurotic's passion is deployed. In [...] "Guiding Remarks for a Convention on Feminine Sexuality" [...] Lacan contrasts the <b>lack</b> of being related to desire with the <b>lack</b> of having (manque à avoir) which he relates to demand.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} do justice to the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided to build their own studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still <b>lacked</b> an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally <b>lacked</b> discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E

5|$|Space was {{a popular}} setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the {{abstract}} setting would help obscure simple graphics that <b>lacked</b> realism. Initially, Jarvis spent 3–4months developing color variations of Taito's Space Invaders and Atari's Asteroids. First inspired by Space Invaders, he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics. After spending a few weeks on the design, however, the team abandoned the idea, believing it <b>lacked</b> enjoyment. Development then shifted to emulating Atari's Asteroids, but hardware differences between Asteroids and Defenders proposed specifications were problematic. Asteroids displays vector graphics on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use pixel graphics on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with pixel graphics, but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay <b>lacked</b> enjoyment and visual appeal.|$|E

30|$|The rest {{of paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. In Section  2, <b>LACK</b> and DST are reviewed, and their features and relations are analyzed {{in order to}} show the potentials to corporate them together. Section  3 focuses on one of the DST on <b>LACK</b> scheme without quality control; this scheme proves the possibility to utilize DST on <b>LACK</b> and shows the capacity gains by adding DST on <b>LACK.</b> Section  4 proposes a DST on the <b>LACK</b> scheme with quality control; it not only improves the capacity of the <b>LACK</b> but also has the <b>LACK</b> adaptive over different quality settings. Section  5 shows the numerical results of the two proposed DST over <b>LACK</b> schemes compared with the conventional <b>LACK</b> scheme. Section  6 concludes this paper and provides the overview of the future work.|$|R

5|$|The game {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Author John Sellers listed {{it among the}} weirder arcade games released. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games echoed similar statements. She criticized the game, stating that the constant blue background was dull and the game <b>lacked</b> longevity. Retro Gamers Darran Jones described the game as engrossing and obscure. He also expressed disappointment that few people remember it. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame called Bubbles a slightly underrated game. He stated that while it <b>lacked</b> excitement, its gameplay was enjoyable. Weiss further commented that the control scheme was unique for its time, and {{that the number of}} on-screen objects moving smoothly was impressive.|$|E
