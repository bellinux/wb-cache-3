5|$|The {{departure}} of the Batavian squadron was noticed by Donnelly's small blockade force, which shadowed the Batavian ships as they passed southwards down the coast of Jutland, <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> them at 22:00 on 11 May. Donnelly correctly guessed the Batavian force's destination, and ordered Sylph to separate, the two vessels following different courses, instructing White to proceed to Duncan's blockade fleet and meet Donnelly there if {{he was unable to}} rediscover the Batavian squadron en route. Pegasus and Sylph encountered one another shortly before 05:00 on 12 May close to Duncan's fleet south of the Texel but without having located the Batavian squadron. Argo and her consorts had sailed close to the Danish and German coasts during the night, seizing in passing a British cutter named Duke of York, travelling from Yarmouth to Hamburg. At dawn on 12 May the Batavian ships were off the Batavian coast sailing southwest towards the Texel anchorage.|$|E
5|$|A {{flurry of}} action followed. On 1 July 1941 he {{expended}} 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader's section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. <b>Losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the squadron, Johnson and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived {{so as to}} come up and underneath into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109's starboard wing. Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and did not make a claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E
5|$|Boyles was {{not long}} able to enjoy his victory undisturbed: at 10:00 on 7 May, shortly after {{the removal of the}} French prisoners had been completed, sails were spotted on the horizon. These were rapidly {{identified}} as three French ships of the line that were making all haste to intercept and capture Swiftsure and Atalante. These ships were part of a squadron under Contre-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly that had sailed from Rochefort the day before in search of the American grain convoy shortly due in European waters. Issuing rapid orders, Boyles instructed Atalantes prize crew to separate their ship from Swiftsure in order to force the French to split their forces; the frigate and the ship of the line fleeing on different courses. Atalante soon outran pursuit and escaped into the Atlantic, the prize crew even managing to replace the damaged main topsail {{in the midst of the}} chase with the assistance of the French prisoners on board. Swiftsure was slower but Boyles was still able to increase the distance between his vessel and the French during the day, finally <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> his pursuers at 22:00.|$|E

25|$|Then on 19 May, Cruizer was six {{or seven}} leagues SE by S off Lowestoff when she {{encountered}} two French privateer luggers. During the chase one lost her main and foremast and struck. Cruizer continued in chase of the other until 5pm {{when it became clear}} that the quarry was gaining, and Wollaston was <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the lugger that had struck.

The two luggers had left Honfleur together and were going to cruise the Dogger Bank.|$|E
500|$|The {{track was}} refined with {{remixing}} and additional parts added on 20 January and 3 February. During the latter session, McCartney and Starr re-recorded their contributions on bass guitar and drums, respectively. Starr later highlighted his fills on the song as typical of an approach whereby [...] "I {{try to become}} an instrument; play {{the mood of the}} song. For example, 'Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire,' – boom ba bom. I try to show that; the disenchanting mood." [...] As on the 1966 track [...] "Rain", music journalist Ben Edmonds recognises Starr's playing as reflective of his empathy with Lennon's songwriting.

500|$|The sequel [...] was {{released}} in 1990 for the MSX2. It further evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor and introduced most of the gameplay elements present in Metal Gear Solid, including the three-dimensional element of height, allowing players to crouch and crawl into hiding spots and air ducts and underneath desks. The player could also distract guards by knocking on surfaces and use a radar to plan ahead. The enemies had improved AI, including a 45-degree field of vision, turning their heads left and right to see diagonally, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen (they were limited to a single screen in earlier games), and a three-phase security alarm (where reinforcements are called in to chase the intruder, then remain {{on the lookout for}} some time after <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the intruder, and then leave the area). The game also had a complex storyline and improved graphics.|$|E
500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the {{anti-globalisation}} rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, and I think a lot of our records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E
500|$|Like {{the whole}} town, the school Christmas pageant is {{stripped}} of all symbols of Christmas, {{and the children}} instead present a minimalist song and dance created by composer Philip Glass. The parents, astounded by how awful the pageant has turned out, begin blaming one another for destroying Christmas and a fight breaks out.

When all the children start believing, Mr. Hankey finally reveals himself to everyone and scolds them for <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the good things of Christmas and focusing on the bad.

500|$|Hipper {{turned his}} ships southward around 18:05 {{to fall back}} upon Scheer's {{advancing}} battleships and then reversed course five minutes later. Evan-Thomas turned northeast at around 18:06 and then made a slow turn to the southeast once he spotted the Grand Fleet. He first spotted the battleship , flagship of the 6th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron and thought she was leading the Grand Fleet as it deployed from cruising formation into line ahead. At 18:17 he realised that Marlborough was actually {{at the rear of}} the formation and he ordered a turn to the north to bring his squadron into line behind the Grand Fleet. This took some time and his ships had to slow down to [...] to avoid overrunning the 6th Division and blocking its fire. The 5th Battle Squadron concentrated their fire on the German battleships after <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the battlecruisers, with Barham opening fire at 18:14.

500|$|Bowen has {{described}} Tippett as [...] "a composer of our time", one who [...] engaged with the social, {{political and cultural}} issues of his day. [...] Arnold Whittall sees the music as embodying Tippett's philosophy of [...] "ultimately optimistic humanism". [...] Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works [...] to seek [...] "to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, {{while at the same}} time never <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the contemporary reality". The key early work in this respect is A Child of Our Time, of which Clarke writes: [...] "he words of the oratorio's closing ensemble, 'I would know my shadow and my light, So shall I at last be whole', have become canonical in commentary on Tippett... this [...] statement crystallizes an ethic, and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works". Sceptical critics such as the musicologist Derrick Puffett have argued that Tippett's craft as a composer was insufficient for him to deal adequately with the [...] task that he had set himself of [...] "transmut his personal and private agonies into... something universal and impersonal". Michael Kennedy has referred to Tippett's [...] "open‐eyed, even naive outlook on the world", while accepting the technical sophistication of his music. Others have acknowledged his creative ingenuity and his willingness to adopt whatever means or [...] techniques were necessary to fit his intentions.|$|E
500|$|Aerosmith's next {{album was}} even more successful. Pump, {{released}} in September 1989, featured three Top Ten singles: [...] "What It Takes", [...] "Janie's Got a Gun", and [...] "Love in an Elevator", {{as well as the}} Top 30 [...] "The Other Side", re-establishing the band as a serious musical force. Pump was a critical and commercial success, eventually selling 7 million copies, spawning several music videos that were in regular rotation on MTV, and achieving four-star ratings from major music magazines. Pump ranked as the fourth-bestselling album of 1990. The band also won its first Grammy in the category of Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, for [...] "Janie's Got a Gun". In addition, the video for [...] "Janie's Got a Gun" [...] won two Video Music Awards and was ranked as one of the 100 greatest videos of all time by Rolling Stone, MTV, and VH1. Like Permanent Vacation, Pump was produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who added production touches such as instrumental interludes that provided transitions between songs to give the album a more complete sound, as well as the Margarita Horns, who added horns to tracks such as [...] "Love in an Elevator" [...] and [...] "The Other Side". Rock critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that Pump [...] "revels in [...] without ever <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Aerosmith's dirty hard rock core", going on to say that, [...] "such ambition and successful musical eclectism make Pump rank with Toys in the Attic and Rocks." [...] The recording process for Pump was documented in the video The Making of Pump, which has since been re-released as a DVD. The music videos for the album's singles were featured on the release Things That Go Pump in the Night, which quickly went platinum.|$|E

On 17 July, the squadron outran and captured the British brig , rated as 18 guns but actually carrying 24. Rangers crew had observed the approaching French squadron from some distance, and Commander Charles Coote had ordered that once their capture was inevitable, the crew were to cause as much damage as possible to their vessel to deny its use to the French. So successful were these efforts that Allemand was forced to burn Ranger once her crew had been removed as prisoners of war. Allemand subsequently reached his first station, off The Lizard, the day after capturing Ranger. There he waited in vain for the fleet under Ganteaume, which had never departed Brest. Following his instructions, Allemand then sailed for the Bay of Biscay, where he was to meet the fleet under Villeneuve that had been ordered north to join with Ganteaume. He passed southwards during July {{and was in the}} region of Cape Finisterre on 22 July: later records show that he was close enough {{to the site of the}} Battle of Cape Finisterre to have participated in the engagement if he had been aware that it was under way. News of Allemand's presence reached Villeneuve early in August and on 5 August he despatched the frigate [...] in search of the Rochefort squadron. Didon was followed on 9 August by the main fleet, including 29 ships of the line and associated frigates and corvettes. Villeneuve passed up the Spanish coast, anchoring off the village of Zerez, near Ferrol, on 10 August and departing the following day in a west by northwest direction. On 13 August the fleet was spotted by the frigates [...] under Captain Edward Brace and [...] under Captain Thomas Dundas, who were forced to flee a French detachment sent in pursuit, <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the enemy on 14 August as Villeneuve's main force continued to the northwest.|$|E
