5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the <b>little</b> <b>brown</b> bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and {{the next two or}} three hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since <b>little</b> <b>brown</b> bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but <b>little</b> <b>brown</b> bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. <b>Little</b> <b>brown</b> bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
