40|$|High-frequency {{transverse}} vibration of stepped beams has attracted increasing attention in various industrial areas. For an n-step Timoshenko beam, the governing differential equations of {{transverse vibration}} {{have been well}} established {{in the literature on}} the basis of assembling classic Timoshenko beam equations for uniform beam segments. However, solving the governing differential equation has not been resolved well to date, manifested by a computational bottleneck: only the first k modes (k ≤ 12) are solvable for i-step (i ≥ 0) Timoshenko beams. This bottleneck diminishes the completeness of stepped Timoshenko beam theory. To address this problem, this study first reveals the root cause of the bottleneck in solving the governing differential equations for high-order modes, and then creates a sophisticated method, based on <b>local</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems,</b> that can overcome the bottleneck to accomplish high-order mode shapes of an n-step Timoshenko beam. The proposed method uses a set of <b>local</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> in place of the conventional global <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> to characterize the transverse vibration of an n-step Timoshenko beam. With the method, the <b>local</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> can simplify the frequency equation for the vibration of an n-step Timoshenko beam, making it possible to obtain high-order modes of the beam. The accuracy, capacity, and efficiency of the method based on <b>local</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> in acquiring high-order modes are corroborated using the well-known exact dynamic stiffness method underpinned by the Wittrick-Williams algorithm as a reference. Removal of the bottlenecks in solving the governing differential equations for high-order modes contributes usefully to the completeness of stepped Timoshenko beam theory.

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{evaluation of}} high-order modes of a uniform Euler-Bernoulli beam {{has been studied}} by reformatting the classical expression of mode shapes. That method, however, is inapplicable to a stepped beam due to the nonuniform expressions of the mode shape for each beam segment.
