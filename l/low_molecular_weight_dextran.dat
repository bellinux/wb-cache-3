The carbohydrate shell {{for each of}} these preparations is unique and is key in determining the various physicochemical properties, the metabolic pathway, and the immunogenicity of the iron-carbohydrate complex. As intravenous dextran can cause severe, antibody-mediated dextran-induced anaphylactic reactions (DIAR), {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore the potential of various intravenous iron preparations, non-dextran-based or dextran/dextran-based, to induce these reactions. An IgG-isotype mouse monoclonal anti-dextran antibody (5 E 7 H 3) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed to investigate the <b>dextran</b> antigenicity of <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> iron <b>dextran,</b> ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside 1000, ferric gluconate, iron sucrose and ferric carboxymaltose, as well as isomaltoside 1000, the isolated carbohydrate component of iron isomaltoside 1000. <b>Low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> iron <b>dextran,</b> as well as dextran-based ferumoxytol and iron isomaltoside 1000, reacted with 5 E 7 H 3, whereas ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose, sodium ferric gluconate, and isolated isomaltoside 1000 did not. Consistent results were obtained with reverse single radial immunodiffusion assay. The results strongly support the hypothesis that, while the carbohydrate alone (isomaltoside 1000) does not form immune complexes with anti-dextran antibodies, iron isomaltoside 1000 complex reacts with anti-dextran antibodies by forming multivalent immune complexes. Moreover, non-dextran based preparations, such as iron sucrose and ferric carboxymaltose, do not react with anti-dextran antibodies. This assay allows to assess the theoretical possibility of a substance to induce antibody-mediated DIARs. Nevertheless, as this is only one possible mechanism that may cause a hypersensitivity reaction, a broader set of assays will be required to get an understanding of the mechanisms that may lead to intravenous iron-induced hypersensitivity reactions...|$|R
40|$|Sunil BhandariDepartment of Renal Medicine, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals National Health Service Trust and Hull York Medical School, Kingston upon Hull, UKBackground: The {{clinical}} {{need to be}} able {{to administer}} high doses of intravenous iron conveniently as a rapid infusion has been addressed by the recent introduction of ferric carboxymaltose and subsequently iron isomaltoside 1000. Neither requires a test dose. The maximum dose of ferric carboxymaltose is 1000 mg. The maximum dose of iron isomaltoside 1000 is based on 20 mg/kg body weight without a specified ceiling dose, thereby increasing the scope of being able to achieve total iron repletion with a single infusion. This ability to give high doses of iron is important in the context of managing iron deficiency anemia, which is associated with a number of clinical conditions where demands for iron are high. It is also an important component of the strategy as an alternative to blood transfusion. Affordability is a key issue for health services. Recent price changes affecting iron sucrose and ferric carboxymaltose, plus modifications to the manufacturers&rsquo; prescribing information, have provoked this update. Methods: This study is a comparative analysis of the costs of acquiring and administering the newly available intravenous iron formulations against standard treatments in the hospital setting. The costs include the medication, nursing costs, equipment, and patient transportation. Three dosage levels (600 mg, 1000 mg, and 1600 mg) are considered. Results and conclusion: The traditional standard treatments, blood and iron sucrose, cost more than the alternative intravenous iron preparations across the dose spectrum and sensitivities. <b>Low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> iron <b>dextran</b> is the least expensive option at the 1600 mg dose level but has the caveat of a prolonged administration time and requirement for a test dose.

We demonstrated that CD 24 is selectively and strongly expressed in {{the cells of the}} epithelial attachment to the tooth and the epithelial lining of the diseased periodontal pocket and studies in vitro showed that CD 24 regulated expression of the epithelial intercellular adhesion protein E-cadherin. Results In the present study, the barrier function of oral epithelial cell monolayers to <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>dextran</b> was assayed {{as a model for the}} normal physiological function of the epithelial attachment to limit ingress of microbial products from oral microbial biofilms. Paracellular transfer of <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>dextran</b> across monolayers of oral epithelial cells was specifically decreased following incubation with anti-CD 24 peptide antibody whereas passage of dextran across the monolayer was increased following silencing of mRNA for CD 24. Changes in barrier function were related to the selective regulation of the genes encoding zonula occludens- 1, zonula occludens- 2 and occludin, proteins implicated in tight junctions. More particularly, enhanced barrier function was related to relocation of these proteins to the cell periphery, compatible with tight junctions. Conclusion CD 24 has the constitutive function of maintaining expression of selected genes encoding tight junction components associated with a marginal barrier function of epithelial monolayers. Activation by binding of an external ligand to CD 24 enhances this expression but is also effective in re-deployment of tight junction proteins that is aligned with enhanced intercellular barrier function. These results establish the potential of CD 24 to act as a potent regulator of the intercellular barrier function of epithelia in response to local microbial ecology. </p...|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} study on blood coagulation during profound hypothermia either by surface cooling or by extracorporeal circulation {{was made and}} the effect of hemodilution in the extracorporeal circulation was investigated. The result was summarized as follows; 1) Profound hypothermia by surface cooling caused decrease in the platelet count and reduction of its function. The count recovered to normal level soon after rewarming but the functional insufficiency remained longer even after the rewarming. The profound hypothermia for less than one hour gave no significant influence on clotting factors other than the platelet. 2) After the extracorporeal circulation alone, decrease in platelet count and the damage on clotting factors were generally observed, but they were temporary and recovered within 24 hours in nearly all cases. However, when the extracorporeal perfusion was prolonged, the disturbance in the first and the second phase in clotting mechanism were remarkable and persistent to result in voluminous postoperative hemorrhage. Hence, it is quite desirable that the extracorporeal perfusion is terminated within 2 hours after the start. 3) Most of the patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease were accompanied by abnormalities in vascular resistance, count and function of platelet and factors relating to blood coagulation. It is of clinical importance that postoperative augmentation of these abnormalities was not rare. 4) The hemodilution with <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>dextran,</b> modified by the author, was applied for the extracorporeal circulation to obtain profound hypothermia.

40|$|Vertical liquid columns {{containing}} <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>dextran</b> density gradients can be {{used for}} preparative lymphocyte electrophoresis on earth, in simulation of 0 gravity conditions. Another method that has been tested at 1 G, is the electrophoresis of lymphocytes in a upward direction in vertical columns. By both methods up to 10 to the 7 th power lymphocytes can be separated at one time in a 30 cm glass column of 8 mm inside diameter, at 12 v/cm, in 2 hours. Due to convection and sedimentation problems, the separation at 1 G is less than ideal, but it is expected that at 0 gravity electrophoresis will prove to be a uniquely powerful cell separation tool.

40|$|In a murine {{model of}} {{moderate}} childhood malnutrition {{we found that}} polynutrient deficiency led to a 4 – 5 -fold increase in early visceralization of L. donovani (3 days post-infection) following cutaneous infection and a 16 -fold decrease in lymph node barrier function (p, 0. 04 for all). To {{begin to understand the}} mechanistic basis for this malnutrition-related parasite dissemination we analyzed the cellularity, architecture, and function of the skin-draining lymph node. There was no difference in the localization of multiple cell populations in the lymph node of polynutrient deficient (PND) mice, but there was reduced cellularity with fewer CD 11 c+dendritic cells (DCs), fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), MOMA- 2 + macrophages, and CD 169 + subcapsular sinus macrophage (p, 0. 05 for all) compared to the well-nourished (WN) mice. The parasites were equally co-localized with DCs associated with the lymph node conduit network in the WN and PND mice, and were found in the high endothelial venule into which the conduits drain. When a fluorescent <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> (10 kD) <b>dextran</b> was delivered in the skin, there was greater efflux of the marker from the lymph node conduit system to the spleens of PN...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) theory and equipment has been made. Dextran is fractionated industrially by ethanol precipitation, {{which is a}} high energy intensive process. The aims of this work were to investigate the fractionation of dextran using UF and to compare the efficiency and costs of UF fractionation with ethanol fractionation. This work is the continuation of research conducted at Aston, which was concerned with the fractionation of dextran using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and hollow fibre UF membranes supplied by Amicon Ltd. Initial laboratory work centred on determining the most efficient make and configuration of membrane. UF membranes of the Millipore cassette configuration, and the DDS flat-sheet configuration, were examined for the fracationation of <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> (MW) <b>dextran.</b> When compared to Amicon membranes, these membranes {{were found to be}} inferior. DDS membranes of 25 000 and 50 000 MW cut-offs were shown to be capable of fractionating high MW dextran with the same efficiency as GPC. The Amicon membranes had an efficiency comparable to that of ethanol fractionation. To increase this efficiency a theoretical UF membrane cascade was adopted to utilize favourable characteristics encountered in batch mode membrane experiments. The four stage cascade used recycled permeates in a counter- current direction to retentate flow, and was operated 24 hours per day controlled by a computer. Using 5 000 MW cut-off membranes the cascade improved the batch efficiency by at least 10 % for a fractionation at 6 000 MW. Economic comparisons of ethanol fractionation, combined GPC and UF fractionation, and UF fractionation of dextran were undertaken. On an economic basis GPC was the best method for high MW dextran fractionation. When compared with a plant producing 100 tonnes pa of clinical dextran, by ethanol fractionation, a combined GPC and UF cascade fractionation could produce savings on operating costs and an increased dextran yield of 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Native dextran B 512 is a T-cell-independent (TI) antigen. By conjugating <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> (MW) <b>dextran</b> to protein, a T-cell-dependent (TD) {{response}} against dextran can be obtained. We {{have previously}} reported {{the effects of}} native dextran and two different protein-dextran conjugates on the immune system. While one type of conjugate induced an optimal TD response, the other conjugate ('suboptimal') evoked a response more similar to that induced by native dextran, i. e. with little immunoglobulin class switch and with a secondary response of similar magnitude to the primary response. In order to investigate if {{it was possible to}} augment the anti-dextran response we examined the effects of cholera toxin (CT) in our dextran model system. CT is a potent mucosal, as well as systemic, adjuvant with effects on T cells, B cells and antigen-presenting cells. We show that CT is a very efficient adjuvant for both the TD and TI forms of dextran. A major increase in IgM and IgG anti-dextran antibody production was detected after administration of CT together with the conjugates compared with a conventional alum adjuvant. The effect was most pronounced for the suboptimal TD conjugate. CT was also able partially to abrogate the unresponsiveness to dextran in the TI type 2 (TI- 2) non-responder strain CBA/N. CT was also found to be a very potent adjuvant for native dextran, secondary IgM levels were enhanced eightfold by the co-administration of CT. Furthermore CTB-Dx, which is a conjugate of the non-toxic part of CT and low MW, non-immunogenic dextran, elicited an anti-dextran response in nude mice. Collectively, our data show {{that it is possible to}} improve the immunogenicity of both TD and TI forms of a carbohydrate by co-administration of CT. This is indicative of two components of the adjuvant effect, one could enhance antigen presentation and costimulation of T cells and the other could have a direct stimulatory effect on B cells...|$|R

The authors have used a disposable oxygenator with <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>dextran</b> prime, along with moderate hypothermia, in a consecutive series of 15 patients operated upon for congenital and acquired heart lesions. In this consecutive series there has been one death and this could not be attributed to the perfusion technique but to the surgical procedure carried out.

Given the ability of iron to catalyze redox reactions, iron therapy {{can be associated with}} oxidative stress. The lung is uniquely susceptible to oxidative stress, and {{little is known about the}} effects of intravenous iron treatment in this organ. This study characterized changes in markers of oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammation in the lung of non-iron deficient, non-anemic rats treated with five weekly doses (40  mg iron per kg body <b>weight)</b> of <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> iron <b>dextran</b> (LMWID), iron sucrose (IS), ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), ferumoxytol (FMX), iron isomaltoside 1000 (IIM), or saline (control). Rats treated with LMWID, FMX, or IIM showed significant changes in most measures of oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and iron deposition compared to the saline-treated controls, with greatest changes in the LMWID treatment group. Increases in products of lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and protein nitrosation (nitrotyrosine) were consistent with increases in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, Cu,Zn-SOD, GPx), decreases in antioxidative capacity (reduced:oxidized GSH ratio), increased levels of transcription factors involved in the inflammatory pathway (NF-κB, HIF- 1 α), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL- 6), adhesion molecules (VCAM- 1), markers of macrophage infiltration (ED- 1), and iron deposition (Prussian blue, ferritin). Since changes in measured parameters in FCM- or IS-treated rats were generally modest, the results suggest that FCM and IS have a low propensity to induce lung inflammation. The relevance of these findings to clinical safety profiles of the tested intravenous iron products requires further investigation.

Parenteral iron is indicated for patients intolerant or unresponsive to oral iron or requiring rapid iron replenishment. This study evaluated differences {{in the cost of}} treating these patients with iron isomaltoside (Monofer®, IIM) relative to other intravenous iron formulations. Methods: A budget impact model was developed to evaluate the cost of using IIM relative to ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject®, FCM), <b>low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> iron <b>dextran</b> (Cosmofer®, LMWID), and iron sucrose (Venofer®, IS) in patients with IDA. To establish iron need, iron deficits were modeled using a simplified dosing table. The base case analysis was conducted over 1 year in patients with IDA with mean bodyweight of 82. 4 kg (SD 22. 5 kg) and hemoglobin levels of 9. 99 g/dL (SD 1. 03 g/dL) based on an analysis of patient characteristics in IDA trials. Costs were modeled using UK health care resource groups. Results: Using IIM required 1. 3 infusions to correct the mean iron deficit, compared with 1. 3, 1. 8, and 7. 7 with LMWID, FCM, and IS, respectively. Patients using IIM required multiple infusions in 35 % of cases, compared with 35 %, 77 %, and 100 % of patients with LMWID, FCM, and IS, respectively. Total costs were estimated to be GBP 451 per patient with IIM or LMWID, relative to GBP 594 with FCM (a GBP 143 or 24 % saving with IIM) or GBP 2, 600 with IS (a GBP 2, 149 or 83 % saving with IIM). Conclusion: Using IIM or LMWID in place of FCM or IS resulted in a marked {{reduction in the number of}} infusions required to correct iron deficits in patients with IDA. The reduction in infusions was accompanied by substantial reductions in cost relative to FCM and IS over 1 year.

40|$|Binding {{constants}} of the dextran-reactive BALB/c mouse IgA myeloma proteins W 3129 and QUPC 52 {{have been}} determined for {{each member of}} the isomaltose series of oligosaccharides and for methyl alphaDglucoside. Protein W 3129 has maximum complementarity for isomaltopentaose (IM 5) deltaf degrees = 7, 180 cal/mol) with 55 - 60 % of the total binding energy directed against methylalphaDglucoside. Protein QUPC 52 gives maximum binding with isomaltohexaose (IM 6) (deltaF degrees = - 5, 340 cal/mol) and has about 70 % of its total binding energy for isomaltotriose (IM 3), but at most only 5 % for isomaltose (IM 2) or methyl alphaDglucoside. Protein W 3129 precipitates with branched dextrans high in alpha (1 yields 6) linkages and reacts with but does not precipitate a synthetic alpha (1 yields 6) -linked linear dextran. Protein QUPC 52 precipitates both branched and linear dextrans. Thus, the immunodominant group for protein W 3129 is mimicked by methyl alphaDglucoside and this protein reacts exclusively at the terminal nonreducing ends of alpha (1 yields 6) -linked dextran chains. Protein QUPC 52 has an immunodominant group which is expressed by IM 3 but not smaller oligosaccharides and this protein can react at nonterminal locations along alpha (1 yields 6) - linked dextran chains. Precipitation of linear dextran seems to be a valid although not quantitative assay for antidextrans with nonterminal specificity. Quantitative precipitin reactions with branched and linear dextrans suggest that alpha (1 yields 6) -specific human antidextrans are mixtures of molecules having terminal and nonterminal specificities and that the fraction of each type can vary among individuals. Rabbit antisera against IM 3 or IM 6 coupled to bovine serum albumin also appear to contain antibodies with nonterminal specificity for dextran chains although a large fraction has terminal specificity. <b>Low</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> clinical <b>dextran</b> N- 150 N (congruent to 60, 000) reacted more like linear dextran than like its parent native-branched dextran B 512.

An appreciation of terminal and nonterminal specificities and of the different immunodominant structures in isomaltosyl chains has proven to be of a great value in understanding the immunochemical reactions of dextrans. Moreover, certain previous findings with fructosan-reactive mouse myeloma proteins and human antilevans (55, 84) also suggest terminal and nonterminal specificities for levan chains...|$|R
