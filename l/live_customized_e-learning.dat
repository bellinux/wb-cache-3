Higher education institutions (HEIs) can take part in this market by offering e-learning-based training and education customized {{to the needs of}} the corporate clients. There is, however, a variety of needs that should be taken into account to form sustainable e-learning courses and related training services for the students, and this implies that it is challenging to design <b>e-learning</b> deliverables <b>customized</b> for corporate clients. To succeed in developing holistic e-learning designs which cover most relevant requirements, participants representing different roles such as customer representatives, domain experts, pedagogues, technical experts, economists and market people, students, and people from the administration should be present in the design phase. Furthermore, these stakeholders should utilize modern computersupported cooperation, while they strive to produce high quality results in a time and cost effective manner. Concurrent design is an approach used to solve complex and interdisciplinary design issues in which interactions between different disciplines is essential to achieve optimal and comprehensive solution. This thesis considers the use of a concurrent design approach, when <b>customized</b> <b>e-learning</b> deliverables are designed and developed for corporate clients. It is a paper-based thesis which includes six scientific and peer-reviewed papers, besides four secondary papers that are not included in their entirety but only where general information is described. Aim: The overall research aim was to contribute with basic motivation, implementation experience, and requirements for practical realization, regarding methodological approaches for concurrent design of e-learning deliverables for corporate clients. The following research questions were answered: 1. Why should HEIs apply a concurrent design approach when they aim to deliver e-learning to corporate clients? 2. How should a concurrent design approach for the development of <b>customized</b> <b>e-learning</b> for corporate clients be materialized? That is to say, how should this approach initially be described, and how should it eventually be tested and evaluated? 3. What are the key requirements for a concurrent design approach to the design of <b>customized</b> <b>e-learning</b> for corporate clients? Methods: This study was inspired by design-based research, and various research methods that were suitable to answer the research questions faced as the project progressed, were utilized. This includes literature reviews, questionnaires, interviews, design science, action research, besides qualitative data analysis and coding of collected data. Contributions: The main contribution of this thesis is the concurrent design inspired methodological approach to the design of new e-learning solutions for corporate clients, which are customized to the current context and the project in question. The following contributions were identified: 1. Detected motivation and conditions for applying a concurrent design approach to the design of <b>customized</b> <b>e-learning</b> for corporate clients. 2. The concurrent e-learning design method; which includes a description of processes, roles, models, tools, a concurrent design facility, and an appropriate infrastructure. 3.

Today, however, the use of Grids has evolved to tackle new horizons such as managing large amounts of data and running business applications that support consumers and casual users. In particular, this evolution towards a general-purpose, Grid service-based infrastructure allows educational institutions to enhance e-learning technologies and innovate in e-learning experiences through the provision and mutualisation of various services. Grid technologies will likely become the Information and Communication Technologies backbone of tomorrow's elearning programmes due {{to their ability to}} handle and process data from a multitude of resources (i. e., sensors, data warehouses, etc.) and offer new learning experiences which do not exist without the Grid capabilities. To face these new challenges, we propose a service-oriented Grid architecture capable to deliver services {{that can be used in}} collaborative learning processes and virtual learning environments.

40|$|Abstract. Learning objects {{have changed}} the way {{computer-based}} instruction is viewed and used and have provided new opportunities for delivering <b>customized</b> and personalized <b>e-learning.</b> Since so far {{there are a lot}} of research and development efforts concerning the technical implementation of the learning object concept and the interest for the subsequent development of standards is very high. Nevertheless the learning object concept, as used in design and development of e-learning, has also instructional ‚Äì pedagogical value to offer. This paper discusses a research effort aiming to develop a webbased training service by stressing the instructional benefits of the learning object-based implementation. During this effort a certain strategy guided the whole design and development process while certain learning theories were associated to the learning strategy followed. The idea behind this association was to highlight the advantages from applying the learning object idea to create appealing e-learning courses for adult learners; advantages that are not directly related to any technological or standard implementation but contribute a lot to the pedagogical quality of an e-learning service which is usually underestimated or neglected. The main purpose of this effort was to prepare, structure and develop web-based courses and training materials in a way that would provide sound instructional benefits to the main recipients of such services: adult learners and trainees. ...|$|R

Two specific problems are crucial to promote sustainable online learning for the remote communities. First, presenting learning content may {{not be sufficient to}} help students to improve their learning as they are not competent to make meaning from the information presented. Second, students are often not competent to articulate information from different perspectives or discuss complex issue. The author investigated whether Knowledge Management (KM) processes, e-learning Principles and Human factors engineering will promote meaningful learning and consequently sustainable online learning for the remote community. The contributions are in five aspects: (i) instructional design of learning activities especially role playing (ii) design of learning content, (iii) design of hint-based teaching-learning strategies to scaffold learning and (iv) design of technology-enhanced collaborative learning and (v) the design and development of an integrated systematic web and system usability evaluation format to help with the design and development of usability-efficient and usability-effective learning activities and consequently, learner-centered, learner effective and cost effective solution.

Recently it has been found, in many systems (e. g. gut, neurons, and hematopoietic stem cells), that the self-renewal and differentiation balance is maintained when the stem cells divide asymmetrically. Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs), {{one of the best}} characterized model systems with well-defined stem cell niches, were reported to divide asymmetrically, where centrosome plays an important role. Utilizing time-lapse <b>live</b> cell imaging, <b>customized</b> tracking, and image processing programs, we found that most acentrosomal GSCs have the spectrosomes reposition from the basal end (wild type) to the apical end close to hub-GSC interface (acentrosomal GSCs). In addition, these apically positioned spectrosomes were mostly stationary while the basally positioned spectrosomes were mobile. For acentrosomal GSCs, their mitotic spindles were still highly oriented and divided asymmetrically with longer mitosis duration, resulting in asymmetric divisions. Moreover, when the spectrosome was knocked out, the centrosomes velocity decreased and centrosomes located closer to hub-GSC interface. We propose that in male GSCs, the spectrosome recruited to the apical end plays a complimentary role in ensuring proper spindle orientation when centrosome function is compromised...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Virtual {{screening}} of small molecules using molecular docking {{has become an}} important tool in drug discovery. However, large scale virtual screening is time demanding and usually requires dedicated computer clusters. There {{are a number of}} software tools that perform virtual screening using AutoDock 4 but they require access to dedicated Linux computer clusters. Also no software is available for performing virtual screening with Vina using computer clusters. In this paper we present MOLA, an easy-to-use graphical user interface tool that automates parallel virtual screening using AutoDock 4 and/or Vina in bootable non-dedicated computer clusters. Implementation MOLA automates several tasks including: ligand preparation, parallel AutoDock 4 /Vina jobs distribution and result analysis. When the virtual screening project finishes, an open-office spreadsheet file opens with the ligands ranked by binding energy and distance to the active site. All results files can automatically be recorded on an USB-flash drive or on the hard-disk drive using VirtualBox. MOLA works inside a <b>customized</b> <b>Live</b> CD GNU/Linux operating system, developed by us, that bypass the original operating system installed on the computers used in the cluster. This operating system boots from a CD on the master node and then clusters other computers as slave nodes via ethernet connections. Conclusion MOLA is an ideal virtual screening tool for non-experienced users, with a limited number of multi-platform heterogeneous computers available and no access to dedicated Linux computer clusters. When a virtual screening project finishes, the computers can just be restarted to their original operating system. The originality of MOLA lies on the fact that, any platform-independent computer available can he added to the cluster, without ever using the computer hard-disk drive and without interfering with the installed operating system. With a cluster of 10 processors, and a potential maximum speed-up of 10 x, the parallel algorithm of MOLA performed with a speed-up of 8, 64 √ó using AutoDock 4 and 8, 60 √ó using Vina. </p...|$|R
