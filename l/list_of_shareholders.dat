25|$|Measures {{were taken}} to seek {{parliamentary}} authority in 1846 but before the Bill was presented the GNoSR was created. A decision was taken that the two railways would connect at Elgin and the Morayshire Railway would connect its Speyside line to Craigellachie at Orton. The company's capital was agreed at £50,000. Parliamentary approval for this scheme were obtained on 10 July 1846 but financial panic gripped the United Kingdom in 1847 and the entire project was shelved. An internal crisis developed within the company following a change of some the directors. The board declared that powers would be requested to abandon plans for the Craigellachie extension as {{there was no sign}} of the GNoSR starting their scheme. Some Edinburgh based shareholders—with the financial upheaval of the previous few years feared that the entire project was no longer viable—attempted to get the entire railway cancelled at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held on 24 February 1851 using the Abandonment of Railways Act, 1850. This motion was carried by 1800 shares to 677. Provost Grant suspected that due processes had not been observed and protested to the Railway Commissioners who on 21 March 1851 called for a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> who had attended the abandonment EGM—the Commissioners found that the necessary shares owned by those attending were insufficient for an abandonment. The Edinburgh shareholders withdrew their support placing the company in a critical position. The Railway Commissioners granted the abandonment of the Craigellachie section on 10 July and agreed that the capital of the company be reduced to £29,700. However, it was not until Elgin Town Council agreed to invest £1,000 in shares and Colonel Brander of Pitgaveny made a large addition to his already substantial holding that the contract for the Elgin to Lossiemouth section was placed.|$|E

The whole business has a very ugly look, though what the motive of this secrecy was, or why Brander should be willing to allow, if not to assist, in my father's ruin is more than I can conceive.

60|$|Then {{there is}} another rule for making journalism honest on which I should like to insist absolutely. I should {{like it to be}} a fixed thing that the name of the {{proprietor}} as well as the editor should be printed upon every paper. If the paper is owned by shareholders, let there be a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders.</b> If (as is far more common in this singularly undemocratic age) it is owned by one man, let that one man's name be printed on the paper, if possible in large red letters. Then, if there are any obvious interests being served, we shall know that they are being served. My friends in Manchester are in a terrible state of excitement about the power of brewers and the dangers of admitting them to public office. But at least, if a man has controlled politics through beer, people generally know it: the subject of beer is too fascinating for any one to miss such personal peculiarities. But a man may control politics through journalism, and no ordinary English citizen know that he is controlling them at all. Again and again in the lists of Birthday Honours you and I have seen some Mr. Robinson suddenly elevated to the Peerage without any apparent reason. Even the Society papers (which we read with avidity) could tell us nothing about him except that he was a sportsman or a kind landlord, or interested in the breeding of badgers. Now I should like the name of that Mr. Robinson to be already familiar to the British public. I should like them to know already the public services for which they have to thank him. I should like them to have seen the name already on the outside of that organ of public opinion called Tootsie's Tips, or The Boy Blackmailer, or Nosey Knows, that bright little financial paper which did so much for the Empire and which so narrowly escaped a criminal prosecution. If they had seen it thus, they would estimate more truly and tenderly the full value of the statement in the Society paper that he is a true gentleman and a sound Churchman.|$|E

40|$|As complex {{networks}} in economics, we consider Japanese shareholding networks as they existed in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2003. In this study, we use as data <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> for companies <b>listed</b> {{on the stock}} market or on the over-the-counter market. The lengths <b>of</b> the <b>shareholder</b> <b>lists</b> vary with the companies, and we use lists for the top 20 shareholders. We represent these shareholding networks as a directed graph by drawing arrows from shareholders to stock corporations. Consequently, the distribution of incoming edges has an upper bound, while that of outgoing edges has no bound. This representation shows that for all years the distributions of outgoing degrees can be well explained by the power law function with an exponential tail. The exponent depends on the year and the country, while the power law shape is maintained universally. We show that the exponent strongly correlates with the long-term shareholding rate and the cross-shareholding rate.

Rubin was born in Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1893, the second of seven children. He attended public school in Brooklyn but left before completing high school to join his father's paper-box manufacturing business. In 1917-19 he served in the American Expeditionary Force in France. Until 1935 he worked alongside his younger brother, William, in their father's business. When the Rubins learned that Sweets Co., one of their major customers, was in serious difficulty, they became interested in acquiring control of the company.

The Oshawa Manufacturing Co. was eventually {{taken over by the}} Joseph Hall Works in 1857. In 1862, the Cedar Dale Works was built after being in a rented space in the Hall Works for two years, building scythes and hoes. With the building of the firm, the village of Cedar Dale was established. In 1867, the firm became Whiting and Cowan when John Cowan bought into the company. After the death of Whiting in 1867, his son-in-law, R. S. Hamlin headed the company. By 1872, it became the A. S. Whiting Manufacturing Co. when Cowan withdrew from the business. Before Whiting’s death, the company had been profitable but due to new machinery being developed, hand tools were becoming obsolete and the business only lasted for a few more years (source: Oshawa Community Museum and Archives Web site).

5000|$|The {{directors}} {{set up a}} sub-committee to {{look into}} allegations of mismanagement, but before it could report the financial management of the company was attacked at the half-yearly shareholders' meeting. It emerged {{that there was no}} <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> meeting the requirements of Parliament, nor was there any independent audit of accounts (they were looked over by a company director, who also acted as a solicitor for the company, although not officially the company solicitor). Two representatives of Newcastle shareholders attended, complaining that shares had been sold in Newcastle by the company at a premium on the assurance of its representative (the solicitor-cum-director) that a dividend of 8% was to be expected; a dividend of 4% had then been declared and this was partly funded by the premium on the shares sold. The company secretary was not an efficient officer - [...] "the time was come when some one ought to be {{at the head of the}} Company who is competent to manage its affairs". The chairman of the sub-committee whilst refusing to go into detail ahead of the submission of their report confirmed that they were satisfied that [...] "it was most essential and important that there should be a thorough change in everything connected with the Company" [...] The Railway Chronicle editorialised that [...] "the conduct of the board ... was a specimen of everything that a business-like management could avoid"; the company secretary (who had also been acting as its engineer) was dismissed and a committee of five directors set up to more closely supervise the operation of the railway. The next shareholders' meeting in February 1847 was told there was no immediate prospect of a dividend being paid (interest payments on the company's borrowings, and the running costs of the railway ate up in almost equal measure the operational receipts); the meeting then voted to explore the possibility of amalgamation with the Newcastle and Carlisle or the Lancaster and Carlisle railways. The Newcastle and Carlisle offered to lease the line, paying 5% a year on M&C shares, but negotiations lapsed: matters had improved for the M&C, which found itself able to pay a 3% a year dividend. [...] Results for the first half of 1848, however, showed the M&C to be running at a loss : receipts were down 20% and interest payments were higher; it was therefore resolved to negotiate the leasing of the line by George Hudson, [...] the Railway King and chairman of numerous railway companies chiefly in the east of the country. Hudson proposed a lease of the line by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway from 1 October 1848, matching a lease just taken by Hudson personally of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway. He guaranteed the M&CR a dividend of 4%. The offer was accepted by a shareholders' meeting from which the press were excluded.|$|E

40|$|The International Accounting Standards require {{entities}} {{to report}} useful and accurate information, enabling shareholders {{and others to}} make informed investment decisions. This research investigates the array of factors that influence the investment decision-making of shareholders in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The research employed a mixed research methodology that combines quantitative and a qualitative analysis to obtain empirical data on the factors that impact on Thai shareholders investing in large asset-based industries in the SET. Data were collected from shareholders who invested in 204 listed companies within three industries: namely, Resources; Industrials; and Property and Construction. The Department of Business Development (DBD) provided the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Multiple responses and cross tabulations were used to analyse the survey data to determine the association between seven variables (factors) that influenced the decision-making of shareholders. Furthermore, the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney Tests were used to analyse the possible influence of age, gender, and education on the investment decisions of the Thai shareholders. The quantitative survey, involved 121 respondents which represented 28. 81 per cent of the possible informants who received the survey through the post. The qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} ten randomly-selected shareholders from lists of shareholders of specific large asset-based industries in Thailand, as provided by the Department of Business Development (DBD). Interview findings were {{used in the present study}} to substantiate the questionnaire in term of its question and findings. The findings show that the sources of information that shareholders rated as most important when making investment decisions ranked as follows. Financial statements, both income statements and balance sheets were number on; relevance and reliability of accounting information ranked second; the reputation of audit firms and managing directors followed; and then financial/investment opinions from stockbrokers, financial advisors and the media; and financial reports prepared in accordance with the impairment of assets standard (IAS 36). The results of this study contribute towards achieving a greater understanding of individual Thai shareholders&rsquo; use of accounting information in company financial statements when making their investment decisions in the Stock Exchange of Thailand. This research makes a unique contribution through gauging the importance that Thai investors place on certain sources and forms of information when buying, selling, and holding in their share-trading decision processes. The research adds to the extant body of knowledge in two key ways. Firstly, the decision-making processes of Thai shareholders have not been researched previously. Secondly, a major finding of this research was the importance which the majority of investors placed on the Impairment of Assets Standard...|$|E
