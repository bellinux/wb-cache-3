30|$|For this analysis, we {{exploit the}} {{longitudinal}} {{nature of the}} Young <b>Lives</b> <b>data,</b> a unique individual-level panel following a cohort of about 700 children in Peru over four rounds of data collection that took place between 2002 and 2013. The Young <b>Lives</b> <b>data</b> cover a critical phase of the life-cycle for human capital and skills accumulation following the same children between ages 8 and 19. Information {{on a number of}} risky behaviours are collected at the age of 15 and 19 which makes the Young <b>Lives</b> <b>data</b> particularly suitable for this analysis. Furthermore, rich information both at the household and individual level are collected which include children’s cognitive and psychosocial competencies, school history, parental and children’s aspirations and aspirations for education. 2 Based on the data available, we define indicators to measure the prevalence of (i) smoking behaviours; (ii) drinking behaviours; (iii) drinking and violence (engaging in violent or risky activities when drunk); (iv) consumption of illegal drugs; (v) criminal behaviours; (vi) possession of weapons; (vii) unprotected sex; and (viii) total number of risky and criminal behaviours.|$|R

25|$|Intelligent {{transport}} systems vary in technologies applied, from basic management {{systems such as}} car navigation; traffic signal control systems; container management systems; variable message signs; automatic number plate recognition or speed cameras to monitor applications, such as security CCTV systems; and to more advanced applications that integrate <b>live</b> <b>data</b> and feedback {{from a number of}} other sources, such as parking guidance and information systems; weather information; bridge de-icing (US deicing) systems; and the like. Additionally, predictive techniques are being developed to allow advanced modelling and comparison with historical baseline data. Some of these technologies are described in the following sections.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant {{that even in the}} most remote areas storm chasers still had a <b>live</b> <b>data</b> feed. The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true vector format with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{consumption and}} wealth levels using the Young <b>Lives</b> <b>data.</b> The {{purpose is to}} describe {{the context in which}} children are growing up, and therefore also to understand some of the opportunities children and young people will have as they grow older. The national pictures show economic growth and absolute poverty reduction after 2000 but a more mixed picture of national income inequality levels rising in Vietnam and India, and falling somewhat in Peru and Ethiopia. Analysis of Young <b>Lives</b> <b>data</b> shows that these GDP increases are associated with wealth and consumption growth in the Young Lives sample. Disaggregating the change {{in a number of different}} ways reveals that, although consumption and wealth levels tend to be rising for different groups of children, those with already higher levels of consumption have tended to gain the most. We add to this with exploratory analysis of specific geographic communities, demonstrating how they have changed...|$|R

2500|$|Resilver (repair) of a crashed disk in a ZFS RAID {{can take}} a long time (this is not unique to ZFS, it applies to all types of RAID, in one way or another). This means that very large volumes can take several days to repair or to being back to full {{redundancy}} after severe data corruption or failure, and during this time a second disk failure may occur, especially as the repair puts additional stress on the system as a whole. In turn this means that configurations that only allow for recovery of a single disk failure, such as RAIDZ1 (similar to RAID5) should be avoided. Therefore, with large disks, one should use RAIDZ2 (allow two disks to crash) or RAIDZ3 (allow three disks to crash). [...] It should be noted however, that ZFS RAID differs from conventional RAID by only reconstructing <b>live</b> <b>data</b> and metadata when replacing a disk, not the entirety of the disk including blank and garbage blocks, which means that replacing a member disk on a ZFS pool that is only partially full will take considerably less time compared to conventional RAID.|$|E
