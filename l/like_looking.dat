500|$|In February 2006, Dan Ford, from Wareham in Dorset, {{received}} permanent scarring to {{his face}} after being sprayed with CS during an arrest by police. Ford was subsequently advised by doctors {{to stay out of}} sunlight for at least 12 months. After the incident, his cousin, Donna Lewis, was quoted as saying, [...] "To look at him, it was <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> at a melting man, with liquid oozing from his face." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Shaw, the {{colliery}} manager, was on {{the surface}} and the remaining shift foremen were still underground and unable to give assistance. He took charge and descended the York shaft, accompanied by overman D R Thomas. The descent was slow, and they had to clear several girders and obstructions before they reached the bottom. They found that the men from {{the east side of the}} workings (approximately 450 workers) were unharmed, and their evacuation was ordered. Shaw and Thomas moved to the western side, where they found other men, alive but injured, and arranged for them to travel to the surface. Thomas later reported that the view into the western workings [...] "was exactly <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> into a furnace".|$|E
500|$|In a February 21, 2015 {{interview}} with Billboard, Violent J stated that Mike E. Clark {{will not be}} producing either album due to prior engagements, which include working with Kid Rock, so they will have other people do the production. He also said that [...] "LOST" [...] will have darker beats, and no comedy on it. The album is <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> at the world through negative lenses. He said that [...] "FOUND" [...] is like you have been found, and has songs about the good times, and songs with comedy. Also in the interview {{it was announced that}} the [...] "20th Anniversary Riddle Box Tour" [...] has been temporarily sidelined. They plan to tour in early spring into most of the summer, ending at the GOTJ 2015, then tour again ending at the annual Hallowicked concert.|$|E

500|$|Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Here I Stand" [...] {{a throwback}} to Stevie Wonder, and was {{disappointed}} that it was placed {{near the end of}} the parent album. USA Today Steve Jones noted the track as a highlight of the album. Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club wrote that the song [...] "lyrically and musically sounds more passionate and more adult than Usher ever has," [...] and called it a [...] "syrupy ballad". However, Blender Josh Eells called the [...] "chivalrous" [...] number [...] "sweet but taxing, <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> at photos from someone else’s wedding," [...] while Jim Farber of the Daily News wrote that [...] "the [...] melody fails [...]" [...] The song ranked at number one on AOL Radio's list of top Usher songs. At the 51st Grammy Awards, [...] "Here I Stand" [...] was nominated for the Best Male R Vocal Performance award, but lost to Ne-Yo's [...] "Miss Independent" [...] from his 2008 album, Year of the Gentleman.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{were pleased}} with the game's premise and setting, {{variously}} describing it as [...] "weird", [...] "wacky" [...] and [...] "silly". [...] Hope Falls, especially the area of Creepy Hollow, was compared {{to the work of}} Tim Burton. [...] Dead Head Fred's graphics were warmly received, with GameSpy noting [...] "The game looks simply phenomenal on the PSP screen." [...] Pocket Gamer UK said [...] "graphically the game won't blow your head off but it is undeniably stylish." [...] Pocket Gamer also felt that the game's level design, with its emphasis on changing heads to solve environmental puzzles, made up for the [...] "mediocre combat system". [...] The character design was praised; GameSpy said [...] "Fred {{is one of the most}} interesting and entertaining characters to ever hit gaming," [...] and GameZone said [...] "Fred’s freakish form is <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> at a car crash … you really don’t want to stare but you just can’t help it." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the US, and said of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest {{a different point of}} view. It's <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought – assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Chelsea Girl is well-regarded {{by music}} critics, Nico was {{dissatisfied}} with it: [...] "The first time I heard the album, I cried. I still cannot listen to it, because everything I wanted for that record, {{they took it}} away." [...] Jim Morrison, whom Nico later called [...] " [...] soul brother", encouraged her to write her own songs; this was [...] "a key breakthrough for [...] ". They were together in California in July and August 1967, often driving into the desert and experimenting with peyote. Morrison, who encouraged Nico to write down her dreams, read Mary Shelley, William Blake and Samuel Taylor Coleridge to her. He recorded his chemical visions and dreams, using the material for his songs as he imagined the opium-addicted Coleridge had worked. In 1986 Nico said, [...] "He taught me to write songs. I never thought that I could... He really inspired me a lot. It was <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> in a mirror then." [...] She began writing her own material and performing it to an intimate audience at Steve Paul's club, the Scene. Nico composed her music on a harmonium bought, according to Richard Witts, from a San Francisco hippie; manager Danny Fields recalled, [...] "I think Leonard Cohen may have given it to her, or {{had something to do}} with her getting it." [...] With that instrument, [...] "she discovered not only her own artistic voice but a whole new realm of sound." [...] The droning pump organ became her trademark.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: [...] "e felt like happiness is something everyone strives to have, and sometimes it's not just about being happy, but if you have obstacles in your life that you have to get over to be happy. And it's just about that striving to get there. t was kind of <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> back at all of the things I've been through, just kind of putting that into the song." [...] The song was released with two B-sides: [...] "Let It Rain" [...] in Europe and Japan, and [...] "Fly Here Now", only in Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Kiyohiko Koike for Listenmusic {{felt the}} song was an [...] "aggressive number erupting all the band member's fervour" [...] created by aspects such as the [...] "quick beat, {{growling}} bass line and Ringo's freaky passionate voice". He felt {{the song was}} not a song you could call a single feeling it had an [...] "eccentric spirit of adventure", but praised Sheena {{being used as a}} resource by her bandmates in the production of a song, and felt that the [...] "mental aspects" [...] of the band had evolved. Hot Express reviewer Tetsuo Hiraga praised Sheena's [...] "charming" [...] vocals in the song, and felt as if the song were exploding from every direction. He believed that this [...] "broken" [...] Sheena had not been seen in her previous works before. CDJournal reviewers noted the song's structure, describing it as [...] "developing into a constantly changing song, as if many songs were in a single song." [...] Reviewer Naoko Saito was very positive on the song, praising the [...] "exploding tricky band sound", calling the song [...] "full of thrills and excitement, <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> at something you shouldn't be". What's In? reviewers called the song a [...] "wild rock tune", noting its [...] "bewildering structure".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there and I knew what she was like but when I saw Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E
