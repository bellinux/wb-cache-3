30|$|Gateway vehicle {{selection}} and management is the prominent {{issue in the}} mechanism of multi-hop relay based on the Integrated VANET-cellular networks Heterogeneous Wireless Network. This {{is due to the}} non-similarity characteristics in vehicles, which lead to inability of the gateway to access. To solve this problem, one of the proposed solutions is to assemble them in groups (clusters) based on vehicles with similar characteristics and elect a cluster head (CH) for each group (cluster), which becomes the gateway node. Vehicle clustering is promising to resolve this issue, where cluster-head selection depends only on the geographical <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In consequence, the cluster head of the cluster does not have the basic standards to manage the VANET groups, so that it enables them to connect with the cellular network.|$|E

Cameras typically used in these systems are characterized by relatively low dynamic range which is only a fragment of the dynamic range of the human eye. In order {{to adapt to the}} lighting conditions the cameras feature dyna-mic changes of the gain and exposure. For vehicles there is a very wide range of the observed brightness of details because of the variety of vehicles ’ colors and the presence of elements reflecting light in different ways, as well as changing lighting conditions. This means that even if the camera is able to capture the relevant dynamic range, there is a restriction of the distinguishability of details, which is essential in the process of detecting the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The use of HDR imaging techniques based on various expo-sures helps to increase the dynamic range and improves the accuracy of vehicles ’ positions estimation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Vehicle-to-vehicle {{communications}} via dedicated-short-range-communication (DSRC) devices {{will enable}} safety {{applications such as}} cooperative collision warning. These devices use the IEEE 802. 11 p standard to support low-latency vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. How-ever, a major challenge for the cooperative collision warning is to accurately determine the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In this paper, we present a novel cooperative-vehicle-position-estimation algorithm which can achieve a higher accuracy and more reliability than the existing global-positioning-system-based positioning solutions by making use of intervehicle-distance measurements taken by a radio-ranging technique. Our algorithm uses signal-strength-based intervehicle-distance measurements, vehicle kinematics, and road maps to estimate the relative positions of vehicles in a cluster. We have analyzed our algorithm by examining its per-formance-bound, computational-complexity, and communication-overhead requirements.

40|$|For roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) ships, when {{transporting}} {{more cars}} {{within the same}} deck area on board, {{it is necessary to}} adjust or take away the current lashing system. Furthermore, this operation may also decrease the cost and time of operation as well as cargo damages due to lashing. This requirement, combined with the safety consideration on cargo shifting, may lead to concepts of lashing-free deck design. One of the lashing-free concepts suggests that in some conditions cars can be secured without using lashings, mainly depending on the friction between the tire and the deck without lashings. By doing a series of parametric studies of vehicle securing without lashings under roll and pitch motions, {{it was found that the}} value of the maximum required friction coefficient between the tires and the deck is highly relevant to the roll and pitch amplitude, pitch period, orientation of vehicles on decks, and the vertical <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> from the baseline of the vessel...|$|E

In this paper we propose a method for identifying the pose and location of objects with circular protrusions in three dimensions from a single image and a 3 d representation or model of the object of interest.

We find that in such environments the mobility <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> are well patterned {{which can be used}} to predict the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vehicles</b> in a large degree of accuracy. We use the real trace collected from more than 4, 000 taxies at Shanghai over 6 [*]months to identify the VMP by VOM model scheme. By taking the advantage of VMP, we propose PSR. In PSR, the disseminated state information carries vehicular node’s current state and the predictive states. As the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> can be accurately predicted, a large amount of control overhead can be saved. The results show that PSR outperforms existing state-of-art designs in terms of control overhead while retaining high data packet delivery ratio and low delay, at the cost of a little longer average path length. Under certain scenarios, the control overhead can be reduced by 90 % compared with DSR, and 75 % compared with WSR.|$|R
