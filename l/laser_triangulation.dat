5000|$|The next {{generation}} of scanning, known as noncontact scanning includes high speed <b>laser</b> single point <b>triangulation,</b> <b>laser</b> line scanning, and white light scanning, is advancing very quickly. This method uses either laser beams or white light that are projected against {{the surface of the}} part. Many thousands of points can then be taken and used to not only check size and position, but to create a 3D image of the part as well. This [...] "point-cloud data" [...] can then be transferred to CAD software to create a working 3D model of the part. These optical scanners are often used on soft or delicate parts or to facilitate reverse engineering.|$|R

50|$|The TriDAR sensor is {{a hybrid}} 3D camera that {{combines}} auto-synchronous <b>laser</b> <b>triangulation</b> technology with laser radar (LIDAR) {{in a single}} optical package. This configuration {{takes advantage of the}} complementary nature of these two imaging technologies to provide 3D data at both short and long range without compromising on performance. The <b>laser</b> <b>triangulation</b> subsystem is largely based on the Laser Camera System (LCS) used to inspect the Space Shuttle's thermal protection system after each launch. By multiplexing the two active subsystem's optical paths, the TriDAR can provide the functionalities of two 3D scanners into a compact package. The subsystems also share the same control and processing electronics thus providing further savings compared to using two separate 3D sensors. A thermal imager is also included to extend the range of the system beyond the LIDAR operating range.|$|E

30|$|Considering the {{classification}} of the laser devices {{in the field of}} conservation science reported by Pezzati [24], our apparatus is at <b>triangulation</b> <b>laser</b> system based on single-point-projection [25], whereas the most of the reported systems are generally based on surface or line detection, our laser sensor is based on single point measurement. Specifically, here we plan to scan the surface of historical canvas paintings by means of a <b>triangulation</b> <b>laser</b> sensor mobilized via an XY robot. The apparatus allows to perform the scanning of a generic surface with medium accuracy (inaccuracy <± 50  μm). The resolution is obtained at a relatively low cost, but with a slow scanning speed, and it is mainly determined by the spatial reproducibility of the positioning system.|$|R

50|$|In 1999, two {{different}} research groups started scanning Michelangelo's statues. Stanford University {{with a group}} led by Marc Levoy used a custom <b>laser</b> <b>triangulation</b> scanner built by Cyberware to scan Michelangelo's statues in Florence, notably the David, the Prigioni and the four statues in The Medici Chapel. The scans produced a data point density of one sample per 0.25 mm, detailed enough to see Michelangelo's chisel marks. These detailed scans produced {{a large amount of}} data (up to 32 gigabytes) and processing the data from his scans took 5 months. Approximately in the same period a research group from IBM, led by H. Rushmeier and F. Bernardini scanned the Pietà of Florence acquiring both geometric and colour details. The digital model, result of the Stanford scanning campaign, was thoroughly used in the 2004 subsequent restoration of the statue.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} {{methods for}} extracting range data from optical triangulation scanners are accurate only for planar objects of uniform reflectance illuminated by an incoherent source. Using these methods, curved surfaces, discontinuous surfaces, and surfaces of varying reflectance cause systematic distortions {{of the range}} data. Coherent light sources such as lasers introduce speckle artifacts that further degrade the data. We present a new ranging method based on analyzing the time evolution of the structured light reflections. Using our spacetime analysis, we can correct {{for each of these}} artifacts, thereby attaining significantly higher accuracy using existing technology. We present results that demonstrate the validity of our method using a commercial <b>laser</b> stripe <b>triangulation</b> scanner. ...|$|R

A new system which uniquely combines two fundamen-tal measurement techniques [...] eddy current position sensing, and <b>laser</b> optical <b>triangulation</b> [...] was designed. This Automated Coating Inspection System has been developed to replace manual inspection of the Thermal Protection System (TPS) on the External Tank (ET) of the Space Shuttle. The ET is a disposable fuel tank, 155 feet long and 28 feet in diameter.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{comparing}} 3D data against a CAD model {{is referred to}} as CAD-Compare, and can be a useful technique for applications such as determining wear patterns on moulds and tooling, determining accuracy of final build, analysing gap and flush, or analysing highly complex sculpted surfaces. At present, <b>laser</b> <b>triangulation</b> scanners, structured light and contact scanning are the predominant technologies employed for industrial purposes, with contact scanning remaining the slowest, but overall most accurate option. Nevertheless, 3D scanning technology offers distinct advantages compared to traditional touch probe measurements. White-light or laser scanners accurately digitize objects all around, capturing fine details and freeform surfaces without reference points or spray. The entire surface is covered at record speed without the risk of damaging the part. Graphic comparison charts illustrate geometric deviations of full object level, providing deeper insights into potential causes.|$|E

The sensitivities of non-linearity to the design variables are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{scanning}} is {{a widespread}} methodology of visualizing the natural environment and the manmade structures that exist in it. Laser scanners accomplish to digitalize our reality by making highly accurate measurements. Using these measurements they create a set of points in 3 D space which is called point cloud and depicts an entire area or object or parts of them. <b>Triangulation</b> <b>laser</b> scanners use the triangle theories and they mainly are used to visualize handheld objects at a very close range from them. In many cases, users of such devices take for granted the accuracy specifications provided by laser scanner manufacturers and respective software and for many applications this is enough. In this paper we use point clouds, collected by a <b>triangulation</b> <b>laser</b> scanner under a repetition method, of two cubes that are geometrically similar to each other but differ in material. At first, the data of each repetition are being compared to each other to examine {{the consistency of the}} scanner under multiple measurements of the same scene. Then, the reconstruction of the objects‟ geometry is achieved and the results are being compared to the data derived by a digital caliper. The errors of calculated dimensions were estimated by the use of error propagation law...|$|R
40|$|The {{dichotomy}} between detail representation and data management {{is still a}} big issue {{in the context of}} the acquisition and visualization of 3 D objects, especially in the field of Cultural Heritage. New technologies give the possibility to acquire very detailed geometry, but very often it’s very hard to process the amount of data produced. In this paper we present a project which aimed at virtually reconstructing the impressive (7 x 11 m.) portal of the Ripoll Monastery, Spain. The monument was acquired using <b>triangulation</b> <b>laser</b> scanning technology, producing a dataset of more than 2000 range maps for a total of more than 1 billion triangles. All the steps of the entire project are described, from the acquisition planning to the final setup for the dissemination to the public. In particular, we show how timeof-flight laser scanning data can be used to obtain a speed up in the alignment process, and how, after model creation and imperfections repairing, an interactive and immersive setup gives the public the possibility to navigate and visualize the high detail representation of the portal. This paper shows that, after careful planning and with the aim of new algorithms, it’s now possible to preserve and visualize the highly detailed information provided by <b>triangulation</b> <b>laser</b> scanning also for very large surfaces. 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>Triangulation</b> based 3D <b>laser</b> {{scanners}} {{are also}} active scanners that use laser light {{to probe the}} environment. With respect to time-of-flight 3D <b>laser</b> scanner the <b>triangulation</b> <b>laser</b> shines a laser on the subject and exploits a camera {{to look for the}} location of the laser dot. Depending on how far away the laser strikes a surface, the laser dot appears at different places in the camera's field of view. This technique is called <b>triangulation</b> because the <b>laser</b> dot, the camera and the laser emitter form a triangle. The length of one side of the triangle, the distance between the camera and the laser emitter is known. The angle of the laser emitter corner is also known. The angle of the camera corner can be determined by looking at the location of the laser dot in the camera's field of view. These three pieces of information fully determine the shape and size of the triangle and give the location of the laser dot corner of the triangle. In most cases a laser stripe, instead of a single laser dot, is swept across the object to speed up the acquisition process. The National Research Council of Canada was among the first institutes to develop the <b>triangulation</b> based <b>laser</b> scanning technology in 1978.|$|R

It is shown that spacetime analysis do eliminate these artifacts almost completely, it is also shown that the shape of the laser beam used no longer is critical thanks to the spacetime analysis, and that in some cases the laser probably even could be exchanged for a non-coherent light source. Furthermore experiments of running the derived algorithm on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) are conducted with very promising results.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Laser</b> <b>triangulation</b> systems {{allow for}} non-contact, {{accurate}} and fast digitizing of surfaces. The {{quality of the}} digitized surface depends on many factors. Some, like laser emission wavelength, are characteristics of the system. Other factors, like part surface quality are external to the system. <b>Laser</b> <b>triangulation</b> systems project a laser beam {{onto the surface of}} the workpiece, so that an image of this projection is captured in a photo-sensor. This image is processed using triangulation techniques to calculate the spatial position of every point on the projection. The sensor does not only capture the light projected by the laser, but also captures the ambient light emitted in the same wavelength of the laser beam. Since calculation of points positions depends on the image characteristics, ambient light becomes a potential error source. The present work evaluates the influence of ambient light on the results of the scanning process. A methodology for testing different light sources under the same digitizing conditions has been developed. Three different criteria have been used to analyze the quality of the point cloud: the number of captured points, the average dispersion of the test point cloud with respect to a reference point cloud, and the distribution of such geometric dispersion across the whole surface.

40|$|Precision and accuracy-based {{models for}} well-calibrated time-of-flight-based laser range {{scanners}} {{can be assumed}} to agree; however, {{this is not the}} case for triangulation-based laser range scanners. We show that the accuracy model for a <b>triangulation</b> <b>laser</b> range scanner features a skewed distribution even if the precision model is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. This is because the magnitude of the sensor uncertainty for any given measurement is a function of range which violates the assumption of identical distribution.

Future work will involve applying the test protocol to a real laser range scanner. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
