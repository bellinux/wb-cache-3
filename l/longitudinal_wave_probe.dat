40|$|Demand on High Speed Craft (HSC) is {{increasing}} due to development of inland transportation. Therefore, many analysis {{have been conducted}} to evaluate performance of this modern ship. One of the important analysis is calm water resistance test. Resistance component of the hull and wave pattern around the hull are obtained from the calm water test. These criteria are important in analyzing flow around hull, especially on wave interference between the hulls. In this paper, flow around hull has been studied for one model of Semi SWATH hull form with fin stabilizers installation by performing calm water resistance test in deep water. The fore fin angle is fixed to zero degree while the aft fin angle is varied to 0, 5 and 15 degree. The effects of fin angle to resistance criteria and flow around hull are investigated. Wave height has been recorded using <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>probe</b> during resistance test. For each configuration, the investigation is conducted with range of Length Froude Number from 0. 34 to 0. 69.

Residual stress and microstructure evaluation of ductile cast iron using a nondestructive method (Critically Refracted Longitudinal Ultrasonic Wave Technique) was approached. Residual stresses, both good and bad graphite nodules, and different matrix phases such as ferrite, pearlite and martensite are developed in ductile iron castings for various reasons. The presence of residual stresses and bad graphite nodules can both have a serious effect on the mechanical properties of the iron. This in turn could lead to the castings having unsatisfactory properties for which they were designed. A critically refracted <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>probe</b> was designed and fabricated for the use of ductile iron evaluation. A group of bars were investigated for the relationship between Lcr wave velocity and the matrix as well as the modularity. Each of these bars was then heat treated and investigated for a relationship between LCR wave velocity and the matrix and modularity once again. The bars were also investigated for velocity changes before and after heat treatment. Also, residual stress measurements ductile iron bars was attempted using the in four sand cast LCR wave propagation technique. Acoustoelastic constants were determined experimentally for as cast, fully annealed, normalized, and determined These acoustoelastic quenched and tempered specimens. These acoustoelastic constants were then used to calculate residual stresses in the different heat treated specimens...|$|E

With the aid of imaging the geometry of specimen (counterbore) and weld the exact defect-position could be determined relative to the weld. According to MPA statements, the SAFT-sizing is in good agreement with the intended defect sizes. Difficulties occurred in imaging a KTA-notch (20 mm x 3 mm) at the interface between counterwelding and buttering.

40|$|International audienceFew tools {{have been}} {{developed}} for industrial quality control of textures. The use of contactless techniques, based on acoustic waves, offers an obvious advantage in food-processing industry and cosmetics. The dynamic acoustoelastic testing (DAET) is an acoustic method based on the interaction between a low-frequency compression/expansion pump wave and an ultrasound <b>longitudinal</b> <b>probe</b> <b>wave.</b> This method describes the variations of the bulk viscoelastic modulus, through the quantification of nonlinear elastic and viscous parameters. The DAET method and related model were validated in homogeneous media leading to low values of viscoelastic nonlinearities, essentially governed by the fluid nature. However, the most significant results were obtained in granular or air-based media. The high values of nonlinear viscoelastic parameters are due to the microinhomogeneities of complex media. This method appears to be an interesting alternative to conventional rheometry, especially for the characterization of these complex fluids...|$|R

40|$|Summary. If thermal and {{mechanical}} coupling is neglected, {{there is a}} class of isothermal strain energy functions for isotropic compressible hyperelastic solids, that admits the propagation of a finite amplitude transverse wave, without a coupled <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave,</b> and a subclass that admits the simultaneous propagation of an uncoupled finite amplitude transverse <b>wave</b> and a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> [1]. Several examples of this class of strain energy function are discussed. When thermal {{and mechanical}} coupling is considered the solid is described as thermoelastic. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the possibility of the propagation of a finite amplitude transverse wave without a coupled <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave,</b> or the uncoupled simultaneous propagation of a finite amplitude transverse <b>wave</b> and a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave,</b> in an isotropic thermoelastic solid that has no underlying deformation.

The research work revealed the quite different <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> velocity changes between under the simple and pure shear states and also distinguished longitudinal velocity change under the pure shear state, {{on the other}} hand transverse wave velocity changes under simple and pure shear states showed almost the same change tendencies similar to the texture development under both shear states. Therefore, to clear the different effects due to plastic deformation on transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves</b> velocity changes under simple and pure shear states the microstructural changes of polycrystal solids were investigated via finite element polycrystal model (FEPM).

It is found that there exist five basic waves in an infinite electro-microelastic solid, namely an independent <b>longitudinal</b> micro-rotational <b>wave,</b> two sets of coupled <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves</b> influenced by the electric effect, and two sets of coupled transverse waves.

Numerical computations have been performed for a particular model and the variations of amplitude and energy ratios are obtained against the angle of incidence. The results obtained are depicted graphically. It has been verified that the sum of energy ratios is equal to unity at the interface and the amplitude ratios of reflected and transmitted waves depend upon the angle of incidence, frequency and elastic properties of the media.

40|$|AbstractInspection of {{cylindrical}} structures {{using the}} first <b>longitudinal</b> Ultrasonic Guided <b>Wave</b> (UGW) mode {{has so far}} been predominantly neglected. This is due to its attenuative and dispersive behaviour, at common UGW operating frequencies (20 - 100 kHz). However, with the current knowledge on the level of attenuation in the first <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> mode and dispersion compensation techniques, the first <b>longitudinal</b> guided <b>wave</b> mode no longer need to be neglected. Furthermore, the first <b>longitudinal</b> guided <b>wave</b> mode has higher number of non-axisymmetric modes compared to other axisymmetric modes in the operating frequency.
