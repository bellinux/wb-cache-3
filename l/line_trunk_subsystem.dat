50|$|In the 1970s PKP {{intended}} {{to increase speed}} of Polish passenger trains, which resulted mainly in building CMK <b>line</b> (<b>Trunk</b> <b>Line)</b> and the modernisation of EU05 locomotives into EP05 series. Meanwhile a project was opened to introduce new electric locomotives able to pull trains with speed exceeding 125 km/h, based on British EU06 and local EU07 machines.|$|R
50|$|PPP is used {{over many}} types of {{physical}} networks including serial cable, phone <b>line,</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>line,</b> cellular telephone, specialized radio links, and fiber optic links such as SONET. Internet service providers (ISPs) have used PPP for customer dial-up access to the Internet, since IP packets cannot be transmitted over a modem line on their own, without some data link protocol.|$|R

50|$|This set of MF tones was {{originally}} devised for Bell System long-distance operators placing calls manually, and predates the DTMF Touch-Tone system used by subscribers.

50|$|Peripheral {{units are}} on shelves in the SM. In most exchanges the {{majority}} are Line Units (LU) and Digital <b>Line</b> <b>Trunk</b> Units (DLTU). Each SM has Local Digital Service Units (LDSU) to provide various services to <b>lines</b> and <b>trunks</b> in the SM, including tone generation and detection. Global Digital Service Units (GDSU) provide less-frequently used services to the entire exchange. The Time Slot Interchanger (TSI) in the SM uses random-access memory to delay each speech sample {{to fit into a}} time slot which will carry its call through the exchange to another or, in some cases, the same SM.|$|R

The {{construction of}} a <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> to Modjo Dry Port is well underway (May 2017) but visibly far from being commissioned. The missing facilities and <b>trunk</b> <b>lines</b> within the Port of Doraleh are now [...] "soon" [...] to be built through a combined effort of the two governments of Djibouti and Ethiopia. The very new Djibouti Multipurpose Terminal, inaugurated in April 2017, will now also {{be connected to the}} railway through a <b>trunk</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} for 1953 included bumper guards, electric clock, <b>lined</b> <b>trunk,</b> dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun visors, rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. In 1953 a padded safety dash also became standard on the 98. For {{the first time}} air conditioning was an option.|$|R
50|$|On 1 October 1891, the New Wannsee line {{open from}} Zehlendorf to Berlin {{parallel}} with the <b>trunk</b> <b>line.</b> It served suburban traffic while long-distance trains ran on the <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> to Magdeburg.|$|R
25|$|However, the {{dependence}} on this single <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> occasionally causes widespread Internet outages during Dempster or Alaska Highway maintenance or construction. A backup <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> between Fort Simpson and Inuvik is currently under construction.|$|R
50|$|Collector roads can {{originate}} {{in several different}} ways. Most often, they are planned within a suburban layout and built expressly for that purpose; occasionally, they fill gaps in a grid system between arterial roads. Urban planners often consider such roads when laying out new areas of development because infrastructure for utilities such as electric power distribution <b>lines,</b> <b>trunk</b> sewers and water mains can be built through the same corridor.|$|R
5|$|The Norwegian State Railways serves Lysaker Station {{both with}} Oslo Commuter Rail trains {{as well as}} {{regional}} trains. Up to five daily express trains along the Sørlandet Line and the stop at Lysaker. It also serves an hourly headway of the R10 regional trains from the Drammen Line and Dovre Line. There are five hourly trains heading to Asker via the Asker Line, including the L12, L13 and L14. Westwards L12 runs to Kongsberg while they eastwards serve the Gardermoen <b>Line,</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> and the Kongsvinger Line. L1, a full-stop service on the Trunk- and Drammen Line, runs every thirty minutes. A rush-hour service line L2x, serving the Østfold Line, also serves Lysaker.|$|R
25|$|NSB made four {{proposals}} {{for a new}} railway to Gardermoen. The simplest devised constructing a branch from the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> at a location north of Jessheim Station which would run to the airport. Alternatively, and ultimately selected, was construction of a tunnel eastwards from Oslo to Lillestrøm and an upgrade of the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> and a new route from a point at Asper to the airport. Two more direct routes were proposed; the one branching off from north of Grefsen Station on the Gjøvik Line, the other diverting from the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> close to Grorud Station. All four routes called for the railway to continue north from Gardermoen and meet up with the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> at Bøn Station.|$|R
5000|$|The Delhi-Chennai <b>line</b> (Grand <b>Trunk</b> route) is {{classified}} as a [...] "Group A" [...] line which can take speeds up to 160 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Lillestrøm is {{connected}} to Oslo by two separate railway <b>lines.</b> The <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> (opened 1854) runs to Oslo via the Grorud valley and is used mostly by commuter trains calling at all stations, as well as freight trains. Non-stop commuter trains, airport express trains, and long-distance expresses use the high-speed Gardermoen Line (opened 1999), which runs mostly in tunnel to Oslo.|$|R
50|$|Frogner Station is {{a railway}} station at Frogner in Akershus, Norway on the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line.</b> The station was opened in 1854 {{as part of}} the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line.</b> It is served by two hourly services, Line 440 and 450 by Norwegian State Railways.|$|R

50|$|T-carrier spans are terminated, {{originally}} one per card but {{in later}} models usually two, in Digital <b>Line</b> <b>Trunk</b> Units (DLTU) which concentrate their DS0 channels into the TSI. These may serve either interoffice trunks or, using Integrated Subscriber Loop Carrier, subscriber lines. Higher-capacity DS3 signals {{can also have}} their DS0 signals switched in Digital Network Unit SONET (DNUS) units, without demultiplexing them into DS1. Newer SM's have DNUS (DS3) and Optical OIU interfaces (OC12) with {{a large amount of}} capacity.|$|R

2500|$|Trains on the Red Line operate {{every ten}} minutes during peak hours Monday through Friday. [...] They operate every twelve minutes during the daytime weekdays and {{all day on}} the {{weekends}} after approximately 10 a.m. (with a 15-minute headway early Saturday and Sunday mornings). Night service can range between 10–20 minutes. Due to being paired with the Purple Line, the headways between Union Station and Wilshire/Vermont are cut in half, so the Red/Purple <b>Line</b> <b>trunk</b> has trains running five to ten minutes throughout service times.|$|R

50|$|With {{structuring}} and grouping, it is {{very well}} seen that in any distributed network there are devices performing one complex function. At that, those devices can be placed in different location. A telephone exchange is the most typical {{example of such a}} distributed group of devices. It typically contains subscriber <b>line</b> units, <b>line</b> <b>trunk</b> units, switching matrix, CPU and remote hubs. A basic telephone service leans on all those units, so it is convenient for an engineer to manage a telephone exchange as one complex entity encompassing all those units inside.|$|R
25|$|Several routes were {{considered}} for the Loenga–Alnabru Line. The {{need to keep the}} gradient at bay meant that the tracks were placed at a lower elevation than the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line,</b> with the two not reaching the same height until Bryn Station. At the same time the company needed {{to stay away from the}} Alna River. Meanwhile, the Gjøvik Line was built with a branch, the Alna Line, which connected to Alnabru. Just northeast of the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> was placed in a culvert under the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> so it would meet up with the Alna Line. The Loenga–Alnabru Line was completed between Bryn and Alnabru in May 1904. with this work being carried out at the same time as the doubling of the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line.</b> The section from Loenga to Bryn opened on 1 May 1907.|$|R
