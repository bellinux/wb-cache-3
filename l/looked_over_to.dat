5|$|A {{turning point}} of the game came on the first {{possession}} of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led a short drive that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and 1, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Parcells for a signal {{as to whether he}} should try to draw the defense offside or run a play. After a nod of approval from Parcells, he ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro and Phil McConkey to give him three on the game, and Joe Morris and Ottis Anderson each rushed for one touchdown. The Giants' defense limited the Broncos to only two net yards and 10 offensive plays in the third quarter. The 30 second half points set a Super Bowl-record for points in a half, and Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record which still stands.|$|E
2500|$|... or {{the life}} of me, I could not run to get it. It seemed like an age before I could get the ball {{in my hands and}} then, as I <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> first, it seemed like the longest throw I ever had to make. The first baseman was the tallest in the league, but I threw the ball far over his head.|$|E

[...] Kaufman found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. [...] Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.|$|E

60|$|Johnny Chuck <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the alder thicket. He saw Sammy Jay, Blacky the Crow and Mrs. Redwing {{sitting in}} the alders. They were calling back and forth, {{apparently}} very much excited. Peter Rabbit looked {{this way and that}} way to see if the coast was clear.|$|E
60|$|Happy Jack <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the house, {{and there}} sat Tommy on a window-sill, helping {{himself to the}} most delicious-looking cracked nuts. The sight of them made Happy Jack's mouth water. A long branch hung down over the window and almost touched the sill. Happy Jack ventured half way and stopped. Somehow it seemed very {{dangerous}} to go so close to that window.|$|E

[...] "Whatever it may have been, you've not been false to the cause of beauty, I'm sure." [...] And she <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Amelia with a knowing smile. But Amelia was engaged upon her plate, and went on with her dinner without turning her eyes either on Mrs Lupex or on John Eames.|$|E
6000|$|Timmy <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{where he}} had last seen Whitefoot. There he was picking out seeds from a pine cone on the ground. The trunk of a tree was between him and Hooty. But Timmy knew that Whitefoot hadn't seen Hooty, and that any minute he might run out from behind that tree. If he did Hooty would see him, and silently as a shadow would swoop down and catch him. What was to be done? ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{then there}} was a rustle in the grass and out popped Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat and Happy Jack Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and Bobby Coon. When Johnny Chuck had {{recovered}} from his surprise and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the doorway of his new home there sat Reddy Fox on Johnny Chuck's precious new mound. It seemed as if all the little meadow people were there, all but Jimmy Skunk, who wisely stayed away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} had a good heart," [...] said my mother, softly, <b>to</b> me, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Uncle Chipperton, who was telling my father, for the second time, just how I looked, as I sat alone at the long table.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what will}} you do about your loan?" [...] said Mr Slow, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> John Ball when he asked the question, as though inquiring whether all Miss Mackenzie's affairs were <b>to</b> be talked <b>over</b> openly in the {{presence}} of that gentleman.|$|R

"You old booby," [...] Rebecca said, {{pinching}} {{his ear and}} <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{see that}} he made no mistakes in spelling--"beseech is not spelt with an a, and earliest is." [...] So he altered these words, bowing to the superior knowledge of his little Missis.|$|R
60|$|Jumper drew a {{long breath}} and settled his long hind feet for a great jump, hoping to so take Whitey the Owl by {{surprise}} {{that he might be}} able to get away. And as Jumper did this, he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> that stump where Whitey had been sitting so long. Whitey was just leaving it on his great silent wings, and his fierce yellow eyes were fixed in the direction of Shadow the Weasel. He had seen that moving black spot which was the tip of Shadow's tail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Johnny Chuck won't {{come out}} again to-day, and there won't be any {{excitement}} at all," [...] thought Sammy Jay in disappointment, {{for he had}} hoped to see a fight between Reddy Fox and Johnny Chuck. Just then Sammy <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Farmer Brown's house, and there was Farmer Brown's boy getting ready to saw wood. The imp of mischief under Sammy's pert cap gave him an idea. He flew over to the old apple-tree, just over Reddy's head, and began to scream {{at the top of his}} lungs.|$|E
60|$|The Judge {{was seated}} in a great high-backed carved oak chair, on the {{right-hand}} side of a great stone fireplace where, in the corner, a rope hung down from the ceiling, its end lying coiled on the floor. With a feeling of something like horror, Malcolmson recognised the scene of the room as it stood, and gazed around him in an awestruck manner as though he expected to find some strange presence behind him. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the corner of the fireplace--and with a loud cry he let the lamp fall from his hand.|$|E

50|$|Some {{continuity}} {{errors are}} evident in the finished film.

60|$|Whitefoot scampered along {{through a}} little tunnel and {{presently}} very cautiously peeped out of another little round {{hole in the}} snow. Sure enough, there was Whitey the Snowy Owl back to him on a stump, watching the hole down which he had disappeared a few minutes before. Whitefoot grinned. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> where he had last seen Jumper. Jumper was still there; {{it was clear that}} he hadn't moved, and so Whitey hadn't seen him. Again Whitefoot grinned. Then he settled himself to watch patiently for Whitey to become tired of watching that hole and fly away.|$|E
60|$|So Reddy trotted {{through the}} swamp till {{he came to}} the edge of it. There his keen nose found the scent of the farmer. It didn't take him two minutes to {{discover}} that the farmer had followed Bowser the Hound {{to the edge of the}} swamp and then gone back. Eagerly Reddy <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the farmyard for those fat hens. They, too, had disappeared. Not one was to be seen. But there was no mystery about the disappearance of these other fat hens. He heard the muffled crow of the big rooster. It came from the henhouse. All those fat hens had been shut up. It was perfectly plain to Reddy that the farmer suspected Reddy might return, and he didn't intend to lose another fat hen. With a little yelp of disappointment, Reddy turned his back on the farm and trotted off into the woods.|$|E
60|$|It was one {{of those}} wonderfully clear {{moonlight}} evenings, when the ocean, like a great reflecting mirror, seems to double the brightness of the sky,--and its vast expanse lay all around them in its stillness, like an eternity of waveless peace. Mara remembered that time in her girlhood when she had followed Moses into the woods on just such a night,--how she had sat there under the shadows of the trees, and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Harpswell and noticed the white houses and the meeting-house, all so bright and clear in the moonlight, and then off again {{on the other side of}} the island where silent ships were coming and going in the mysterious stillness. They were talking together now with that outflowing fullness which comes when the seal of some great reserve has just been broken,--going back over their lives from day to day, bringing up incidents of childhood, and turning them gleefully like two children.|$|E
