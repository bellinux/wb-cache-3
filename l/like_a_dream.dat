500|$|After marrying Sara Fricker {{in autumn}} 1795, Coleridge left their home at Clevedon {{and began to}} travel {{throughout}} England {{in order to meet}} with various philosophers and political theorists. In part, he was trying to meet with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works. During this time, he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health. His feelings of guilt, along with a fever that he treated with laudanum, affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to Josiah Wade on 10 February 1796: [...] "My past life seems to me <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> a feverish dream! all one gloomy huddle of strange actions, and dim-discovered motives! Friendships lost by indolence, and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibilities." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson Benson {{writes in}} [...] "Ernest Hemingway: The Life as Fiction and the Fiction as Life" [...] that critics should refrain from finding {{connections}} between Hemingway's life and fiction and instead {{focus on how}} he uses biographical events to transform life into art. He believes the events in a writer's life have only a vague relationship to the fiction, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> from which a drama emerges. Of Hemingway's earliest stories, Benson claims [...] "his early fiction, his best, has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare". In his essay [...] "On Writing", Hemingway wrote that [...] "Indian Camp" [...] was a story in which imaginary events were made to seem real: [...] "Everything good he'd ever written he'd made up.... Of course he'd never seen an Indian woman having a baby. That was what made it good." ...|$|E

500|$|However, reviews {{were not}} uniformly positive. Tim Teeman posed the {{question}} in The Times: [...] "I know she's a national institution and June Brown plays her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> but was last night's Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He noted that Jordan's script worked best as Dot remembered Ethel, but assessed that the episode was overly indulgent, and did not reveal anything [...] "substantially new" [...] about Dot. As with Banks-Smith's review, Teeman felt that the episode was incompatible with Dot's former characterisation, suggesting that her Christian faith ought to have tempered her decision not to care for Jim. He felt that overall, the episode was somewhat dull and boring, describing Dot as an EastEnders [...] "jewel" [...] who should be cherished, not turned into a [...] "drag act".|$|E
500|$|Although {{it did not}} {{directly}} impact the ongoing storyline of Awake, [...] "Nightswimming" [...] introduced and continued key thematic elements of the series. It {{was described as a}} [...] "long, roundabout" [...] episode that is [...] "bent on making [...] fully commit to moving to Oregon with Hannah" [...] by Matt Fowler from IGN. Fowler thought that, since Rex was not in the episode, the [...] "green reality" [...] seemed more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b> In a review of the following episode, [...] "Game Day", he admitted that he thought Alina was behind Marcus' car bomb, since he thought that this story would have an arrest by the end. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall opined that Michael is [...] "coming to grips with Hannah's desire to move because he loves her that much". However, the Brittens later decided not to move in [...] "Slack Water", the series' tenth episode, owing to personal concerns.|$|E
500|$|The year 2006 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Genelia's career. She completed two Telugu movies in early 2006, one was the romantic comedy Happy, {{and the other was}} Raam. She then portrayed the role of Haasini, a vibrant, effervescent and a happy-go-lucky young girl, in the 2006 Telugu romantic film Bommarillu. The movie, a blockbuster at the box-office, grossed [...] in India, and also won the 2006 Golden Nandi award. Her character was well received, and garnered her the Telugu Filmfare Award for Best Actress, besides Nandi Special Jury Award and Santosham Award for Best Actress. Sify concluded about her acting in their review that, [...] "The scene stealer is Genelia with her innocent looks and cute mannerisms. She does not overact and we just fall in love with her character. Genelia looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> in chic skirts and is {{the life of the party}} and raises the bar of the film." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown's {{single-hander}} {{episode of}} EastEnders received much critical acclaim. The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith deemed Brown possibly {{the only member}} of the cast with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) capable of carrying such a monologue. Robert Hanks for The Independent wrote that [...] "I don't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Conversely, Tim Teeman posed the question in The Times: [...] "I know she’s a national institution and June Brown plays her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> but was last night’s Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic.

500|$|Bond {{wrote of}} her next role, [...] "It was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> come true when I saw my own {{name in the}} title role" [...] of Iolanthe (1882–84). Bond's first {{entrance}} as Iolanthe was across a [...] "stream". [...] She wrote in her memoirs about a performance of Iolanthe: [...] "Realism can be carried too far, {{as it was when}} one night a zealous property man said to me: 'It'll be just like the real thing to-night, Miss Bond. I've put some frogs into the water!' [...] 'Then you'll just have to fish them out again,' I retorted, 'and the curtain won't go up until you do.' [...] They had to catch those frogs in an inverted umbrella. [...] Everybody got splashed and agitated, and the performance was delayed for some time." [...] The critics praised Bond's portrayal of the title character: [...] "Miss Jessie Bond... may be credited with all the grace, delicacy, and fascination we should expect from a fairy mother, and her singing of the really exquisite melody in the last scene {{was one of the most}} successful items in the entire opera." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{early months}} of 1706 also proved {{frustrating}} for the Duke as Louis XIV's generals gained early successes in Italy and Alsace. These setbacks thwarted Marlborough's original plans for the coming campaign, but he soon adjusted his schemes and marched into enemy territory. LouisXIV, equally determined to fight and avenge Blenheim, goaded his commander, Marshal Villeroi, to seek out Monsieur Marlbrouck. The subsequent Battle of Ramillies, fought in the Spanish Netherlands on 23 May, was perhaps Marlborough's most successful action, and {{one in which he}} had himself characteristically drawn his sword at the pivotal moment. For the loss of fewer than 3,000 dead and wounded (far fewer than Blenheim), his victory had cost the enemy some 20,000 casualties, inflicting in the words of Marshal Villars, [...] "the most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs". The campaign was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English general. Town after town subsequently fell to the Allies. [...] "It really looks more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> than truth", wrote Marlborough to Sarah. With Prince Eugene's rout of the French army at Turin in September, 1706 proved a miraculous year for Allied arms.|$|E

500|$|Several Scandinavian {{actors were}} cast in major roles, {{including}} Pihla Viitala, Peter Stormare (who Arterton said had actually inspired her to start acting), Bjørn Sundquist, and Ingrid Bolsø Berdal. In addition, actors from Germany and Poland (including Thomas Mann, Rainer Bock, and Joanna Kulig) {{and other parts}} of the world were also cast. Viitala, a self-described [...] "big fan" [...] of Renner, said she was nervous at first, but found him [...] "extremely" [...] easy to approach, made a good connection, and enjoyed working with him. Wirkola said Berdal was chosen for her [...] "piercing" [...] eyes, adding: [...] "There are a lot of Norwegians in the film. Minor parts, but I knew I could get great actors in small parts and Ingrid has a great physicality." [...] Stormare said he was only surprised at [...] "how smart Tom [...] is, and how broad this fantasy is and the span of his imagination," [...] his favourite aspect being how [...] "some of the witches are so sexy and cool." [...] He compared the film's production to being in Disneyland, saying it felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> to him.|$|E
500|$|... "Sleeping {{with the}} One I Love" [...] {{revolves}} around Fantasia feeling torn between {{the stability of}} her boyfriend and the sensual pleasures of her lover. According to Wanda J. Coppage of Music Times, the lyrics focus on [...] "the {{story of a woman}} in search of love, but she seems to find it with the wrong type of men". Throughout the single, Fantasia [...] "candidly and guiltlessly" [...] discusses her affair by singing: [...] "I’m sleeping with the man I love because the one I’m with just ain’t good enough.” In the verses, Fantasia sings about her conflict with choosing between the two men, through lyrics such as: “Yes, I've tried to shake it off, and I even tried to pray / But I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me”. She expresses pain with the lyrics [...] "See my baby's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> but the other man, he haunts me". Other lyrics also include: [...] "I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me...I thought about the cost, but it's a price I'm willing to pay." ...|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b> [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E
