5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient {{to allow them}} to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand valve}} has a chamber, which in normal use {{contains}} breathing gas at ambient pressure. A valve which supplies medium pressure gas can vent into the chamber. Either a mouthpiece or a full-face mask {{is connected to}} the chamber for the diver to breathe from. The mouthpiece can be direct coupled or connected by a flexible <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose.</b> On one side of the chamber is a flexible diaphragm to control the operation of the valve. The diaphragm is protected by a cover with holes or slits through which outside water can enter freely.|$|E

Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. This patent was curcumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration resulted in a diver passing out, he developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates {{the first and second}} stages by a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose,</b> and releases exhaled gas at the second stage.

5000|$|While not {{adhesive}} to the repaired object, it is self-adhesive, {{securing the}} bond well. It is supplied in rolls with an [...] layer, {{to prevent the}} tape from amalgamating before use. It may optionally be made with an iron-oxide additive which adds high thermal conductivity. This tape is used extensively in aviation and aerospace wiring applications as a splice or wrapping tape due to its non-flammability.

50|$|The basic {{appliance}} in New Zealand is the Pump Tender, {{which is}} primarily equipped for fires. Typical equipment includes a pump (normally driven off the appliance engine via a power take-off); a high pressure hose reel for small fires and initial attack; {{a supply of}} high-pressure and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> for larger fires; fire-fighting foam; a standpipe and bar for accessing fire hydrants, and suction hoses for accessing non-reticulated water supplies; forcible entry tools such as Halligan bars, axes and sledgehammers; aluminium and wooden ladders; and a first aid kit with an automated external defibrillator.|$|R
2500|$|In the [...] "single-hose" [...] {{two-stage}} design, {{the first}} stage regulator reduces the cylinder pressure of up to about [...] to an intermediate pressure (IP) of about [...] above ambient pressure. [...] The second stage demand valve regulator, supplied by a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> from {{the first stage}}, delivers the breathing gas at ambient pressure to the diver's mouth. [...] The exhaled gases are exhausted directly to the environment as waste through a non-return valve on the second stage housing. The first stage typically {{has at least one}} outlet port delivering gas at full tank pressure which is connected to the diver's submersible pressure gauge or dive computer, to show how much breathing gas remains in the cylinder.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> {{commonly}} used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. [...] Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8‚Äù male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|E

5000|$|Hydraulic-fracturing {{equipment}} used {{in oil and}} natural gas fields usually consists of a slurry blender, one or more high-pressure, high-volume fracturing pumps (typically powerful triplex or quintuplex pumps) and a monitoring unit. Associated equipment includes fracturing tanks, one or more units for storage and handling of proppant, high-pressure treating iron, a chemical additive unit (used to accurately monitor chemical addition), <b>low-pressure</b> flexible <b>hoses,</b> and many gauges and meters for flow rate, fluid density, and treating pressure. Chemical additives are typically 0.5% percent of the total fluid volume. Fracturing equipment operates over a range of pressures and injection rates, and can reach up to [...] and [...] (100 barrels per minute).|$|R
50|$|The celebrated {{mechanical}} engineer Harry Ricardo {{began his career}} by working in his grandfather, Alexander Rendel's, civil engineering practice. At {{the time they were}} involved in the construction of bridges in India, which required hydraulic lifting, hoisting and riveting equipment. As the existing transport infrastructure was poor, all plant used on site needed to be lightweight and easily portable. Machines also needed to be connected to their hydraulic power source by flexible tubing, which limited their working pressure to around 500 psi. At this time, modern shipyard equipment was using pressures of up to 2000 psi. This high-pressure equipment was smaller and lighter than the bulkier low-pressure variety, a desirable feature for this construction work. Ricardo's innovation was to specify the use of portable hydraulic intensifiers for these tools, permitting the use of the improved high-pressure form, even where their supply was at <b>low-pressure,</b> through flexible <b>hose.</b> These intensifiers were so successful that eventually several hundred were supplied and used.|$|R

It has a rear-mounted 1900 L/min pump with one <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> reel, a 2000 L onboard water tank, and around 5.2 m2 of locker space. New appliances are typically built on Iveco Eurocargo chassis.|$|E

50|$|A {{buoyancy}} compensator, {{also called}} a buoyancy control device, BC, BCD, stabilizer, stabilisor, stab jacket, wing or ABLJ depending on design, {{is a piece}} of diving equipment containing an inflatable bladder which is worn by divers to establish neutral buoyancy underwater and positive buoyancy on the surface, when needed. The buoyancy is controlled by adjusting the volume of air in the bladder. The bladder is filled with gas from the diver's primary breathing gas cylinder via a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> from the regulator first stage, directly from a small cylinder dedicated to this purpose, or from the diver's mouth through the oral inflation valve.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{inflation}} system {{is from a}} <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> from the primary breathing gas supply, but a dedicated direct feed pony bottle was common on early buoyancy compensators, and remains an option for some models. Most BCs allow oral inflation both underwater and on the surface. This could theoretically reduce gas consumption, but is generally not considered worth the effort and slightly increased hazard of taking the DV out of the mouth underwater, and possibly having to purge it before breathing again. Oral inflation is, however, an effective alternative inflation method {{in case of a}} failure of the pressurized {{inflation system}}. Emergency inflation by expendable CO2 cartridge is provided on some BCs.|$|E

A <b>low-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> links this with the second-stage regulator, or [...] "demand valve", which is mounted on the mouthpiece. Exhalation occurs through a rubber one-way mushroom valve in the chamber of the demand valve, directly into the water quite close to the diver's mouth.
