25|$|The hamster tail can be {{difficult}} to see, as it is usually not very long (about 1/6 the length of the body), {{with the exception of the}} Chinese hamster, which has a tail the same length as the body. One rodent characteristic that can be highly visible in hamsters is their sharp incisors; they have an upper pair and <b>lower</b> <b>pair</b> which grow continuously throughout life, so must be regularly worn down. Hamsters are very flexible, but their bones are somewhat fragile. They are extremely susceptible to rapid temperature changes and drafts, as well as extreme heat or cold.|$|E

At the rear, fixed and almost square horizontal tailplanes stretched between the upper and the <b>lower</b> <b>pairs</b> of booms. A pair of trapezoidal rudders were hinged on the last two verticals, assisted by another central one further forward.

2500|$|To begin flight testing, a {{temporary}} non-retractable undercarriage with long braced V-legs {{was attached to}} the fuselage, and fixed tail wheels attached to the <b>lower</b> <b>pair</b> of fins. In this form, the aircraft was trucked to Edwards AFB in November 1953 for ground testing and taxiing trials. During one of these tests, {{at a time when the}} aft section of the large spinner had not yet been fitted, Lockheed Chief Test Pilot Herman [...] "Fish" [...] Salmon managed to taxi the aircraft past the liftoff speed, and the aircraft made a brief hop on 22 December 1953.

2500|$|Like the H.P.42, the H.P.43 was an unequal-span biplane with unswept and unstaggered {{wings of}} {{constant}} chord. [...] Both used a Warren girder biplane construction, with {{two pairs of}} strongly outward-leaning struts linked by an inward-leaning pair on each wing. [...] This layout avoided the need for bracing wires. [...] Both types had dihedral on upper and lower outer wing sections, combined with marked anhedral in the centre section of the lower wing, a feature that optimised {{the view from the}} passenger aircraft because the wing was attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage and kept the single-wheeled undercarriage legs, mounted at the end of the centre section, short and widetrack. The <b>lower</b> <b>pair</b> of engines were also mounted at this point, on top of the wing. [...] Both types carried ailerons and leading edge slots on the upper wing only. [...] In contrast, not only did the H.P.43 have a smaller span (114ft compared with 130ft on the H.P.42) but the upper and lower planes had nearly equal chord, unlike the sesquiplane H.P.42. The H.P.43's third Bristol Pegasus IM3 radial engine was mounted centrally on the upper wing with bracing to the upper fuselage longerons.|$|E
50|$|Hartenberg & Denavit {{presents}} {{the definition of}} a kinematic pair:In the matter of connections between rigid bodies, Reuleaux recognized two kinds; he called them higher and <b>lower</b> <b>pairs</b> (of elements). With higher pairs, the two elements are in contact at a point or along a line, as in a ball bearing or disk cam and follower; the relative motions of coincident points are dissimilar. <b>Lower</b> <b>pairs</b> are those for which area contact may be visualized, as in pin connections, crossheads, ball-and socket joints and some others; the relative motion of coincident points of the elements, and hence of their links, are similar, and an exchange of elements from one link to the other does not alter the relative motion of the parts as it would with higher pairs.|$|R

2500|$|Also of {{interest}} is that on the last page of the MS are found numerous small pencil drawings of horses, lambs, lions and two human profiles.

Also present are various random letters (especially the letter [...] "N") which may be examples of Blake's attempts to master mirror writing, a skill which was necessary for his work as an engraver. However, it is thought that at least some of the sketches and lettering on this page could have been by Blake's brother, Robert; [...] "the awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry of the head of the large lion in the <b>lower</b> <b>pair</b> of animals in the upper left quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some instances, corrected by one of them." ...|$|E

Here, the very delicate membrane of chitine which lines the sack or tube, extending from the external orifice, {{can be seen to}} be continuous, as in all Cirripedes, with the outer tunic of the thorax. Within the thorax, there are some longitudinal muscles, without transverse striæ, which, I believe, enter the short limbs, but not the abdomen, as I infer from the latter not being everted when they are pulled. At their lower ends these muscles terminate abruptly, and from being contracted are often a little enlarged. They extend a short way beneath the <b>lower</b> <b>pair</b> of limbs, and are, I suspect, attached to the outer integument of the animal, near the base.|$|E

In the lower segments, these spines are exceedingly unequal in length, the inner spines on both rami, not being above one fourth {{of the length of}} the outer corresponding spine in each pair. The tufts intermediate between these pairs, are not very large: on the lateral upper rims there are some strong, short spines: dorsal tufts with short, thick spines. First cirrus about three fourths as long as the second cirrus, with numerous tapering segments, three or four of the lower ones being thick and protuberant: in the first cirrus there are eleven segments, and in the sixth cirrus, seventeen. Second cirrus, with the anterior ramus slightly thicker than the posterior ramus: a few of the basal segments of both rami are protuberant, and thickly clothed with spines. In the third cirrus, the two rami are nearly equally thick, with some of the basal segments in both clothed, like a brush, with spines. In these brushes on the first, second, and third cirri, most of the spines are doubly toothed, each tooth being simply conical.|$|E
60|$|Plate 13 gives {{impressions}} {{taken from}} the fingers of a child of 2-1/2 years in 1877, and again in 1890, when a boy of 15. They are enlarged photographically to the same size, and are therefore on different scales. The impressions from the baby-hand are not sharp, but sufficiently distinct for comparison. Every bifurcation, and beginning or ending of a ridge, common to the two impressions, is marked with a numeral in blue ink. There is only one island in the present instance, and {{that is in the}} upper pair of prints; it is clearly seen in the right hand print, lying {{to the left of the}} inscribed number 13, but the badness of the left hand print makes it hardly decipherable, so it is not numbered. There are a total of twenty-six good points of comparison common to the upper pair of prints; there are forty-three points in the <b>lower</b> <b>pair,</b> forty-two of which appear in both, leaving a single point of disagreement; it is marked A on the fifth ridge counting from the top. Here a bifurcated ridge in the baby is filled up in the boy. This one exception, small though it be, is in my experience unique. The total result of the two pairs of prints is to afford sixty-eight successes and one failure. The student will find it well worth his while to study these and the following prints step by step, to satisfy himself of the extraordinarily exact coincidences between the two members of either of the pairs. Of course the patterns generally must be the same, if the ridges composing them are exactly alike, and the most cursory glance shows them to be so.|$|E
60|$|Thorax and Abdomen.--The thorax, as in S. vulgare, {{is highly}} extensible, and when {{stretched}} exhibits the same five transverse folds or articulations; when contracted, it is broader, {{so that even}} the truncated end of the abdomen is wider than the lower (properly anterior) end of the thorax in S. vulgare. Its thin outer integument is studded with excessively minute points in transverse rows. The four pair of limbs are longer than in S. vulgare, but the spines on them much shorter and thicker; each limb (including the first) supports three spines, of which one is seated on a notch low down on the outside, and is longer than the other two; of these two, {{the one on the}} same side with the notch, is a little longer than the other. The spines on the first and second pair of limbs are considerably shorter than those on the third pair, and these latter, are a little shorter than those on the fourth or posterior pair. Hence, the spines on the thoracic limbs, compared with those of S. vulgare, present considerable differences, both in their relative and absolute dimensions. The abdominal lobe is in proportion rather shorter; its end is less abruptly truncated, and supports a row of, I believe, six moderately long, and basally thick spines; these spines are not so long as those surmounting the fourth pair of limbs. On both lateral margins of the abdomen, rather on the ventral face, there is a row of, I believe, seven long spines, but {{it is very difficult to}} count the spines in specimens which have been once dried. I was able to distinguish that the two <b>lower</b> <b>pair</b> of spines on the ventral surface, are seated a little way one below and within the other, as in S. vulgare. The abdominal spines altogether form quite a brush, and there are certainly several more than in S. vulgare, and those on the two sides are much longer.|$|E
