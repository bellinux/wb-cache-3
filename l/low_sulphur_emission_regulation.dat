40|$|Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular alternative to traditional marine fuels, {{as it is a}} cost-effective solution so comply with the new Emission Control Area (ECA) <b>sulphur</b> <b>emission</b> <b>regulations</b> that take effect on 1 st January 2015. Connect LNG has developed The Universal Buoyancy System (UBS), a cost-effective and simple concept for offloading LNG for small-scale ships. The system consists of a flexible cryogenic pipeline, a reel on land and a floating semisubmersible platform. The platform is designed to support the external forces acting on the floating cryogenic pipeline and hence protect the vessel s manifold. The platform is attached to the ship side by vacuum technology, and the LNG hose may then safely be connected to the ship s manifold. This thesis investigates the behaviour of the platform in three different configurations by using two different methods; simulations in MARINTEK s finite element programme SIMA, and model tests performed in the Marine Cybernetics laboratory at MARINTEK, Trondheim. The platform was exposed to one extreme sea state for three hours, under different configurations and wave headings. The platform was tested alone, connected to the ship side, and connected to both the ship side and the pipeline. As far as possible, the same conditions are used in both model test and in SIMA. In addition, parameters used in the SIMA simulations such as computed transfer functions added mass and damping will be validated in the model test. The results from the model test to some extent validated the input parameters in SIMA, but were not accurate enough to confirm them. The extreme sea states and setups tested showed that the complete system, with platform, pipeline and ship side was the most vulnerable configuration. The computer simulations and the model test results disagree on whether it is the 315 degree or 90 degree wave heading that is the most severe for the complete system, but the differences between the different wave headings are small in both methods, so this might be due to the modelling differences as well as statistical randomness...|$|R

40|$|Transportation plays a {{major role}} in the gross {{domestic}} product of various nations. There are, however, many obstacles hindering the transportation sector. Cost-efficiency along with proper delivery times, high frequency and reliability are not a straightforward task. Furthermore, environmental friendliness has increased the importance of the whole transportation sector. This development will change roles inside the transportation sector. Even now, but especially in the future, decisions regarding the transportation sector will be partly based on emission levels and other externalities originating from transportation in addition to pure transportation costs. There are different factors, which could have an impact on the transportation sector. IMO’s sulphur regulation is estimated to increase the costs of short sea shipping in the Baltic Sea. Price development of energy could change the roles of different transport modes. Higher awareness of the environmental impacts originating from transportation could also have an impact on the price level of more polluting transport modes. According to earlier research, increased inland transportation, modal shift and slowsteaming can be possible results of these changes in the transportation sector. Possible changes in the transportation sector and ways to settle potential obstacles are studied in this dissertation. Furthermore, means to improve cost-efficiency and to decrease environmental impacts originating from transportation are researched. Hypothetical Finnish dry port network and Rail Baltica transport corridor are studied in this dissertation. Benefits and disadvantages are studied with different methodologies. These include gravitational models, which were optimized with linear integer programming, discrete-event and system dynamics simulation, an interview study and a case study. Geographical focus is on the Baltic Sea Region, but the results can be adapted to other geographical locations with discretion. Results indicate that the dry port concept has benefits, but optimization regarding the location and the amount of dry ports plays an important role. In addition, the utilization of dry ports for freight transportation should be carefully operated, since only a certain amount of total freight volume can be cost-efficiently transported through dry ports. If dry ports are created and located without proper planning, they could actually increase transportation costs and delivery times of the whole transportation system. With an optimized dry port network, transportation costs can be lowered in Finland with three to five dry ports. Environmental impacts can be lowered with up to nine dry ports. If more dry ports are added to the system, the benefits become very minor, i. e. payback time of investments becomes extremely long. Furthermore, dry port network could support major transport corridors such as Rail Baltica. Based on an analysis of statistics and interview study, there could be enough freight volume available for Rail Baltica, especially, if North-West Russia is part of the Northern end of the corridor. Transit traffic to and from Russia (especially through the Baltic States) plays a large role. It could be possible to increase transit traffic through Finland by connecting the potential Finnish dry port network and the studied transport corridor. Additionally, <b>sulphur</b> <b>emission</b> <b>regulation</b> is assumed to increase the attractiveness of Rail Baltica in the year 2015. Part of the transit traffic could be rerouted along Rail Baltica instead of the Baltic Sea, since the price level of sea transport could increase due to the sulphur regulation. Both, the hypothetical Finnish dry port network and Rail Baltica transport corridor could benefit each other. The dry port network could gain more market share from Russia, but also from Central Europe, which is the other end of Rail Baltica. In addition, further Eastern countries could also be connected to achieve higher potential freight volume by rail...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, {{alternative}} fuels, such as wood and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), are increasingly being used in Sweden for heat and power production. The positive environmental impact in terms of <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>emissions,</b> no net emission of CO 2 to the atmosphere, and local availability are main driving forces in this development. The sustainable society concept requires the recycling or deposition of inorganic substances as agricultural nutrients (energy crops) or harmless land fills (MSW). However, utilisation of alternative fuels also introduces new environmental hazards, resulting from the enrichment of heavy metals, such as Cd, in the combustion residues. Rather than their net concentrations alone, availability and solubility together determine the amounts of ash which may be deposited in land fills or used in agriculture. Consequently, long term risk assessment must include knowledge of the chemical speciation of the heavy metals, by which is meant their coordination numbers, oxidation states, and the local chemical properties of the host compounds. In this study, MSW and biomass fly ash particles are being investigated (i) in the bulk, {{to determine whether or}} not the Cd concentration exhibits dependence on particle size, and (ii) within single particles, to determine the Cd distribution and speciation. Based on this, possible chemical transformation routes of Cd are proposed. For the first time, a combination of synchrotron radiation x-ray microprobe techniques is used here to investigate the Cd distribution and in situ speciation within single biomass and MSW fly ash particles. Cd distribution within single particles and any inter-elemental correlations are investigated by Synchrotron Radiation induced micro-X-ray Fluorescence (&# 956;-SRXRF) spectrometry; Cd speciation at single spots on individual ash particles is studied by Synchrotron Radiation induced micro-X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (&# 956;-SRXAS); the crystalline structures of the Cd-containing matrices are identified from Synchrotron Radiation induced micro-X-ray diffraction (&# 956;-SRXRD) patterns, while Cd internal elemental distribution is established by Synchrotron Radiation induced micro X-ray Fluorescence Tomography (&# 956;-SRXRFT) experiments. Analysis of MSW fly ash particles indicates Cd to be preferentially concentrated in small areas with local concentrations up to 200 ppm, so called hot-spots. In contrast, a more homogeneous Cd distribution is found in case of biomass fly ashes. &# 956;-XRT results show the Cd concentration to be higher in the cores of the fly ash particles than on the particles surfaces. In both ashes, Ca-containing matrices are found to be the main Cd-bearing phases. In both kinds of ash, comparisons of XAS spectra of fly ashes with reference compounds show Cd to be present exclusively in oxidation state + 2, and mainly as CdSO 4, CdO and CdCl 2. Although previous studies have indicated Cd to be enriched in the smaller-size ash particles, both bulk and single particle investigations presented in this study tell of similar Cd concentrations throughout all the particle sizes investigated. Bulk analysis of representative MSW fly ash samples give a 134 mg/kg dry ash Cd concentration, as compared to 34 mg/kg dry ash of fly ash from biomass combustion. In particular the latter exceeds the Swedish National Forestry Board recommendations of 30 mg/kg dry ash Cd concentration for maximum trace metal levels in recycled wood ash. Based on the results obtained, possible reaction mechanisms involving Cd are suggested, stressing the necessity to include information regarding the different mineral matrices constituting the ash particles...|$|R

40|$|Decrease {{in carbon}} dioxide {{emissions}} was not the driver when shipping started to investigate fuel alternatives to replace the traditional heavy fuel oil. Instead it was regulations of sulphur contents in fuel in <b>sulphur</b> <b>emission</b> control areas (SECA). The dominating driving forces for a ship-owner to change fuel are regulations and price. The result will thus be an economic based fuel choice among those fuels fulfilling present regulations rather than a long term sustainable alternative. A fuel change is usually also connected to a capital cost for conversion and infrastructure {{that has to be}} compensated by lower fuel price. Fuels used in SECA areas today are <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> marine gas oil (LSMGO), “hybrid fuels” (heavy fuel oils that has been blended to <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> contents), LNG or methanol.

However, in the past years, the economic incentive has changed from a favourable situation for the “clean” fuels like LNG or methanol towards traditional fuels fulfilling only sulphur regulations. Decisions are today based entirely on the fast changing prices, providing a selection of fuels that fulfil only present regulations and excluding possible future regulations or customer demands. The long-term pathway towards sustainability with a change into fossil free fuel production is not taken into account. In the paper, the relation between the many possible drivers as well as the implications of market changes for decrease of greenhouse gas emissions will be further discussed...|$|R
