50|$|Continuous {{trenching}} involves using a large cutting chain excavator system {{then using}} the trench box and hopper to continuously back-fill the trench with reactive media. Continuous trenching can be fast and thus, inexpensive, but {{can only be}} used for trenches less than 50 feet deep. In addition, the machinery used for this technique cannot be used effectively for soil with <b>large</b> <b>cobbles.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During {{reconstruction}} (see below) limited excavations {{were conducted}} at Newtown Castle. The {{results indicated that}} the castle may be late 16th or early 17th century, rather than mid-16th century. Signs of the presence of a significant population (animal and shellfish remains and a <b>large</b> <b>cobbled</b> space) were also discovered in the area. This gave rise to speculation whether the name [...] "Newtown" [...] may actually have referred to a new settlement near the castle.|$|R
50|$|At 3.9 meters, {{a gravel}} lens seals the site, with all deeper {{material}} being pre-Clovis in age (Lopinot et al. 1998:41).

One {{is a large}} tabular stone, possibly an anvilstone, broken into three pieces {{and the other is}} a <b>large</b> <b>cobble</b> (Bush 2006; Chandler 2001b; Ray et al. 2000). Both of these artifacts display evidence of possible human modification. In addition, the gravel layer contains many flakes.|$|R
5000|$|Barry {{spent over}} 10 years {{improving}} the house, {{as well as}} adding a new block including state bedrooms and dressing rooms, as well as servant's quarters, a sculpture gallery, and a clock tower. This interesting complex, with its clock tower, is generally known as the Riding School, designed in 1840 and built between 1841-50. It stands on the perimeter of a <b>large</b> <b>cobbled</b> stableyard, and represents the last major addition to, and almost sole survivor of the once-exciting and impressive Trentham Hall.|$|R
50|$|It prefers wetted rock {{faces of}} springs and flowing water, with <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> and boulders. The {{principal}} {{threat to the}} Bruneau hot springsnail is the reduction and/or elimination of its geothermal habitats {{as a result of}} groundwater withdrawal, primarily for agriculture. Spring temperatures are the predominant factor that determines the springsnail's distribution and abundance; the springsnail requires constant springwater temperatures to survive.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Habitat and distribution=== This snail is {{believed}} to be confined to the Snake River, inhabiting areas of swift current on the undersides of <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> and boulder-sized rocks. In 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported the known modern range of the species to be from Grandview, Idaho (ca. RM 487) to the Hagerman Reach of the Snake River (ca. RM 573).|$|E
50|$|Well {{below the}} Gainey point, {{at a depth}} of 3.7 to 3.8 meters were found three <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> {{identified}} as manuports and three flakes (Lopinot et al. 1998:41). Given that their size is much larger than other material deposited by the river and the small grain of the surrounding soil, it has been judged doubtful that they were moved to this location by the river, but natural action cannot be ruled out entirely.|$|E

50|$|Northern DPS green {{sturgeon}} migrate up the Klamath River between late February and late July (Moyle 2002). The spawning period is March-July, with a peak from mid-April to mid-June (Moyle 2002). Spawning {{takes place in}} deep, fast water (Moyle 2002). Preferred spawning substrate is likely <b>large</b> <b>cobble,</b> but it can range from clean sand to bedrock (Moyle 2002). Eggs are broadcast and externally fertilized in relatively fast water and probably in depths greater than 3 m (Moyle 2002). Female {{green sturgeon}} produce 59,000-242,000 eggs, about 4.34 millimeters (mm) in diameter (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001 and 2006).|$|R
50|$|First {{patients}} {{admitted to}} Mont Park were all farm workers and artisans who {{laid out the}} farm, roads and gardens. In 1912 at Mont Park there were blacksmiths, workshop employees and 110 carpenters. 212 patients were employed in farming duties and 106 worked in the gardens. Excess produce not required by other asylums was sold.The farm buildings were extensive with hay sheds, store rooms for vegetables, glass houses and pig and calf pens. Only remnants of these buildings remain and are used by La Trobe University as store rooms. These buildings wereconstructed around a <b>large</b> <b>cobbled</b> basalt courtyard. The largest building was the milking shed, which had a well-laid brick floor, cambered and angled for drainage.|$|R
50|$|Hammersley Fork flows over bedrock or <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> {{for much}} of the stretch between Dry Hollow and Nelson Branch. From the mouth of Nelson Branch to 2 mi downstream, the stream mostly flows in the central part of its valley. The {{tributary}} Nelson Branch has a patch of erosion that is 8 m high and 18 m long.

5000|$|Historically, {{the common}} {{building}} {{material in the}} area has been brick or cobbles - extant buildings in brick date to {{as early as the}} late 17th century, alternatively <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> have also been used in the area for building construction - several structures of this type survive in the town, dating to the late 17th, 18th or 19th century, including some listed buildings, utilising cobbles or cobbles with brick. [...] The Old Hall in Hornsea Market Place dates to the early 17th century, and is built of brick on cobble foundations.|$|E
50|$|Bartlett Pond has water {{depths of}} {{slightly}} over a meter. The {{bottom of the}} pond {{is made up of}} fine silt and clay muds with <b>large</b> <b>cobbles,</b> clasts and boulders in some places left behind by the retreat of the glaciers. In a study conducted by University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 2013 and again in 2014, X-ray fluorescence data shows slightly higher abundance of lead and zinc within the upper 50 centimeters of sediment cores taken out of the pond. These elements are common in the shallowest sediments of many ponds throughout the Northeast US, left behind by industrial pollution and leaded gas emissions.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface of}} the bank partly {{consists}} of gravel and <b>larger</b> <b>cobbles.</b> Due to the relatively great depth of the Cleaver Bank, the soil is only seldom, in very heavy weather, moved by wave action. Because the gravel is relatively poor in silt and the transparency is great, there is enough light enough {{to allow for the}} growth of calcareous red algae. The benthic fauna on the bank contains species that live on a hard substrate, such as sea anemones and polyps. Rare species living on Cleaver Bank are Thracia convexa and the Rayed artemis. The bank is used by herring for spawning. In addition, the soft coral type dead man's finger is found here.|$|R
50|$|The black redhorse usually {{lives in}} {{moderately}} sized rivers and streams, 25 to 130 m wide, up to 1.8 m in depth, and with generally moderate to fast currents. It is rarely found associated with aquatic vegetation. Substrates include rubble, gravel, sand, boulders and silt. In summer, they generally prefer pools and overwinter in deeper pools. In the spring, black redhorse migrate to spawning habitats. Spring spawning {{has been observed}} in riffle habitats at water temperatures between 15 °C and 21 °C, and over a variety of substrates from fine gravel to <b>large</b> <b>cobble.</b> Eggs are nonadhesive and {{range in size from}} 2.6 to 2.9 mm. The age at maturity is between two and six years. Lifespan increases with latitude and some individuals reach 16 years of age.|$|R
5000|$|The orangethroat darter (Etheostoma spectabile) is {{a species}} of darter endemic to the central and eastern United States where it is native to parts of the Mississippi River Basin and Lake Erie Basin. Its typical habitat {{includes}} shallow gravel riffles in cooler streams and rocky runs and pools in headwaters, creeks, and small rivers, with sand, gravel, rubble, or rock substrates. It forages on the bottom for the aquatic larvae of midges, blackfly, mayfly and caddisfly, as well as isopods and amphipods. Spawning takes place in spring, the selected sites often being the upper stretches of riffles with sandy and gravelly bottoms interspersed with <b>larger</b> <b>cobble.</b> Reproductive success is high in this species. No particular threats have been identified, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
50|$|The Roman {{road from}} Manchester to Carlisle {{ran through the}} area. Excavations in advance of an {{extension}} to Penrith Cemetery showed that the road survived better {{at the edges of}} the field. The cobble and gravel surfaces appeared to have been entirely ploughed out at the centre. The road was constructed by excavating a wide, shallow trench below the level of subsoil. <b>Large</b> <b>cobbles</b> were probably obtained from nearby, as they did not appear frequently within the subsoil in the excavated area. The cobbles were added to the excavated subsoil and this was dumped back into the cut to form a stable foundation, which was raised in the centre of the road to form a camber.|$|E
50|$|These megaliths are {{distinguished}} from other types {{by the presence}} of a burial shaft, sometimes up to 4 m in depth, which is lined with <b>large</b> <b>cobbles.</b> A large capstone is placed over the burial shaft without propping stones. Capstone-style megaliths are the most monumental type in the Korean Peninsula, and they are primarily distributed near or on the south coast of Korea. It seems that most of these burials date to {{the latter part of the}} Middle Mumun (c. 700-550 BC), and they may have been built into the early part of the Late Mumun. An example is found near modern Changwon at Deokcheon-ni, where a small cemetery contained a capstone burial (No. 1) with a massive, rectangularly shaped, stone and earthen platform. Archaeologists were not able to recover the entire feature, but the low platform was at least 56×18 m in size.|$|E
50|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to refine the Udden-Wentworth scale, including its definition of cobbles. In 1968, D. J. Doeglas proposed subdividing the cobble designation into two fractions, small cobbles (for particles with diameters from 64 - 125 mm) and <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> (for particles with diameters from 125 - 250 mm). A 1999 paper by Terence C. Blair and John G. McPherson argued that the Udden-Wentworth and Krumbein scales betrayed a historical emphasis on the study of sand grains while ignoring larger gravel grains. They proposed defining fine cobbles as those with diameters from 64 - 128 mm (−6 to −7 φ) and coarse cobbles as those with diameters from 128 - 256 mm (−7 to −8 φ). In 2012, Simon J. Blott and Kenneth Pye suggested that the cobble designation be eliminated altogether, replaced by very small boulder and small boulder designations equivalent in size to Blair and McPherson's fine and coarse cobbles, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The gilt darter (Percina evides) {{is a small}} {{freshwater}} fish in the genus Percina, a ray-finned fish in the perch family. It {{can be found in}} a number of states in the Mississippi River drainage of the United States although it has been extirpated from some river systems in which it was at one time present, mostly due to siltation and pollution problems. Males are more colorful than females and can grow to a length of about 9 cm. It is a benthic fish that feeds primarily on small aquatic insect larvae. Males form territories during the breeding season in late spring and early summer. Spawning typically takes place at the upper ends of riffles with sandy and gravelly bottoms interspersed with <b>larger</b> <b>cobbles.</b> Some organisations are endeavouring to conserve populations of the gilt darter and re-introduce it to states where the fish has been extirpated but suitable habitat still exists.|$|R
50|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the presumed Greco-Roman church {{underlying}} the existing building. The oldest part of the extant buildings is the original 8th century Carolingian crypt. This is quadrangular with signature rounded external corners. It has a floor of <b>large</b> herringbone-laid <b>cobbles</b> and {{is believed to be}} unique. Some remnants of early carved capitals are now incorporated into the 12th century north tower.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reproductive}} {{season of}} the gilt darter is in the spring. Southern populations {{have been reported to}} begin the breeding season earlier than northern populations. Ripe females were caught in Arkansas as early as late April and early May. In Virginia, gilt darters were reported to spawn in May. In Missouri, breeding males were reported to be found in late May. In Minnesota, breeding typically occurred over a 6-week period in June and July, although it began in middle May in one year. Water temperatures at the time of breeding were 16-23˚C. Breeding was observed in the Little River of Tennessee from early June through early July. Males were observed establishing specific territories for breeding. They were reported to spawn at temperatures of 17-20 degrees Celsius. Ideal spawning habitat was at the upper ends of riffles with sandy and gravelly bottoms interspersed with <b>larger</b> <b>cobble.</b> [...] Females produced from 130-400 eggs which hatch and mature past the larval stage within 2 weeks.|$|R

40|$|Using {{a variety}} of {{sampling}} techniques and observations we describe aspects of the reproductive ecology and early life-history of Bear Lake sculpin, Cottus extensus, a species endemic to Bear Lake, Utah-Idaho. Adult sculpin spawned in shallow water (0. 5 – 6. 0 m depths) in cavities beneath <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> and boulders. During 1993, egg mass densities were highest (3 ̆e 4. 0 m 2) at 1. 0 – 2. 0 m depths. Electivity indices verified substrate selection and also indicated an avoidance of s and- and gravel-embedded materials.

40|$|Effects of {{sediment}} bypass tunnel (SBT) on environmental {{recovery of the}} degraded channels below dams, which were suggested by Awazu et al. (2015), were further examined by aerial photos using a drone. Coarse bed materials such as boulders were more represented below than above the Koshibu Dam, where SBT {{had not been in}} operation yet. The coarse bed materials protruded into the water column or formed steps, which increased slow-flow areas below the Koshibu Dam. On the other hand, sand, gravel, and cobbles dominated below as in above the Asahi Dam, where SBT had been operated for more than 17 years. Although bed characteristics below Asahi Dam seem to have almost recovered to a pre-dam state, less representation of <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> and boulders may suggest limitations of SBT system to transport downstream full sizes {{of sediment}} especially for the coarsest class of the bedload materials...|$|E
50|$|Outside of Africa where {{cleavers}} {{were most}} abundant, cleavers {{have appeared in}} Southwestern Europe. In these regions, they are more abundant than hand axes where raw material occurs {{in the form of}} <b>large</b> quartzite <b>cobbles</b> that do not need extensive decortication and shaping prior to the removal of large flakes. Cleavers can also be found made out of different raw materials such as flint or limestone, but these are not nearly as common.|$|R
50|$|The down {{platform}} of Ashton Park Parade station was located {{on what is}} now a grass site to the south of Ashton's Park Parade Bypass and before the construction of the Bypass the down platform was approached directly from the end of Warrington Street where there was a <b>large</b> <b>cobbled</b> yard for passenger and parcel vehicles. The up platform stood {{on the edge of the}} escarpment, supported by arches and overlooking Lower Wharf Street. To the east of this platform were coal staithes where coal was dropped into vehicles wwaiting below in the coal yard. The lines serving the coal staithes were controlled by a signal box located on the opposite side of the line and just to the east of the down line platform where there was also a substantial goods siding. When the sidings were built Ashton’s Old Baronial Hall was demolished to make way for them. These sidings occupied the land where the Bypass runs between the Parish Church and the railway line with the only remaining signs of the sidings being two wooden buildings in Church Street which once served the goods yard.|$|R
5000|$|Prime {{spawning}} {{habitat for}} the blacktail shiner is in fractional crevices; generally located in flowing water, preferring crevices in current velocities of 0.30 m/s. Populations in reservoirs chose crevice sites in locations of much lower current speeds. [...] In the Blanco River, Texas, blacktail shiners were observed depositing eggs underneath small boulders and <b>large</b> <b>cobble</b> in a bedrock riffle in the swiftest current velocities available. Males respond to sounds produced by spawning females {{and are able}} to distinguish these sounds from those produced by related female red shiners. Males are territorial, defending a crevice from other males. Breeding pair swims along the crevice, the female deposits eggs; usually the sperm has already been released into the crevice, so the eggs are deposited into a crevice with viable sperm. Immediately after spawning, the male doubles back and eats any eggs that failed to make it into the crevice. Small males (sneakers) try to fertilize eggs by darting between the dominant male and spawning female. Both large and small males will enter another male's territory and deposit sperm in a crevice before the male courts a female to lay eggs in the crevice.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to these “classic clam gardens,” local knowledge and the archaeological record indicate that people cleared portions of beaches to enhance production but did not necessarily build walls (Caldwell et al. 2012). Based on field observations, whether a wall was built depends on the size and slope of the beach, {{and the location of}} the sea shelf, and possibly local ecological factors. Furthermore, we note that some fish traps/holding ponds are cleared of rocks at particular tidal heights, possibly to enhance clam production. Clearing beaches of <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> may increase spat recruitment but determining this requires ecological experiments. Finally, we have noted that the very building of a clam garden wall, or any intertidal or sub-tidal rock feature (e.g., the stone piles used to anchor reef nets) creates habitat for a variety of valued species, such as sea cucumbers, crabs, and small fish. Although archaeologists have largely missed these subtle manipulations of marine ecosystems, they represent an important part of ancient management systems.|$|E
40|$|In {{field studies}} of the late Tertiary Ash Hollow Formation of the Ogallala Group in western Nebraska the {{alluvial}} deposits are composed of large volumes of sand and gravel up to <b>large</b> <b>cobbles.</b> Because the current understanding of the climate of the region {{at the time of}} deposition does not provide for a source for deposits of this character, a scanning electron microscopic study of the surface features on the quartz sand grains from these sediments was undertaken. Nine samples, collected from locations in Banner, Morrill and Keith Counties, were examined to see if they had one or more of 22 surface features. The results were compared with models for glacial, glacio-fluvial and fluvial sand compiled from the work of others. Preliminary results indicate that two of the samples correspond well with the glacial model, five others correspond with the glacio-fluvial model and none corresponds well with the fluvial model. These results indicate the need to look further for corroborating evidence of a glacial source for {{at least part of the}} Ash Hollow Formation and to consider the implications for a partial glacial history of the mountain sediment source regions in the late Tertiary...|$|E
40|$|Three {{heavy fuel}} oil (HFO) tanks with diameters of up to 60 m, a pump station, a pump shed station and a vent stack station have {{recently}} been constructed {{as part of the}} HFO Tank Farm in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The project was located in an area near the sea with high groundwater level. The ground was composed of 11 to 12 m of silty sand and gravel with cobbles and boulders with diameters up to 300 mm followed by limestone. The preliminary soil investigation using Standard Penetration Test (SPT) indicated that while the soil was generally dense, but a loose layer of sand was identified and soil improvement was stipulated. During later stages, a supplementary geotechnical investigation using the Menard Pressuremeter Test (PMT) indicated that the high SPT blow counts were not representative of the actual ground conditions and that due to the presence of the <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> the soil had erroneously been represented as dense. In fact, the soil was loose from the surface down to bedrock. Dynamic Compaction was used to improve the soil's strength and to reduce its compressibility. PMT in conjunction with finite element analysis were used to verify the ground condition after ground treatment...|$|E
40|$|Although most {{populations of}} lake trout Salvelinus {{namaycush}} spawn over rocky shoals, {{use of these}} substrates by lake trout {{has not yet been}} found in Lake Tahoe. <b>Large</b> <b>cobble</b> substrate exists at depths less than 20 m, and steep, fractured, rocky substrate can be found in isolated areas from the surface down to at least 100 m, but no evidence of spawning activity in these areas has been found. Instead, at least a portion of the population spawns on deepwater mounds (40 – 60 m deep) over beds of the macrophyte Chara delicatula. This is the first known report of lake trout spawning over macrophyte beds. We hypothesize that this population originated from a deep-spawning stock and that the macrophyte beds on these mounds may provide some of the best deepwater incubation habitat in the lake, Although egg predation by intermediate sizes of lake trout (375 – 500 mm fork length) was substantial, the mounds appeared to be a refuge from the potentially more effective invertebrate and small vertebrate egg predators. The oxygen and temperature regime within the macrophytes was suitable for egg development, and the eggs that infiltrated deeply among the plant strands were anchored against currents and were presumably protected from further predation by lake trout...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Springer and can be found at: [URL] modeled patch occupancy to examine factors that best predicted the prevalence of four functionally important focal stream consumers (Tallaperla spp., Cambarus spp., Pleurocera proxima, and Cottus bairdi) among 37 reaches within the Little Tennessee River basin of the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. We compared 34 models of patch occupancy to examine the association of catchment and reach scale factors that varied as a result of converting forest to agricultural or urban land use. Occupancy of our taxa was linked to parameters reflecting both catchment and reach extent characteristics. At the catchment level, forest cover or its conversion to agriculture was a major determinant of occupancy for all four taxa. Patch occupancies of Tallaperla, Cambarus, and C. bairdi were positively, and Pleurocera negatively, correlated with forest cover. Secondarily at the reach level, local availability of large woody debris was important for Cambarus, availability of <b>large</b> <b>cobble</b> substrate was important for C. bairdi, and stream calcium concentration was important for P. proxima. Our results show the abundance of stream organisms was determined by the taxon-dependent interplay between catchment- and reach-level factors...|$|R
