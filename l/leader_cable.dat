500|$|The Ambrose Channel pilot cable, {{also called}} the Ambrose Channel <b>leader</b> <b>cable,</b> was a cable laid in Ambrose Channel at the {{entrance}} to the Port of New York and New Jersey that provided an audio tone for guiding ships in and out of port at times of low visibility.

500|$|The Ambrose <b>leader</b> <b>cable</b> was {{an armored}} cable {{with a single}} {{internal}} conductor (see picture) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the Channel floor. It originated at Fort Lafayette (near the present day Verrazano-Narrows Bridge), then extended 16 miles down the Ambrose Channel to the vicinity of Lightship Ambrose offshore. [...] It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500Hz (cycles per second) current at 400volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field {{along the length of}} the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away. [...] The current was mechanically keyed to send the word [...] "NAVY" [...] in Morse Code.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the media}} hype {{described}} above, {{it appears that}} the Ambrose Channel pilot cable never met with large scale commercial success. Initially, some contemporaries of the cable proposed that it be extended several miles past the Ambrose light.

By 1929 the Baltimore Sun reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable. In that year, Marriott publicly complained that navigation cables still had unrealized potential for guiding ships. <b>Leader</b> <b>cable</b> systems appear to have been obsoleted by the refinement of radio direction finding and the placement of radio beacons (low-power radios broadcasting an identifiable signal) at strategic locations.

[...] Once operational, the latter newspaper called it [...] "the greatest safeguard devised for shipping in modern history". [...] According to a 1921 trade magazine, <b>leader</b> <b>cables</b> had five functions: [...] "to enable a ship to make a good landfall in thick weather, to lead a ship up the harbor, to lead a ship from open water through a restricted channel to open water on the far side, to give warning of outlying dangers, and to assist a vessel to keep a straight course from port to port and thus save fuel." ...|$|R
5000|$|At that time, Autoland {{had lower}} {{priority}} because efforts were concentrated on other projects including rapid landing of aircraft for RAF Fighter Command, visual aids for pilots, runway approach lighting and an approach aid using DME with Barbro. That changed when Operational Requirement 947 (OR947) for automatic {{landing on the}} V-Force bomber fleet was issued in 1954. [...] At that time the V-bomber force was the UK's main contribution to the strategic nuclear power of the west [...] and all-weather operation was essential. There was also renewed interest in automatic landing for civil aviation. As {{the next step in}} the development, the flare-out and coupling units from the Devon were linked to a Smiths Type D autopilot and installed in Varsity WF417, a much larger aircraft, capable of carrying 38 people rather than 10 in the Devon. The first fully automatic approach and landing was made by WF417 on 11 November 1954 under calm and misty conditions. [...] A similar system was installed in Canberra WE189 to provide the first application of Autoland to jet-type aircraft. [...] Automatic approaches [...] and automatic landings [...] were recorded by WE189 but the development was interrupted in April 1956 when the facilities at Woodbridge, which had the only suitable <b>leader</b> <b>cable</b> installation, ceased to be available to BLEU. Development of auto-flare and automatic kicking-off drift was continued at RAF Wittering, but in September that year WE189, returning from tests at Wittering, crashed due to engine failure on an approach when returning to its base at Martlesham Heath. The pilot, Flt. Lt. Les Coe, and the BLEU scientist in charge of the project, Mr. Joe Birkle, were killed.|$|E

The MLC system consisted of ground equipment that produced a magnetic field about a wire along runway centerline and airborne equipment that detected the strength and direction of this field and computed displacement and heading. Results of these tests indicate that estimates of aircraft displacement from centerline produced by the magnetic <b>leader</b> <b>cable</b> system using {{either of the two}} algorithms appear to be adequate for use by an automatic control system during rollout, turnoff, and taxi.

Closed loop guidance laws for braking and reverse thrust are derived for rollout, turnoff, and taxi, as functions of the landing speed, the desired taxi speed and the distance to go.
