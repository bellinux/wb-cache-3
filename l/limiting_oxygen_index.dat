50|$|Vinyl siding {{features}} a chlorine base, making it inherently slow to ignite and flame retardant. All organic materials (that is, anything containing carbon) will ignite, but {{the higher the}} temperature a material has to reach before it flames, the safer it is. PVC won’t ignite, even from another flame, until it reaches about 730°F (387°C) and won’t self-ignite until about 850°F (454°C). Those ignition temperatures are significantly higher than common framing lumber, which ignites from a flame at 500°F (260°C) and self-ignites at 770°F (410°C). Also, ASTM D2863 tests show that rigid PVC’s high <b>Limiting</b> <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Index</b> means that it needs unusually high amounts of oxygen to burn and stay burning. Rigid PVC (vinyl siding) will not independently sustain combustion in air with a normal concentration of oxygen (about 21 percent) — so it extinguishes more easily.|$|E
