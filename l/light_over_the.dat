The improvements included a red arc of <b>light</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> hazardous Pearl Rock region. An additional upgrade was made in 1875 when the lamp was switched out for a four-wick mineral oil burner.|$|E

In all, fifty-eight coins have been excavated from Middle Harling, fourteen were found at Burrow Hill (Suffolk) and thirty-five from other places in East Anglia and elsewhere. Over a hundred 'Beonnas' are now known: most of them have been acquired by the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Allies' {{occupation}} of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the Yamato-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of Yamato and Musashi were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to <b>light</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, the loss of the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the Yamato class somewhat difficult. Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{sunlight}} in ozone depletion {{is the reason}} why the Antarctic ozone depletion is greatest during spring. During winter, even though PSCs are at their most abundant, there is no <b>light</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pole to drive chemical reactions. During the spring, however, the sun comes out, providing energy to drive photochemical reactions and melt the polar stratospheric clouds, releasing considerable ClO, which drives the hole mechanism. Further warming temperatures near the end of spring break up the vortex around mid-December. As warm, ozone and -rich air flows in from lower latitudes, the PSCs are destroyed, the enhanced ozone depletion process shuts down, and the ozone hole closes.|$|E
25|$|Rich {{agricultural}} lands led {{the province}} to great prosperity. New hydraulic works increased the extend {{and intensity of}} the irrigation. Olives and grapes had for long been popular products commonly praised; however, the vineyards and orchards had been devastated during the last Punic war; also they were intentionally left to ruin because their produce competed with that of Roman Italia. Instead Africa Province acquired fame {{as the source of}} large quantities of fine wheat, widely exported—though chiefly to Rome. The ancient writers Strabo (64 BC – c. 21 AD), Pliny (23 – c. 79 AD), and Josephus (37 – c. 95 AD) praised the quality of African wheat. The Baradas river valley was acclaimed as productive as the Nile. Later, when Egypt began to supplant Africa Province as the supplier of wheat to Rome, the grape and the olive began reappearing again in the fields of the province, {{toward the end of the}} 1st century. St. Augustine (354–430) wrote that in Africa lamps fueled by olive oil burned well throughout the night, throwing <b>light</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> neighborhoods.|$|E
500|$|Tennis for Two {{was first}} shown on October 18, 1958. The game was {{rendered}} as a horizontal line, representing the tennis court, {{and a short}} vertical line in the center, representing the tennis net. The first player would press the button on their controller to send the ball, a point of <b>light,</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> net, and it would either hit the net, reach {{the other side of}} the court, or fly out of bounds. The second player could then hit the ball back with their controller while it was on their side, either before or after it bounced on the ground. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut. Higinbotham claimed later that [...] "the high schoolers liked it best, you couldn't pull them away from it." [...] Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity. Players could set the game to simulate the gravity levels of the Moon or Jupiter. Higinbotham referred to the game as Tennis for Two, though a placard attached to the 1959 version titled it [...] "Computer Tennis". After the 1959 exhibition, the game was dismantled so its components could be put to other uses.|$|E

Defying the laws of gravity and seemingly outside of spacetime, his paintings of this period evoke a state of suspended animation, a dream-world as conceived by Mallarmé.

Sister Vincenza had noted the pope had not touched the coffee she had left for him in the sacristy at 5:15am (after about ten minutes) and went looking for him but found him dead, and hastily summoned Marin who also went into the room. Marin testified that Luciani's hands were cold, and she was struck by the darkness of his nails. Sister Vincenza said: [...] "He hasn't come out yet? Why not? and knocked a few more times but heard silence, then opening the door and walking in. Marin remained in the hallway but heard the elder sister say: [...] "Your Holiness, you shouldn't pull these jokes on me" [...] because Sister Vincenza also had heart problems. Marin further testified that original information provided by the Vatican regarding who discovered the pope was wrong, since it had originally been claimed the pope's secretaries Lorenzi and Magee did. Marin testified that [...] "he was in bed with a slight smile" [...] on his face. The reading <b>light</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> headboard was still on, with his two pillows under his back propping him up, with his legs outstretched and his arms on top of the bedsheets.
