40|$|In this alert, NIOSH {{warned that}} crane {{operators}} and crew members may be electrocuted when working near overhead power lines. Five cases were described {{which resulted in}} six electrocutions. Case 1 involved a 29 year old who pushed the crane cable on a 1 yard cement bucket into a 7, 200 volt power line. Case 2 involved a 33 year old well driller who was electrocuted when a metal pipe lifted by a truck <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> contacted a 12, 000 volt overhead power line. The third case involved a 24 year old foreman for a telecommunications company who was electrocuted when he grabbed the door handle of a truck <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> whose boom was in contact with a 7, 200 volt overhead power line. Case 4 involved a 37 year old construction laborer electrocuted while pulling a wire rope attached to a crane cable toward a load. The fifth case involved a 20 year old male truck driver and his 70 year old male employer who were electrocuted when the boom of a truck <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> contacted a 7, 200 volt conductor of an overhead power line. Recommendations were made to train workers to comply with current regulations, to ensure that overhead power lines are deenergized or separated from the crane and its load, to designate a person to observe the clearance and give immediate warning when the crane approaches the limits of safe clearance, and not to use cage type boom guards, insulating links or proximity warning devices {{as a substitute for}} deenergizing and grounding lines or maintaining safe clearance.

50|$|Before 1870 crane {{were fixed}} to a position, {{except for some}} mounted on flatcars, which {{provided}} some restricted movement. Appleby Brothers demonstrated steam-powered cranes at Paris in 1867 and Vienna in 1873. In 1922, Henry Coles, manager of Appleby Corp., began producing truck-mounted cranes under the name Petrol Electric Lorry Crane. In 1939 the Coles were acquired by Steel and Co. Ltd. of Sunderland. Hiab invented the world's first hydraulic truck <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> in 1947. The name, Hiab, comes from the commonly used abbreviation of Hydrauliska Industri AB, a company founded in Hudiksvall, Sweden 1944 by Eric Sundin, a ski manufacturer who saw a way to utilize a truck's engine to power loader cranes {{through the use of}} hydraulics.|$|R

[...] However, tension between pickets and strike-breaking lorry drivers rose on 3 February when Fred Matthews, a miner from the Doncaster area, was struck and killed by a lorry speeding out of Keadby Power Station, near Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire. Matthews was one of 50 miners manning the picket line. The <b>lorry</b> <b>mounted</b> the pavement, [...] "scattering pickets", and failed to stop after hitting Matthews. Police officers on duty at the picket line had to use cars belonging to miners to pursue the lorry, and brought it to a halt around a mile from the scene of the incident.|$|R

40|$|Staff {{is proposing}} {{to address issues}} {{regarding}} two-engine on-road and off-road cranes by making both engines of two-engine cranes subject to the In-Use Off-Road Diesel Vehicle regulation and to remove the upper engines from the Portable ATCM regulation performance requirements. These issues facing the crane operators are related to safety and feasibility of repowering or retrofitting crane engines, and the complexity and unnecessary cost associated with complying with multiple regulations without any appreciable emission benefits. Two-engine cranes are defined as mobile diesel-powered machines with a hoisting mechanism mounted on a specially constructed truck chassis or carrier; one engine provides motive power, and a secondary engine is used to lift and move materials and objects. There are three general categories of two-engine cranes: lattice boom (conventional), all terrain or truck mounted. All terrain and truck <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> are very similar and can be categorized as truck <b>mounted</b> hydraulic <b>cranes.</b> The motive or drive engine is on-road engine. The secondary engine is off-road engine. B. Issues Concerns by crane operators regarding on-road cranes raised late during the off-road regulatory development process {{and could not be}} evaluated and workshopped in time to include them in the off-road regulation. The crane owners and operators requested that the two-engine cranes be included in the In-Use Off-Road Diesel Regulation...|$|R
