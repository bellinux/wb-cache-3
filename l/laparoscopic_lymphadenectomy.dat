30|$|<b>Laparoscopic</b> transperitoneal <b>lymphadenectomy</b> in gynaecological {{oncology}} {{was first}} described by Dargent and Salvatin in 1989. The first <b>laparoscopic</b> extraperitoneal para-aortic <b>lymphadenectomy</b> {{was described by}} Vasilev and McGonigle in 1996 [6].|$|R
30|$|To our knowledge, {{there is}} very limited {{published}} data as regards {{to the use of}} Ultracision for <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomies</b> [23, 24]. Our data supports the evidence from other researchers and compares favourably with the results of other studies that used electrosurgery for this procedure.|$|R
30|$|<b>Laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> is {{becoming}} increasingly common {{in the management of}} gynaecological malignancies, either in isolation or in combination with a vaginal procedure.|$|E
30|$|The {{laparoscopy}} {{approach is}} feasible {{in the most}} of the cases. Age is not a contraindication, in our experience, for <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> approach.|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, {{different}} authors independently developed techniques for pelvic and paraaortic lymph node sampling. Since then, <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> {{has been demonstrated}} to yield {{the same number of}} nodes when compared with the laparotomic approach. Only one microscopically involved lymph node was lost at <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> when a laparotomic control followed immediately after. It seems bleeding, which is the most serious perioperative complication, is more common during <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> than during laparotomy; however, the incidence will decrease with experience of the surgeon. The laparoscopic procedure does not seem to influence negatively the survival of patients with early stage endometrial and cervical cancer. There {{does not seem to be}} a significant reduction in overall hospital charges for laparoscopic surgery in oncology, but patients who undergo laparoscopic surgery recover significantly sooner than those who undergo laparotomy...|$|E

30|$|The laparoscopic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy opened new {{perspectives}} for gynecological oncology. Besides an exact staging {{of patients with}} cervical or endometrial cancer, <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> allows new therapeutic strategies in patients with gynecological malignancies. Pelvic and paraaortal lymph node dissection, {{as part of the}} staging surgery for cervical and endometrial carcinoma, interrupts the afferent lymphatics. The higher acceptance by the community of gyn-oncologists was after finding that <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> can be performed in the majority of patients and is associated with a low complication rate.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to prove the {{surgical}} and oncological safety of radical vaginal trachelectomy (RVT) and <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> for patients with early-stage cervical cancer who are seeking parenthood. Methods: A database of 225 patients with early-stage cervical cancer and intention to treat by RVTafter <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> was prospectively maintained. A total of 212 patients were treated according to the protocol. The procedure was preformed in a standardized manner, and life table analysis was applied. Results: In the cohort of patients treated according to protocol, 8 recurrences occurred and 4 patients died from recurrence. The median follow-up time was 37 months (range, 0 - 171 months). The 5 -year recurrence-free and overall survival was 94. 4 % and 97. 4 %, respectively. Perioperative and short-term postoperative complications were rare (2. 8 % and 7. 5 %, respectively). No severe long-term complications occurred. Conclusions: Radical vaginal trachelectomy combined with <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> is a safe method for treatment of patients with early-stage cervical cancer who are seeking parenthood.

30|$|In our opinion, Ultracision {{could become}} a first choice {{instrument}} for <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy,</b> as it enables simultaneous safe tissue dissection, haemostasis and cutting. We think that its favourable features will encourage more surgeons to perform laparoscopic lymphadenectomies.|$|E
30|$|Material and Methods: We {{realized}} 10 extraperitoneal <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> between 2012 and 2013. We {{analyzed the}} operative time, {{the number of}} lymph nodes, the loss of hemoglobine, the hospital stay and the complications during and after surgery.|$|E

30|$|<b>Laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> {{was first}} {{described}} using bipolar diathermy and scissors, and this {{remains to be}} the standard technique.

30|$|Discussion: By <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> an {{adequate}} number of lymph nodes {{can be removed}} in {{an adequate}} time. In 21 cases pelvic nodes and 13 cases paraaortic nodes were positive. The complication rate is low and can be minimized by standardization of the procedure.|$|E
30|$|The <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>lymphadenectomy</b> {{described}} in this case report was well tolerated by the patient. An advantage of the laparoscopic approach was the clear presentation of the anatomical structures [20, 27].

30|$|Results: The {{surgical}} treatment was in 9 cases (16, 7 %) radical hysterectomy, in 6 cases (11, 1 %) laparoscopic transperitoneal pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, in 16 cases (29, 6 %) <b>laparoscopic</b> extraperitoneal para-aortic <b>lymphadenectomy</b> and in 6 cases (11, 1 %) <b>laparoscopic</b> transperitoneal para-aortic <b>lymphadenectomy.</b> 6 women had pelvic recurrence,the overall mortality was 22, 2 %.|$|R
