5|$|After Prince died in 1899 he was {{replaced}} by the Reverend John Hugh Smyth-Pigott. Around 1890, Smyth-Pigott again started leading meetings of the community and recruited 50 young female followers to supplement the ageing population of Agapemonites. He took Ruth Anne Preece as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Hallelujah. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false teachings and made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime, if he will claim that he was a god another time, which did come true as in the <b>life</b> <b>time</b> of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he stopped claiming being a god. After the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he claimed again being god and was sentenced to death and died.|$|E

25|$|The polymer {{electrolyte}} {{have a small}} {{deterioration of}} conductivity by a thermal degradation mechanism of the conductive polymer. The electrical conductivity decreased, {{as a function of}} time, in agreement with a granular metal type structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the conductive polymer grains. The <b>life</b> <b>time</b> of polymer electrolytic capacitors is specified in similar terms to the non-solid electrolytic caps, but its <b>life</b> <b>time</b> calculation follows other rules which lead to much longer operational life times.|$|E
