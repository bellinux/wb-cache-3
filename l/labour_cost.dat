5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in <b>labour</b> <b>cost.</b> To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E

As part of their statistical work, ILO maintains several databases. This database covers 11 major data series for over 200 countries. In addition, ILO publishes a number of compilations of labour statistics, such as the Key Indicators of Labour Markets (KILM). KILM covers 20 main indicators on labour participation rates, employment, unemployment, educational attainment, <b>labour</b> <b>cost,</b> and economic performance. Many of these indicators have been prepared by other organizations. For example, the Division of International Labour Comparisons of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics prepares the hourly compensation in manufacturing indicator.|$|E

40|$|This article showcases ongoing {{work within}} ONS {{to develop a}} new unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> {{indicator}} for the UK by building upon the existing unit wage costs series. It begins by examining the concept of unit wage costs, describing what the series aims to measure and explaining some of the conceptual difficulties when estimating data in practice. The first issue concerns the series used to measure the <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of employees; wages and salaries are currently used instead of the more comprehensive compensation of employees (CoE) series. Secondly, the <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of the self-employed are not satisfactorily estimated by the current method. Two possible methods {{for the development of a}} unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> measure are outlined; both incorporate CoE as their employee <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> measure, but take different approaches to estimating the <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of the self-employed. The article concludes that the preferred model for estimating unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> proxies self-employed <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> by applying the ratio of CoE to the sum of CoE and gross operating surplus in the employed sector to mixed income, a measure of total earnings in the selfemployed sector.

25|$|A pint of pub beer is famously more {{expensive}} {{in the south}} of England than the north, but supermarket beer prices are very similar. This may be treated as anecdotal evidence in favour of the Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis, since supermarket beer is an easily transportable, traded good. (Although pub beer is transportable, the pub itself is not.) The BS-hypothesis explanation for the price differentials is that the 'productivity' of pub employees (in pints served per hour) is more uniform than the 'productivity' (in foreign currency earned per year) of people working in the dominant tradable sector in each region of the country (financial services {{in the south of}} England, manufacturing in the north). Although the employees of southern pubs are not significantly more productive than their counterparts in the north, the pubs must pay wages comparable to those offered by other southern firms in order to keep their staff. This results in southern pubs incurring a higher <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> per pint served.|$|E
25|$|All large {{businesses}} incur {{administrative costs}} {{in the process of}} delivering revenue collected from customers to the suppliers of the goods or services being purchased. Taxation is no different; the resource collected from the public through taxation is always greater than the amount which can be used by the government. The difference is called the compliance cost and includes (for example) the <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> and other expenses incurred in complying with tax laws and rules. The collection of a tax in order to spend it on a specified purpose, for example collecting a tax on alcohol to pay directly for alcoholism-rehabilitation centres, is called hypothecation. Finance ministers often dislike this practice, since it reduces their freedom of action. Some economic theorists regard hypothecation as intellectually dishonest since, in reality, money is fungible. Furthermore, it often happens that taxes or excises initially levied to fund some specific government programs are then later diverted to the government general fund. In some cases, such taxes are collected in fundamentally inefficient ways, for example, though highway tolls.|$|E

We try to clarify the common issues in the current debate concerning <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>labour</b> demand in Belgium and neighbouring countries and investigate the influence of <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> on employment by using macroeconomic OECD data. We conclude that the tax wedge in Belgium {{is one of the}} highest of all OECD countries. <b>Labour</b> <b>costs</b> in Belgium rose at a moderate tempo, but labour productivity evolved less favourably compared with neighbouring countries. Belgian unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs,</b> considered as an indicator of competitiveness, evolved unfavourably. By using a dynamic error correction model we find a statistically significant but limited negative relation between <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and employment. A decrease in <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of 10 % results in an increase of employment of only 1. 3 %, which indicates a strongly inelastic labour demand. In contrast to studies based on microeconomic data, which find generally higher wage elasticities, {{on the basis of this}} study no decisive elements can be found to question the rationale of the current wage indexation mechanism. economic history; ECSC; European Integration; regional concentration...|$|R
500|$|Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise {{early in}} Essai, {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} wealth and price formation on the market. Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself [...] "nothing but the food, conveniences, and pleasures of life." [...] While Cantillon advocated an [...] "intrinsic" [...] theory of value, based on the input of land and <b>labour</b> (<b>cost</b> of production), he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value. Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand. He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular good in a particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged. Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle—changes in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.|$|E

The goal of this paper was to examine how well this measure is related to international export performance at the firm level. To this end, we use Belgian firm-level data for the period 1999 to 2010 to analyse the impact of unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> on exports. We find an estimated elasticity of the intensive margin of exports with respect to unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> between − 0. 2 and − 0. 4. This elasticity varies between sectors and between firms, with more labour-intensive firms having a higher elasticity. The microdata also enable us to analyse the impact of unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> on the extensive margin. Our results show that higher unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> reduce the probability of starting to export for non-exporters and increase the probability of exporters stopping. While our results show that unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> {{have an impact on the}} intensive margin and extensive margin of firm-level exports, the effect is rather low, suggesting that pass-through of costs into prices is limited. The latter is consistent with recent trade models emphasising that not only relative costs, but also demand factors such as quality and taste matter for explaining firm-level exports.
