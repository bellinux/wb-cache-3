40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{previous}} meta-analysis {{found that}} high dose zinc acetate <b>lozenges</b> reduced {{the duration of}} common colds by 42 %, whereas low zinc doses had no effect. <b>Lozenges</b> are dissolved in the pharyngeal region, thus {{there might be some}} difference in the effect of zinc <b>lozenges</b> on the duration of respiratory symptoms in the pharyngeal region compared with the nasal region. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether zinc acetate <b>lozenges</b> have different effects on the duration of common cold symptoms originating from different anatomical regions. METHODS: We analyzed three randomized trials on zinc acetate <b>lozenges</b> for the common cold administering zinc in doses of 80 - 92 mg/day. All three trials reported the effect of zinc on seven respiratory symptoms, and three systemic symptoms. We pooled the effects of zinc <b>lozenges</b> for each symptom and calculated point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). RESULTS: Zinc acetate <b>lozenges</b> shortened the duration of nasal discharge by 34 % (95 % CI: 17 % to 51 %), nasal congestion by 37 % (15 % to 58 %), sneezing by 22 % (- 1 % to 45 %), scratchy throat by 33 % (8 % to 59 %), sore throat by 18 % (- 10 % to 46 %), hoarseness by 43 % (3 % to 83 %), and cough by 46 % (28 % to 64 %). Zinc <b>lozenges</b> shortened the duration of muscle ache by 54 % (18 % to 89 %), but there was no difference in the duration of headache and fever. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of zinc acetate <b>lozenges</b> on cold symptoms may be associated with the local availability of zinc from the <b>lozenges,</b> with the levels being highest in the pharyngeal region. However our findings indicate that the effects of zinc ions are not limited to the pharyngeal region. There is no indication that the effect of zinc <b>lozenges</b> on nasal symptoms is less than the effect on the symptoms of the pharyngeal region, which is more exposed to released zinc ions. Given that the adverse effects of zinc in the three trials were minor, zinc acetate <b>lozenges</b> releasing zinc ions at doses of about 80 mg/day may be a useful treatment for the common cold, started within 24 hours, for a time period of less than two weeks...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored <b>lozenge</b> {{that creates a}} three-dimensional illusion of cubes in perspective for the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, {{making it one of}} the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while major themes include maritime, theatrical, natural, or mythological objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The rosette motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette motif. The illusion of three-dimensional relief in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E

5|$|Euan MacKie has {{supported}} Thom's analysis, {{to which he}} added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period. To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. Kintraw is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed {{that this was a}} foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on Jura. This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at Maes Howe and on the Bush Barrow <b>Lozenge</b> led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.|$|E
