40|$|Garg and Hayhoe 1 At the Federal Aviation Administrationâ€™s (FAA) National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF), three rigid airport {{pavements}} (MRC, MRG, and MRS) with 12 -inch thick {{concrete slabs}} on different support systems (slab on crushed stone base, slab on grade, and slab on stabilized base) were trafficked to complete failure using dual tandem (B- 747) and triple dual tandem (B- 777) landing gear configurations. All three test items were constructed on CBR 7 subgrade (DuPont clay). Test item MRC consisted of 12 -inch concrete slabs over 10 -inches of crushed stone subbase, MRG consisted of 12 -inch concrete slabs over subgrade, and MRS consisted of 12 -inch concrete slabs over a 6 -inch econocrete subbase. The north {{sides of the}} test items were rubblized with a resonant pavement breaker. After rubblization, the rubblized concrete was rolled and paved with a 5 -inch thick HMA (hot mix asphalt) overlay. The overlaid pavements were subjected to full-scale accelerated traffic tests under the 4 -wheel landing gear configuration (with wander) and 55, 000 -lbs wheel load. No significant distresses were observed for 5000 passes after which the wheel load was increased to 65, 000 -lbs and 6 -wheel <b>landing</b> <b>gea...</b>|$|E
