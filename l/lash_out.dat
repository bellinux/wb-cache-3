5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E
5|$|Toyah argues with Leanne's half-sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), for not {{passing on}} a message about {{starting}} a {{shift at the}} pub, but they agree to call a truce. Peter leaves cigarettes at Leanne's flat and Toyah tries to take the blame but Simon is forced to cover for her. Simon later tells Eva who blackmails Toyah: stop Peter from shutting down Aidan Connor's (Shayne Ward) factory or Eva will tell Leanne about Peter and Toyah. Peter agrees to Eva's demands and they continue their affair. Toby returns in January 2017 and demands Toyah sign a paper to destroy their frozen embryos. Toyah is reluctant and after a heart to heart, they kiss. However, Toyah {{makes it clear that}} she doesn't love Toby and is staying with Peter, causing Toby to <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> and leave. Peter learns what has happened and decides to drop off Chloe Tipton (Jo-Anne Knowles), making Toyah jealous. They later make up and Leanne catches Peter and Toyah kissing. During a heated argument, Leanne disowns Toyah and refuses to talk to her again, despite her efforts. Leanne forgives Toyah after she helps deliver baby Oliver in a lift after it breaks down.|$|E
5|$|Wild tigers {{that have}} had no prior contact with humans {{actively}} avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal. Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between {{a mother and her}} young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle. Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey. For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, {{by the time she was}} shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch. Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.|$|E

All the publicity surrounding the calendar has taken a toll on their personal lives, and they <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> {{at each other in}} angry frustration. Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son and the demands of the family business in favour of her newfound celebrity, while Chris believes Annie welcomes the Mother Teresa-like status to which she's been elevated that allows her to cater to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail. All is resolved eventually, and the women return home to resume life as it was before they removed their clothing.|$|E

25|$|Mal Loye and Brad Hodge helped Lancashire Lightning {{to recover}} after Stuart Law was stumped {{in the second}} over off Durham Dynamos medium-pacer Neil Killeen. Loye and Hodge paired up for 169 for the second wicket, as Loye became the second Lancastrian to score a Twenty20 century this season before he was {{eventually}} caught off Nathan Astle's bowling for 100. Lancashire closed on 208 for 4, and only Killeen conceded less than 30 runs of Durham's six bowlers. Astle got the best bowling figures, with two for 37, but his batting helped little - 55 for 37 was never enough {{to keep up with}} the asking rate of 10.5. When Durham realised that, they tried to <b>lash</b> <b>out,</b> and a result, wickets tumbled to Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork and Durham finished their 20 overs with the score on 171 for 7.|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} {{few years of}} his life Guthrie was largely alone except for family. The {{progression}} of Huntington's threw Guthrie into extreme emotional states causing him to <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of Anneke's. These actions mirrored common symptoms of Huntington's including uncharacteristic aggression, emotional volatility, and social disinhibition. Guthrie's illness was essentially untreated, {{because of a lack of}} information about the disease. His death helped raise awareness of the disease and led Marjorie to help found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease, which became the Huntington's Disease Society of America. None of Guthrie's three remaining children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington's. Mary Guthrie's son Bill died in an auto-train accident in Pomona, California, at the age of 23. Mary's other children, Gwendolyn and Sue, suffered from the disease and both died at 41years of age.|$|E

25|$|After {{an opening}} ten overs which yielded 46 runs for Sri Lanka, Sanath Jayasuriya was trapped lbw by Deighton Butler {{with the last}} {{delivery}} of the tenth over, following which Daren Powell and Dwayne Smith tied the Sri Lankans down with good pace bowling. Powell got Kumar Sangakkara's wicket for 7, before Smith dug out two wickets with successive balls as Sri Lanka moved to 73/4. Mahela Jayawardene gave an heave to Powell, and Sri Lanka were five down for 92, after 25 overs. Banks finished with 26 runs from his ten overs, securing the wicket of Chandana, following which Sri Lanka felt were compelled to <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> {{in order to have}} a go at reaching the target. The part-timer Deonarine got two wickets, including the final one of Russel Arnold, who made a slow 59, before bowling Sri Lanka out to 193 at the end of the 47th over, thereby helping his team win their first game of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} time, Kelly's {{mother had a}} new baby, Erin, got married, and put Kelly's {{childhood}} home up for sale. Self-consciousness over her figure, along with the anxiety she began to feel, caused her to <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only liked her because she was physically attractive.|$|E
25|$|As the {{deadline}} nears, the LBA executives begin to panic and <b>lash</b> <b>out,</b> {{resulting in a}} contradictory sequence where Wolfe is fired and then rehired within a span of minutes. When all seems lost, however, an anonymous source sends copies of the answers {{to each of the}} contestants, thus voiding the contest and saving LBA. Although Archie, the LBA executives and the police suspect Wolfe of doing so, he insists that he was not responsible, and begins to suspect one of the advertising executives of at least stealing the wallet, if not murdering Dahlmann. After the letters are sent, Vernon Assa approaches Wolfe and attempts to unilaterally dismiss him from the case, but Wolfe refuses. His suspicions aroused, Wolfe summons the major players to his office and claims he will reveal the identity of the thief, and in doing so provide the police with vital information to help them identify the murderer. Before he can do so, however, Vernon Assa is poisoned with cyanide surreptitiously slipped into his drink and dies on the floor of Wolfe's office. Dahlmann's wallet is found in his pocket, suggesting that he was the thief and murderer.|$|E

500|$|Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich {{also criticized}} the booing. According to Park: [...] "We get nothing — not a dime for this. Brother, I'm sick". Other players were more sanguine. Dryden didn't <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> at the fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, but I can {{understand}} it. The fans {{wanted us to}} do real good, and they're frustrated we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, but I guess I didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his working}} method as [...] "sheer {{perseverance}} {{to the point}} of madness", Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture. Robinson writes that even in Chaplin's later years, his work continued [...] "to take precedence over everything and everyone else." [...] The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> at his actors and crew.|$|E
500|$|In the Tests, Chapman scored 165 runs at 23.57, {{and in all}} {{first-class}} matches {{he reached}} 533 runs and averaged 33.31. Southerton summarised his performance: [...] "Chapman himself began well in batting but in the later matches was too prone to <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> at the off ball and, as the tour progressed, the Australian bowlers discovered his weakness." [...] On his captaincy, Southerton wrote: [...] "Chapman captained the side uncommonly well, improving out of all knowledge as the tour progressed." [...] Socially, Chapman enjoyed the tour; he attended many functions and events; Bill Ferguson, the team scorer, only saw him annoyed once on the tour: when his accustomed drink was not waiting for him at a lunch interval.|$|E
