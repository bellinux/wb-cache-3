5|$|Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{played an}} {{important}} role during the Khmelnytsky Uprising between 1648–54, when the Zaporozhian Cossacks <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, allied themselves with the Crimean Tatars and the local Ukrainian peasantry against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's army and militia. During the uprising, the castle was unsuccessfully besieged by local Cossacks and insurgents <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Commander Maksym Kryvonis. In 1651, the castle was then subject to another Cossack siege <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Hetman Ivan Bohun, before an unexpected counterattack by Polish insurgents under commanders Aleksandrenka and Chuika re-established the Polish presence in the area and relieved the siege. A 60,000 force army <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Khmelnytsky himself reasserted Cossack control over the castle in 1652. Just one year later, the castle was attacked yet again, this time by a 40,000 strong Crimean Tatar horde.|$|E

5|$|The pre-game buildup focused {{primarily}} on the two high-powered offenses, {{both of which were}} <b>led</b> <b>by</b> strong rushing attacks.

The opening line favored Northern Illinois by seven points. After being tied at the end of regulation, the game went into two overtime periods and eventually concluded with Northern Illinois winning 44–37. The Huskies were subsequently invited to the 2013 Orange Bowl.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{describes the}} development of a InGaN/GaN light-emitting diode (LED) with textured sidewalls using natural lithography with polystyrene spheres (PSs) as the etching mask and dry etching the epitaxial layers of LEDs to achieve nano-scale textured sidewalls. The LED with textured sidewalls increased the output power of the InGaN - GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) <b>LEDs</b> <b>by</b> a factor of 1. 3, indicating that the LED with nano-scale textured sidewalls had larger light extraction efficiency. The wall-plug efficiency of nitride-based <b>LEDs</b> was increased <b>by</b> 30 % using textured sidewalls...|$|R

50|$|Burst dimming is {{a method}} to control dimming of cold cathode {{fluorescent}} lamps (CCFLs) and <b>LEDs</b> <b>by</b> using pulse width modulation (PWM) at approximately 100-300 Hz {{which is supposed to}} be above the noticeable flicker limit for the human eye. This technique is sometimes used with TFT displays to control backlighting. An alternative dimming method is to control lamp current.|$|R
