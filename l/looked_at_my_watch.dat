500|$|Brundage married Elizabeth Dunlap, {{daughter}} of a Chicago banker, in 1927, when he was 40. Elizabeth Brundage, three years younger than her husband, was a trained soprano, a talent she exhibited for visitors to the Brundage home. She had {{a strong interest in}} classical music, one which may not have been fully shared by her husband, who said of a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre that it [...] "started at 7o'clock, at 10:00pm I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and it registered exactly 8o'clock". She died at age 81 in 1971.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was six o'clock. I {{determined}} to lose no time.|$|E
60|$|He {{lapsed into}} silence. The train rolled on. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> London {{was not far}} off now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> upon no such matter," [...] said the Captain; [...] "nor will I any way be {{disposed}} to doubt your friend's honour, Mr. Winterblossom." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had just}} stopped to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> when I saw {{something}} dark floating towards me, urged by the slow current of the river. As it came nearer, I thought I recognized the mill-boat.|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS: '--a man brushed heavily against me, {{and then}} hurried {{on in the}} other direction. I had unbuttoned <b>my</b> coat to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> under the lamp-post, and after he struck against me I clapped my hand to my waistcoat, and--phew!--' ...|$|R
60|$|Ah! He, of course, would know. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{was twenty}} minutes past nine only.... Still.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> Yes, {{five hours}} had been {{gathered}} {{in by the}} grim scytheman. I went to dinner.|$|E
60|$|Perfectly {{clear it}} was, {{perfectly}} clear, and why hadn't I seen it before?... I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and it was}} half-past two.|$|E
6000|$|... "One quite {{forgot all}} about time. I was {{relieved}} at 4 A.M., and on <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> found I had been up there nearly twelve hours, and then discovered I was rather hungry. The skipper and I had some cheese and biscuits, ham sandwiches, and water on the bridge, and then I went down and brewed some cocoa and ship's biscuit." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had already}} learnt {{that it was}} folly to argue with a Spanish guard, and, drawing back my head, I sat down. But, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> I {{saw that it was}} only ten. I should never again have a chance of {{inspecting}} the eyebrows of Joseph of Arimathea unless I chartered a special train, so, seizing the opportunity and my bag, I jumped out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sat down}} {{alone in the}} bedroom. I had {{a few minutes of}} thought with myself, which I don't choose to put into words, even in these secret pages. I got up, and unlocked--never mind what. I went round to Midwinter's side of the bed, and took--no matter what I took. The last thing I did before I left the room was to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was half-past ten, Armadale's usual time for leaving us. I went back at once and joined the two men again.|$|R
60|$|I {{had just}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> making {{out in the}} starlight that the hour was eleven, when the report of a gun broke the silence.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It wanted {{five minutes}} to twelve, when the premonitory {{symptoms}} of the working of the laudanum first showed themselves to me.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{was past}} three o'clock--quite the full swing of {{afternoon}} office {{work in the}} port. He snarled imperiously: [...] "Sit down, Captain." ...|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not feel}} bound to say what concession, on this point, I made to Miss Ambient, {{who went on to}} relate to me that within the last half-hour Beatrice had had a revulsion; that she was tremendously frightened at what she had done; that her fright itself betrayed her; and that she would now give heaven and earth to save the child. [...] "Let us hope she will!" [...] I said, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and trying to time poor Ambient; whereupon my {{companion}} repeated, in a singular tone, [...] "Let us hope so!" [...] When I asked her if she herself could do nothing, and whether she ought not to be with her sister-in-law, she replied, [...] "You had better go and judge; she is like a wounded tigress!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{really said}} {{it in a way}} that made me take refuge for an instant in <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "Are you going back to tea? If you are, I'll, in spite of my desire to roam, walk twenty steps with you." [...] I had already again put my hand into his arm, and we strolled for a little till I threw off that I was sure Mrs. Server was waiting for him. To this he replied that if I wished to get rid of him he was as willing to take that as {{anything}} else for granted--an observation that I, on my side, answered with an inquiry, though an inquiry that had nothing to do with it. [...] "Do you also tell everything to Mrs. Brissenden?" ...|$|R
3000|$|To {{supplement}} our quantitative results, {{we conducted}} in-depth post-experiment interviews with our participants. These {{shed light on}} individuals’ experiences and support our findings about the intervention’s effectiveness. Many participants reported our system to have made them more aware of everyday kindness. F 1 said: “As I was writing down what I was grateful for, I {{became more and more}} thankful! I began to see things I haven’t seen before.” Some mentioned positively how the inspiring content was embedded in their everyday routine. D 2 reported: “I remember a time, anxiously <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> when a notification showed up and made me smile.” Some participants reported the app helped them to reappraise the situation even when faced with difficulties. 242 C said: “I used the journal feature to write down things that I felt grateful for. Sometimes I had a bad day but still tried to find good in it.” [...]...|$|R
60|$|Searle {{received}} this broadside gaping. Then turning away {{he went and}} seated himself on a bench {{against the wall and}} rubbed his forehead amazedly. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and listened for the wheels of our carriage.|$|E
60|$|When I had {{finished}} giving instructions to Wada for the arranging of my things I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was early yet, only several minutes after three so I went on deck again {{to witness the}} arrival of the crew.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> to {{find that}} it was now eight o'clock in the morning in this horrible place where there was neither morn, nor noon, nor night, but only an eternal {{brightness}} that came I knew not whence, and never learned.|$|E
5000|$|Dear God {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. Siskel & Ebert gave the film two thumbs down upon its release. James Berardinelli gave the film one star and explained, [...] "At least after seeing this movie, I understand where the title came from [...] - [...] starting about thirty minutes into this interminable, unfunny feature, I began <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> {{every few minutes}} and thinking, 'Dear God, is this ever going to end?' A sickeningly bad pastiche of much better pictures [...] - [...] It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, and (believe it or not) Spartacus all leap to mind [...] - [...] Dear God is the worst excuse for a holiday film since Nora Ephron's hideous Mixed Nuts." [...] As of August 2010, film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes had given the film a 12% positive rating, based on reviews from 33 critics.|$|R
60|$|I begin my {{promenade}} - {{thinking of}} all kinds of distant things and persons, and of nothing near - and pace up and down for half-an- hour. Then I go on board again; and getting into the light of one of the lamps, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and think it must have stopped; and wonder what has become of the faithful secretary whom I brought along with me from Boston. He is supping with our late landlord (a Field Marshal, at least, no doubt) in honour of our departure, and may be two hours longer. I walk again, but it gets duller and duller: the moon goes down: next June seems farther off in the dark, and the echoes of my footsteps make me nervous. It has turned cold too; and walking up and down without my companion in such lonely circumstances, is but poor amusement. So I break my staunch resolution, and think it may be, perhaps, as well to go to bed.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the {{circumference}} measuring {{four hundred and}} fifty-five feet, which would require as many palisades {{to be made of}} trees, one with another, of a foot diameter each. Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our men being dexterous in the use of them, great despatch was made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> when two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter. Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end. While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round, of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, the bodies being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,[105] we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a stage ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was {{a quarter}} past three. The tide {{would begin to}} turn about five, {{but it would be}} at least ten before the rock would be covered. I had, then, little more than six hours to live unless rescued.|$|E
6000|$|Lister {{fixed the}} date and added: [...] "It was nearly ten o'clock. The porter had just gone through the car and when he said my berth was ready I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> He went to the next Pullman, and I thought he was getting busy late." ...|$|E
60|$|Hours {{passed before}} I could close my eyes. It was broken rest when it came, {{until the day}} dawned. Then I fell asleep at last in good earnest. When I woke, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> I was amazed {{to find that it}} was ten o'clock.|$|E
60|$|At first I {{wondered}} {{why they did}} not set {{to work with a}} will and cut away this barrier and let me out. But there suddenly came to my mind a reason for this lack of energy which was more chilling than the glistening walls around me: Why should they suppose that I was in the ice-chamber? I was not in the habit of coming here very often, but I was in the habit of wandering off by myself {{at all hours of the}} day. This thought made me feel that I might as well lie down on the floor of this awful cave and die at once. The workmen might think it unsafe to mine any further in this part of the glacier, and begin operations at some other point. I did sit down for a moment, and then I rose involuntarily and began my weary round. Suddenly I thought of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was nearly five o'clock. I had been more than four hours in that dreadful place, and I did not believe that I could continue to exercise my limbs very much longer. The lights I had seen had ceased. It was quite plain that the workmen had no idea that any one was imprisoned in the cave.|$|R
6000|$|... "For sure," [...] she answered—and then, {{laying the}} books on the table, [...] "I know how a man will {{compliment}} me {{by the way he}} <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> me"—she kneeled before the fire. [...] "Some <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> hair, some <b>watch</b> {{the rise and fall of}} <b>my</b> breathing, some <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> neck, and a few,—not you among them,—look me in the eyes for my thoughts. To you, I'm a fine specimen, strong! Pretty strong! You primitive man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|In my {{own case}} my inward {{watchman}} is, perhaps, somewhat out of practice. He does his best; {{but he is}} over-anxious; he worries himself, and loses count. I say to him, maybe, [...] "Five-thirty, please;" [...] and he wakes me with a start at half-past two. I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> He suggests that, perhaps, I forgot to wind it up. I put it to my ear; it is still going. He thinks, maybe, something has happened to it; he is confident himself it is half-past five, if not a little later. To satisfy him, I {{put on a pair}} of slippers and go downstairs to inspect the dining-room clock. What happens to a man when he wanders about the house in the middle of the night, clad in a dressing-gown and a pair of slippers, there is no need to recount; most men know by experience. Everything--especially everything with a sharp corner--takes a cowardly delight in hitting him. When you are wearing a pair of stout boots, things get out of your way; when you venture among furniture in woolwork slippers and no socks, it comes at you and kicks you. I return to bed bad tempered, and refusing to listen to his further absurd suggestion that all the clocks in the house have entered into a conspiracy against me, take half an hour to get to sleep again. From four to five he wakes me every ten minutes. I wish I had never said a word to him about the thing. At five o'clock he goes to sleep himself, worn out, and leaves it to the girl, who does it half an hour later than usual.|$|R
6000|$|... "'We {{will lose}} no time' I said reassuringly, as I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> 'It is now seven-thirty. We will reckon {{the time from}} now, with {{overtime}} at time and a half. But if I am {{to do anything for}} you I must have some idea of what has happened.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{jumped up}} and ran down to the cave. All were there except Margaret, who came {{immediately}} after me carrying Silvio in her arms. When the cat saw his old enemy he struggled to get down; but Margaret held him fast and soothed him. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was close to eight.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little sailing-boat was {{approaching}} the shore. The man steering was hidden from {{me by the}} sail; but the boat was so near that I thought I recognized the flag on the mast. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> Yes! It was Armadale coming over from Santa Lucia at his usual time, to visit us in his usual way.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{hurts me}} most," [...] he went on, [...] "is having {{to watch her}} making herself ridiculous. Yet what am I to do? If I explain things to her she will be miserable and ashamed of herself; added to which her frankness--perhaps her {{greatest}} charm--will be murdered. The trouble runs through everything. She won't take my advice about her frocks. She laughs, and repeats to me--well, the lies that other women tell a girl who is spoiling herself by dressing absurdly; especially when she is a pretty girl and they are anxious she should go on spoiling herself. She bought a hat last week, one day when I was not with her. It only wants the candles {{to look like a}} Christmas tree. They insist on her taking it off so they may examine it more closely, with the idea of having one built like it for themselves; and she sits by delighted, and explains to them the secret of the thing. We get to parties half an hour before the opening time; she is afraid of being a minute late. They have told her that the party can't begin without her--isn't worth calling a party till she's there. We are always the last to go. The other people don't matter, but if she goes they will feel the whole thing has been a failure. She is dead for want of sleep, and they {{are sick and tired of}} us; but if I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> they talk as if their hearts were breaking, and she thinks me a brute for wanting to leave friends so passionately attached to us.|$|R

When they were set up, our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other day that the men could not work.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} {{of the success of the}} campaign, several other {{companies}} followed suit with nostalgia-themed campaigns of their own, with mixed results. Particularly singled out for derision were campaigns by Persil and Sainsbury's, with Leon Jaume of WCRS commenting on the latter in Campaign magazine: [...] "This is meagre fare, frankly, and allows the blogsters to concentrate on the elephant on the bacon counter: that the ad doesn't so much nod to the recent Hovis epic as pick a fight with it, shouting: 'I've got decades of British history, me! Hear my tinkling piano track! <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> loveable urchin! <b>Watch</b> <b>my</b> wartime reconstruction!' The bloggers are less than whelmed by the similarities, and I feel the uncomfortable frisson of kinship with them." ...|$|R
