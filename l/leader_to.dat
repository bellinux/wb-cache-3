5|$|In 1998, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{arrived in}} Cuba to meet Castro and {{highlight}} their close ties. He {{was the first}} Canadian government <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> visit the island since Pierre Trudeau was in Havana in 1976. In 2002, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited Cuba, where he highlighted the lack of civil liberties {{in the country and}} urged the government {{to pay attention to the}} Varela Project of Oswaldo Payá.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the longer version of the Annals of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the Annals of Einsiedeln. The first places the event in 902, while the others date it to 904. The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> a dinner on the pretext of negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him. Kristó and other Hungarian historians argue that the dual leadership over the Hungarians ended with Kurszán's death.|$|E

5|$|Andrianjaka {{moved his}} capital from Ambohidrabiby to Ambohimanga upon {{ascending}} {{to the throne}} around 1610 or 1612. He was reportedly the first Merina <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> receive Europeans around 1620 and traded slaves in exchange for guns and other firearms {{to aid in the}} pacification of rival principalities, obtaining 50 guns and three barrels of gunpowder to equip his army. He unified the principalities on what he later designated as the twelve sacred hills of Imerina at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka. These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when Andrianampoinimerina redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites.|$|E
5|$|As {{the summit}} closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> leave, Nasser {{suffered}} a heart attack. He was immediately transported to his house, where his physicians tended to him. Nasser died several hours later, around 6:00p.m. Heikal, Sadat, and Nasser's wife Tahia were at his deathbed. According to his doctor, al-Sawi Habibi, Nasser's likely {{cause of death was}} arteriosclerosis, varicose veins, and complications from long-standing diabetes. Nasser was a heavy smoker with a family history of heart disease—two of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition. The state of Nasser's health was not known to the public prior to his death. He had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{deuterium}} being {{a valuable}} commodity, Archer is {{startled by the}} lack of basic medical supplies and the run-down nature of the colony. The reason becomes apparent when seven Klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their 'regular arrangement'. When Tessic informs Korok (Robertson Dean), the leader of the Klingons, {{that they do not have}} all the deuterium because two pumps were not working, Korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order. Later, when Tucker and Archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the Klingons, Tessic tell them to take their 200 liters and leave. However, leaving does not sit well with Archer and he convinces the <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> resist with their support.|$|E

5|$|Feijó's {{administration}} {{was unable to}} suppress the uprisings in both the north and south. By 1837, his government's credibility and support had vanished. Feijó resigned in August 1837 and Pedro de Araújo Lima (later the Marquis of Olinda), a Reactionary from Pernambuco Province, became interim regent and {{was elected to the}} office the next year. He appointed his colleagues to ministry portfolios. Honório Hermeto, who had been reelected to another term as general deputy until 1841, remained in the Chamber as the party's <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> bolster the new Reactionary cabinet. The ever-weak Moderate Party collapsed, and Feijo's Moderates allied with other groups with which they shared no common principles or ideology. During the late 1830s and early 1840s, this alliance evolved into the second Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|For the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) each {{decontamination}} battery (Entgiftungs-Batterie) {{was authorized}} six Sd.Kfz. 10/1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10/2. Eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/3 {{were held at}} the battalion level for issue to the batteries in lieu of their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s if needed. If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another {{was used by the}} platoon <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> tow an anti-tank gun. Similarly decontamination units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s and used them just like the 10/1s after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the 10/3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|Guy's reign {{was troubled}} {{by the threat of}} the Ottoman Turks, against whom, {{according}} to the Chronographia regum francorum, he proved a courageous <b>leader.</b> <b>To</b> strengthen the security of his domains, on 22 July 1362, Guy became a Venetian citizen, a development that heralded active Venetian involvement in the affairs of the area. Two years later, soon after his arrival in the Morea, he was involved in the civil war over possession of the Principality of Achaea between Philip II of Taranto and Maria of Bourbon, widow of Philip's older brother Robert, who died in September 1364 without a direct heir. Guy, along with the Despot of the Morea Manuel Kantakouzenos, supported Maria and her son Hugh of Lusignan until 1370, when the latter sold their claims to Philip.|$|E

5|$|Kanchipuram Lok Sabha {{constituency}} is a {{newly formed}} constituency of the Parliament of India after the 2008 delimitation. The constituency originally existed for the 1951 election, and {{was formed in}} 2008 after merging the assembly segments of Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, Madurantakam (SC), Uthiramerur and Kanchipuram, which {{were part of the}} now defunct Chengalpattu constituency, and Alandur, which was part of the Chennai South constituency. This constituency is reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) candidates. K. Maragatham from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam is the current Member of Parliament for the constituency. Indian writer, politician and founder of the DMK, C. N. Annadurai, {{was born and raised in}} Kanchipuram. He was the first member of a Dravidian party to hold that post and was the first non-Congress <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> form a majority government in post-colonial India.|$|E

5|$|On 6 September 2007, eight {{members of}} the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian {{motorcade}} consisting of two motorcycles, two black four-wheel drive vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow—drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world <b>leader,</b> <b>to</b> discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.|$|E

5|$|The {{first group}} of {{converts}} to Islam in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside.

Medinans who converted to Islam and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.|$|E

5|$|The major revolt {{began on}} September 20, 1260.

As the uprising was spreading through Prussian lands, each clan chose a leader: the Sambians were led by Glande, the Natangians by Herkus Monte, the Bartians by Diwanus, the Warmians by Glappe, the Pogesanians by Auktume. One clan that did not join the uprising was the Pomesanians. The uprising was also supported by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians. However, {{there was no one}} <b>leader</b> <b>to</b> coordinate efforts of these different forces. Herkus Monte, who was educated in Germany, became the best known and most successful of the leaders, but he commanded only his Natangians.|$|E
