Because fatigue fracture is the most critical failure mode for these joints under fluctuating loads, understanding their fatigue failure behavior and assessment of their fatigue lives are crucial {{from the viewpoint of}} failure prevention in design. In this study, a series of experiments was conducted to study the fatigue failure of spot-welded modified tensile-shear specimens made of a low carbon steel. Two different types of resistance spot welding were investigated (manual and automated). Tests were repeated under different load ranges, and the corresponding fatigue lives were determined.

In the numerical part of this study, a finite element analysis was carried out using commercial software, ANSYS, to determine the stress and strain states within the specimens.

40|$|Purpose: Modification of {{the surface}} layer of the {{titanium}} alloys is frequently applied {{in order to improve}} their tribological properties. Various surface engineering techniques can be used to produce hard coatings, e. g. composed of metallic carbides, nitrides or more recently DLC. The coating and substrate materials possess significantly different stiffness and strength properties. This can lead to premature failure of the usually elastic coating in case of plastic deformation of the substrate when the high stresses are encountered. Cracking of the hard coating leads to stress concentration and localized plastic deformation of the substrate that can modify macroscopic deformation behaviour of the system. In the paper the influence of coating and substrate properties on <b>local</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> of substrate material was numerically investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Two dimensional finite element analysis of the process of tensile deformation of titanium alloy with hard elastic coating was carried out.

The coexistent {{phenomenon}} of deformed and transformed adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) is analyzed using Johnson-Cook model and gradient-dependent plasticity for heterogeneous ductile metal material. The size of deformed ASB {{is described by}} the internal length reflecting the heterogeneity of material. Microstructural effect leads to a nonuniform distribution of temperature rise in deformed ASB. When the peak temperature in deformed ASB exceeds the transformation temperature, a transformed ASB appears {{at the center of}} deformed ASB. With a decrease of flow shear stress, the width of transformed ASB increases until its upper bound, i. e., the size of deformed ASB, is reached. The effects of initial temperature and strain rate on the occurrence of transformation, evolution of the thickness of transformed ASB, distributions of <b>local</b> temperature and <b>plastic</b> shear <b>deformation</b> in ASB are investigated.

Due to mixing of the hot (primary) and cold (secondary) water flows, high frequent temperature fluctuations arise which may cause material degradation and cracking. An evaluation of the integrity of the mixing tee is a complex problem which requires the knowledge of thermal-hydraulic boundary condition, material strength and fracture mechanics properties, as well as an appropriate description of elastic-plastic material behaviour under cyclic loading. Data necessary for the structural analysis were provided by different project partners based on their experimental investigations and numerical modelling.
