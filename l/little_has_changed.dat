5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> in {{the general}} sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E

Yet corruption within the law enforcement sector of {{the government}} allows deforestation to continue. Laws have been passed to stop the wholesale demolition of the basin, yet bribes to government officials have been speculated as to the reason why <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> Additionally, most of the parties involved {{in the sale of}} wood and charcoal are former militiamen, which add elements of fear that a civil war might resume if their products were to be seized.|$|E

In 2005, Malmö got a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malmö, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes. While the inner city becomes gentrified and the upper-middle class have settled the Western Harbour, <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> for the inhabitants of the districts of the Million Programme; Malmö remains a city of sharp social divides and high unemployment.|$|E

25|$|The city {{is home to}} two horse-racing tracks, Keeneland and The Red Mile harness track. Keeneland, {{sporting}} live {{races in}} April and October, is steeped in tradition; <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> since the track's opening in 1936. Keeneland hosted the 2015 Breeders' Cup, with the event's signature race, the Breeders' Cup Classic, won by Triple Crown winner American Pharoah. This track also has the world's largest thoroughbred auction house; 19 Kentucky Derby winners, 21 Preakness Stakes winners, and 18 Belmont Stakes winners were purchased at Keeneland sales. Its most notable race is the Blue Grass Stakes, which is considered an important preparation for the Kentucky Derby. The Red Mile is the oldest horse racing track {{in the city and}} the second-oldest in the nation. It runs live harness races, in which horses pull two-wheeled carts called sulkies. The two tracks announced a partnership in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Although {{available}} only on limited release {{in many parts}} of the Western world, Lucian Pintilie's production has attracted significant interest abroad, and was granted a special reception at the Telluride Film Festival. John Simon describes the film as [...] "witty, harrowing, wonderful", and, in one of his comparative essays on cinema traditions, lists it among the most notable European works of 1994 (alongside Yves Angelo's Colonel Chabert and Nanni Moretti's Caro diario). His colleague Hoberman added the film to a [...] "10 Best" [...] list for 1994. Berardinelli draws a parallel between An Unforgettable Summer and Before the Rain, by Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski, noting that, for all the difference in setting and approach, they deal with similar subjects. He writes: [...] "If nothing else, these two pictures taken together underline the unhappy truth that, in the Balkans, <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> over the past seventy years." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Many reviews found the game avoided some of Aerosmith's [...] "more popular sugar-coated hits...like 'Amazing', 'Crazy', or 'I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing'", but felt that other major Aerosmith songs could {{have also been}} included. Game Informer noted that [...] "creating a band specific game was smart", but that [...] "very <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> from the base game". They also complimented the great job that Activision did with their motion captures of Aerosmith. The difficulty of the game {{was not to be}} found as hard as Guitar Hero III due to the [...] "very riff-friendly guitarist" [...] Joe Perry; while reviewers felt this was a good correction from the previous game, they also noted that the easiness of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith led to some bland tiers, repetitive musical sections, and lack of any significant difficulty curve. The length of the game was poorly received, with reviewers commenting {{that it is difficult to}} justify the title priced equivalently as other next-generation console full games. Eurogamer commented that one's appreciation for the game [...] "lives or dies based on [...] fondness for Aerosmith", and that ultimately, with other available music games that offer additional downloadable songs, a game that focuses on a single band would need [...] "to offer gameplay innovations, spectacular fan service, or a lot more material" [...] than what Guitar Hero: Aerosmith provides. Reviews also noted the sparseness of downloadable content.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, New Amerykah Part One is an esoteric concept {{album with}} sociopolitical themes and mostly downbeat subject matter. It {{features}} more impersonal topics and social commentary than on Badu's previous work. Its subject matter deals with social concerns and struggles within the African-American community, exploring {{topics such as}} institutional racism, religion, poverty, urban violence, the abuse of power, complacency, drug addiction, and nihilism. Badu said she wrote about [...] "poor families, the undermining of the working class, the so-called minority." [...] According to New York critic Nitsuh Abebe, the record's main theme was the struggle for African Americans to determine their cultural identity {{in light of the}} [...] "Civil Rights and post-Civil Rights" [...] era. In Ratliff's opinion, the album's subject matter has been explored before by Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and Funkadelic, which [...] "suggests that <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> in nearly 40 years, and perhaps ... that's her point." [...] Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters believed that like Suzanne Vega's 2007 album Beauty & Crime, New Amerykah Part One also incorporated [...] "a post-9/11 worldview, plus a few shots of community spirit, individual growth, pleas for social activism and spiritual enlightenment, and ... the realities of death." [...] He felt that like the [...] "clash in musical styles", some songs [...] "seem committed to having America honor" [...] the promise of the American Dream for African-Americans, while other songs [...] "seem to reject the promise, or at least the idea that the promise can be fulfilled without considerable effort".|$|E
500|$|Since the {{intensive}} period of house building, <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> At {{the west end}} of the suburb, the Tyneside flats at Northborne Street and surrounding streets remain in situ and here there is [...] "housing and little else". Much of this housing is in poor condition, some is in [...] "crumbling disrepair" [...] and requires substantial investment. Old Durham Road has developed into {{the focal point of the}} neighbourhood and is the sole commercial area, with small, independent shops running along the western end of the road backing onto the streets from Inskip Terrace and Shipcote Terrace. Whilst many retail units are in a state of deterioration, and despite a report describing recent housing development on the east side of Old Durham Road as [...] "poorly handled and unsightly", the area remains [...] "interesting and lively". By contrast, the central and eastern areas of Deckham are affected by a more marked decline. At the western edge there are stone remnants of an old, rural settlement, but the remainder, grouped around Edgeware and Kingston Roads, consists of bland, repetitive social housing arranged on long, curved streets which combine to create an environment which is anonymous, claustrophobic and disorientating. One source describes the environment as one where [...] "eyesores become landmarks (lock–up workshops on Kingston Road), any slight change in materials becomes significant (system–built housing on Kingston Road), and any attempt to do something different becomes a relief (a corner garden on Mayfair Gardens)".|$|E
