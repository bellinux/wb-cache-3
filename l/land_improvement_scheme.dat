2500|$|Under the First Wilson Government, {{subsidies}} for farmers were increased. Farmers {{who wished to}} leave the land or retire became eligible for grants or annuities if their holdings were sold for approved amalgamations, and could receive those benefits whether they wished to remain in their farmhouses or not. A Small Farmers Scheme was also extended, and from 1 December 1965, 40,000 more farmers became eligible for the maximum £1,000 grant. New grants to agriculture also encouraged the voluntary pooling of smallholdings, and in cases where their land was purchased for non-commercial purposes, tenant-farmers could now receive double the previous [...] "disturbance compensation." [...] A Hill <b>Land</b> <b>Improvement</b> <b>Scheme,</b> introduced by the Agriculture Act of 1967, provided 50% grants {{for a wide range}} of land improvements, along with a supplementary 10% grant on drainage works benefitting hill land. The Agriculture Act 1967 also provided grants to promote farm amalgamation and to compensate outgoers.|$|E

40|$|Pollution of the River Murray by salt imposes {{costs on}} {{domestic}} and industrial users in Adelaide and to irrigators on the River Murray. Salt enters the Murray-Darling system through saline ground water aquifers and from irrigation and drainage of saline land. Irrigation and drainage generate benefits from improved agricultural productivity and impose costs through increased salt loads to the Murray-Darling system. The salinity of the River Murray {{can be reduced}} by pumping highly saline ground water into evaporation basins before it enters the River Murray. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model {{which is used to}} determine the mix of ground water interception <b>schemes</b> and <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>schemes</b> that minimises the net present value (over a time horizon of 30 years) of total Murray-Darling Basin costs due to salinity and waterlogging. By varying a target salinity level, the mix of works that yields various salinity targets in the River Murray at minimum cost is obtained. The sensitivity of the optimal solution to prescribed changes in costs and benefits of projects and to a longer planning horizon is examined.

50|$|The River Beult {{was subject}} to a <b>Land</b> Drainage <b>Improvement</b> <b>Scheme</b> in the 1930s. This led to the river being widened, deepened and {{straightened}} from Smarden to Yalding. Despite this action the river is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It {{is one of the}} few clay rivers in England and Wales to retain much of its characteristic flora. It hasn't been heavily embanked like most clay rivers found in the midlands, although the majority of trees were removed. The lack of shade coupled with retained areas of grazing means there are many wildlife rich margins to the river, with nearly 100 different species of aquatic and marginal plants recorded.|$|R

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>improvements</b> {{with long}} pay-back periods are often delayed on leased {{agricultural}} land, resulting in social costs through land degradation, decreased land productivity and environmental problems. An {{important question is}} thus how landowners would respond to regulations and mandates concerning <b>land</b> <b>improvements.</b> Based on a landowner survey, we analyse landowner choices under certain <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> regulations, using the currently dominant choice of leasing land for agricultural use as the benchmark. The results indicated that land leasing {{will continue to increase}} in the future, but if the landowner mandate to co-finance costly <b>land</b> <b>improvements</b> is increased, landowners are predicted to respond significantly to these mandates and search for other land management options. Three heterogeneous landowner groups were identified based on their land use choices. Current leasers and amenity owners, in particular, were sensitive to <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> mandates, and would avoid compulsory investment expenses by selling or afforesting their land. contingent behaviour, latent class model, landlord, land use, heterogeneity, Land Economics/Use, Q 15, Q 24, Q 28,...|$|R

As the Main construction projects were completed, the purpose of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts Has shifted from facilities construction to operation and maintenance of them. However, the recent social situation has brought great changes in circumstance to <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts.
