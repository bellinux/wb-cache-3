50|$|There {{are three}} basic {{definitions}} for integral linearity in common use: independent linearity, zero-based linearity, and terminal, or end-point, linearity. In each case, linearity defines {{how well the}} device's actual performance across a specified operating range approximates a straight line. Linearity is usually {{measured in terms of}} a deviation, or non-linearity, from an ideal straight line and it is typically expressed in terms of percent of full scale, or in ppm (parts per million) of full scale. Typically, the straight line is obtained by performing a least-squares fit of the data. The three definitions vary {{in the manner in which}} the straight line is positioned relative to the actual device's performance. Also, all three of these definitions ignore any gain, or offset errors that may be present in the actual device's performance characteristics.Many times a device's specifications will simply refer to linearity, with no other explanation as to which type of linearity is intended. In cases where a specification is expressed simply as linearity, it is assumed to imply independent linearity.Independent linearity is probably the most commonly used linearity definition and is often found in the specifications for DMMs and ADCs, as well as devices like potentiometers. Independent linearity is defined as the maximum deviation of actual performance relative to a straight line, located such that it minimizes the maximum deviation. In that case there are no constraints placed upon the positioning of the straight line and it may be wherever necessary to minimize the deviations between it and the device's actual performance characteristic.Zero-based linearity forces the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>value</b> of the straight line to be equal to the actual <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>value</b> of the device's characteristic, but it does allow the line to be rotated to minimize the maximum deviation. In this case, since the positioning of the straight line is constrained by the requirement that the lower range values of the line and the device's characteristic be coincident, the non-linearity based on this definition will generally be larger than for independent linearity.For terminal linearity, there is no flexibility allowed in the placement of the straight line in order to minimize the deviations. The straight line must be located such that each of its end-points coincides with the device's actual upper and lower range values. This means that the non-linearity measured by this definition will typically be larger than that measured by the independent, or the zero-based linearity definitions. This definition of linearity is often associated with ADCs, DACs and various sensors.A fourth linearity definition, absolute linearity, is sometimes also encountered. Absolute linearity is a variation of terminal linearity, in that it allows no flexibility in the placement of the straight line, however in this case the gain and offset errors of the actual device are included in the linearity measurement, making this the most difficult measure of a device's performance. For absolute linearity the end points of the straight line are defined by the ideal upper and lower range values for the device, rather than the actual values. The linearity error in this instance is the maximum deviation of the actual device's performance from ideal.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for calculating the configurational-dependent {{diffusion}} coefficient of a globular protein {{as a function of}} the global folding process. Using a coarse-grained structure-based model, we determined the diffusion coefficient, in reaction coordinate space, {{as a function of the}} fraction of native contacts formed Q for the cold shock protein (TmCSP). We find nonmonotonic behavior for the diffusion coefficient, with high values for the folded and unfolded ensembles and a <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of <b>values</b> in the transition state ensemble. We also characterized the folding landscape associated with an energetically frustrated variant of the model. We find that a low-level of frustration can actually stabilize the native ensemble and increase the associated diffusion coefficient. These findings can be understood from a mechanistic standpoint, in that the transition state ensemble has a more homogeneous structural content when frustration is present. Additionally, these findings are consistent with earlier calculations based on lattice models of protein folding and more recent single-molecule fluorescence measurements...|$|R

40|$|Energy budget {{constraints}} on climate response correspondence To the Editor — The rate of global mean warming has been lower {{over the past}} decade than previously. It has been argued 1 – 5 that this observation might require a downwards revision of estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity, that is, the long-term (equilibrium) temperature response to a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Using up-to-date data on radiative forcing, global mean surface temperature and total heat uptake in the Earth system, we find that the global energy budget 6 implies a <b>range</b> of <b>values</b> for the equilibrium climate sensitivity that is in agreement with earlier estimates, within the limits of uncertainty. The energy budget of the most recent decade does, however, indicate a <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of <b>values</b> for the more policy-relevant 7 transient climate response (the temperature increase at the point of doubling of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration following a linear ramp of increasing greenhouse gas forcing) than the range obtained by either analysing the energy budget of earlier decades or current climate model simulations 8. The response of the climate system to rising greenhouse gas levels is often summarized in terms of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) or the transient climate response (TCR). Both quantities are related to the global mean temperature change 9 ΔT, the radiative forcing change ΔF, and the change in the rate of the total increase in Earth system heat content ΔQ (see Supplementary Section S 1), by the global energy budget...|$|R

The electrolyte composition {{is similar to that}} of ileal fluids and independent of the secretory rate. The transmural potential difference is about 12 mV, mucosa negative. Of the major electrolytes, only HCO 3 - is secreted grossly against its electrochemical potential difference. This finding plus the low hydraulic (or osmotic) permeability (Lp) and high secretory pressures of the organ strongly suggest that the secretion is an active one. The passive permeability to Na+ and Cl- appears to be, at most, somewhat less than for small bowel. Permeability to mannitol was estimated at 2. 5 × 10 - 7 cm·s- 1. On the basis of reasonable assumptions and results with luminal test solutions of differing osmolarities, it was concluded that (a) the Lp of the appendiceal epithelium is in the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of <b>values</b> reported for small bowel and colon; (b) the Lp is higher for osmotic absorption than for osmotic secretion; and (c) the rate of spontaneous secretion is insensitive to luminal anisotonicity over a wide <b>range</b> of <b>values.</b> But sufficiently hypotonic solutions can reverse net secretion to net absorption, more by inhibiting spontaneous secretion than increasing osmotic absorption.

Methods: 9234 locations sampled for soil total P from the Australian National Site Soil Data Collation were analysed. In order to make some adjustment for uneven spatial sampling we area-weighted the data using subregions from the Interim Bioregionalisation of Australia. Results: Topsoil total P concentrations ≤ 100  mg kg⁻¹ were widespread, but not a majority of the continent (estimated 25  %). The western Monsoon Tropics (65  %), southwestern Australia (50  %), and southeast South Australia (38  %) were estimated to have larger fractions of the sampled landscape ≤ 100  mg kg⁻¹ than eastern Australia (13. 5  %), but not a <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of <b>values.</b> Total P values across the continent included a large fraction (33  %) in the range 101 – 250  mg kg⁻¹.

All neurons included (26 conditioned, 26 pseudoconditioned, and 28 naive) had stable penetration and at least 60 mV action potential amplitudes. Mean input resistances were approximately equal to 60 mu omega for the three groups. A marked reduction in the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following an impulse was apparent for conditioned (x = - 0. 98 mV) {{as compared to the}} pseudoconditioned (x = - 1. 7 mV) and naive (x = - 2. 0 mV) neurons.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the test-retest reliability of an interactive voice response (IVR) version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C 30. Methods: A convenience sample of outpatient cancer clinic patients (n = 127) was asked to complete the IVR version of the QLQ-C 30 twice, 2 days apart. The QLQ-C 30 is a 30 -item, cancer-specific questionnaire composed of single-item and multi-item scales. The instrument has five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), and a global quality-of-life scale. The remaining single items assess dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial problems. The analyses focused on intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), comparing the ICC 95 % lower confidence interval (CI) value with a critical value of 0. 70. Results: The ICCs for the nine multi-item scales were all above 0. 69, ranging from 0. 698 to 0. 926 (ICC 95 % <b>lower</b> CI <b>value</b> <b>range</b> 0. 588 - 0. 895). All of the scales were significantly different from our threshold reliability of 0. 70, with the exception of the cognitive functioning scale. The ICCs for the six single items ranged from 0. 741 to 0. 883 (ICC 95 % <b>lower</b> CI <b>value</b> <b>range</b> 0. 646 - 0. 835), and three of the six were statistically different from 0. 70.

These data were taken for two inlet-boundary-layer conditions. The first condition {{was that of a}} thinner inlet boundary later (boundary-layer displacement thickness, delta* approximately equal to 0. 034) produced by an inlet section approximately 1 inlet diameter in length between the entrance bell and the diffuser. The second condition was a thicker inlet boundary layer (delta* approximately equal to 0. 120) produced by an additional inlet section length of approximately 6 diameters. Longitudinal static-pressure distributions were measured fro wall static orifices. Transverse total- and static-pressure surveys were made at the inlet and exit stations. Boundary-layer velocity distributions were measured at seven stations between the inlet and exit. These data were obtained for a Reynolds number (based on inlet diameter) range of 1 x 10 (exp 6) to 3. 9 x 10 (exp 6). The corresponding Mach number range was from M = 0. 2 to choking. At the maximum-power-available condition supersonic flow was obtained as far as 4. 5 inches downstream from the diffuser inlet with a maximum Mach number of M approximately equal to 1. 5. The total-pressure loss through the diffuser in percentage of inlet dynamic pressure was approximately 2. 5 percent for the thinner inlet boundary later and 5. 5 percent for the thicker inlet boundary later over the <b>lower</b> subsonic <b>range.</b> These <b>valued</b> increased with increasing flow rate- the values for the thicker inlet boundary later more than those for the thinner inlet boundary layer.

In the PIK 3 CD gene, a C 896 T substitute in exon 7 was detected. This mutation causes primary immunodeficiency and is an autosomal dominant disease. Conclusion: The PIK 3 CD C 896 T mutation responsible for primary immunodeficiency {{may contribute to the}} onset of bilateral SSNHL with subsequent rapid progression...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{apparent}} recovery fraction (ARF) {{of applied}} nitrogen (N) by a crop is calculated as {{the difference between}} the total N uptake by crops from fertilized and unfertilized treatments per unit N applied. The 15 N recovery fraction (15 SNRF) is calculated as the amount of 15 W-labeled N recovered in fertilized crops per unit 15 SN-Iabeled N applied. The relationship between ARF and 15 NRF is discussed {{on the basis of a}} complete-mixing model for the distribution of 15 N-labeled N over different N pools in the soil-crop system. Mineralization-immobilization turnover in soil is not considered in the model. It is shown that in the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of ARF <b>values,</b> i. e., on soils high in available N, values of 15 NRF are likely to exceed those of ARF. This is because the fertilizer N mixes with the soil mineral N pool and thus the plant derives its N from applied as well as soil N, even if there is little or no crop response to applied N. In the higher <b>range</b> of ARF <b>values,</b> i. e., in N-deficient soils, values of 15 SNRF may be lower than those of ARF due to an increased uptake efficiency of soil N in fertilized treatments. Loss of N, either from the fertilizer or from the mixed soil mineral N pool, reduces the <b>range</b> of <b>values</b> of 15 WRF and ARF. From an agronomic point of view, ARF is a meaningful quantity as it accurately reflects the overall effect of fertilizer application on crop N uptake, whereas 15 SNRF is a meaningful quantity in 15 N tracer studies on N fertilizer use efficiency and N balances in soil-crop systems. In the absence of mineralization-immobilization turnover in soil, the fertilizer N recovery in the crop is accurately estimated by 15 NRF...|$|R

The simulation technique was based on performing a series of grand canonical Monte Carlo calculations for {{a small number of}} state points and combining the results to obtain the phase behavior of a system over a range of temperatures and densities. Critical parameters were determined from mixed-field finite-size scaling concepts by matching the order parameter distribution near the critical point to the distribution for the three-dimensional Ising universality class. Calculations for the simple cubic lattice (coordination number z) 6) and for a high coordination number version of the same lattice (z) 26) were performed for chain lengths significantly longer than those in previous simulation studies. The critical temperature was found to scale with a chain length following the Flory-Huggins functional form. For the z) 6 lattice, the extrapolated infinite chain length critical temperature is 3. 71 (0. 01, in excellent agreement with previous calculations of the temperature at which the osmotic second virial coefficient is zero and the mean end-to-end distance proportional to the number of bonds. This confirms that the three alternative definitions of the £ temperature are equivalent in the limit of long chains. The critical volume fraction scales with a chain length with an exponent equal to 0. 38 (0. 01, in agreement with experimental data but in disagreement with polymer solution theories. The width of the coexistence curve prefactor was tentatively found to scale with a chain length with an exponent of 0. 20 (0. 03 for z) 6 and 0. 22 (0. 03 for z) 26.

The mechanistic relationship linking F CO 2, Δ in leaf sap, and sap flow based canopy stomatal conductance (G s) was applied in our study. No significant seasonal variations {{were observed in}} Δ or in {{the ratio of the}} intercellular and ambient CO 2 concentrations (C i / C a), although diurnal C i / C a varied between sunlit and shaded leaves. A sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of F CO 2 were more sensitive to dynamics in G s than in C a and Δ. By using seasonally and canopy averaged C i / C a values, an acceptable estimate of F CO 2 was obtained. F CO 2 exhibited similar diurnal variation to that of G s. Large seasonal variation in F CO 2 was attributed to the responsiveness of G s to vapour pressure deficit, photosynthetically active radiation, and soil moisture deficit. Our estimate of F CO 2 for a mature A. mangium plantation (2. 13 ± 0. 40 g C m − 2 day − 1) approached the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of <b>values</b> for subtropical mixed forest, probably due to lower mean canopy stomatal conductance, higher C i / C a, and greater tree height than other measured forests. Our estimate was also lower than values determined by satellite-based modeling or component carbon analysis, suggesting the necessity of stand level flux data for verification. Qualitatively, the sap flux/stable isotope results compared well with gas exchange results. Differences in results between the two approaches reflected variability due to leaf position and age, which could be reduced for sap flux/stable isotope, which uses canopy average values of G s and C i / C a...|$|R

Viable cell counts yielded slightly <b>lower</b> <b>values,</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 1 x 10 (8) to 1. 2 x 10 (8) spirochetes per ml of rumen fluid. The antibiotic rifampin, which served as a selective agent for rumen spirochetes, was added to agar media used in the estimation of viable spirochete numbers in rumen fluid. Morphologically diverse spirochetes were isolated from rumen fluid {{by means of}} a procedure involving the use of rifampin as a selective agent in agar media. The strains isolated represented seven morphological types of spirochetes differing in cell size, cell coiling pattern, and number of periplasmic fibrils per cell. Electron microscopy showed that the number of periplasmic fibrils present in the different morphological types of rumen spirochetes ranged from 2 to more than 20 per cell.

40|$|Abstract: Gutenberg-Richter {{relation}} is {{used for}} obtaining the relationships of earthquake num-ber with different magnitudes. The regression result, b value, represents the ratio of earthquake numbers. The lower value means the frequently occurrence of larger earthquakes and mainly distributed in seismic zones and high geo-stress areas. Acoustic Emission(AE) is the energy re-leasing during loading or fracturing process of materials. It acts like a transient wave {{which is similar to}} the seismic waves. In this study, G-R relation is revised and then applied for process-ing AE data. Two different type sensors were adopted for acquiring high frequency signals of concrete specimen under compression. The regression parameter, bA value, was discussed for different loading levels and the integrity of materials. The primary results show good linear rela-tion between logarithm of amplitudes and appearing numbers. For larger amplitude <b>range,</b> bA <b>value</b> is around 2. 5 during the whole loading process. It means this value is dependent with loading levels and fracturing of materials and also unchanged with different acquisition and processing parameters. This value could properly reflect the property of AE events. For <b>lower</b> amplitude <b>range,</b> bA <b>value</b> varies with increasing loading. The variation is not obvious for me-dium loading level. At high loading level, bA value decreases significantly. It suddenly drops beneath 1 at the failure of specimen. This variation is the same for records with different sensors. For AE monitoring, this value could be used for predict the failure of materials...|$|R

Canopy CO 2 uptake (F CO 2) of a subtropical mature A. mangium plantation was estimated by combining sap flow measurements and stable carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) in Southern China from 2004 to 2007.
