40|$|Investigations of modal {{parameters}} for a mistuned packet of turbine blades due to <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> damage are reported using analytical and numerical studies with a simplified model. The turbine blade {{is assumed to}} be an Euler-Bernoulli beam connected with a <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> which is modeled as a mass less linear elastic spring. Thus, the blade is considered as a continuous system and <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> as a discrete system. The analytical results using Eigen value analysis are compared with numerical results obtained using commercial finite element package. In real life situation, though not reported in the literature, it is the failure of <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> that occurs quite often compared to the turbine blade and acts as precursor to the subsequent blade damage if it goes undetected. Therefore, studying the modal parameters of the grouped turbine blades in the context of <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> failure becomes important. The effect of variation of <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> location and stiffness indicative of damage resulting in the loss of stiffness on modal parameters is investigated.

The reasonability of this method is verified by the results from other methods, for example, rule. The internal frictional angle of filling earth, the seismic intensity, {{and the frequency of}} the input earthquake wave have a predominant effect on the needed total tensile force of the <b>lacing</b> <b>wires,</b> which shows that (1) the needed total tensile force of the <b>lacing</b> <b>wires</b> goes up with the increase of the PGA and the internal frictional angle; (2) the needed total tensile force of the expandability <b>lacing</b> <b>wires</b> is bigger than that of the nonexpandability lacing wires; (3) the needed total tensile force of <b>lacing</b> <b>wires</b> is saddle distributed and the force achieves maximum value when the frequency of input wave equals the natural frequency of reinforced retaining wall. Besides, if the reinforced retaining wall is designed in compliance with the rules, the emergency capacity of reinforced retaining wall is reduced.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The vibration of a turbocharger blade and dynamic characteristics of bladed packets connected by a <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> have been studied. The study was carried out using three analytical and experimental methods. They are: Modal Testing, Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPD and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Vibration modes of a turbocharger blade with aerodynamic profile, with and without a <b>lacing</b> <b>wire,</b> were identified using model blades with simplified geometry. The separation of coupled modes was achieved using ESPI tests. The modes of vibrations of bladed packets were identified. The effect of inter-blade coupling through a <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> is that a cluster of sub-modes are generated in bladed packets corresponding to each fundamental mode of the freestanding blade, {{the number of the}} sub-modes being equal to the number of blades in the packet. Apart from the fundamental sub-mode, the vibration of all other submodes are out of phase with different phase relations. The stiffness of the <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> and its location with respect to the blade make great contributions towards certain mode clusters in terms of mode shapes and natural frequencies. The nonlinearity of the stiffness of the deformed <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> caused by centrifugal force was established. The coupling of this non linearity with different vibration amplitudes, due to different phase relation, results in the dynamic mistuning in <b>lacing</b> <b>wire</b> stiffness. This mistuning {{is considered to be a}} major attribute in reducing the responses at resonance...|$|E

40|$|PaperPg. 99 - 110. Following {{a review}} of {{possible}} alternative solutions regarding {{the choice of a}} mechanical driver; i. e., electric motor, gas turbine or steam turbine, it is demonstrated that the steam turbine as applied in industry is ideally suited for integration in many processes and often provides an optimum heat/power balance. Although it involves a higher initial capital investment, the overall result is an economic optimum. The steam turbine is adaptable within a wide range as regards the specific requirements set by each application. It has a favorable output/speed characteristic and is an independent source of power, unaffected - given proper design - by unusual operating conditions. Emphasizing the need for highly reliable machines, a design concept is presented, founded on a sound philosophy regarding mechanical design, safety and reliability. The system is an intelligent application of the modular design concept, supported by extensive research, testing and advanced computing technology. A description of requirements for applications in various widely differing industries demonstrates the suitability of this design concept. Attention is drawn to considerations leading to the actual choice of a turbine, such as efficiency, impulse or reaction design, and others. In view of this, an unbiased review is given of vital elements such as the rotor and its blading and the underlying design principles. Aspects of blade erosion, axial thrust and blade fixing methods, including the control stage, follow. In the design stage of last stage blading, particular attention is required regarding flow patterns, strength and resonance characteristics, but it is demonstrated that wide range variable speed units with last stage blades larger than 500 mm (20 ") can be built reliably. A special section is devoted to the elimination of dynamic stresses by suitable blade design and methods such as damping or <b>lacing</b> <b>wire.</b> Mechanical drivers can be coupled to the driven machines either by flexible or solid couplings, the latter being the only sensible solution for units of medium and large outputs, regardless of the number of cylinders.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} or reduce vibration problems inturbomachines without a high {{increase in the}} complexity of thevibratory behavior, the adjacent airfoils around the wheel areoften mechanically connected together with <b>lacing</b> <b>wires,</b> tip orpart-span shrouds {{in a number of}} identical sectors. Although anaerodynamic stabilizing effect of tying airfoils together ingroups on the whole cascade is indicated by numerical andexperimental studies, for some operating conditions suchsectored vane cascade can still remain unstable. The goal of the present work is to investigate thepossibilities of a sectored vane cascade to undergoself-excited vibrations or flutter. The presented method forpredicting the aerodynamic response of a sectored vane cascadeis based on the aerodynamic work influence coefficientrepresentation of freestanding blade cascade. The sectored vaneanalysis assumes that the vibration frequency is the same forall blades in the sectored vane, while the vibration amplitudesand mode shapes can be different for each individual blade inthe sector. Additionally, the vibration frequency as well asthe amplitudes and mode shapes are supposed to be known. The aerodynamic analysis of freestanding blade cascade isperformed with twodimensional inviscid linearized flow model. As far as feasible the study is supported by non-linear flowmodel analysis as well as by performing comparisons againstavailable experimental data in order to minimize theuncertainties of the numerical modeling on the physicalconclusions of the study. As has been shown for the freestanding low-pressure turbineblade, the blade mode shape gives an important contributioninto the aerodynamic stability of the cascade. During thepreliminary design, it has been recommended to take intoaccount the mode shape as well rather than only reducedfrequency. In the present work further investigation using foursignificantly different turbine geometries makes these findingsmore general, independent from the low-pressure turbine bladegeometry. The investigation also continues towards a sectoredvane cascade. A parametrical analysis summarizing the effect ofthe reduced frequency and real sector mode shape is carried outfor a low-pressure sectored vane cascade for differentvibration amplitude distributions between the airfoils in thesector as well as different numbers of the airfoils in thesector. Critical (towards flutter) reduced frequency maps areprovided for torsion- and bending-dominated sectored vane modeshapes. Utilizing such maps at the early design stages helps toimprove the aerodynamic stability of low-pressure sectoredvanes. A special emphasis in the present work is put on theimportance for the chosen unsteady inviscid flow model to bewell-posed during numerical calculations. The necessity for thecorrect simulation of the far-field boundary conditions indefining the stability margin of the blade rows isdemonstrated. Existing and new-developed boundary conditionsare described. It is shown that the result of numerical flowcalculations is dependent more on the quality of boundaryconditions, and less on the physical extension of thecomputational domain.
