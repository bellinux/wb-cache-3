5|$|Snow <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> icings are two {{principal}} issues for roofs. Snow loads {{are related to}} the climate in which a structure is sited. Icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, a {{connecting}} {{track was}} opened through downtown Norwich, allowing trains from the Norwich and Worcester Railroad {{to connect to}} steamers at New London rather than Allyn's Point. Use of the connection stopped in November 1855, but was continuous after April 1859. After {{the completion of the}} New London & Stonington to Groton Wharf in 1858, ferry service ran from New London to Groton to allow through railroad service. The NH station was soon too small to handle large passenger <b>loads,</b> <b>and</b> the Bureau of Railroad Commissioners was petitioned for a new station as early as 1859.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Richmond and {{neighbouring}} Twickenham on {{the opposite}} bank of the Thames, {{both of which were}} distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck.|$|E

5|$|M34 Prime Mover – M34 Prime Movers {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed <b>loads,</b> <b>and</b> multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Rocket {{remained}} in {{use with the}} L after the accident, albeit rarely used for anything other than internal engineering duties. The more advanced Planet design was better suited to heavy <b>loads,</b> <b>and</b> Rocket became redundant. In 1834 it was used for experiments with new drive systems, after which it was put in storage. In 1836 it was sold to the Midgeholme Colliery, and used to haul coal until 1844.|$|E
5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily {{be stored in}} quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical <b>loads,</b> <b>and</b> maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} reliability methods {{in the development of}} a <b>load</b> <b>and</b> resistance factor design (LRFD) bridge codes. Structural performance is measured in terms of the reliability index. <b>Load</b> <b>and</b> resistance models are summarized. An important step is the selection of the target reliability index <b>and</b> calculation of <b>load</b> <b>and</b> resistance factors. <b>Load</b> <b>and</b> resistance factors are derived so that the reliability of bridges designed using the proposed provisions is at the predefined target level...|$|R

40|$|Measuring icing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> icing rate are {{important}} parameters for an atmospheric icing sensor. A new icing sensor {{has recently been}} designed and developed at Narvik University College for measuring atmospheric icing rate, icing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> icing type. Unlike the existing atmospheric icing sensors commercially available in market, which uses the axial loading for measuring icing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> icing rate, this new sensory system measures icing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> icing rate using the torque loading physics. The performance of this new icing sensor has been tested and validated at cryospheric environment simulator Japan. This research work focus upon the lab based experimentation and evaluation of axial <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> torque <b>loading</b> sensory physics during an icing event. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has prevented a problem for pedestrians attempting to cross it. Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle heavy <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the problem of the wooden bridge floor gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high crossing point above the river means it is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
5|$|Using these {{metal frames}} for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to {{increased}} wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing {{had to be}} introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> moments on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s.|$|E

40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the topic of work-related <b>load</b> <b>and</b> stress in {{psychological}} context. Its theoretical part brings a review of general default and recent information on work-related <b>load</b> <b>and</b> stress and related phenomena. It focuses on primary models and defines the terms of work-related <b>load</b> <b>and</b> stress refering to ambiguity of their comprehension within the literature. Using the theorethical models it explains the principals of origin and effects of work- related <b>load</b> <b>and</b> stress {{and the role of}} other factors in this process. It mentions the causes and consequences of work-related <b>load</b> <b>and</b> stress on health, social relationships and performance of employees. The thesis further focuses on phenomena related to work-related <b>load</b> <b>and</b> stress. It brings the information on employee well-being, burnout, engagement and workaholism. It looks at these phenomena within the context of job demands and resources. At the end it concentrates on the possibilities of coping and prevention. The practical part of the thesis contains the proposal of a research project designed to study correlations of selected job demands and resources with burnout, engagement and workaholism in psychologists...|$|R
5|$|Defense of the Ancients is {{maintained}} via official forums. Users can post ideas for new heroes or items, {{some of which}} are added to the map. Players have contributed icons and hero descriptions and created the artwork displayed while the map <b>loads,</b> <b>and</b> suggestions for changes to existing heroes or items are taken seriously; IceFrog once changed a new hero less than two weeks after the new version of the map was released. Versions of the scenario where enemy heroes are controlled by artificial intelligences have also been released. Mescon continued to maintain dota-allstars.com, which by the end of IceFrog's affiliation in May 2009 had over 1,500,000 registered users and had received over one million unique visitors every month. Due to their separation, IceFrog announced that he would be further developing a new official site, playdota.com, while continuing game development; Mescon closed dota-allstars on July 22, 2010, citing dropping statistics and his new passion for League of Legends as the reason for its end.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as much of a problem to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E
5|$|The Eidgenössische Flugzeugwerke Emmen N-20 was a semi-tailless {{swept wing}} jet {{similar to the}} U.S. Navy's Vought F7U Cutlass with four engines mounted {{internally}} in the wings, fold-out canards to improve its aerodynamics at slow speeds, and a maximum designed airspeed of 1200km/h, a remarkable velocity for an aircraft of the early 1950s. The FFA P-16 was a single-engine straight-wing aircraft for which a contract for production of 100aircraft was awarded in 1958, but after the second crash of a pre-production model, the order was canceled. The aircraft had met all Swiss Air Force requirements for an STOL attack fighter capable of carrying heavy <b>loads,</b> <b>and</b> the crash was widely considered a pretext for the Swiss parliament to reverse itself. In addition, {{by the middle of}} 1958, influenced by NATO concepts, the LVK had redefined the Swiss doctrine of air power from close air support to counter-air operations. Further, the strategic concepts governing Swiss defense doctrine had shifted to a dynamic (mobile) defense that included execution of air missions beyond the Swiss border and the possibility of carrying nuclear weapons, for neither of which the P–16was suitable.|$|E
