5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{commented on the}} {{metallic}} nature {{of some of the}} properties of astatine. Since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes, and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number, it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase. Astatine may be metallic in the <b>liquid</b> <b>state</b> on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of vaporization (∆Hvap) greater than ~42 kJ/mol are metallic when liquid. Such elements include boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, selenium and tellurium.

5|$|The {{structure}} of solid astatine is unknown. As an analogue of iodine {{it may have}} an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.7 eV). Alternatively, if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase, as has been predicted, it may have a monatomic face-centered cubic structure. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic astatine (At2) is sparse and inconclusive.

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{introductory}} {{review of the}} physics of quantum spin <b>liquid</b> (QSL) <b>states.</b> Quantum magnetism is a rapidly evolving field, and recent developments reveal that the ground states and low-energy physics of frustrated spin systems may develop many exotic behaviors once we leave the regime of semi-classical approaches. The {{purpose of this article}} is to introduce these developments. The article begins by explaining how semi-classical approaches fail once quantum mechanics become important and then describes the alternative approaches for addressing the problem. We discuss mainly spin 1 / 2 systems, and we spend most of our time in this article on one particular set of plausible spin <b>liquid</b> <b>states</b> in which spins are represented by fermions. These states are spin-singlet states and may be viewed as an extension of Fermi <b>liquid</b> <b>states</b> to Mott insulators, and they are usually classified in the category of so-called SU(2), U(1) or Z_ 2 spin <b>liquid</b> <b>states.</b> We review the basic theory regarding these states and the extensions of these states to include the effect of spin-orbit coupling and to higher spin (S> 1 / 2) systems. Two other important approaches with strong influences on the understanding of spin <b>liquid</b> <b>states</b> are also introduced: (i) matrix product states and projected entangled pair states and (ii) the Kitaev honeycomb model. Experimental progress concerning spin <b>liquid</b> <b>states</b> in realistic materials, including anisotropic triangular lattice systems (κ-(ET) _ 2 Cu_ 2 (CN) _ 3 and EtMe_ 3 Sb[(Pd(dmit) _ 2]_ 2), kagome lattice systems (ZnCu_ 3 (OH) _ 6 Cl_ 2) and hyperkagome lattice systems (Na_ 4 Ir_ 3 O_ 8), is reviewed and compared against the corresponding theories.

25|$|The {{melting point}} is {{sensitive}} to extremely large changes in pressure, but generally this sensitivity is orders of magnitude less than that for the boiling point, because the solid-liquid transition represents only a small change in volume. If, as observed in most cases, a substance is more dense in the solid than in the <b>liquid</b> <b>state,</b> the melting point will increase with increases in pressure. Otherwise the reverse behavior occurs. Notably, {{this is the case}} of water, as illustrated graphically to the right, but also of Si, Ge, Ga, Bi. With extremely large changes in pressure, substantial changes to the melting point are observed. For example, the melting point of silicon at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) is 1415°C, but at pressures in excess of 10 GPa it decreases to 1000°C.|$|E
25|$|Two {{things are}} {{characteristic}} for the {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) when compared with other reactor types: coolant loop separation from the steam system and pressure inside the primary coolant loop. In a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with demineralized/deionized water. A boiling water reactor, by contrast, has only one coolant loop, while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water for coolant and moderator (e.g. sodium in its <b>liquid</b> <b>state</b> as coolant or graphite as a moderator). The pressure in the primary coolant loop is typically , which is notably higher than in other nuclear reactors, and nearly twice that of a boiling water reactor (BWR). As an effect of this, only localized boiling occurs and steam will recondense promptly in the bulk fluid. By contrast, in a boiling water reactor the primary coolant is designed to boil.|$|E
25|$|A {{liquid is}} a nearly {{incompressible}} fluid that {{conforms to the}} shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, {{it is one of the}} four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the <b>liquid</b> <b>state</b> is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.|$|E

40|$|Recently, thermal Hall {{effect has}} been {{observed}} in the paramagnetic state of Volborthite, which consists of distorted Kagome layers with S= 1 / 2 local moments. Despite {{the appearance of a}} magnetic order below 1 K, the response to external magnetic field and unusual properties of the paramagnetic state above 1 K suggest possible realization of exotic quantum phases. Motivated by these discoveries, we investigate possible spin liquid phases with fermionic spinon excitations in a non-symmorphic version of the Kagome lattice, which belongs to the two-dimensional crystallographic group p 2 gg. This non-symmorphic structure is consistent with the spin model obtained in the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Using projective symmetry group (PSG) analysis and fermionic parton mean field theory, we identify twelve distinct Z_ 2 spin <b>liquid</b> <b>states,</b> four of which are found to have correspondence in the eight Schwinger boson spin <b>liquid</b> <b>states</b> we classified earlier.
