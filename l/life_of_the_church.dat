5|$|Women and men {{religious}} {{engage in}} a variety of occupations, from contemplative prayer, to teaching, to providing health care, to working as missionaries. While Holy Orders are reserved for men, Catholic women have played diverse roles in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> with religious institutes providing a formal space for their participation and convents providing spaces for their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing and running the Church's worldwide health and education service networks.|$|E
5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> and {{in the history of}} Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, {{and if there is a}} conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E

25|$|Sixth, {{the bishops}} played an {{important}} role in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> in Wallachia, given the high position established within the synod for them by Neagoe Basarab, which often propelled them into the role of metropolitan.

25|$|Akinola {{was among}} the Global South leaders who opposed the consecration of Gene Robinson, the first openly {{homosexual}} bishop in the Anglican Communion.

25|$|New liturgical {{resources}} were introduced, which would culminate in {{the publication of}} the Book of Alternative Services in 1985. Agitation for the ordination of women led to the vote on 18 June 1975, by the Anglican Church of Canada in favour of ordination as priests, and, eventually, bishops. Social and cultural change led to the church's decision to marry divorced couples, to endorse certain forms of contraception, and to move towards greater inclusion of homosexual people in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E

50|$|Another {{significant}} contribution made by Jesse Bader to <b>the</b> evangelistic <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> was <b>the</b> religious census. Dr. Bader {{believed that it}} was essential to know people's church preference. He was certain this needed to be obtained by churches working together visiting house to house. The technique he perfected required careful processes and months <b>of</b> preparation. <b>The</b> results, in a society that was becoming much more mobile, needed to be used quickly.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was {{originally}} laid in earthen Spanish tile, but {{was replaced with}} slate in 1915. The shingles currently in place were laid in 1994 due to deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slate and to reduce <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof. Another later addition were the four large bronze doors {{in place at the}} entrance to <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> Installed in 1965, they were cast in Italy and depict four scenes in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church's</b> patron, St. John Gualbert.|$|R
25|$|Irenaeus {{wrote in}} the 2nd century that Peter and Paul had been {{the founders of the}} church in Rome and had {{appointed}} Linus as succeeding bishop. Paul was not a bishop of Rome, nor did he bring Christianity to Rome since there were already Christians in Rome when he arrived there. Also, Paul wrote his letter to the church at Rome before he had visited Rome. Paul only played a supporting part in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> in Rome.|$|E
25|$|The <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> {{congregation}} {{began in}} 1849, {{when a group}} of Christians from various denominations, who had been meeting informally in a sail loft in Port Adelaide, formed themselves into the 'Congregational Church of Port Adelaide'. The services were led by Rev. Matthew Hodge who was asked to cut-short his journey to Victoria (from England) and stay in South Australia instead. His first service was held on 30 September 1849 in the sail loft, but later that year a small stone church was built on the corner of St Vincent and Lipson Streets.|$|E
25|$|Members {{commonly}} {{believe that}} sacraments (or ordinances) express the abiding presence of God in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> {{its members and}} priesthood. Sacraments are considered metaphorical acts designed to create and renew a person's spiritual relationship with God. Sacraments are viewed as covenants with God in response to God's grace. Community of Christ practices eight sacraments: baptism, confirmation, blessing of children, The Lord's Supper, marriage, ministration to the sick, ordination, and Evangelist's Blessing. Laying on of hands is used in confirmation, ordination, the blessing of children, ministration to the sick, and Evangelist's blessing.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church in Luxembourg was {{relatively}} silent during the war, and took no public stance regarding {{the fate of}} the Jews or the Nazi regime. On the one hand, the Bishop, Joseph Laurent Philippe, was bedridden due to illness, and was therefore in no state to provide active opposition. On the other hand, the Bishop did not want to further antagonise the occupiers and endanger the already fragile religious <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church,</b> which was heavily restricted during wartime. Bishop Philippe did, however, refuse to meet with the Nazi leadership, and made preparations in case his post should fall vacant.|$|E
25|$|The higher {{prominence}} given {{today to}} the presence of homosexual clergy, including bishops, in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> reflects broader issues, both socially and ecclesiologically (see List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality), concerning issues of social tolerance and the relationship between social change and doctrinal development. The issue has attracted greater attention in recent years following the development of the gay rights movement, and the increasing discussion within some Christian churches over the legitimacy of gay clergy in senior positions. Most notably in the selection of Gene Robinson as the Episcopal Bishop of New Hampshire in 2003, prompting wider debate across the Anglican Communion.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} of the Church's history, celibacy was {{considered}} optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many {{that most of the}} Apostles, such as Peter, were married and had families. It is clear from the New Testament (Mk 1:29–31; Mt 8:14–15; Lk 4:38–39; 1 Tim 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6) that at least Peter had been married, and that bishops, presbyters and deacons of the Early Church were often married as well. It is also clear from epigraphy, the testimony of the Church Fathers, synodal legislation, papal decretals and other sources that in the following centuries a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a normal feature of the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church.</b> Celibacy was not required for those ordained, but still was a discipline practised in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life.|$|E
