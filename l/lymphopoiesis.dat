All lymphocytes originate, during this process, from a common lymphoid progenitor before differentiating into their distinct lymphocyte types. The differentiation of lymphocytes follows various pathways in a hierarchical fashion {{as well as in}} a more plastic fashion.

2500|$|Hematopoiesis {{is defined}} as the {{formation}} and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). [...] HSPCs are primitive cells capable of self-renewal and initially differentiate into common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells. [...] CMPs represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that myelopoeisis begins. [...] During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation takes place including thrombopoiesis, erythropoeisis, granulopoeisis, and [...] monocytopoeisis. [...] CLPs subsequently differentiate into B-cells and T-cells in a process designated <b>lymphopoiesis.</b> [...] Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in hematopoietic cells it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. [...] In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [...] This hypothesis was substantiated when pre-mir-155 transduced HSPCs generated 5-fold fewer myeloid and 3-fold fewer erythroid colonies. [...] Additionally, Hu et al. demonstrated that the homeobox protein, HOXA9, regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in hematopoiesis. [...] These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in SPI1 (i.e. PU.1), a transcription factor and a regulator of myelopoiesis, and a validated target of this miRNA. [...] It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [...] Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [...] Finally, it was established that regulatory T-cell (Tregs) development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown {{to play a role in}} Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting SOCS1, a negative regulator for IL-2 signaling.

50|$|In {{the case}} of mammals such as humans, <b>lymphopoiesis</b> begins with limited passive {{provision}} by the mother of lymphocytes and substantial immunoglobulin G that cross the placenta and enter the fetus to provide some protection against pathogens, and also leukocytes that come from breast milk and enter circulation via the digestive tract. It is often not effective in preventing infections in the newborn. However early in gestation the developing embryo has begun its own <b>lymphopoiesis</b> from the fetal liver. <b>Lymphopoiesis</b> also arises from the yolk sac. This {{is in contrast to}} the adult where all lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lymphopoiesis</b> is now usually used interchangeably {{with the}} term [...] "lymphocytopoiesis" [...] - the making of {{lymphocytes}} - but other sources may distinguish between the two, stating that [...] "lymphopoiesis" [...] additionally refers to creating lymphatic tissue, while [...] "lymphocytopoiesis" [...] refers only {{to the creation of}} cells in that tissue. It is rare now for <b>lymphopoiesis</b> to refer to the creation of lymphatic tissues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphopoiesis</b> {{continues}} {{throughout life}} and so progenitor cells and their parent stem cells {{must always be}} present.|$|E
50|$|Pathosis in <b>lymphopoiesis</b> {{leads to}} any of various {{lymphoproliferative}} disorders, such as the lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lymphopoiesis</b> (lĭm'fō-poi-ē'sĭs) (or lymphocytopoiesis) is the {{generation}} of lymphocytes, {{one of the five}} types of white blood cell (WBC). It is more formally known as lymphoid hematopoiesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphopoiesis</b> can {{be viewed}} in a {{mathematical}} sense as a recursive process of cell division and also {{as a process of}} differentiation, measured by changes to the properties of cells.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} major types of lymphocytes, many sub-types, and {{hundreds}} or thousands of lymphocyte cell types that have been identified by scientists. All are generated by normal or abnormal <b>lymphopoiesis</b> except for certain artificial strains created in the laboratory by development from existing strains. Although lymphocytes are usually considered mature (as seen in blood tests) they are certainly not inert but can and do get around the body to anywhere there is a need; and when such need arises, new rounds of 'downstream' <b>lymphopoiesis</b> such as cell multiplication and differentiation may arise, coupled with intense mitotic and metabolic activity.|$|E
5000|$|Lymphocytes are the {{cornerstone}} of the adaptive immune system. They are derived from common lymphoid progenitors. The lymphoid lineage is primarily composed of T-cells and B-cells (types of white blood cells). This is <b>lymphopoiesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Myelopoiesis {{refers to}} 'generation of {{cells of the}} myeloid lineage' and erythropoiesis refers to 'generation of cells of the erythroid lineage' etc., so {{parallel}} usage has evolved in which <b>lymphopoiesis</b> refers to 'generation of cells of the lymphoid lineage'.|$|E
50|$|The thymus is {{largest and}} most active during the {{neonatal}} and pre-adolescent periods. By the early teens, the thymus begins to atrophy and thymic stroma is mostly replaced by adipose tissue. Nevertheless, residual T <b>lymphopoiesis</b> continues throughout adult life.|$|E
50|$|A {{generally}} regarded valid map of B cell <b>lymphopoiesis</b> {{is as follows}} in sequence, in two parts with the first being in the bone marrow and the second in the spleen:. The development process in the bone marrow occurs in Germinal Centers.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{whatever}} the details {{may turn out}} to be, the process of <b>lymphopoiesis</b> always seems to relentlessly give rise to progeny with special attributes and abilities - [...] "superpowers" [...] so to speak - but with progressively more restricted lymphoid developmental potential.|$|E
50|$|B <b>lymphopoiesis</b> occurs {{exclusively}} in the bone marrow and B lymphocytes are made continuously throughout life there in a 'microenvironment' composed of stromal cells, extracellular matrix, cytokines and growth factors, which are critical for proliferation, differentiation, and survival of early lymphocyte and B-lineage precursors.|$|E
5000|$|Changes in cytoplasm, {{morphology}} of {{the cell}} nucleus, granules, cell internal biochemistry, signaling molecules and cell surface markers are difficult to correlate with definite stages in <b>lymphopoiesis.</b> The morphological differences do not just correspond to steps in mitosis (somatic cell division), but result from continuous [...] "maturation processes"{{of the cell}} nucleus {{as well as of}} the cytoplasm and so one must not be too rigid about morphological distinctions between certain cell stages.|$|E
50|$|A {{common cause}} for Weaver {{syndrome}} is mutations in the EZH2 gene on chromosome 7q36. EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste, Drosophila, homolog 2), {{is the second}} histone methyltransferase associated with human overgrowth. It encodes the catalytic component of the PRC2 protein complex (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2), which regulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and {{has been found to}} repress transcription. EZH2 also has critical roles in stem cell maintenance and cell lineage determination, such as osteogenesis, myogenesis, <b>lymphopoiesis</b> and hematopoiesis.|$|E
50|$|New {{questions}} {{emerge in}} immunology continuously {{as though there}} were a stem cell for questions. For example {{it was thought that}} the process of <b>lymphopoiesis</b> was a direct, orderly unidirectional sequence. But it is not clear if end-stage lymphocytes come from progenitors that are homogeneous populations or overlapping populations. Nor is it clear whether lineages of lymphocytes develop via a continuum of differentiation with a progressive loss of lineage options or whether abrupt events result in the acquisition of certain properties.|$|E
50|$|Trypanosomes {{are also}} able to achieve evasion through the {{mediation}} of the host's immune response. Through the conversion of ATP to cAMP by the enzyme adenylate cyclase, the production of TNF-α, a signaling cytokine important for inducing inflammation, is inhibited in liver myeloid cells. In addition, trypanosomes are able to weaken the immune system by inducing B cell apoptosis (cell death) and the degradation of B cell <b>lymphopoiesis.</b> They are {{also able to}} induce suppressor molecules that can inhibit T cell reproduction.|$|E
50|$|B {{lymphocytes}} {{are identified}} {{by the presence of}} soluble immunoglobulin G (IgG). This is the most common protective immunoglobulin in the adult body. After antigenic stimulation, B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete large quantities of soluble IgG. This is the final stage of B <b>lymphopoiesis</b> but it is the clincher because the plasma cells must either issue antibody close to a source of infection, or disseminate it in the blood to fight an infection at a distance or in an inaccessible part of the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{changes were}} sparked by {{observations}} that <b>lymphopoiesis</b> {{did not always}} break into two lineages {{at the level of}} the CLP. Worse, some macrophages (long considered a myeloid lineage) could be generated by lymphoid lineage progenitors. In essence focus has been shifted away from the CLP to the MLP (lymphoid-specified progenitors), which are clearly lymphoid progenitors yet retain some myeloid potential, particularly the interesting ability in both man and mouse to make macrophages - one of the most versatile of immune cell defenders - and also many dendritic cells, the best 'watchdogs' of antigen invaders.|$|E
50|$|The {{partial loss}} of {{or loss of}} {{function}} of any white blood cell type is a serious health matter and <b>lymphopoiesis</b> is absolutely necessary for life. Mature lymphocytes are {{a critical part of}} the immune system that (with the exception of memory B and T cells) have short lives measured in days or weeks and must be continuously generated throughout life by cell division and differentiation from cells such as common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in mice. Were this system to fail, the body would be largely undefended from infection.|$|E
5000|$|Cluster of {{differentiation}} (CD) molecules are markers on {{the cell}} surface, as recognized by specific sets of antibodies, used to identify the cell type, stage of differentiation and activity of a cell. CD135 is an important cell surface marker used to identify certain types of hematopoietic (blood) progenitors in the bone marrow. Specifically, multipotent progenitors (MPP) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) express high surface levels of CD135. This marker is therefore used to differentiate hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which are CD135 negative, from MPPs, which are CD135 positive. (See Lymphopoiesis#Labeling <b>lymphopoiesis)</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the E protein (class I) family of helix-loop-helix {{transcription}} factors. The 9aaTAD transactivation domains of E proteins and MLL are very similar and both bind to the KIX domain of general transcriptional mediator CBP. [...] E proteins activate transcription by binding to regulatory E-box sequences on target genes as heterodimers or homodimers, and are inhibited by heterodimerization with inhibitor of DNA-binding (class IV) helix-loop-helix proteins. E proteins {{play a critical role in}} <b>lymphopoiesis,</b> and the encoded protein is required for B and T lymphocyte development.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocytes have {{a number}} of {{alarming}} properties such as the ability to wander around the body and take up lodging almost anywhere, and while on the way issue commands in the form of cytokines and chemokines and lymphokines, commands that affect many cell types in the body and which may also recursively induce further <b>lymphopoiesis.</b> One strong behavior pattern that captivates researchers and the public alike is the ability of lymphocytes to act as police, judge and executioner to kill other cells or demand that they suicide, a command that is usually obeyed. There seems to be no other sentencing option available.|$|E
5000|$|The term myeloid ( [...] + [...] ) is an {{adjective}} {{that in its}} broadest sense {{means either}} [...] "resembling bone marrow" [...] or [...] "pertaining to bone marrow", and the related adjective myelogenous (myelo- + [...] ) means [...] "arising from bone marrow". In hematopoiesis, both terms refer to blood cells that arise from a progenitor cell for granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, or platelets (the common myeloid progenitor or CMP) and often even more specifically to the lineage of the myeloblast (the myelocytes, monocytes, and their daughter types); thus, although all blood cells, even lymphocytes, are born in the bone marrow, myeloid cells in the narrowest {{sense of the term}} can be distinguished from lymphoid cells, that is, lymphocytes, which come from common lymphoid progenitor cells (CLPs) that give rise to B cells and T cells. Those cells' differentiation (that is, <b>lymphopoiesis)</b> is not complete until they migrate to lymphatic organs such as the spleen and thymus for programming by antigen challenge. Thus, among leukocytes, the term myeloid is associated with the innate immune system, in contrast to lymphoid, which is associated with the adaptive immune system. Similarly, myelogenous usually refers to nonlymphocytic white blood cells, and erythroid can often be used to distinguish [...] "erythrocyte-related" [...] from that sense of myeloid and from lymphoid. The word myelopoiesis has several senses in a way that parallels those of myeloid, and myelopoiesis in the narrower sense is the regulated formation specifically of myeloid leukocytes (myelocytes), allowing that sense of myelopoiesis to be contradistinguished from erythropoiesis and <b>lymphopoiesis</b> (even though all blood cells are produced in the marrow).|$|E

50|$|HOXB6 is a {{structural}} protein {{that has been}} shown to influence the growth and differentiation of the different blood lineages. This gene has also been shown to encourage the growth of granulocytes and monocytes, but at the cost of other blood cells. HOXB6 has the ability to cause the indefinite proliferation of murine marrow cells, as well as expand hematopoietic stem cells. When expressed abnormally, HOXB6 displays many characteristics of a potent oncoprotein. An oncoprotein can cause the transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell. Overexpression of HOXB6, along with the addition of MEIS1 protein, has been implicated in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Acute myeloid leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells, specifically the leukocytes. The chromosomal irregularity most frequently seen in HOXB6 AML is a reappearing interstitial deletion of chromosome 2. Fundamental HOXB6 expression stops myeloid differentiation and debilitates erythropoiesis, megakaryopoiesis, and <b>lymphopoiesis.</b>|$|E

50|$|LNK {{is widely}} {{expressed}} in human tissues, {{with the highest}} expression in hematopoietic cells. LNK negatively controls the activation of several receptors activation, including stem cell factor receptor (c-kit), thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (c-Fms), and their related pathways. LNK is a negative regulator of signaling in endothelial cells, such as the TNF signaling pathway, especially in inflammation. LNK {{has been found to}} function as a negative regulator in <b>lymphopoiesis,</b> megakaryopoiesis, erythropoiesis as well as HSC expansion by moderating growth factor and cytokine receptor-mediated signaling. The overexpression of LNK led to the inhibition of anti-CD3 mediated NF-AT-Luc activation, indicating that LNK is involved in the mechanism of T cell-negative regulation. In addition to its role in progenitor cell growth and commitment, LNK appears to be involved in cell motility and cellular interactions. LNK modulates crosstalk between integrin- and cytokine-mediated signals, thus controlling thrombopoiesis. LNK facilitates integrin aIIbb3 phosphorylation and signaling in order to promote platelet cytoskeleton rearrangement and spreading, and thus stabilizes thrombosis formation.|$|E
