25|$|Originally {{the video}} was planned to feature {{the story of}} a delicate-hearted protagonist, played by Yamaguchi, who is put into a glass case while evil and hypocritical events {{happened}} in the world outside the case. After discussions with the band, the plan for the video changed: the protagonist was kept, and instead the video featured a story where the protagonist was hurt by different characters and by society, culminating in a scene where he <b>lost</b> <b>something</b> important to him. The video was recorded like a theatrical play, and incorporated optical illusions created by stage techniques.|$|E

500|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Johnson {{was raised}} as the {{youngest}} of three siblings. Johnson began fighting {{at the age of}} 10, after his father's fatal heart attack. The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I <b>lost</b> <b>something,</b> a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing. Now that I think of it, of course, it was the wrong thing to do, especially putting all that burden on my mom having to deal with it." [...] Athletic, Johnson was a three-sport varsity athlete at Marquette High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. Johnson later received a full scholarship to play football at Central Methodist University, but transferred after one year to Meramec Community College where {{he was one of the}} top NJCAA wrestlers in the country.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of its centenary about 20 per cent of the LSO's members were women. Some musicians, {{including}} Davis, judged that this improved the orchestra's playing as well as its behaviour. Others, including Previn and the veteran principal trumpet Maurice Murphy, felt that although the technical standard of playing had improved, the diminution of the orchestra's machismo was a matter for regret. Comparing the LSO of 2004 with the orchestra of the 1960s and 1970s, Murphy said, [...] "Now the strings have improved so much, the playing is fantastic, but it has <b>lost</b> <b>something</b> of its gung-ho quality." [...] The orchestra of the 1960s had a reputation for tormenting conductors it disliked; even such notorious martinets as George Szell were given a hard time. By the 21st century the orchestra had long abandoned such aggression; civilities were maintained even with conductors whom the orchestra took against: they were simply never re-engaged.|$|E
500|$|When {{comparing}} {{the two brothers}} during the time Alphonse obtained {{the ability to use}} alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemist appearing in the series. Although she claims she has not thought of the characters' birthdates, Arakawa noted that she decided Edward's birthdate during the series' serialization. During a chapter in which it was mentioned that Edward was about to be 16, winter was about to begin in Hokkaido, Arakawa's birthplace, so it was decided Edward's birthdate would be in winter. In a common slapstick gag from the series, Edward is often struck by Winry Rockbell's wrench. While commenting that Edward has an ability easily dodge her, Arakawa comments that he gets hit on purpose as a result of his personality. The director of the first anime series, Seiji Mizushima, says that in the development of the story Edward [...] "evolves and devolves"; Mizushima comments that Edward is continuously overcoming inner struggles in order to determine how to grow up. The appearance of his automail in the anime is used to symbolize the intangibles of his character, making viewers note that Edward <b>lost</b> <b>something</b> important.|$|E

500|$|Paige {{transferred}} to the New York production of Sunset Boulevard to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've come home at last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was the most terrible feeling.... I'd felt I'd <b>lost</b> <b>something</b> so very important to me. I thought it had died and gone away." ...|$|E

Although some of them without doubt gained in literary style, nevertheless, to the regret of many, they also <b>lost</b> <b>something</b> of their old charm of simplicity and fervour." [...] For the profound revision of the book by Pope Pius X see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X.|$|E
2500|$|Warner Books' spokesperson, Rob Nissen, said, [...] "Mr. O'Brien is an award-winning, veteran {{business}} {{reporter with}} the New York Times and his work, as does his book, 'TrumpNation,' speak for themselves." [...] Nissen further stated that Trump willingly and extensively aided O'Brien {{in his research}} for the book, and that O'Brien was willing to meet with Trump at any time to discuss the project. Martin Garbus, a First Amendment expert who was not involved with the case, said, [...] "I think the book is totally protected. Trump would have to prove both deliberate falsity and that he <b>lost</b> <b>something</b> {{as a result of}} that falsity. I don't think he can do that." ...|$|E
60|$|Finally, {{when his}} host {{had emerged from}} a side portal of the mansion, and {{approached}} the gateway, the traveller still {{felt that there was}} <b>something</b> <b>lost,</b> or <b>something</b> gained (he hardly knew which), that set the Donatello of to-day irreconcilably at odds with him of yesterday. His very gait showed it, in a certain gravity, a weight and measure of step, that had nothing in common with the irregular buoyancy which used to distinguish him. His face was paler and thinner, and the lips less full and less apart.|$|R

2500|$|Sadly, the poet's work at {{his death}} was mostly {{unfinished}} and in fragments, and was edited and published by his friend and fellow poet Iakovos Polylas. [...] Whether Solomos was never satisfied with his work and kept little of it, whether large parts of his manuscripts were <b>lost</b> (<b>something</b> Polylas implies), or whether he had difficulties fleshing out the ambitious structure of his planned works is not clear, but the fragments show a huge disconnect between intention and surviving work: The Cretan begins with a fragment of Canto 18 and ends with Canto 22, {{and none of them}} are complete; Lambros was conceived with at least 38 cantos (of some of them only a prose summary survives), with the shortest poetic fragment consisting of a single line, and the longest containing 33 stanzas; the second draft of The Free Besieged consists of 61 fragments, of which 27 are single lines, seven are two lines, and two are half-lines.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{conversation}} with Fenchurch, she learns from Arthur about hitchhiking across the galaxy and Arthur learns that all the dolphins disappeared shortly after the world hallucinations. He and Fenchurch travel to California to see John Watson, an enigmatic scientist who claims {{to know why the}} dolphins disappeared. He has abandoned his original name in favour of [...] "Wonko the Sane", because he believes {{that the rest of the}} world's population has gone mad. Watson shows them another bowl with the words [...] "So long and thanks for all the fish" [...] inscribed on it, and encourages them to listen to it. The bowl explains audibly that the dolphins, aware of the planet's coming destruction, left Earth for an alternate dimension. Before leaving, they created a new Earth and transported everything from the original to the new one. After the meeting, Fenchurch tells Arthur that while he <b>lost</b> <b>something</b> and found it, she had found something and lost it. She desires that they travel to space together, and reach the site where God's Final Message to His Creation is written.|$|E
2500|$|The West Indies visited England {{again in}} 1933 and two trial matches {{were held in}} the Caribbean {{early in the year}} to select the side. Francis played in the second of these and took five wickets for 38 runs in the first innings and one for 17 in the second. These figures were not enough, however, to earn him {{selection}} and he joined Radcliffe in the Bolton Cricket League as a professional for both the 1933 and 1934 seasons, following on from one of the pioneers of black cricket in England, Charles Llewellyn. The tour organisers hoped that Constantine, who was playing Lancashire League cricket with Nelson, would be released from his contract for big matches; when Constantine was not released for the first Test match at Lord's, Francis was drafted in from Radcliffe to open the bowling with Manny Martindale. Francis failed to take a wicket in the match and, according to Wisden, [...] "had <b>lost</b> <b>something</b> of his pace and nip off the pitch". He was not called on again, and the Test match proved to be his last game in first-class cricket.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{attacks and}} counterattacks shifted the lines {{back and forth}} as Johnson {{received}} more and more reinforcements—McNair's Brigade (commanded by Col. David Coleman), and Deas's and Manigault's brigades from Hindman's division—but many of these men were exhausted. Van Derveer's brigade arrived from the Kelly Field line to beef up the Union defense. Brig. Gen. Patton Anderson's brigade (Hindman's Division) attempted to assault the hill in the gap between Johnson and Kershaw. Despite all the furious activity on Snodgrass Hill, Longstreet was exerting little direction on the battlefield, enjoying a leisurely lunch of bacon and sweet potatoes with his staff in the rear. Summoned to a meeting with Bragg, Longstreet asked the army commander for reinforcements from Polk's stalled wing, even though he had not committed his own reserve, Preston's division. Bragg was becoming distraught and told Longstreet that the battle was being <b>lost,</b> <b>something</b> Longstreet found inexplicable, considering the success of his assault column. Bragg knew, however, that his success on {{the southern end of the}} battlefield was merely driving his opponents to their escape route to Chattanooga and that the opportunity to destroy the Army of the Cumberland had evaporated. After the repeated delays in the morning's attacks, Bragg had lost confidence in his generals on the right wing, and while denying Longstreet reinforcements told him [...] "There is not a man in the right wing who has any fight in him." ...|$|E
