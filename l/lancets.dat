5|$|Triaenops menamena is a {{medium-sized}} species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish brown to gray. It is larger and darker than Paratriaenops auritus and P.furculus. Among living Triaenops species, it {{is smaller than}} T.persicus and T.afer, but somewhat larger than T.parvus. The extinct Triaenops goodmani, which is known only from three mandibles (lower jaws), is also larger. In the complexly shaped noseleaf (a group of fleshy structures around the nose and mouth), T.menamena has the trident structure characteristic of Triaenops and Paratriaenops: three adjacent <b>lancets</b> (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In T.menamena, the two outer <b>lancets</b> are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three <b>lancets</b> are more equal in Paratriaenops. The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal process and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process. The ears are small and broad and contain notches on the inner side. The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6mm long. The wing membrane is dark and translucent {{and the end of}} the tail usually projects from the uropatagium (tail membrane). Males average slightly larger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305mm (10.6 to 12.0in).|$|E
5|$|Every {{window in}} the church {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single <b>lancets,</b> and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four <b>lancets</b> to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch of an older window well above.|$|E
5|$|The east {{window is}} a {{memorial}} to Mrs Rosa Edwyna Powell (died 1860), of Nanteos, and her daughter Harriet Edwyna (died 1857), and was inserted by direction of the Will of her son George (died 1882). It depicts the Transfiguration of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was designed by Seddon and installed in 1884. There are other stained glass windows, including the three western <b>lancets,</b> filled with stained glass by the parishioners in 1894, {{in memory of the}} Reverend John Pugh, curate 1856–1861 and vicar 1861–1893.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Lancet</b> also publishes several {{specialty}} journals: The <b>Lancet</b> Neurology (neurology), The <b>Lancet</b> Oncology (oncology), The <b>Lancet</b> Infectious Diseases (infectious diseases), The <b>Lancet</b> Respiratory Medicine (respiratory medicine), The <b>Lancet</b> Psychiatry [...] (psychiatry), The <b>Lancet</b> Diabetes and Endocrinology (endocrinology), and The <b>Lancet</b> Gastroenterology & Hepatology (Gastroenterology) all {{of which}} publish original research and reviews. In 2013, The <b>Lancet</b> Global Health (global health) became the group's first fully open access journal.

5|$|The two-storey façade to Viaduct Road is E-shaped and regular, with a {{symmetrical}} seven-bay plan. The {{first and}} seventh bays project further forward than the centre (fourth) bay, which is formed by an elevated entrance porch. This has lancet {{windows on the}} sides, grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course. The doorway is under a segmental arch which is topped by a gable. The rest of the ground floor has larger <b>lancets</b> arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above. The south-facing walls have two pairs together, while on the inward-facing walls {{of the first and}} seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance apart. At first-floor level, similar paired <b>lancets</b> and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the roofline. The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five-light oriel windows, canted to form a 1–3–1 pattern of trefoil-headed panes. These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels. Above these at first-floor level, and also above the entrance porch, there are three-light trefoil-headed windows set under a segmental arch-shaped hood mould. Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery.|$|E
25|$|During Scott’s 1860 additions, {{what is now}} {{the north}} aisle west window of four <b>lancets,</b> {{contemporary}} with the 13th-century geometrical nave west windows, was re-sited from the original north wall of the nave. The aisle also contains Scott’s run of four windows on its long north side, all of three <b>lancets</b> with cinquefoils—lobes formed by the overlapping of five circles—set in a rosette above within a pointed head, and at the east one window of two <b>lancets</b> with a quatrefoil rosette above. Above the aisle east and west windows are small glazed trefoil openings. Between the north wall windows, and at the aisle corners, are buttresses with steeply angled double steps to the eaves of the slate roof, with their socles, or base plinths, continuing around the faces of the aisle walls.|$|E

40|$|I survey much {{evidence}} on mortality in Iraq, including {{data from the}} first and second <b>Lancet</b> surveys. The second <b>Lancet</b> survey is inconsistent with all credible and relevant information on levels and trends in violent deaths and on the geographical distribution of violence. I discuss weaknesses in attempts made by The Bloomberg School of Public Health and authors of the second <b>Lancet</b> survey to claim corroboration for the second <b>Lancet</b> survey from other sources. These attempts notwithstanding, the second <b>Lancet</b> survey is a clear outlier within a wide body of evidence on mortality in Iraq. Iraq mortality, <b>Lancet,</b> Johns Hopkins,...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{shape is}} the long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the <b>lancet.</b> <b>Lancet</b> openings are often grouped, usually as {{a cluster of}} three or five. <b>Lancet</b> openings may be very narrow and steeply pointed. <b>Lancet</b> arches are typically defined as two-centered arches whose radii are larger than the arch's span.|$|R
25|$|The {{windows in}} St Peter's include some <b>lancets</b> {{surviving}} from the 14th Century, along with much notable stained glass from renowned Victorian glass makers Heaton and Butler, Clayton and Bell, Charles Eamer Kempe, Nathaniel Westlake and James Powell and Sons.|$|E
25|$|The south {{transept}} rose (10.5m diameter, made c.1225–30) {{is dedicated}} to Christ, who {{is shown in the}} central oculus, right hand raised in benediction, surrounded by adoring angels. Two outer rings of twelve circles each contain the 24 Elders of the Apocalypse, crowned and carrying phials and musical instruments. The central lancet beneath the rose shows the Virgin carrying the infant Christ. Either side of this are four <b>lancets</b> showing the four evangelists sitting on the shoulders of four Prophets – a rare literal illustration of the theological principle that the New Testament builds upon the Old Testament. This window was a donation of the Mauclerc family, the Counts of Dreux-Bretagne, who are depicted with their arms in the bases of the <b>lancets.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1845 and 1846 the chancel was {{restored}} {{to the design of}} Sydney Smirke. The east window was turned into a three-light window, all the side windows became single <b>lancets,</b> and the clerestory was removed. In the late 1870s, a stone pulpit was erected, and in the mid-1880s new seating was installed.|$|E

5000|$|However, a {{supplement}} to the <b>Lancet</b> study published separately by its authors, as well as subsequent interviews with one of <b>Lancet's</b> authors have disputed the methodology and results of the ILCS study. On the other hand, Jon Pedersen, author of the ILCS study, has disputed the methodology and results of the <b>Lancet</b> study. For more info on this controversy see the sections titled [...] "Criticisms" [...] and [...] "UNDP ILCS study compared to <b>Lancet</b> study" [...] in <b>Lancet</b> surveys of Iraq War casualties.|$|R
2500|$|IBC {{illustrated}} {{several of}} what it calls [...] "the main data {{that are relevant to}} a comparative assessment of" [...] the ILCS study and the 2004 <b>Lancet</b> study. It points to, for example, a much larger number of clusters (2,200 for ILCS vs. 33 for <b>Lancet),</b> and a more accurate sampling rate (1 in 200 for ILCS vs. 1 in 3,000 for <b>Lancet).</b> The 2006 <b>Lancet</b> study is somewhat larger than the first (it used 47 clusters instead of 33, and had a lower sampling rate). The 2004 <b>Lancet</b> study surveyed 988 households, and the 2006 <b>Lancet</b> study surveyed 1849 households. The ILCS study surveyed 22,000 households.|$|R
25|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} following World War I, many of these windows were created by the more conservative studios as memorials to fallen soldiers. Hence there are countless two-light windows of St George and St Michael and even more <b>lancets</b> of the Good Shepherd gathering his lost sheep to the fold. These are the last product of the second Golden Age of stained glass window production.|$|E
25|$|In North America, {{hospitals}} resisted {{adoption of}} meter glucose measurements for inpatient diabetes care {{for over a}} decade. Managers of laboratories argued that the superior accuracy of a laboratory glucose measurement outweighed the advantage of immediate availability and made meter glucose measurements unacceptable for inpatient diabetes management. Patients with diabetes and their endocrinologists eventually persuaded acceptance. Some health care policymakers still resist {{the idea that the}} society would be well advised to pay the consumables (reagents, <b>lancets,</b> etc.) needed.|$|E
25|$|In the 15th century {{three of}} the single <b>lancets</b> {{on the north side}} of the {{clerestory}} were replaced with two-light square-headed windows, two large windows were inserted in the south wall of the south chapel and one in the south wall of the chancel. Also 15th century are the piscinas in the chancel and south chapel, and the octagonal font. The 13th-century clerestory was given a new roof on stone corbels late in the 15th century.|$|E
5000|$|Another five <b>lancet</b> window, Window 126 {{is known}} as the [...] "Verrière de Kerguelenen". The first <b>lancet</b> depicts the Virgin Mary with child. The second {{features}} Canon of Kerguelenen being presented by Saint Julien. Kerguelenen was the canon of the cathedral from 1489 to 1497 and the archdeacon of Poher. The third <b>lancet</b> depicts Saint Christopher with a child on his back presenting a Kerguelenen nobleman and In the fourth <b>lancet,</b> Sainte Barbe is depicted holding her tower and presenting a kneeling noblewoman. A bishop is depicted in the fifth <b>lancet.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{restored}} in 1998. The first <b>lancet</b> depicts a priest {{on his knees}} before a prie-Dieu being presented by a Holy bishop. The second <b>lancet</b> depicts a saint, either Saint Maurice or Saint Jacques le Majeur. In the third <b>lancet,</b> the Virgin Mary is shown breastfeeding the baby Jesus In the fourth and final <b>lancet</b> a canon is presented by a Holy bishop. Various phylacteries appear in the tracery.|$|R
50|$|This four <b>lancet</b> window {{features}} Sainte Catherine d'Alexandrie in {{the first}} <b>lancet.</b> She holds a fragment of the wheel on which she was martyred. In <b>lancet</b> two two bishops appear one kneeling. It is thought this is Bertrand de Rosmadec who was the Quimper bishop from 1416 to 1444. The third <b>lancet</b> features a saint in a white robe and the fourth depicts the Virgin Mary with child.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of the windows now visible at Chartres were made and installed between 1205 and 1240, but four <b>lancets</b> preserve panels of Romanesque glass from the 12th century which survived the fire of 1195. Three of these are located beneath the rose in the west façade: the Passion window to the south, the Infancy of Christ in the centre and a Tree of Jesse to the north. All three of these windows were originally made around 1145 but were restored in the early 13th century {{and again in the}} 19th.|$|E
25|$|All {{windows are}} <b>lancets.</b> The {{three in the}} north {{transept}} are very tall and have two quatrefoils above, while in the south transept two narrower windows with intricate tracery are separated by a thick mullion. There is also a quatrefoil and a sexfoil (six-lobed round window) in this wall. The aisles have three-light lancet windows, {{and there is a}} large lancet topped by a quatrefoil in the west wall of the nave. The Heaton, Butler and Bayne glass firm designed the stained glass in this window in 1892. Each lancet in the apse is separated by a thin stone shaft inside and out. This feature was copied from St Barnabas Church, Hove.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 1417, a small chapel {{was placed}} between the buttresses {{of the south}} nave for the Count of Vendôme. At {{the same time the}} small organ that had been built in the nave aisle was moved up into the triforium where it remains, though some time in the sixteenth century it was {{replaced}} with a larger one on a raised platform at the western end of the building. To this end, some of the interior shafts in the western bay were removed and plans made to rebuild the organ there. In the event, this plan was abandoned, the glass in the western <b>lancets</b> was retained and the old organ was replaced with the present one.|$|E
50|$|This window {{acknowledges}} the {{donations to the}} cathedral of the nobles Tréanna of the parish of Elliant. The first <b>lancet</b> features a kneeling Tréanna cavalier who is presented by his patron saint Saint Nicholas. In the second <b>lancet,</b> another cavalier is presented by Saint Derrien. Another cavalier appears in the third <b>lancet.</b> He appears to be from Bodigneau. The fourth <b>lancet</b> has a cavalier presented by Saint Hervé.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} <b>lancet</b> is a {{depiction}} of Saint Yves. In the second <b>lancet</b> is Saint James the Greater (known in Brittany as Saint Jacques de Turquie) holding {{a book and}} a bourbon. Saint Peter appears in <b>lancet</b> three with his key and John the Baptist features in the fourth <b>lancet.</b> The fifth and final <b>lancet</b> features Saint Louis who holds the crown of thorns. In the window's tympanum are the arms of Brittany, and of Bishops Alain Le Maout and Raoul Le Moël, Canons de Groeskaër and de Kerguelenen, of Dresnay, of Tréanna, of Kerloaguen, and of the Baron de Pont d'Abbe.|$|R
5000|$|The five <b>lancet</b> Window 123 {{is known}} as the [...] "Vitrail du Tymeur" [...] window as it honours the Tymeur family. In the first <b>lancet,</b> Saint Patern, the Bishop of Vannes, is {{depicted}} and the second <b>lancet</b> depicts John the Baptist with a noblewoman who bears the arms of Rosmadec in alliance with Tymeur. The third <b>lancet</b> carries a depiction of the Virgin Mary whilst in the fourth <b>lancet</b> Saint Michael is depicted with a cavalier bearing the arms of Tymeur. In the tracery are the arms of either Tymeur, or Tymeur in alliance with Léon, Rieux, Malestroit, Chastel and Juch.|$|R
25|$|Because {{of their}} greater {{distance}} from the viewer, {{the windows in the}} clerestory generally adopt simpler, bolder designs. Most feature the standing figure of a saint or Apostle in the upper two-thirds, often with one or two simplified narrative scenes in the lower part, either to help identify the figure or else to remind the viewer of some key event in their life. Whereas the lower windows in the nave arcades and the ambulatory consist of one simple lancet per bay, the clerestory windows are each made up of a pair of <b>lancets</b> with a plate-traceried rose window above. The nave and transept clerestory windows mainly depict saints and Old Testament prophets. Those in the choir depict the kings of France and Castille and members of the local nobility in the straight bays, while the windows in the apse hemicycle show those Old Testament prophets who foresaw the virgin birth, flanking scenes of the Annunciation, Visitation and Nativity in the axial window.|$|E
25|$|In 1134, another fire {{damaged the}} town, and perhaps {{part of the}} cathedral. The north tower was started {{immediately}} afterwards – the south tower some time later. From the beginning, it was intended that these towers flank a central porch of some sort and a narthex. When the north tower rose {{to the level of}} the second storey, the south was begun – the evidence lies in the profiles and in the masons marks on the two levels of the two towers. Between them on the first level, a chapel was constructed to Saint Michael. Traces of the vaults and the shafts which supported them are still visible in the western two bays. This chapel was probably vaulted, and those vaults saved the western glass. The stained glass in the three <b>lancets</b> over the portals date from some time between 1145 and 1155, while the south spire, some 103metres high, was also completed by 1155 or later.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the MMR vaccine was {{the subject}} of {{controversy}} after the publication in The Lancet of a 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield and others reporting case histories of 12 children mostly with autism spectrum disorders with onset soon after administration of the vaccine. At a 1998 press conference, Wakefield suggested that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single vaccination. This suggestion was not supported by the paper, and several subsequent peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. It later emerged that Wakefield had received funding from litigants against vaccine manufacturers and that he had not informed colleagues or medical authorities of his conflict of interest; had this been known, publication in The Lancet would not have taken place in the way that it did. Wakefield has been heavily criticized on scientific grounds and for triggering a decline in vaccination rates (vaccination rates in the UK dropped to 80% in the years following the study), as well as on ethical grounds for the way the research was conducted. In 2004, the MMR-and-autism interpretation of the paper was formally retracted by 10 of Wakefield's 12 coauthors, and in 2010 The <b>Lancets</b> editors fully retracted the paper. Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and is barred from practising medicine in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The {{church has}} a central porch with a {{scalloped}} bargeboard and <b>lancet</b> windows reached by timber steps to each side. The {{body of the}} church is lit by <b>lancet</b> windows and there are <b>lancet</b> windows flanking the porch and a louvred <b>lancet</b> high under the roof. This is gabled and clad in corrugated iron sheeting with a belfry on the roof ridge. The church has wide diagonal beaded boards on eaves, soffit and doors.|$|R
50|$|The {{clerestory}} is {{in three}} bays, {{and on its}} eastern gable is a cross. On its north face is one double <b>lancet</b> window, and {{on the south side}} there are three similar windows. The north aisle is in two unequal-sized bays. In its west wall is a double <b>lancet</b> window, on the north side is a double <b>lancet</b> window with Decorated tracery, and in the east wall is another <b>lancet</b> with similar tracery.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} between the <b>Lancet</b> and U.N. pre-invasion mortality rates is 3.5 deaths/1,000/year. The <b>Lancet</b> study used the number of 26,112,353 (from <b>Lancet</b> supplement) as the population of Iraq. 3.5 times 26,112 equals 91,392. So 3.5 deaths/1,000/year means around 91,400 deaths in one year in a population of 26.1 million.|$|R
