The item that is searched and the results that are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of <b>location.</b> <b>Search</b> engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Facility Location Problem is an {{important}} research topic in spatial analysis. This paper focuses on the Static and Mobile Facility Location (SMFL) Problem, which aims to identify those static and mobile facility locations that serve a target area most efficiently and equally. This paper formalizes the SMFL problem as a bi-objective model and then solves the model by using a novel heuristic algorithm, named Static and Mobile Facility <b>Location</b> <b>Searching</b> (SMFLS). The algorithm consists of two steps: static facility <b>location</b> <b>searching</b> and mobile facility <b>location</b> <b>searching.</b> In order to solve the model for large datasets efficiently, a clustering-based heuristic method is proposed for the static facility <b>location</b> <b>searching</b> while the mobile facility <b>location</b> <b>searching</b> is implemented using a greedy heuristic method. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate {{the efficiency of the}} SMFLS algorithm. In addition, with the aim of conducting facility location decision-making conveniently and efficiently, in this paper, an interactive geospatial analysis platform, named Geospatial Analysis Platform using Interactive Maps (GAPIM) is proposed by combining the bi-objective models and the SMFLS algorithm with an interactive map. Experiments on Alberta public health service data are conducted, with the results demonstrating the efficiency and practicality of the platform...|$|R
