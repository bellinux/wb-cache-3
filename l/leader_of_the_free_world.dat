2500|$|United States President Barack Obama {{shook hands}} with Cuban leader Raul Castro, the first such {{encounter}} between sitting U.S. and Cuban heads of government since Bill Clinton and Fidel Castro shook hands at the U.N. in 2000. The gesture prompted criticism from Republican politicians in Washington. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American opponent of the Castro government, said: [...] "Sometimes a handshake is just a handshake, but when the <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>world</b> shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant." [...] Senator John McCain compared the Obama–Castro handshake to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's handshake with Adolf Hitler when the two {{were in the process}} of negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 saying, [...] "Neville Chamberlain {{shook hands with}} Hitler. It gives Raul some propaganda to continue to prop up his dictatorial, brutal regime, that's all". The Cuban government welcomed the gesture, although the White House said it had been unplanned.|$|E

It was ridicule he could never shake. Several commentators and analysts in 1948 attributed the falloff in Dewey's popularity late in his presidential campaign, in part, to his distinctive mustache and resemblance to actor Clark Gable, which was said to raise doubts with voters as to the seriousness of Dewey as prospective <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>World.</b> Roger Masters, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, wrote: [...] "The shaved face has become {{a reflection of the}} Protestant ethic. Politicians are supposed to control nature in some sense, so beards and mustaches, which imply a reluctance to control nature, are now reserved for artisans or academics."

2500|$|Kishi's next {{foreign policy}} {{initiative}} {{was much more}} difficult: reworking Japan's security relationship with the United States. With this in mind, Kishi wanted to revise Articles 1 and 9 of the 1947 American-imposed constitution to allow Japan to allow the Emperor to play a more active political role and for Japan to {{have the freedom to}} once again wage war. In June 1957, Kishi visited the United States, where he was received with honor, being allowed to address a joint session of Congress, throwing the opening pitch for the New York Yankees in a baseball game in New York and being allowed to play golf at an otherwise all-white golf club in Virginia, which the American historian Michael Schaller called [...] "remarkable" [...] honors for a man who as a Cabinet minister had signed the declaration of war against the United States in 1941 and who was responsible for using thousands of Koreans and Chinese as slave labor during World War II. The Vice President of the United States, Richard Nixon introduced Kishi to Congress as a [...] "honored guest who was not only a great <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>world,</b> but also a loyal and great friend {{of the people of the}} United States", apparently unaware or indifferent to the fact that Kishi had been one of the closest associates of General Tojo, hanged by the United States for war crimes in 1948.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} the way in which American power is {{accepted}} worldwide can be seen in the way in which American domestic politics is globalized. No other polity is so widely observed as the United States, where presidential elections are often viewed across the whole world. The political scientist Yuen Foong Khong characterizes this as the American Tributary System, a system in which the President of the United States is often referred to as the <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>world,</b> similar to the mandate of heaven under the concept of tianxia. Khong suggests that while China has receded from being a tianxia to being an ordinary country, the United States has made the opposite transition, from country to tianxia.|$|E
