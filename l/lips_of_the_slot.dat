40|$|A large-chord NACA 23012 airfoil was tested. The airfoil {{extended}} completely {{across the}} test section, and two-dimensional flow was approximated. The model was {{fitted with a}} full-span slotted flap having a chord 25. 66 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airfoil chord. The ailerons investigated extended over the entire span and each had a chord 10 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airfoil chord. <b>The</b> types <b>of</b> ailerons tested were: retractable ailerons, slot-lip ailerons using <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> for ailerons, and plain ailerons on <b>the</b> trailing edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slotted</b> flap. <b>The</b> data are presented in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> curves of section lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients for the airfoil with flap deflected but with ailerons neutral, and of rolling-moment, yawing-moment, and hinge-moment coefficients calculated for a rectangular wing of aspect ratio 6 with a semi-span aileron and a full-span flap. For the ailerons investigated the data indicate that, from considerations of rolling and yawing moments produced and of stick forces desired, the retractable aileron is the most satisfactory means of lateral control for use with a full-span slotted flap...|$|R
40|$|A {{subcutaneous}} electrode structure {{suitable for}} a chronic implant and for taking a low noise electrocardiogram of an active animal, comprises a thin inflexible, smooth disc of stainless steel having a diameter as of 5 to 30 mm, which is sutured in place to the animal being monitored. The disc electrode includes a radially directed slot extending in from <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc for approximately 1 / 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diameter. Electrical connection is made to the disc {{by means of a}} flexible lead wire that extends longitudinally <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> and is woven through apertures in the disc and held at the terminal end by means of a spot welded tab. Within <b>the</b> <b>slot,</b> an electrically insulative sleeve, such as silicone rubber, is placed over the wire. The wire with the sleeve mounted thereon is captured in <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc and within <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> by means <b>of</b> crimping tabs extending laterally <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> and over <b>the</b> insulative wire. <b>The</b> marginal <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> area is apertured and an electrically insulative potting material such as silicone rubber, is potted in place overlaying <b>the</b> wire <b>slot</b> region and through the apertures...|$|R
40|$|Around {{the high}} head gates as the {{velocity}} is too high, every non uniform object {{such as a}} <b>slot</b> makes <b>the</b> flow too disturbed. Vertical-lift gate required recessed slots in abutments for <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate slides. <b>The</b> flow <b>of</b> water across <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> causes flow separation at <b>the</b> upstream <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> and reattachment on the downstream side. Eddies are set up within <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> and vortices are formed. Thus, under higher velocity flow conditions (due to high head), cavitations can occur within gate slots by fluctuations. In addition <b>of</b> cavitations <b>the</b> pressure fluctuation can make impacts on the structure too. This hydraulic phenomenon can be occurred with serious damages. In this research, experimental data is used based on measuring pressure fluctuation by pressure transducer under an experimental model which has built and taken place in Michelle Hydraulics Laboratory at civil engineering department <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Melbourne. Pressure fluctuations were measured under two group of seven piezometers along <b>the</b> two gate <b>slots</b> for gate positions of 10 %- 10 %, 30 %- 10 %, 50 %- 10 %, 70 %- 10 %, 30 %- 30 %, 50 %- 30 %, 70 %- 30 %, 50 %- 50 %, 70 %- 50 %, 70 %- 70 %, head condition behind the gates were constant for all tests. The results were analyzed and presented as Cavitations Index in two <b>slots.</b> <b>The</b> cavitation indexes were calculated in based 0. 1 % probability levels of fluctuation pressures. Other probability levels contained 1 %, 5 % as higher pressures and 95, 99 and 99. 9 % as higher pressures, were studied in this paper...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the LMAL 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel of a NACA 23021 airfoil with a double slotted flap having a chord 32 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airfoil chord (0. 32 c) to determine the aerodynamic section characteristics with the flaps deflected at various positions. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> moving <b>the</b> fore flap and rear flap as a unit and of deflecting or removing <b>the</b> lower <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> were also determined. Three positions were selected for the fore flap and at each position <b>the</b> maximum lift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airfoil was obtained with the rear flap at the maximum deflection used at that fore-flap position. <b>The</b> section lift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airfoil increased as the fore flap was extended and maximum lift was obtained with the fore flap deflected 30 deg in the most extended position. This arrangement provided a maximum section lift coefficient of 3. 31, which was higher than the value obtained with either a 0. 2566 c or a 0. 40 c single-slotted-flap arrangement and 0. 25 less than the value obtained with a 0. 4 c double-slotted-flap arrangement on the same airfoil. <b>The</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profile-drag coefficient obtained with the 0. 32 c double slotted flap were larger than those for the 0. 2566 c or 0. 40 c single slotted flaps for section lift coefficients between 1. 0 and approximately 2. 7. At all values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> section lift coefficient above 1. 0, the 0. 40 c double slotted flap had a lower profile drag than the 0. 32 c double slotted flap. At various values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximum section lift coefficient produced by various flap defections, the 0. 32 c double slotted flap gave negative section pitching-moment coefficients that were higher than those of other <b>slotted</b> flaps on <b>the</b> same airfoil. The 0. 32 c double slotted flap gave approximately the same maximum section lift coefficient as, but higher profile-drag coefficients over the entire lift range than, a similar arrangement of a 0. 30 c double slotted flap on an NACA 23012 airfoil...|$|R
