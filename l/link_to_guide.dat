40|$|The {{research}} {{concluded the}} following results: 1 - Several types of condition structures {{were included in}} the text of the large university visit. They were used to achieve the purpose that the visit sought to adopt. The condition of the condition, with its causes and consequences, contributed to adapting the minds to the high ideological content contained in the noble text. 2 - Help the condition of the condition, including thumb and thumb in the tools, {{to get rid of the}} speaker of the clear signals that may harm the recipient, especially that the visit decides the good fate of the family and the bad consequences of those who violated, was thumb and uncles a means of alerting the addressee On what he needs to know in his faith, and a <b>link</b> <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> him and convince him of the facts. 3 - the use of conditional sentence in its original order, which consists of (condition tool and the condition and condition answer) in the text of the visit, and varied instruments condition, and used three of them, namely (from, if, and). The text of the visit is considered to be a place for addressing the wise people of the nation in general, for the purpose of guiding them and alerting them to the facts of the vague things they have in the minds of non-continent. While the two tools (Lu) and (N) were used once. 4 - robbing time of doing the condition and answer in the texts of the visit, the researcher explained that the letters of the sacred texts are not subject to a specific time, but are texts that exceeded time and place, and its actions are indicative of continuity. 5 - A number of the structures of the condition have been contradicted by what is proven by the grammarians in the section on the rulings of doing the condition and its answer. The answer is a name derived from the words of the imam (peace be upon him) : " ((And the answer to you at the bottom of the gendarmerie of hell)), as these answers were not coupled with the penalty, although it is not suitable to be an answer to the condition. The researcher pointed out that these answers must be recognized in the section of the clause, a dam to the lack of extrapolation in grammar, and pointed out that the use of the texts of the infallibles (peace be upon them) in the linguistic citation, being one of the most closely related linguistic codes. 6 - The researcher presented to the structures of the police did not respond to the original order of the condition clause, and where the answer to the condition on the tool and the condition, and the grammarians in the provisions of this structure and the evidence, and concluded the opinion that such sentences can be prepared from the sentences that do not need to fully estimate the answer, And that it is satisfied with its grammatical elements, and that it is full of interest, and that it has a meaning that does not have the original order of speech. The researcher noted in the text of the visit conditional structures in which the response of the condition is repeated in the form of consecutive conditional sentences, which in its entirety constitute an answer to the condition. He also noted that sentences were repeated on a regular basis, in which conditional sentences were met in conditional conditional structures, which increased the consistency of the text and its unity, and achieved various indications recorded by the researcher in the study...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{described}} different functional cell {{types in the}} frontal eye field (FEF), but {{the reliability of the}} distinction between these types has been uncertain. Studies in other brain areas have described specific differences in the width of action potentials recorded from different cell types. To substantiate the functionally defined cell types encountered in FEF, we measured the width of spikes of visual, movement, and visuomovement types of FEF neurons in macaque monkeys. We show that visuomovement neurons had the thinnest spikes, consistent with a role in local processing. Movement neurons had the widest spikes, consistent with their role in sending eye movement commands to subcortical structures such as the superior colliculus. Visual neurons had wider spikes than visuomovement neurons, consistent with their role in receiving projections from occipital and parietal cortex. These results show how structure and function of FEF can be <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> inferences about neuronal architecture...|$|R

This Global Land Vegetation module is one of four Studying Earth's Environment from Space (SEES) modules.

Computer Lab Resources contains an instructor's guide, data and software. The instructor's guide contains exercises for using the data and software. The public domain software, a version of NIH-Image for the Macintosh that was modified by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center especially for SEES, is for data display, analysis and tutorial of satellite data. The software will also work on Windows machines with a Mac emulator. Image 2000, a cross-platform Java version of the software, is expected to be available by the end of the year 2000. Each module section can stand-alone (e. g. you don't have to use the Class Resources in order to complete the Computer Lab Resources).

In particular we analytically demonstrate that a transmission greater than one in the evanescent spectrum (amplification of the evanescent modes) can be directly <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the <b>guided</b> modes supported by the structure. Moreover we show that the slope of the phase of the transmission function in the propagating spectrum is inversely proportional to the ability of the structure to compensate the diffraction of the propagating modes. We apply these findings to discuss several examples where super-resolution is achieved thanks to the simultaneous availability of the amplification of the evanescent modes and the diffraction compensation of the propagating modes...|$|R

40|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 18 th century, the first {{integral}} pop- ulation enumeration was held in the Netherlands during the Batavian Republic. It took over 30 years before the first official census was, by royal decree, organized and conducted in 1829, and was meant to be held from then onwards every ten years. The Dutch historical censuses are the only large scale, reliable statistical datasets available about the (demo- graphic, social and economic) history of the Netherlands, covering an all-encompassing geographical area for over two centuries (1795 – 1971). Not surprisingly, the currently preserved and digitized historical censuses are the most consulted historical statistics by researchers. However, the 2 288 census tables are highly disconnected and scarcely integrated in their current form. Meaningful information is still hidden in these miss- ing table-links, meaning that this wealth of information is not reaped to its full potential. In this paper we describe the lessons learnt in CEDAR 5, a project of the Computational Humanities Programme 6, to provide so- lutions to these integration problems. Our system leverages semantic technologies and Linked Data practices, which allow us to convert the census tables into a graph of fine-grained Linked Census Data. Using the distributed architecture of the Web, we interlink this graph with other online historical socioeconomic and demographic Linked Datasets. We use the information provided by these external <b>links</b> <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> the harmonization process in our dataset. At the same time, we investigate which historical classifications are not online yet following Web stan- dards, and we use our census tables (on demographic structures, housing types, occupational classes and statuses, and religious denominations) to urge the need of publishing these historical classifications on the Web. Such historical hubs could increase enormously the interoperability of other datasets. Finally, we propose a querying pipeline on the resulting harmonized census dataset to enhance the data exploration work by his- torians and social scientists and help answering their research questions...|$|R

Recently, we developed snoGPS, a computational screening program for H/ACA snoRNAs, and applied it to Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Because of the 250 -fold larger search space compared to S. cerevisiae, significant enhancements to our algorithms were required. Complementing extensive cloning experiments performed by others, our findings include the detection and experimental verification of seven new mammalian H/ACA RNAs and the prediction of 23 new H/ACA RNA pseudouridine guide assignments. These assignments include four for H/ACA RNAs previously classified as orphan H/ACA RNAs with no known targets. We also determined systematic syntenic conservation among human and mouse H/ACA RNAs.
