5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the <b>longer</b> <b>term,</b> the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E

5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in <b>longer</b> <b>term</b> context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have robust {{efficacy}} in {{the short-term}} management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall. According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), benzodiazepines {{can be used in}} the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the <b>longer</b> <b>term</b> management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|During Western Australia's convict era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the Convict Establishment, and was used for convicts transported from Britain. <b>Longer</b> <b>term</b> local prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a cost to the colonial government, as the then-newly {{constructed}} Perth Gaol had been handed over to the British imperial government for use as a convict station for short term prisoners. Local prisoners were also been kept in the Round House, or on Rottnest Island. In 1876 Perth Gaol was transferred back to local control.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} {{there was no immediate}} prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles. In the <b>longer</b> <b>term,</b> the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the <b>longer</b> <b>term,</b> evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{are being}} made to Union Station, which is the busiest {{passenger}} transportation facility in Canada, {{and is expected to}} have its current passenger traffic double in the next 10 to 15 years. Improvements currently underway include a new roof and glass atrium covering the platforms and railway tracks, new passenger concourses, additional staircases and vertical access points and general visual improvements to the station. Other <b>longer</b> <b>term</b> options such as a second downtown station and/or connections to a future Relief Subway Line are also being studied to meet future demand.|$|E

30|$|For the phone-based STD system (P 1 B-HTK), the {{performance}} degrades when {{the length of}} the term increases. First of all, {{it must be noted that}} for phone-based STD systems, there is no difference between single- and multi-word terms, since the detection subsystem relies on a phone sequence. The edit distance method employed in the P 1 B-HTK system for term detection causes that <b>longer</b> <b>terms</b> are more difficult to keep half of their phones in the 1 -best phone sequence. Therefore, <b>longer</b> <b>terms</b> were more difficult to detect than shorter terms, despite these could generate more FAs.|$|R

5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} {{reorganization}} of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called {{for the formation of}} two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the <b>longer</b> <b>term,</b> these troops would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012 {{the state}} {{government}} announced that the freeway's diamond interchange with Reid Highway will be upgraded with the installation of extra turning lanes and traffic lights. The project is an interim solution to lower congestion and reduce the volume of traffic using local roads to avoid the interchange. The <b>longer</b> <b>term</b> plan is to upgrade Reid Highway to a dual carriageway near the freeway interchange, including a second overpass bridge. The dual carriageway works are scheduled for construction in 2014–15.|$|E

An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 {{as it became}} clear that NATO would need to enhance its defences for the <b>longer</b> <b>term</b> against a potential Soviet attack. In April 1951, Allied Command Europe and its headquarters (SHAPE) were established; later, four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria can usually expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the <b>longer</b> <b>term,</b> developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.|$|E
5|$|An {{economic}} downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because {{of tax cuts}} instituted the previous year, the budget presented by the government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and a large one, $648million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a <b>longer</b> <b>term.</b> After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led {{to an increase in}} the money supply, which in future years would hamper the government's efforts to respond to unemployment.|$|E
30|$|The {{coefficient}} completeness matrix for the clamped–hinged {{boundary conditions}} {{can be determined}} {{in the same way}} as the previous case. However, due to the non-symmetric boundary conditions in FEM, it leads to substantially more complex and <b>longer</b> <b>terms,</b> which indicates the disadvantage of the exact GBT solution.|$|R

5|$|At the time, Hooters was {{sponsoring}} a car driven by Mark Stahl, another owner-driver in the Cup series. Unlike Kulwicki, Stahl was a part-time participant who had trouble making races. The Hooters car {{failed to make}} the field for the Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 and the Atlanta-based chain, desiring a spot in the race, approached the sponsorless Kulwicki to gauge his interest. The principals agreed to at least a one-race deal, which became a much <b>longer</b> <b>term</b> deal when Kulwicki recorded an eighth-place finish in the race. Later in the season, Kulwicki won the Bristol night race for his third career win. In 29races, he had eleven top10 finishes, fourpoles, and finished 13th in the points.|$|E
5|$|During Western Australia's convict era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the Convict Establishment, and was used for prisoners transported from Britain. <b>Longer</b> <b>term</b> locally-sentenced prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a cost to the colonial government. In 1868, penal {{transportation}} to Western Australia ceased, and the number of convicts in the colony gradually declined, down to 83 in the mid-1880s. Due to the great expense of sending these convicts back to Britain, the authorities there negotiated with the colonial government to relinquish jurisdiction over them, as well as the prison complex – demolition was considered too expensive. Early negotiations had broken down, but were restarted in August 1883. After one and a half years, a compromise was reached, and the transfer was finalised on 31 March 1886.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road {{was briefly}} the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a {{professional}} rugby union team, {{in the late}} 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998–99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest in using Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at Easter Road {{with a view to}} Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a <b>longer</b> <b>term.</b> It has since been announced that the team will move to Myreside from January 2017.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} a fundamental lever of constitutional design: the duration of public office terms. We present a simple model grounded in interviews with legislators and highlight three forces shaping incentives to exert legislative effort. We exploit two natural experiments in the Argentine Congress (where term lengths were assigned randomly) to ascertain which forces are empirically dominant. Results for separate measures as well as an aggregate index of legislative effort show that <b>longer</b> <b>terms</b> increase effort. Shorter terms appear to discourage effort not due to campaign distractions but due to an investment payback logic: when effort yields returns over multiple periods, <b>longer</b> <b>terms</b> yield a higher chance of capturing those returns. A broader implication is that job stability may promote effort despite making individuals less accountable. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} the duration of legislative terms on the performance of legislators. We exploit a natural experiment in the Argentine House of Representatives where term lengths were assigned randomly. Results for various objective measures of legislative output show that <b>longer</b> <b>terms</b> enhance legislative performance. We use a second experiment in the Argentine Senate to determine whether our results are specific to a particular chamber and a particular time. The results from the Senate reinforce the idea that <b>longer</b> <b>terms</b> enhance legislative productivity. Our results highlight limits to classic theories of electoral discipline (Barro 1973, Ferejohn 1986) predicting that shorter terms, by tightening accountability, will incentivize hard work by politicians. We discuss and test possible explanations. Our results suggest that the "accountability logic" is overcome by an "investment logic. "...|$|R
