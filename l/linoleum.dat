5|$|For {{most of the}} 19th century, {{the main}} {{industries}} in the town were flax spinning and linen weaving. To cope with increasing imports of flax, timber and hemp, and exports of coal, salt and linen, between 1843 and 1846 a new wet dock and pier was built at the harbour. In 1847 a canvas manufacturer, Michael Nairn, took out a licence on Frederick Walton's patent {{for the production of}} floorcloth, and opened a factory in nearby Pathhead. When the patent expired in 1876, Nairn and other floorcloth manufacturers began the manufacture of <b>linoleum.</b> Production of both floorcloth and <b>linoleum</b> occupied seven factories in the town by 1883, employing 1,300. A further expansion of the harbour was completed between 1906 and 1908, for another increase in <b>linoleum</b> and coal.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of heavy canvas {{was started in}} 1828 by Michael Nairn at a small factory. Influenced by a visit to Bristol, Nairn started to make floorcloth at his new factory at Pathhead in 1847, where his company pioneered the use of ovens to season the floorcloth and reduce production times. When the patent belonging to Frederick Walton expired, Nairn's were able to manufacture <b>linoleum</b> from 1877 onwards. Other factories producing floorcloth and later <b>linoleum</b> were established by former employees of Michael Nairn.|$|E
50|$|Furnishings throughout, {{including}} the bedroom furniture, dining room, lounge room, chairs, settees, sideboards, etc., were designed and manufactured by the well-known Queensland home furnisher F Tritton Ltd of George Street Brisbane using beautiful Queensland wood, the Queensland maple. Carpets, <b>linoleums,</b> floor coverings, curtains, etc. (British throughout) were all laid and fitted by Trittons.|$|R
50|$|Boondooma {{comprises}} built {{elements that}} are now uncommon examples of construction methods and techniques. The principal historic buildings include an 1850s stone storehouse, which is both rare in its method of construction and an early example {{of the use of}} the metric standard in Queensland. The main house and the post office are also important surviving structures. The survival of interior finishes in the main timber house, including wallpapers and <b>linoleums,</b> contributes to its rarity.|$|R
5000|$|Leader Justine Frischmann, who had {{recently}} broken up with boyfriend Damon Albarn of Blur, started to work on Brian Eno-influenced mood music with flatmate Loz Hardy of Kingmaker, resulting on tracks like [...] "Miami Nice" [...] and [...] "My Sex", which {{ended up on the}} album. Frischmann reconnected with Annie Holland in early 1999 and formed a new line-up of the band, including Justin Welch, keyboardist/vocalist Sharon Mew, formerly of Heave, guitarist Paul Jones (<b>Linoleum's</b> former member) and keyboardist Dave Bush, formerly of The Fall.|$|R
5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to <b>linoleum,</b> which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the <b>linoleum</b> industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Linseed oil's {{properties}} as a polymer make it highly {{suitable for}} wood finishing, {{for use in}} oil paints, as a plasticizer and hardener in putty and in making <b>linoleum.</b> When used in food or medicinally, linseed oil is called flaxseed oil.|$|E
5|$|Besides similar fonts, many {{signs and}} objects made in Britain {{during the period}} of Gill Sans' dominance, such as the famous Keep Calm and Carry On poster, {{received}} hand-painted or custom lettering similar to Gill Sans. Fighter Command during the war used a standard set of letters similar to it. Matthew Carter, later a prominent font designer, recalled in 2005 that when his mother cut <b>linoleum</b> block letters for him to play with during the Blitz they were based on it.|$|E
40|$|Fatty oils which, on {{exposure}} to air, dry to insoluble, infusible films, {{have been used}} as protective and decorative coatings for over two thousand years. Today their manufacture for use in paints, varnishes, <b>linoleums,</b> printing inks, and allied materials constitutes a major industry. In the intervening years great advances have been made in their technology but the mechanism by which they are transformed from the liquid to the solid state is still very incompletely understood. This unsatisfactory condition is by no means {{due to a lack of}} research into the problem...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the use of two {{different}} scales in the measurement of odour intensity from 12 solid flooring materials. Material samples were introduced in Tedlar® bags and assessed by a panel trained in the use of these scales with butanol references. No large significant differences have been observed between repetitions and scales. <b>Linoleums</b> and carpets with tar backing bestowed high odour intensity ratings while carpets and vinyl flooring with foam backing yield the lowest scores. The continuous scale method has proved to be repeatable, less time-consuming than the discrete method. Furthermore, the references provided to the subject allowed both individual and session calibration as intensity ratings can be transformed in equivalent concentration levels...|$|R
50|$|Oustric {{moved from}} {{arbitrage}} to ownership of various risky enterprises which {{he turned around}} through debt consolidation and partial sale of shares.During the 1920s he helped salvage the textile maker Kahn, Lang & Manuel, the spinner Valentin Bloch, the paper maker Papeteries de Gascogne and other enterprises.He became involved in companies ranging from oil production to leather goods.In 1929 his holding company acquired Maréchal, a firm in Lyon that made reinforced fabrics.He then acquired Sarlino (Société rémoise de <b>linoléums)</b> in Reims, and Athos, a sewing machine company.Through a structure of holding companies the bank in 1929 controlled an empire of enterprises with optimistically priced shares.One of these was the Banque Adam, a long-established bank in the Pas-de-Calais.The operation was respectable, supported by other banks, and known for its success in salvaging troubled enterprises.|$|R
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{new housing}} estates were built north-west of the town. This was {{followed}} by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s, which destroyed much of the old high street. There was speculation that the town's population could increase to around 55–60,000 by 1970. This did not happen: a decline in the <b>linoleum</b> industry in the mid-1960s led to a decrease in population, from a peak of 53,750 in 1961 to 47,962 in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In the 21stcentury, Kirkcaldy {{remains an}} {{important}} centre for the surrounding areas, with a Museum and Art Gallery, three public parks and shopping facilities. The town also hosts the annual Links Market, {{commonly known as}} Europe's longest street fair. The production of <b>linoleum</b> continues, though on a greatly reduced scale, under Swiss ownership (Forbo Holding AG). Kirkcaldy Harbour, which closed in 1992, re-opened in October 2011 to cargo ships. A project between Carr's Flour Mills, the parent of Hutchison's, Forth Ports (owners of the harbour) and Transport Scotland, will allow Carr's to bring in wheat via the harbour and remove {{a quarter of its}} lorries from the roads every year.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1924, Law's {{will was}} filed with county {{surrogate}} George A. Slater in White Plains. His estate was approximately $5 million, {{the majority of}} which was divided equally between his children. They also each received 25 shares of the Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet company's stock and scrip and 250 shares of the Nairn <b>Linoleum</b> Company. Law's friends, servants, and employees received from $500 to $5,000. He also bequeathed $13,500 to his longtime nurse and secretary Ida Z. Thompson. Law's son Henry inherited the family's Briarcliff Manor house, and Law's daughter Georgia inherited the family's summer house, formerly the C.H. Burnham house, in Jefferson, New Hampshire.|$|E
40|$|Kauri Gum is the fossilised resin of the Kauri Tree (Agathis Australis). The tree {{which often}} attains great size is {{found only in}} the Auckland Province, and the fossil gum is found {{embedded}} {{beneath the surface of}} the soil in open country on the sites of ancient forests. The gum is located by probing with long spears, and is then dug out. It is largely used in the manufacture of high class varnishes and <b>linoleums.</b> There is a large range of colour - from dark, almost black gum, that has evidently been subject in times gone by to the action of forest fires, to clear white, invaluable for certain descriptions of Varnishes. The pieces collected vary from small "chips" to the size of large flint stones and very occasionally lumps up to 50 lbs are found. Most of the gum obtained to-day is of the chip variety and considerable labour is involved in separating it from its surrounding earth. The gum used in these experiments was cut from a block weighing about three pounds, consisting of the best quality gum. As far as could be ascertained only one previous attempt has been made to determine any of the physical constants of the gum and then not even approximate results were obtained. This research was designed primarily to measure: (1) Resistivity (2) Surface Resistance (3) Dielectric Constant These three are of importance in connection with the possible electrical separation of the chip gum from impurities. Several methods are in use on the gum fields for separating the gum from clay and soils, but none give very good results. Since this research was started an English company has patented an electrostatic method of separation and intends to use it on their gum fields in North Auckland. The Refractive index and Specific Heat of the gum were also measured...|$|R

40|$|This film {{shows the}} crowd {{gathered}} in San Francisco for {{the dedication of}} the Dewey Monument in Union Square, on Thursday, May 14, 1903, from 9 : 00 a. m. to 9 : 20 a. m. The Monument, which is still in place, commemorates the victory of Admiral George Dewey and the American fleet over Spanish forces at Manila Bay, the Philippines, on May 1, 1898, during the Spanish-American War. The monument is also a tribute to the sailors of the U. S. Navy. Ground was broken for the monument by President McKinley, Roosevelt's predecessor, on May 12, 1901. The dedication of the monument was President Roosevelt's last official act before leaving San Francisco. Union Square was - and is - the center of San Francisco's retail district, and is located two blocks north of Market Street. Originally a tall sand dune, the square was set aside as a public park in 1850. It got its name from the pro-Union rallies held there {{on the eve of the}} Civil War. The camera was located on the roof a building at the southeast corner of Stockton Street and Union Square Avenue (today's Maiden Lane). Looking north on Stockton, the camera pans left along Post Street, and across Union Square to Powell Street and the St. Francis Hotel to the west. The pan continues south to Geary Street and on to the Stockton Street intersection, then sweeps back north to Stockton Street before drifting back into the square. The following is a scene-by-scene description of the film: [Frame: 0102 (part 1) ] The opening view is north up Stockton Street toward the eastern slope of Nob Hill. The large building along Post Street is the Pacific Union Club, now located on Nob Hill. [0777 (part 1) ] In Union Square to the left of the flagpole is the foliage "Arch of Triumph" through which the arriving and departing President passed. Behind it across Post Street is the Savoy Hotel. [2020 (part 1) ] The Dewey Monument is at center and the official dais below it to the left. The crowd is gathered for the ceremony. In the background rises the Saint Francis Hotel, which opened in 1904. The spire at right rear is the steeple of the First Congregational Church at Post and Mason streets. A new church was built on the site after 1906. Note men hanging from the tall pole in the square, at right. [2367 (part 1) ] After a cut, the pan continues to the left. [2709 (part 1) ] The view is west, along Geary Street. Note the large Cordes Furniture Company Building (later Breuners Furniture) [3100 (part 1) ]. The wall advertisement reads "Furniture, Carpets, Draperies, Rugs, Mattings, <b>Linoleums</b> [...] Your Credit is Good. " [3676 (part 1) ] At the end of the southern pan, the distant, unfinished steel frame of the Flood Building on Market Street can be seen. To the right is the rear of Delmonico's Restaurant, which hides most of the Alcazar Theater. Note the ice van at the corner of Geary and Stockton streets. [Frame: 0100 (part 2) ] After a cut in the continuity of the film, the ceremony has concluded and the crowd is seen surging toward Post Street to watch the departure of the President [1881 (part 2) ]. The camera follows the crowd to Post and Stockton streets, then pans back into the square as crowds continue to gather along Post Street.

5|$|Plants {{grown as}} {{industrial}} crops {{are the source}} {{of a wide range of}} products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, <b>linoleum,</b> plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} <b>linoleum.</b> From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
5|$|Kirkcaldy War Memorial in War Memorial Gardens {{unveiled}} in 1923 was gifted {{to the town}} by John Nairn, <b>linoleum</b> manufacturer and grandson of Michael Nairn. This was dedicated to Ian Nairn, the son of John Nairn {{who died in the}} First World War. A Second World War memorial, designed by Thomas Hubbard, was later added and {{unveiled in}} 1958. The memorial commemorates the lives of 1,012 people from the First World War and 452 from the Second World War. Forming a centre piece to these gardens is Kirkcaldy Galleries, formerly known as Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery, which was also donated by Nairn. The Hunter Street drill hall was completed in around 1895.|$|E
5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at the rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with <b>linoleum</b> floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E

25|$|The {{town was}} a major {{producer}} of <b>linoleum</b> after {{the formation of the}} <b>Linoleum</b> Manufacturing Company in 1864 by its inventor, Frederick Walton. <b>Linoleum</b> became the main industry of the town and {{was a major}} employer in the area until the 1960s. In 1876 about 220 and in 1911 about 350 people worked in the plant. By 1957 it employed some 300 people and in 1956 the factory produced about 2675 m2 of <b>linoleum</b> each week. The term 'Staines Lino' became a worldwide name but the factory was closed around 1970 and is the site is now occupied by the Two Rivers shopping centre, completed about 2000. A bronze statue of two lino workers in Staines High Street commemorates the Staines Lino Factory. The Spelthorne Museum has a display dedicated to the <b>Linoleum</b> Manufacturing Company.|$|E

The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity.|$|E
25|$|An early {{scientific}} study of mercury poisoning was in 1923–6 by the German inorganic chemist, Alfred Stock, who himself became poisoned, together with his colleagues, by breathing mercury vapor that was being released by his laboratory equipment—diffusion pumps, float valves, and manometers—all of which contained mercury, and also from mercury that had been accidentally spilt and remained in cracks in the <b>linoleum</b> floor covering. He published {{a number of papers}} on mercury poisoning, founded a committee in Berlin to study cases of possible mercury poisoning, and introduced the term micromercurialism.|$|E
