25|$|An illegal {{organization}} in Russia, the People's Rights Party established an underground printing press in Smolensk, {{by means of}} which it produced its publications. Owing to <b>limited</b> <b>circulation</b> {{only two of the}} party's publications have survived — the party's program and a single pamphlet, Nasushchnyi Vopros (The Urgent Question).|$|E
25|$|In October 2005, Deng {{published}} an autobiographical work entitled Twelve Years (1975-1987) in <b>limited</b> <b>circulation</b> in Hong Kong, which recounted {{his role in}} the major political events during that period. In reviewing the book, dissident journalist Gao Yu accused him of glorifying himself at the expense of Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. Despite their erstwhile political rivalry, Deng sent wreaths to mourn the death of both Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang.|$|E
25|$|In 1913 {{the first}} {{national}} banknotes were introduced in denominations of 10s, £1, £5, and £10. 1914 saw the introduction of £20, £50, £100, and £1000 notes. The £1000 note only saw <b>limited</b> <b>circulation</b> and was later confined to inter-bank use. Stocks were destroyed in 1969 {{and there are no}} uncancelled examples of this note known to exist in private hands, though a single cancelled example sold in a 2007 auction for AU$1,200,000.|$|E

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to know who the media owners really are, but often they are politicians or well-known businesspeople (often affiliated with political groups), that then influences media editorial policy. According to most experts media are not considered as business per se. Concentration <b>limits</b> <b>circulation</b> of information and ideas.|$|R
5000|$|Deep sand beds {{may be made}} of {{a variety}} of materials, but {{typically}} fine or [...] "superfine" [...] sand is used, with a grain size between 1 mm and 0.05 mm. A larger particle size increases circulation, which in turn requires greater depth to establish anaerobic areas. Larger particles can also inhibit the burrowing of small animals, which would <b>limit</b> <b>circulation</b> into the bed. Additionally, larger particles (2 mm or larger) are prone to detritus accumulation, which necessitates periodic siphon cleaning.|$|R
25|$|Some coins were {{produced}} in very large numbers – during the Western Han, {{an average of}} 220 million coins a year {{were produced}}. Other coins were of <b>limited</b> <b>circulation</b> and are today extremely rare – only six examples of Da Quan Wu Qian from the Eastern Wu Dynasty (222–280) are known to exist. Occasionally, large hoards of coins have been uncovered. For example, a hoard was discovered in Jiangsu containing 4,000 Tai Qing Feng Le coins and at Zhangpu in Shaanxi, a sealed jar containing 1,000 Ban Liang coins of various weights and sizes, was discovered.|$|E
25|$|Lo Stato Operaio (The Workers' State) (March 1940 – December 1943) — This was {{actually}} another {{publication of the}} Communist Party of Italy, published in exile in New York City after its suppression {{by the government of}} France {{at the start of the}} war. The publication maintained a <b>limited</b> <b>circulation</b> in the United States, with a very few copies being sent back for underground distribution in Italy. The paper was too far away from the center of activities of the PCI to have any real political significance and was discontinued by the party at the end of 1943.|$|E
500|$|Due to the <b>limited</b> <b>circulation</b> of the {{cumbersome}} [...] Eisenhower dollar, it {{was decided}} in the 1970s that a smaller dollar coin might prove more useful to the public. On September 26, 1978, Congress approved legislation to provide for a smaller dollar coin to be minted, which would depict Susan B. Anthony, a prominent American suffragette. These new dollars also proved unpopular, {{due in large part}} to their similarity in size and metallic composition to the quarter-dollar. Since there was little interest in the coin as a circulating medium, most were placed in United States Mint and Federal Reserve vaults throughout the country, and mintage ceased after 1981.|$|E
5000|$|American war {{correspondent}} Scott Anderson wrote a {{story about}} his interviews with Trepashkin for the September 2009 issue of the GQ magazine. However, according to NPR's David Folkenflik, Conde Nast management gave orders to <b>limit</b> <b>circulation</b> of the story. These included banning the story off of GQ's website, not showing the US issue to [...] "Russian government officials, journalists or advertisers", not publishing the story in any overseas Conde Nast magazines, not publicizing the story, and asking Anderson to not syndicate it 'to any publications that appear in Russia'.|$|R

50|$|Beyond Investigation Magazine (BIM) is an American {{magazine}} that features Beyond Investigation, {{a group that}} investigates paranormal and conspiracy theory claims. Beyond Investigation was founded by Patrick Wheelock in 2004 to investigate claims of paranormal activity and to publish those investigations and associated research in a printed periodical. Due to the expenses associated with publishing a <b>limit</b> <b>circulation</b> periodical, BIM has changed distribution formats to web and DVD, and only the first issue was distributed in print. In 2005, BIM began webcasting audio programming, most notably a weekly talk show called The Pat & Brian Show.|$|R
500|$|Those who {{roll their}} own tobacco {{prefer to use}} sheets of Rodong Sinmun—the organ of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea—as rolling paper. One piece of the paper {{can be used to}} roll some 40 to 50 {{cigarettes}}. According to one defector, when a North Korean [...] "starts to smoke the Rodong Sinmun tobacco, he cannot smoke other kinds of tobacco. I used to smoke the Rodong Sinmun tobacco, and after defection, couldn't smoke with Chinese paper tobacco due to the poor taste." [...] Because the Rodong Sinmun is in <b>limited</b> <b>circulation,</b> most North Koreans roll their cigarettes with some other paper.|$|E
500|$|Davis gave {{speeches to}} {{soldiers}} and politicians but largely ignored the common people, {{who came to}} resent the favoritism shown to the rich and powerful; Davis thus failed to harness Confederate nationalism. One historian speaks of [...] "the heavy-handed intervention of the Confederate government." [...] Economic intervention, regulation, and state control of manpower, production and transport were much greater in the Confederacy than in the Union. Davis did not use his presidential pulpit to rally the people with stirring rhetoric; he called instead {{for people to be}} fatalistic and to die for their new country. Apart from two month-long trips across the country where he met a few hundred people, Davis stayed in Richmond where few people saw him; newspapers had <b>limited</b> <b>circulation,</b> and most Confederates had little favorable information about him.|$|E
500|$|With George W. Forbes, another Protective Association member, in 1901 Trotter co-founded the Guardian, {{a weekly}} newspaper. [...] At first Forbes, an Amherst College {{graduate}} with some experience in publishing, was the driving operational force in its production, while Trotter funded {{the effort and}} served as its managing editor. [...] The paper became a forum for a more outspoken and forceful approach to gaining racial equality, and its contributors and editorials (which were generally written by Trotter) regularly attacked Washington. [...] The paper's editorial stance brought a stream of criticism from more mainstream African-American publications: the New York Age, calling it [...] "putrescent", wrote that [...] "Editor Trotter... makes himself smelt if not felt"; another wrote that the Guardian was [...] "carrying its cases too fast and too far", and that Trotter suffered from a [...] "mental malady". The Guardian had <b>limited</b> <b>circulation,</b> but was highly influential as one of only 200 African-American publications in the country. [...] It suffered financially due to Trotter's poor accounting and inattention due to his heavy schedule. Forbes, who principally worked as a librarian in the city library, left the business in 1904 because of Booker T. Washington's legal assaults on the newspaper and pressure by Washington supporters on his employers. [...] Trotter's wife, and later his sister, assisted in the paper's publication.|$|E

2500|$|Life was an American {{magazine}} that ran weekly from 1883 to 1936 as a humor magazine with <b>limited</b> <b>circulation.</b> Time owner [...] Henry Luce bought {{the magazine in}} 1936, solely {{so that he could}} acquire the rights to its name, and launched a major weekly news magazine with a strong emphasis on photojournalism. Life was published weekly until 1972, as an intermittent [...] "special" [...] until 1978, and as a monthly from 1978 to 2000.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} and entertaining conspectus {{and evaluation of}} 19th-century (pre-1885) and earlier underground erotica, from the author's own private archive, is provided by Victorian writer Henry Spencer Ashbee, using the pseudonym [...] "Pisanus Fraxi", in his bibliographical trilogy Index Librorum Prohibitorum (1877), Centuria Librorum Absconditorum (1879) and Catena Librorum Tacendorum (1885). His plot summaries of the works he discusses in these privately printed volumes are themselves {{a contribution to the}} genre. Originally of very <b>limited</b> <b>circulation,</b> changing attitudes have led to his work now being widely available.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{dissertation}} discussed marine generator synchronous technology, as well as, intelligent on-shore controlling {{circulation current}} {{by means of}} using reactor to <b>limit</b> <b>circulation</b> current, both of which may realize seamless connection between ship electrical system and shore power; and also demonstrated intelligent FCL all-controlling power electronic device GTO (Gate Turn-off Thyristor) blocking and conducting, that can ensure the rapidity of connecting and disconnecting reactor and notable current limit effect. The dissertation proves the effect of seamless power supply between the port and ship, {{as a result of}} simulation model of intelligent FCL on-shore controlling circulation current. And intelligently dealing with electricity bills processing, as well as seamless power supply, which realize marine energy conservation and low-carbon emissions reduction in the port, can ensure to realize uninterruptable power on-shore connection, {{and at the same time}} promote the development of intelligent port...|$|R

2500|$|The high {{expectations}} {{raised by the}} demo put enormous pressure on the band to deliver, especially because the demo was in <b>limited</b> <b>circulation.</b> The demand grew, but the band took their time to release their debut album. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy had declined various offers from foreign labels, waiting for a Danish label to come forward. They [...] "quite literally felt on home soil" [...] when they were contacted by Nick Foss, head of A at EMI-Medley, and known by the band as the producer of several albums by D-A-D and The Sandmen. He signed them to the label {{and went into the}} studio with them for three months.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scaphoid}} can be slow to heal {{because of}} the <b>limited</b> <b>circulation</b> to the bone. Fractures of the scaphoid must be recognized and treated quickly, as prompt treatment by immobilization or surgical fixation {{increases the likelihood of}} the bone healing in anatomic alignment, thus avoiding mal-union or non-union. Delays may compromise healing. Failure of the fracture to heal ("non-union") will lead to post-traumatic [...] osteoarthritis of the carpus. One reason for this is {{because of the}} [...] "tenuous" [...] blood supply to the proximal segment. Even rapidly immobilized fractures may require surgical treatment, including use of a headless compression screw such as the Herbert screw to bind the two halves together.|$|E
2500|$|Stiffelio had {{provoked}} the censorship board because of “the immoral and rough” storylines of a Protestant minister deceived {{by his wife}} and also because making the characters German did not please an Italian audience, although, as Budden notes, the opera [...] "enjoyed a <b>limited</b> <b>circulation</b> (in Italy), but with the title changed to Guglielmo Wellingrode, the main protagonist now a German minister of state". Verdi had rejected an 1852 request to write a new last act for the Wellingrode version, but, by Spring 1856, in collaboration with his original librettist, Piave, he decided to rewrite the story line and make {{a small amount of}} musical changes and additions. However, as it turned out, the work was to be more complex than that.|$|E
50|$|The {{influenza}} vaccination strategy is generally that of protecting vulnerable people, rather than <b>limiting</b> influenza <b>circulation</b> or totally eliminating human influenza sickness.
