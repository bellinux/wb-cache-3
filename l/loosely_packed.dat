5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
30|$|Due to the organic–inorganic hybrid {{structure}} of POSS-PANI, the dense packing structures of rigid PANI arms are prohibited, instead of <b>loosely</b> <b>packing</b> structures. These structures can convert into stable mesoporous structures by hydrothermal treatments. As we know, {{the size of}} octafunctional POSS cage in this experiment is about 1.2  ~  1.4  nm, which have functional groups in each octant in Cartesian space, either opposite or completely orthogonal to each other. PANI chains that linked {{in the corner of}} POSS cages can be regarded as flexible connections among POSS cages. The final morphologies of the POSS-PANI mesostructure after hydrothermal treatments will be affected by many factors, such as conformational energy of flexible PANI chains, van der Waals forces and the interactions between POSS cages, and electrostatic interaction. In POSS-PANI composites, POSS can be regarded as a head-group area, which plays a governing role in works as in building the mesoporous framework and selecting the mesophases. The favored mesoporous structures can permit the area of POSS cage to be closest to the most optimal value, while maintaining favorable packing mode of the hydrophobic PANI chains. In this case, the total energy of the composite tends to minima and the system is most stable.|$|R

25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally.

6000|$|I did not {{at first}} find it at all an easy matter to make test weights so alike as to differ in no other appreciable respect than in their {{specific}} gravity, and if they differ and become known apart, the knowledge so acquired will vitiate future judgments in various indirect ways. Similarity in outward shape and touch was ensured {{by the use of}} mechanically-made cartridge cases; dissimilarity through any external stain was rendered of no hindrance to the experiment by making the operatee handle them in a bag or with his eyes shut. Two bodies may, however, be alike in weight and outward appearance and yet behave differently when otherwise mechanically tested, and, consequently, when they are handled. For example, take two eggs, one raw and the other hard boiled, and spin them on the table; press the finger for a moment upon either of them whilst it is still spinning: if it be the hard-boiled egg it will stop as dead as a stone: if it be the raw egg, after a little apparent hesitation, it will begin again to rotate. The motion of its shell had alone been stopped; the internal part was still rotating and this compelled the shell to follow it. Owing to this cause, when we handle the two eggs, the one feels [...] "quick" [...] and the other does not. Similarly with the cartridges, when one is rather more <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> than the others the difference is perceived on handling them. Or it may have one end heavier than the other, or else its weight may not be equally distributed round its axis, causing it to rest on the table with the same part always lowermost; differences due to these causes are also easily perceived when handling the cartridges. Again, one of two similar cartridges may balance perfectly in all directions, but the weight of one of them may be disposed too much towards the ends, as in a dumb-bell, or gathered too much towards the centre. The period of oscillation will differ widely in the two cases, as may be shown by suspending the cartridges by strings round their middle so that they shall hang horizontally, and then by a slight tap making them spin to and fro round the string as an axis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the applicability of a genetic approach for solving the construction site layout problem. This problem involves coordinating the use of limited site space to accommodate temporary facilities so that transportation cost of materials is minimized. The layout problem considered in this paper is characterized by affinity weights used to model transportation costs between facilities and by geometric constraints that limit their relative positions on site. The proposed genetic algorithm generates an initial population of layouts through a sequence of mutation operations and evolves the layouts of this population through a sequence of genetic operations aiming at finding an optimal layout. The paper concludes with examples illustrating the strength and limitations of the proposed algorithm in the cases of � 1 � loosely versus tightly constrained layouts with equal levels of interaction between facilities; � 2 � <b>loosely</b> versus tightly <b>packed</b> layouts with variable levels of interactions between facilities; and � 3 � loosely versus tightly constrained layouts.

STUDY DESIGN: Intraoperative measurement of objective hearing thresholds using auditory steady state responses (ASSRs). SETTING: Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Four individuals with mixed hearing loss and, at least no incus, in need for a middle ear implant. INTERVENTION: Surgical placement of the Vibrant Soundbridge. ASSR thresholds were measured intraoperatively, whereas FMT coupling to the cochlea was manipulated {{to find the most}} effective coupling of the FMT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in ASSR thresholds between different FMT coupling options within patients. RESULTS: With ASSR, we assessed placement of the FMT in the round window niche, <b>loosely</b> or tightly <b>packed</b> in the niche; creation of a mobile window in case of a fixed stapes footplate; and FMT position coupled to the stapes that afforded vibration in the natural vibration direction or perpendicular to it.

Dissolved iron concentrations were much higher in fresh surface waters and groundwater {{compared to the}} estuarine water. In bottom sediments, iron minerals were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD); of these, hematite (up to 11 %) has formed by precipitation from iron-rich water in the freshwater section of the catchment. Pyrite was only identified in the estuarine reach and demonstrated several morphologies [identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ] including <b>loosely</b> and closely <b>packed</b> framboids, and the euhedral form.

The persistence of framboids in suspended sediments, where oxygen levels are relatively high, could be due to their silica and clay-rich coatings, which prevent a rapid oxidation of the pyrite.

40|$|Abstract The zona pellucida (ZP) and cumulus-corona cells (CC cells) {{surrounding}} human oocytes, polypronuclear ova and embroys {{derived from}} IVF eggs were studied by SEM/TEM {{to evaluate whether}} their possible alteration may influence oocyte fertilizability and early embryonic development. The outer surface of the ZP surrounding preovulatory oocytes showed a spongy structure, with numerous penetrations. In immature and atretic oocytes, the external aspect of the ZP had a compact, smooth architecture. Numerous penetrating sperm were present on the spongy ZP, whereas only a few, flattened spermatozoa were attached to the compact, smooth-surfaced zona. Condensation of the outer aspect of the ZP may cause disruption and/or reduction of its sperm-binding sites, thereby impeding sperm attachment. This, in turn, may reduce oocyte fertilizability. The CC cells were <b>packed</b> <b>loosely</b> and projected many microvilli and blebs into the wide intercellular spaces. Most CC cells possessed large cytoplasma containing mitochondria with tubular cristae; well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes, and lipid droplets. This arrangement typical of steroidogenic cells, is {{comparable to that of}} parietal granulosa cells, just prior to and following ovulation, and subsequent luteinization. The presence of numerous enlarged, luteinized CC cells about oocytes, polypronuclear ova and embroys did not seem to exert a negative effect on fertilization.
