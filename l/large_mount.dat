2500|$|The Army {{tested a}} great variety of {{experimental}} weapons on the UH-1; nearly anything that could be carried. The Army desired weapons with large calibers and high rates of fire, which led to the testing of a 20mm cannon on a <b>large</b> <b>mount</b> bolted to the cabin floor. The size of the weapon allowed very little room for movement. The Army further tested a full-size Vulcan cannon firing out the door of a UH-1. It was capable of firing 2400 rounds per minute, or about 40 rounds per second. Despite this being a significant reduction from the nearly 100 rounds per second fired by a standard Vulcan cannon, the installation proved [...] "too kinetic" [...] for the UH-1. Podded versions of the M24 20mm cannon were tested in combat over Vietnam. There was a wide variety of 7.62mm automatic weapons tested, including different installations of the M60 machine gun. AS-10 and SS-11 missiles were tested in several different configurations. High-capacity rocket launchers were also tested, such as the XM3 launcher, which had 24 launching tubes. Press photos were taken with the XM5 and XM3 installed on the same aircraft, but this arrangement could not be used because it was more than the gross take-off weight of the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The town of Stowe {{was settled}} in the early 19th century, with the first {{building}} {{in what is now}} village center a tavern built in 1811. This area was better suited for both industry and the growth of a village than older settlements to the north and south, and it was recognized in the 1840s as the town center by the placement of the post office. The tourist trade arose early in the town, with visitors drawn to the mountain scenery, promoted by W.H.H. Bingham, builder of the <b>large</b> <b>Mount</b> Mansfield Hotel in 1864 (burned down in 1889), the Summit Hotel on Mount Mansfield, and roads to Mount Mansfield and Smugglers Notch. The result of this growth in the 19th century is a streetscape diverse in 19th-century architecture.|$|E
50|$|With {{both types}} of mount, springs are {{needed to keep the}} frame pressed against the ball bearings, unless the mount is {{designed}} to be used only in an orientation where gravity will keep the frame in place. Following the cantilever principle, a <b>large</b> <b>mount</b> allows finer control than a smaller one. The frames are ideally made of a light material, to make the resonant frequency of the structure high. This reduces vibration, since many common sources of vibration are relatively low frequency. For stability, the fixed frame is supported by a rigid mount that is securely bolted to a supporting surface. In a laboratory environment, this is typically an optical table. A shock can cause the mount {{to move away from the}} ball bearings, but because there are only 6, hard contacts, the mirror will return to the original position, preserving the alignment.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, {{even after}} {{detailed}} investigations, no trigger {{can be determined}} - {{this was the case}} in the <b>large</b> <b>Mount</b> Cook landslide in New Zealand 1991. It is unclear as to whether the lack of a trigger in such cases is the result of some unknown process acting within the landslide, or whether there was in fact a trigger, but it cannot be determined. Perhaps this is because the trigger was in fact a slow but steady decrease in material strength associated with the weathering of the rock - at some point the material becomes so weak that failure must occur. Hence the trigger is the weathering process, but this is not detectable externally.In most cases we think of a trigger as an external stimulus that induces an immediate or near-immediate response in the slope, in this case in the form of the movement of the landslide. Generally this movement is induced either because the stresses in the slope are altered, perhaps by increasing shear stress or decreasing the effective normal stress, or by reducing the resistance to the movement perhaps by decreasing the shear strength of the materials within the landslide.|$|E

50|$|Early 18th century walled garden {{enclosures}} {{surround the}} House, and the rectangular plot {{is divided into}} two unequal halves by the service drive and the House. The main garden lies below the south facade of the House and is of about the same width as the building. It runs down to the principal entrance on Longcause. West of it, and parallel to it, lies the kitchen garden, between the north end of which and the south elevation of the stables is the Mount Garden. To the north of the House is a court, set into rising ground, which is laid down to grass. Parallel to the west facade of the House, and separated from it by a brick wall, is a narrow walk which extends the length of the kitchen garden, from which it is screened by a second high brick wall (listed grade II). At the north end of this walk a gate leads into the north-east corner of the Mount Garden which lies to the south-west of the House and {{to the north of the}} kitchen garden.
