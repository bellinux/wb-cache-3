5|$|This Is What the Truth Feels <b>Like</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} studio album {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani. It {{was released on}} March 18, 2016 by Interscope Records. Initially, the album {{was scheduled to be}} released in December 2014 with Stefani working with a handful of high-profile producers, and Benny Blanco serving as executive producer. However, after the underperformance of her 2014 singles and the writer's block Stefani suffered, she did not feel comfortable curating an album and scrapped the whole record in favor of starting again. The album's release was scheduled after Stefani hinted at it on her Twitter account.|$|E
5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound <b>like?</b> <b>Is</b> it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to assess the effect of {{information}} about organic production on “Pecorino” cheese liking. Mean scores of perceived <b>liking</b> <b>were</b> similar for organic cheese (OC) and conventional cheese (CC). Expected <b>liking</b> scores <b>were</b> higher for OC than for CC (P< 0. 001). For OC the expected <b>liking</b> <b>was</b> significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than the perceived liking expressed in blind conditions (negative disconfirmation), whereas for CC the expected <b>liking</b> <b>was</b> significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than the perceived liking expressed in blind conditions (positive disconfirmation). Consumers assimilated their liking for OC {{in the direction of}} expectations, as the difference actual vs. perceived <b>liking</b> <b>was</b> significant (P< 0. 001). However, the assimilation was not complete, as the difference actual liking vs. expected <b>liking</b> <b>was</b> also significant (P< 0. 001). Consumers showed a willingness to pay OC higher than the actual commercial value of organic cheese. We conclude that the information about organic farming can be a major determinant of cheese liking, thus providing a potential tool for product differentiation, particularly for small scale and traditional farms...|$|R

Their inclusion in this source and its <b>like</b> <b>is</b> thought {{to be due to}} their importance to the foundation traditions of Dunkeld and St Andrews.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} {{outlined above}} under polarity, that like dissolves <b>like,</b> <b>is</b> the usual guide to solubility with organic systems. For example, petroleum jelly will dissolve in gasoline because both petroleum jelly and gasoline are non-polar hydrocarbons. It will not, {{on the other}} hand, dissolve in ethyl alcohol or water, since the polarity of these solvents is too high. Sugar will not dissolve in gasoline, since sugar is too polar in comparison with gasoline. A mixture of gasoline and sugar can therefore be separated by filtration, or extraction with water.|$|E
25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the <b>like,</b> <b>is</b> the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels <b>like</b> <b>is</b> simply {{a failure of}} language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E

500|$|Starr's first musical hero was Gene Autry, {{about whom}} he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} getting shivers up my {{back when he}} sang, 'South of the Border'".

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

500|$|By 1967, Lennon's {{aggressive}} edges {{from his}} childhood had disappeared, and he spent considerable amounts of time sitting in his sunroom or garden and daydreaming for hours at end. He became somewhat uncommunicative towards most people, including Cynthia (but not with the other Beatles, who had an almost unspoken ability to understand one another). [...] Cynthia once complained, saying: [...] "What I'd <b>like</b> <b>is</b> a holiday of our own ... John, Julian and me". Lennon replied with, [...] "OK, I know, we'll all retire to a little cottage on a cliff in Cornwall, all right?" [...] Then adding, [...] "No, I've got these bloody songs to write. I have to work, to justify living." [...] She understood his temperament, but felt frustrated at never having developed her own career by using her art college background.|$|E
500|$|Hiscock felt a gay penguin {{marriage}} {{was a good}} way to connect Leslie's character and profession to the issue, since a zoo would be part of the parks department. He said, [...] "It seemed like a funny starting place: a cute zoo promotion that spins out of control." [...] Although the storyline is comedic through its use of penguins in the same-sex marriage, commentators inferred the episode nevertheless takes a position in favor of same-sex marriage. Hiscock said in writing the script, he did not intend to make a strong political or social message, and that the staff was more focused on comedy and developing the Leslie Knope character. However, Hiscock said, [...] "What I <b>like</b> <b>is</b> that Leslie doesn't back down from her zoo promotion idea and refuses to annul the wedding. In a weird way she takes a stance." ...|$|E

500|$|Inspired {{by the end}} of her marriage, and {{the various}} {{emotions}} she experienced during that time, as well as a new romantic relationship, Stefani returned to writing new songs. With the help of producers J.R. Rotem, Mattman & Robin and Greg Kurstin, as well as songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, Stefani wrote the album in a few months and described it as a [...] "breakup record", with the songs having a [...] "sarcastic" [...] and dark-humor vibe, as well as being real, joyful, and happy. The album's themes revolve around betrayal and disappointment, as well as moving on from a broken relationship and falling in love again. Musically This Is What the Truth Feels <b>Like</b> <b>is</b> a pop album that is similar to the music on Stefani's previous studio albums. The record includes a guest appearance by rapper Fetty Wap.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror, Oberman revealed that she was attracted to the mesh of sexuality and humour in the personality of Chrissie, declaring, [...] "What I really <b>like</b> <b>is</b> she's got the sex and dry sarcasm". Speaking to the official EastEnders website, she expanded on the importance of Chrissie's sense of humour and wit to her [...] "feisty" [...] characterisation: [...] "What I love about Chrissie is that she's a good strong, funny female character... she's got a really good sense of humour which is necessary to deal with Den. She's very good at wisecracks. Den has the one-liners, but Chrissie bats them right back." [...] Chrissie's barbed and biting remarks became a prominent feature of the character; even when cornered by Den's adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) after attempting to flee the country, she remarks: [...] "You really are your father's daughter, Sharon. No shaking you off either." ...|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Whorf {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the allophone, a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition. Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single phoneme in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even {{to the point that they}} are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: [...] " [...] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [...] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. You always have to keep the observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes <b>like</b> <b>is</b> like, and what it makes unlike is unlike".(Whorf, 1940) ...|$|E

500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other <b>like,</b> <b>Is</b> the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right.

500|$|Since its release, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] has {{received}} critical acclaim from contemporary music critics. Madison Vain of Entertainment Weekly felt the song's [...] "hyper-personal lyrics" [...] were [...] "immediate and affecting". Immediately following its release, Maeve McDermott from USA Today awarded the track [...] "Song of the Week" [...] in October, further adding that [...] "he song's spiritual sibling {{is another of}} Stefani's best works: 1996's No Doubt classic 'Don't Speak'," [...] but noting that [...] "this time around, coming from a more mature artist with fewer things to prove, the pain feels dizzyingly fresh." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator praised {{the fact that the}} singer was [...] "stepping away from the pumped-up vibes of previous tracks like 'Spark The Fire' & 'Baby Don’t Lie', also noting that [...] "eartache is immediately relatable (just ask Adele) and Gwen is often praised for her underrated slow songs , so it is refreshing to witness her jumpstart this current album era with a new vibe." [...] Alex Kritselis of Bustle called it [...] "a fantastic 'comeback single' — a tremendous improvement over 'Baby Don't Lie'," [...] praising that [...] "when she repeatedly sings, 'I don't know why I used to love you,' during the climax, you feel it." [...] Music Times Carolyn Menyes agreed, noting that [...] "we haven't heard a breakup anthem from this girl since her Tragic Kingdom days. After a series of less-than-stellar singles, it's safe to say Stefani is back." [...] In a later review of the parent album, Menyes stated she was [...] "impressed with the vulnerability [...] displayed", comparing it to Stefani's previous singles [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Ex-Girlfriend". Menyes concluded by saying the potential on This Is What the Truth Feels <b>Like</b> <b>is</b> evident on tracks like [...] "Used to Love You".|$|E
