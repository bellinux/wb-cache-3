40|$|In {{contrast}} to atmospheric surface-layer (ASL) turbulence, a linear relationship between turbulent heat fluxes (F(T)) and vertical gradients of mean air temperature within canopies is frustrated by numerous factors, including local variation in heat {{sources and sinks}} and large-scale eddy motion whose signature is often linked with the ejection-sweep cycle. Furthermore, how atmospheric stability modifies such a relationship remains poorly understood, especially in stable canopy flows. To date, no explicit model exists for relating F(T) to the mean air temperature gradient, buoyancy, and the statistical properties of the ejection-sweep cycle within the canopy volume. Using third-order cumulant expansion methods (CEM) and the heat flux budget equation, a "diagnostic" analytical relationship that <b>links</b> <b>ejections</b> and sweeps and the sensible heat flux {{for a wide range}} of atmospheric stability classes is derived. Closure model assumptions that relate scalar dissipation rates with sensible heat flux, and the validity of CEM in <b>linking</b> <b>ejections</b> and sweeps with the triple scalar-velocity correlations, were tested for a mixed hardwood forest in Lavarone, Italy. We showed that when the heat sources (S(T)) and F(T) have the same sign (i. e. the canopy is heating and sensible heat flux is positive), sweeps dominate the sensible heat flux. Conversely, if S(T) and F(T) are opposite in sign, standard gradient-diffusion closure model predict that ejections must dominate the sensible heat flux...|$|R

It is shown that {{a small amount of}} material (0. 01 to 0. 05 projectile mass) may be ejected at high velocity without suffering petrologically detectable shock pressures. The largest fragments ejected at any velocity are spalls that originate from the target planet's surface. The spall size is proportional to the radius of the primary impactor and the target tensile strength and inversely proportional to ejection velocity. The shock level in the spalls is low, typically half of the dynamic crushing strength of the rock. The model also predicts the aspect ratio of the spalled fragments, the angle of ejection, and the sizes and shock level of other fragments originating deeper in the target. Comparison with observational and experimental data shows generally good agreement...|$|R

We found that Hcrt cells have broad action potentials with elongated later positive deflections that distinguish them from adjacent antidromically identified cells. They are relatively inactive in quiet waking but are transiently activated during sensory stimulation. Hcrt cells are silent in slow wave sleep and tonic periods of REM sleep, with occasional burst discharge in phasic REM. Hcrt cells discharge in active waking and have moderate and approximately equal levels of activity during grooming and eating and maximal activity during exploratory behavior.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPolar {{ejection}} {{forces have}} often been hypothesized to guide directional instability of mitotic chromosomes, but a direct link has never been established. This has led, in part, to the resurgence of alternative theories. By taking advantage of extremely precise femtosecond pulsed laser microsurgery, we abruptly alter the magnitude of polar ejection forces by severing vertebrate chromosome arms. ResultsReduction of polar ejection forces increases the amplitude of directional instability without altering other characteristics, thus establishing a direct <b>link</b> between polar <b>ejection</b> forces and the direction of chromosome movements. We find that polar ejection forces limit the range of chromosome oscillations by increasing the probability that motors at a leading kinetochore abruptly disengage or turn off, leading to a direction reversal. ConclusionsFrom {{the relation between the}} change in oscillation amplitude and the amount a chromosome arm is shortened, we are able to map the distribution of polar ejection forces across the spindle, which is surprisingly different from previously assumed distributions. These results allow us to differentiate between the mechanisms proposed to underlie the directional instability of chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|This conference brings {{together}} scientists {{interested in a}} range of basic phenomena <b>linked</b> to the <b>ejection</b> and scattering of electrons from atoms, molecules, clusters, liquids and solids by absorption of light. Photoionization, a highly sensitive probe of both structure and dynamics, can range from perturbative single-photon processes to strong-field highly non-perturbative interactions. It is responsible for the formation and destruction of molecules in astrophysical and plasma environments and successfully used in advanced analytical techniques. Positive ions, which can be produced and studied most effectively using photoionization, are the major components of all plasmas, vital constituents of flames and important intermediates in many chemical reactions. Negative ions are significant as transient species and, when photodetached, the corresponding neutral species often undergoes remarkable, otherwise non-observable, dynamics. The scope of the meeting spans from novel observations in atomic and molecular physics, such as Coulomb Crystals, highly excited states and cold Rydberg plasmas, to novel energy resolved or ultrafast time-resolved experiments, photoionization in strong laser fields, theoretical method development for electron scattering, photoionization and photodetachment and more complex phenomena such as charge transfer and DNA and protein conductivity, important for biological and analytical applications...|$|R

40|$|We present refined color-color {{selection}} criteria for identifying Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars using available mid infrared (MIR) photometry from WISE {{in combination with}} near infrared (NIR) photometry from 2 MASS. Using a sample of spectrally classified objects, we find that WR stars are well distinguished from the field stellar population in the (W 1 -W 2) vs. (J-Ks) color-color diagram, and further dis-tinguished from other emission line objects such as Planetary Nebulae, Be, and Cataclysmic variable stars {{using a combination of}} NIR and MIR color constraints. As proof of concept we applied the color constraints to a photometric sample in the Galactic plane, located WR star candidates, and present five new spectrally confirmed and classified WC (1) and WN (4) stars. Analysis of the 0. 8 - 5. 0 µm spectral data for a subset of known, bright WC and WN stars shows that emission lines (primarily He I) extend into the 3. 0 - 5. 0 µm spectral region, although their strength is greatly diminished compared to the 0. 8 - 2. 5 µm region. The WR population stands out relative to background field stars at NIR and MIR colors due to an excess continuum contribution, likely caused by free-free scattering in dense winds. Mean photometric properties of known WRs are presented and imply that reddened late-type WN and WC sources are easier to detect than earlier-type sources at larger Galactic radii.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Predominant {{models for}} {{predicting}} rates of sediment transport face acute shortcomings {{when applied to}} coastal boundary layers. This {{is due to a}} neglect of the web of stochastic variables governing the rate of sediment dislodgement. While stochastic models do exist, the parametric extent of their validity tends to be limited, and none have taken into account an understanding of phase dependence in application to oscillatory flow, likely because the existing knowledge of the evolution of flow properties throughout a cycle of wave motion is insubstantial. A detailed understanding of the statistical properties of sediment forces and motion is a precondition to the development of specific models for oscillatory flows. Experiments on such flows tend to be limited by the small length and time scales of the particles. Numerical simulations offer flexibility in measuring many properties simultaneously in hard-to-reach places without disturbing the delicate dynamics of particle ejection. Fully resolved simulations of purely oscillatory flow over an idealized sediment geometry were performed at moderate parameter ranges near the transition to turbulence. Due to the computational challenges posed by this flow type, a new structured, fully parallelized, incompressible-flow, finite-volume solver along with effective and generalized immersed-boundary tools was developed and validated against benchmark simulations. Turbulence statistics and their correlation with the statistics of forces on the sediment bed are analyzed. Large divergences from Gaussian behavior are found in the bed velocity during accelerating phases of the cycle, and the probability distribution functions of fluctuations in the bed-flow velocity, u²[subscript b], and lift appear to follow this trend. The results suggest that coherent structures thought to be <b>linked</b> to sediment <b>ejection</b> in laminar flow regimes have a diminished effect on particle forces in transitional and early turbulent regimes. The implications of these findings on model development will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed statistical {{determination of the}} equatorial rotation rates of classical Be stars. The rapid rotation of Be stars {{is likely to be}} <b>linked</b> to the <b>ejection</b> of gas that forms dense circumstellar disks. The physical origins of these disks are not understood, though it is generally believed that the ability to spin up matter into a Keplerian disk depends on how close the stellar rotation speed is to the critical speed at which the centrifugal force cancels gravity. There has been recent disagreement between the traditional idea that Be stars rotate between 50 % and 80 % of their critical speeds and new ideas (inspired by the tendency for gravity darkening to mask rapid rotation at the equator) that their rotation may be very nearly critical. This paper utilizes Monte Carlo forward modeling to simulate distributions of the projected rotation speed (v sin i), taking into account gravity darkening, limb darkening, and observational uncertainties. A chi-squared minimization procedure was used to find the distribution parameters that best reproduce observed v sini distributions from R. Yudin’s database. Early-type (O 7 e–B 2 e) Be stars were found to exhibit a roughly uniform spread of intrinsic rotation speed that extends from 40 – 60 % up to 100 % of critical. Late-type (B 3 e–A 0 e) Be stars exhibit progressively narrower ranges of rotation speed as the effective temperature decreases; the lower limit rises to reach critical rotation for the coolest Be stars. The derived lower limits on equatorial rotation speed represent conservative threshold rotation rates for the onset of the Be phenomenon. The significantly subcritical speeds found for early-type Be stars represent strong constraints on physical models of angular momentum deposition in Be star disks...|$|R
40|$|The stratigraphic {{successions}} of Brumano-Italcementi and Malanotte Formation (Bergamasc Alps, northern Italy) {{were investigated}} {{with the aid}} of chemostratigraphycal analyses of δ 13 Corg. The successions belong to the Lombard Basin with a time-scale ranging between the Norian-Rhaetian (NRB) and the Triassic-Jurassic boundaries (TJB). The outcoming isotopic curve of δ 13 Corg shows a prominent isotopic excursion around the Norian-Rhaetian boundary (at the base of the Zu 2 Member, minimum of δ 13 Corg = - 27, 86 ‰). In the early Rhaetian the isotopic curve returns to background values (δ 13 Corg = ca. - 25, 75 ‰), but in the middle Rhaetian a strong negative shift within the Zu 3 a Member (minimum of δ 13 Corg = - 28, 13 ‰) can be noted. Eventually, around the TJB another drop is showed, reaching the minimum value at the Hettangian base (within the base of the Malanotte Formation, δ 13 Corg = - 28, 75 ‰). These three major δ 13 Corg shifts were correlated with those of other Tethyan sections (Pignola-Abriola section, Lagonegro Basin, southern Italy) and extra- Tethyan sections (Queen Charlotte Islands, Bristish Columbia, Canada). On the basis of these bio-chemostratigraphyc correlations, the global occurrence of the three major δ 13 Corg shifts was demonstrated, therefore a common global cause can be thought. Negative δ 13 Corg global excursions are caused by a 12 C enrichment in the oceanatmosphere system, likely related to: primary productivity drops, decrease in organic carbon burial rate, gas hydrates dissociations from ocean bottoms, and volcanogenic CO 2 giant <b>ejections</b> <b>linked</b> to the emplacement of magmatic provinces.

40|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{instability}} of a vortex ring is linear and characterized by the growth of an azimuthal stationary wave which develops around the ring. Theoretical works predict its origin, shape, number of waves and growth rate. Apart for the growth rate, experimental and numerical results in viscous fluids fit well with the predictions based on an ideal fluid hypothesis. On the other hand, the next stages {{of the development of}} the instability (which are non-linear) are not well known. Only few phenomena are described, in an isolated way, in various partial contributions. The aim {{of this paper is to}} report on a complete experimental investigation of the non-linear phase of the instability of the vortex ring. The vortices were produced in water and their Reynolds number Re p was varied from 2, 650 to 6, 100. Visualizations were performed using planar laser induced fluorescence and measurements with 2 D 2 C and 2 D 3 C particle image velocimetry. Based on a Fourier analysis of the results, it appears that the non-linear phase begins with the development of harmonics of the linear modes (first unstable modes). But the growth of those harmonics is rapidly stopped by the development of low order modes. Then appears an m= 0 mode, which corresponds to a mean azimuthal velocity around the vortex. Simultaneously, secondary vortical structures develop all around the vortex in its peripheral zone. These vortical structures are <b>linked</b> with the <b>ejection</b> of vorticity in the wake of the ring and they appear just before the transition towards turbulence. A tentative is made here to place all these phenomena chronologically, in order to propose a scenario for the transition from the linear phase to turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, hindrances to {{performance}} and voltage scaling led to a shift from uniprocessors to multicore processors, {{to the point where}} the on-chip interconnect plays a larger role in achieving the desired performance and power goals. Shared memory multicores are subject to data sharing concerns as each processor computes on data locally, and needs to be aware of accesses by other cores. Hardware cache coherence addresses the problem, and provides superior performance to software-implemented coherence, but is limited within practical constraints, i. e. area, power, timing. Scaling coherence to higher core counts, presents challenges of unscalable storage, high power consumption, and increased on-chip network traffic. SC²EPTON targets the three challenges with three on-chip networks - SCORPIO, SCEPTER, SB². SCORPIO addresses the unscalable storage plaguing directory-based coherence, with a 36 -core chip prototype showcasing a novel distributed global ordering mechanism to support snoopy coherence over scalable mesh networks. Although the downsides of a directory are averted, the network itself consumes a significant fraction of the total chip power, of which the router buffer power dominates. SCEPTER is a bufferless mesh NoC that reduces the network power consumption, and achieves high performance by intelligently prioritizing, routing, and throttling flits to maximize opportunities to bypass on dynamically set, virtual single-cycle express paths. For unicast communication, SCEPTER performs on-par with state-of-the-art buffered networks, however broadcasts exacerbate the link contention at bisection and <b>ejection</b> <b>links,</b> limiting performance gains. SB² addresses the broadcast traffic in bufferless NoCs with a TDM-based embedded ring architecture that dynamically determines ring access, allows multiple sources simultaneous contention-free access, and sets the control path locally at each node within the same cycle. The three NoCs contribute key elements to the SC²EPTON architecture, resulting in a low-power and high-performance bufferless snoopy coherent mesh network. by Bhavya Kishor Daya. Thesis: Ph.
