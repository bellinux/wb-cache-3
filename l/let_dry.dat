[...] Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light [...] Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure [...] Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East [...] To journie through the airie gloom began, [...] Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun [...] Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle [...] Sojourn'd the while.

[...] 260 [...] Again, God said, let ther be Firmament [...] Amid the Waters, and let it divide [...] The Waters from the Waters: and God made [...] The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, [...] Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd [...] In circuit to the uttermost convex [...] Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, [...] The Waters underneath from those above [...] Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World [...] Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide [...] 270 [...] Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule [...] Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames [...] Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: [...] And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n [...] And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. [...] The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet [...] Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, [...] Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth [...] Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme [...] Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, [...] 280 [...] Fermented the great Mother to conceave, [...] Satiate with genial moisture, when God said [...] Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n [...] Into one place, and <b>let</b> <b>dry</b> Land appeer.

[...] He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then [...] Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, [...] Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad [...] Her Universal Face with pleasant green, [...] Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd [...] Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay [...] Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, [...] Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept [...] 320 [...] The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed [...] Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, [...] And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last [...] Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred [...] Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd [...] Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, [...] With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, [...] With borders long the Rivers.

[...] Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights [...] High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide [...] 340 [...] The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, [...] For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, [...] And let them be for Lights as I ordaine [...] Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. [...] And God made two great Lights, great for thir use [...] To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, [...] The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, [...] And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day [...] 350 [...] In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, [...] And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, [...] Surveying his great Work, that it was good: [...] For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun [...] A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, [...] Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon [...] Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, [...] And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: [...] Of Light by farr the greater part he took, [...] Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd [...] 360 [...] In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive [...] And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine [...] Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. [...] Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs [...] Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, [...] And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; [...] By tincture or reflection they augment [...] Thir small peculiar, though from human sight [...] So farr remote, with diminution seen. [...] First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, [...] 370 [...] Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round [...] Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run [...] His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray [...] Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd [...] Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, [...] But opposite in leveld West was set [...] His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light [...] From him, for other light she needed none [...] In that aspect, and still that distance keepes [...] Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, [...] 380 [...] Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign [...] With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, [...] With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd [...] Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd [...] With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, [...] Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. [...] And God said, let the Waters generate [...] Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: [...] And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings [...] Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. [...] 390 [...] And God created the great Whales, and each [...] Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously [...] The waters generated by thir kindes, [...] And every Bird of wing after his kinde; [...] And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, [...] Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas [...] And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; [...] And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth.

DBS extraction required only 100 Î¼L of sample, added with the internal standards and then three droplets (30 Î¼L each) of this solution were spotted on the card, <b>let</b> <b>dry</b> for 1 h, punched and extracted with methanol with 0. 1 % of formic acid. The supernatant was evaporated and the residue was then reconstituted in 100 Î¼L of water with 0. 1 % of formic acid and injected in the UHPLC-MS/MS system. The method was validated considering the following parameters: LOD and LOQ, linearity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect and dilution integrity. LODs were 0. 05 - 1 ng/mL and LOQs were 0. 2 - 2 ng/mL. The method showed satisfactory linearity for all substances, with determination coefficients always higher than 0. 99. Intra and inter day precision, accuracy, matrix effect and dilution integrity were acceptable for all the studied substances. The addition of internal standards before DBS extraction and the deposition of a fixed volume of blood on the filter cards ensured the accurate quantification of the analytes. The validated method was then applied to authentic postmortem blood samples...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Noel Derecki, James Cronk & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract Here, we {{describe}} {{a method for}} determining phagocytic function of microglia isolated from mouse brains. ### Procedure To determine the phagocytic ability of microglial cells, we prefer to use apoptotic neural cells as targets, since they should most closely approximate natural microglial targets in vivo. 1. Dissociate neural progenitor cells in 0. 1 M PBS + 2 mg/ml papain (Worthington) at 37 Âº C for 30 m. - Treat dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPC) with UV light for 15 - 20 minutes; NOTE: this {{should be done in}} a thin plastic petri dish; thick plastic (eg. 15 or 50 ml conical tube) will block a significant portion of UV light, leading to suboptimal apoptosis. - Wash NPC in 50 ml conical tube with 40 ml PBS (RT), spin at 1200 RPM, 7 m, RT, low brake. Decant supernatant. - Resuspend NPC in 5 ml RT 0. 1 M PBS - Add 5 ul sta 5 (6) -TAMRA, SE (Invitrogen) to NPC, vortex immediately and let incubate at 37 Âº C in dark for 15 m. - Wash 3 X (as in Step 3) with 40 ml ice-cold 0. 1 M PBS. - Resuspend in 1 ml DMEM/F 12 (Invitrogen) + Anti-anti (Invitrogen); count cells using a hemacytometer. Dilute or concentrate to 5 X 10 e 6 per ml. - Feed onto microglial cells (previously allowed to adhere to glass cover slips in 24 -well plates) in 900 ul DMEM/F 12 + 10 % fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) + Anti-anti at a ratio of 10 NPC: 1 microglial cell. NOTE: We typically perform experiments using 5 X 10 e 4 microglia per coverslip such that cells are spaced sufficiently to allow later quantification, thus 5 X 10 e 5 NPC would be fed on in 100 ul DMEM/F 12 + Anti-anti. - Place cells in incubator, at 37 Âº and 5 % CO 2 - At desired timepoints (eg. one, two and five h) remove plates from incubator - In a sterile hood, remove cover slips with forceps, dip 20 X briskly in warm 0. 1 M PBS (to remove non-phagocytosed NPC), then place cover slips in 1 ml 4 % PFA in a 24 -well plate. Replace remaining cover slips in incubator until next desired time-point. - Fix cells on cover slips in dark for 20 m. Wash 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, at RT. - Block cover slips in 10 % serum in PBS containing 0. 3 % Triton X- 100 and 0. 5 % BSA, 1 h, RT in dark. - Incubate with anti-CD 11 b (eBioscience), 1 : 100) for 1 h at RT, in dark. - Wash cover slips 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Incubate with desired secondary antibody (1 : 1000, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at RT. - Wash cover slips 1 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Incubate in DAPI (1 : 20, 000) 5 m. - Wash cover slips 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Mount cover slips with Aqua-Mount (Lerner Laboratories) on slides. <b>Let</b> <b>dry</b> O/N before imaging. - Typically, a âphagocytic indexâ can be calculated by dividing the total area of microglial cells (CD 11 b+) by the total area of labeled NPC. Alternatively, number of phagocytosed targets/cell may be used to quantify phagocytosis. - To check validity of phagocytosed (internal) vs. adhered targets, Z-stacks may be imaged on confocal microscope. ### Timing - NPC dissociation, 30 m - NPC labeling, 45 m - Incubations, variable (1 + h) - Immunohistochemistry, 3 h ### Troubleshooting - Problem: Little or no phagocytosis observed - Solution 1 : NPC were not adequately irradiated; use stronger UV source, extend irradiation time, confirm cell death by dye or antibody-based assay (eg. annexinV, PI). - Solution 2 : Insufficient incubation time; extend incubation. ### Anticipated Results Microglia are highly phagocytic cells. Even after a short period of time, high levels of phagocytosis may be seen, as in Figure 1. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Microglial Phagocytosis** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") *At left is shown a representative Z-stack indicating that UV-irradiated TAMRA-labeled NPC (red) have been phagocytosed and are situated inside of microglia.
