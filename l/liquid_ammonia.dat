5|$|Thus, the {{ammonium}} ion, , {{plays the}} same role in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> as does the hydronium ion in water and the amide ion, , {{is analogous to the}} hydroxide ion. Ammonium salts behave as acids, and amides behave as bases.|$|E
5|$|Organometallic {{chemistry}} of vanadium is well developed, {{although it has}} mainly only academic significance. Vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and even finds some applications in organic chemistry. Vanadium carbonyl, V(CO)6, is a rare example of a paramagnetic metal carbonyl. Reduction yields V (isoelectronic with Cr(CO)6), which may be further reduced with sodium in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> to yield V (isoelectronic with Fe(CO)5).|$|E
5|$|The {{substitution}} of hydrogen atoms in an alkane by progressively more fluorine atoms gradually alters several properties: melting and boiling points are lowered, density increases, solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases. Perfluorocarbons, {{in which all}} hydrogen atoms are substituted, are insoluble in most organic solvents, reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Germane (GeH4) is a {{compound}} similar in structure to methane. Polygermanes—compounds {{that are similar}} to alkanes—with formula GenH2n+2 containing up to five germanium atoms are known. The germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> to form white crystalline MGeH3 which contain the GeH3− anion. The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{oxidation}} {{states can}} occur as Zintl phases, as either free lead anions, as in Ba2Pb, with lead formally being lead(−IV), or in oxygen-sensitive ring-shaped or polyhedral cluster ions {{such as the}} trigonal bipyramidal Pb52− ion, where two lead atoms are lead(−I) and three are lead(0). In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external lone pair. They may be made in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> via the reduction of lead by sodium.|$|E
25|$|One widely adopted {{replacement}} refrigerant is the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) {{known as}} R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). Heat pumps using R-134a replaced R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant {{ozone depletion potential}} and a somewhat lower global warming potential. Other substances such as <b>liquid</b> R-717 <b>ammonia</b> are widely used in large-scale systems, or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable propane or butane, can also be used.|$|R

30|$|The ammonia fiber/freeze {{explosion}} (AFEX) {{process is}} another physicochemical process, much like steam explosion pretreatment, {{in which the}} biomass material is subjected to <b>liquid</b> anhydrous <b>ammonia</b> under high pressures and moderate temperatures and is then rapidly depressurized. The moderate temperatures (60 °C to 100 °C) are significantly {{less than that of}} the steam explosion process, thus allowing less energy input and overall cost reduction associated with the process (Alizadeh et al. 2005, Teymouri et al. 2004, Chundawat et al. 2007).|$|R
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} and their {{hydrides}} react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. <b>Liquid</b> <b>ammonia,</b> ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, {{the most common}} of which being tetrahydrofuran. The most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide, NaC5H5, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (K2C8H8) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|The coinage metals were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p6s1; group 11: d10s1). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia,</b> as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals {{are at the top}} of the electrochemical series, whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom. The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au−) which also occurs in solvated form in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 the Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} observed cryovolcanoes (ice volcanoes) on Triton, a moon of Neptune, and in 2005 the Cassini–Huygens probe photographed fountains {{of frozen}} particles erupting from Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. The ejecta may {{be composed of}} water, <b>liquid</b> nitrogen, <b>ammonia,</b> dust, or methane compounds. Cassini–Huygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the Saturnian moon Titan, which {{is believed to be}} a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere. It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar.|$|R

50|$|Although cyanide is cheap, effective, and biodegradable, {{its high}} {{toxicity}} {{has led to}} new methods for extracting gold using less toxic reagents. Other extractants have been examined including thiosulfate (S2O32−), thiourea (SC(NH2)2), iodine/iodide, <b>ammonia,</b> <b>liquid</b> mercury and alpha-cyclodextrin. Challenges include reagent cost and the efficiency of gold recovery. Thiourea has been implemented commercially for ores containing stibnite.|$|R
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia,</b> forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Solid NH2OH can be {{collected}} by treatment with <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia.</b> Ammonium sulfate, , a side-product insoluble in <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia,</b> is removed by filtration; the <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> is evaporated {{to give the}} desired product.|$|E

See <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> as a solvent.|$|E
50|$|HF is {{dangerous}} to the systems of molecules that Earth-life is made of, but certain other organic compounds, such as paraffin waxes, are stable with it.

Using a solvent system definition of acidity and basicity, nitric acid functions as a base when it is added to liquid HF.|$|R
50|$|Methyl {{diethanolamine}} is a clear, colorless or {{pale yellow}} <b>liquid</b> with an <b>ammonia</b> odor. It is miscible with water, alcohol and benzene. Methyl diethanolamine {{is also known}} as N-methyl diethanolamine and more commonly as MDEA. It has the formula CH3N(C2H4OH)2. MDEA is a tertiary amine and is widely used as a sweetening agent in chemical, oil refinery, syngas production and natural gas.|$|R
50|$|Mixtures of {{different}} solvents can have interesting features like anomalous conductivity (electrolytic) of particular lyonium ions and lyate ions generated by molecular autoionization of protic and aprotic solvents due to Grottus mechanism of ion hopping depding on the mixing ratios. Examples may include hydronium and hydroxide ions {{in water and}} water alcohol mixtures, alkoxonium and alkoxide ions in the same mixtures, ammonium and amide ions in <b>liquid</b> and supercritical <b>ammonia,</b> alkylammonium and alkylamide ions in ammines mixtures, etc.|$|R
25|$|The {{range of}} {{thermodynamic}} stability of <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> solutions is very narrow, {{as the potential}} for oxidation to dinitrogen, E° (N2 + 6NH4+ + 6e− ⇌ 8NH3), is only +0.04nbsp&V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the metal amide and dihydrogen. Most studies involving <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> solutions are done in reducing conditions; although oxidation of <b>liquid</b> <b>ammonia</b> is usually slow, {{there is still a}} risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.|$|E

50|$|Some {{mixtures}} are so intimately combined {{that they}} have some properties similar to compounds and may easily be mistaken for compounds. One example is alloys. Alloys are made mechanically, most commonly by heating the constituent metals to a liquid state, mixing them thoroughly, and then cooling the mixture quickly so that the constituents are trapped in the base metal.

5000|$|The {{applicable}} {{definition of}} a particle does not require it to be elementary or even [...] "microscopic", but it requires that all its degrees of freedom (or internal states) {{that are relevant to}} the physical problem considered shall be known.

Progressively more [...] "complex" [...] particles obtain progressively more internal freedoms (such as various quantum numbers in an atom), and when the number of internal states, that [...] "identical" [...] particles in an ensemble can occupy, dwarfs their count (the particle number), then effects of quantum statistics become negligible. That's why quantum statistics is useful when one considers, say, helium <b>liquid</b> or <b>ammonia</b> gas (its molecules have a large, but conceivable number of internal states), but is useless applied to systems constructed of macromolecules.|$|R
500|$|The current {{understanding}} {{of the evolution of}} Callisto allows for the existence of a layer or [...] "ocean" [...] of liquid water in its interior.
