Vetiver biomass, its metal contents and, its total and MgCl 2 extractable soil metals were monitored over 6 months {{in the presence of}} a mixture of metal at two concentrations: 2 - 10 and 100 - 500 mg kg(- 1), for Cd and Cu, respectively. The Freundlich adsorption coefficient (K-f) values increased after vetiver growth and were significantly higher for vertisol than for <b>lixisol.</b> After 6 months, the vetiver that was grown on <b>lixisol</b> accumulated more metal, increasing up to 4635 mg kg(- 1) for Cu and to 21. 8 mg kg(- 1) for Cd, than did the vetiver that was grown on vertisol, increasing up to 1534 mg kg(- 1) for Cu and to 7. 2 mg kg(- 1) for Cd. The metal bioconcentration factor, which was significantly higher for Cd, increased with the applied concentration and ranged from 1. 6 to 14 for Cu and from 2. 3 to 22 for Cd. Additionally, the translocation factors were higher for Cd (0. 38 - 7. 3) than for Cu (0. 07 - 2. 6), and the translocation was easiest from <b>lixisol</b> than from vertisol. Thus our results demonstrate the ability of vetiver for Cu and Cd phytoremediation in Burkina Faso soils. Nevertheless, these results should be confirmed across the field to advocate the establishment of vetiver hedges. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

All individuals > 3 cm diameter in 40 4 x 4 m(2) plots were harvested for above ground biomass measurements. Four treatments, defined by soil type (<b>lixisol</b> and calcisol) and distance from villages (near 4 km), were tested. The growth rings, assumed to be annual, of the shrub trunk with the largest diameter, presumed to be the oldest specimen on each 4 x 4 m(2) plot, were counted to estimate the duration of biomass production on the plot. Above ground biomass productivity was estimated by the ratio between above ground biomass and growth rings number. The mean above ground biomass productivity varied between 038 and 0. 99 t ha(- 1) year(- 1) of dry mass according to the four treatments. It did not vary significantly with soil type and increased with distance from villages on <b>lixisol</b> where woody charcoal is produced.

Experiments at two sites (Mediga and Yimtenga) were conducted in Burkina Faso {{to assess the impact}} of compost on improving crop production and soil properties. In the first experiment, compost was applied at the rate of 0 and 10 Mg ha- 1 in Mediga on a Ferric <b>Lixisol,</b> and 5 and 0 Mg ha- 1 on a Ferric-gleyic <b>Lixisol</b> in Yimtenga. A second experiment was conducted in Yimtenga to assess the role of compost in mitigating the effect of delay in sowing on crop performance. 0 and 5 Mg ha- 1 compost plots were sown within the normal period for sowing sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) and with a delay of 1 month. A randomised block design was used with four replications for the two experiments. Semi-structured interviews were used to study socio-economic issues of compost technology. No significant difference in soil organic matter content was found between treatments receiving compost and no-compost. However, compost application increased soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) from 4 to 6 cmol kg- 1. Soil pH was also increased by the compost application. Sorghum yield tripled on the 10 Mg ha- 1 compost plots and increased by 45 n the 5 Mg ha- 1 compost plots, compared to no-compost plots. Compost application mitigated the negative effects of a delay in sowing. The study showed that farmers were aware of the role of compost in sustaining yield and improving soil quality. However, lack of equipment and adequate organic material for making compost, land tenure and the intensive labour required for making compost are major constraints for the adoption of compost technology.

Parent material is Precambrian metamorphic bedrock, vegetation a mosaic of (semi) deciduous forest and savanna (cerrado type). The climate is tropical with 4 to 5 dry months in the winter. With direct calculation of CEC per kg clay (both: pH 7 and effective), attributing the CEC completely to the clay fraction, the following soil groups were keyed out: 8 Ferralsols, 6 Phaeozems, 1 Acrisol, 2 <b>Lixisols,</b> 2 Umbrisols, and 1 Regosol. It is astonishing to have Phaeozems. In our handbooks they are described as steppe soils making excellent farmland. On the contrary, in the study area, the forest Phaeozems are medium-fertile and used for shifting cultivation, and the savanna Phaeozems are not suitable for agriculture at all. Using regression analysis to split up the contributions of organic matter and clay to the CEC leads to a modified classification: 2 savanna Phaeozems and the 2 <b>Lixisols</b> shift to the Ferralsols. With that method many more horizons have low-activity clays. To avoid some major difficulties, which may occur with regression analysis, we used the direct calculation to detect the CEC per kg clay. Anyway, the WRB key has to state clearly the required calculation method. For the Phaeozems we suggest introducing a ferralic qualifier. Ferralic Phaeozems would intergrade to the already existing Mollic Ferralsols.

On-farm experiments combining two tillage regimes - annual ox-ploughing (AP) and ox-ploughing/hand hoe scarifying in alternate years, referred to as reduced tillage (RT) - with or without compost addition in a cotton-maize rotation were carried out on two common soil types (a Ferric <b>Lixisol</b> and a Ferric Luvisol). We investigated the effects of the treatments on: (i) soil aggregate stability, (ii) soil infiltrability, and (iii) crops nutrient uptakes and yields. Reduced tillage resulted in greater macroaggregate stability than annual ploughing in both soil types. The compost addition treatments (in combination with annual ploughing or reduced tillage) increased soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) compared to the annual ploughing without compost addition (control). The soil nutrient status was related to organic and mineral fertilizer inputs, and soil carbon and nitrogen contents were highest (ca 0. 6 % C and 0. 05 % N) in plots where compost was applied, after the third year of the experiment. Reducing tillage had no clear effect on cotton and maize nutrient uptake, but compost applications increased N and P uptake by cotton in both soil types. On both soil types, the cotton fibre yields under the reduced tillage regime with compost additions were higher than those obtained under the control, although the differences were not always statistically significant. The trend of maize production was: higher production under the annual ploughing with compost addition than the control on the <b>Lixisol,</b> while it was the reduced tillage with compost addition, on the Luvisol.

For this purpose, hourly soil moisture measurements were collected with TDR and analyzed between 2003 and 2010 for three soil-vegetation associations in the Aiuaba Experimental Basin.

Soil type was not significant in landslide occurrences. However soil texture in the horizons was significant in some of the landslides especially in the western zone. One factor that was common to all soils sampled in the western side was the same soil texture of clay down the profile and the subsequent absence of landslides in the surroundings of the profiles. In the eastern zone soil profile horizon is significant in some of the landslides but in the shallow landslides the slope and the shallow depth which creates a discontinuity between the saprolite and the rock causing water stagnation is the main influence.

The survey was performed using GIS techniques based on the integration of a SRTM-derived digital elevation model, topographic maps at 1 : 100, 000, digital geological data, Landsat imagery, and available soil maps. The GIS survey also allowed to take into consideration other fundamental environmental parameters such as rainfall distribution and water balance calculations that are useful to understanding soil distribution and mesoscale topographic patterns. The resulting soil-landform map captures the key features of the regional pedogeomorphic landscapes: (1) the humid Baturité massif is characterised by a summit surface (800 - 900 m a. s. l.) which is the domain of multiconvex topography, monosiallitic weathering and associated low-activity-clay Acrisols; (2) a sub-humid peripheral area of highly dissected landscape (200 - 800 m) shows a shallowness in weathering and soil profiles (Lixisols); (3) in the semi-arid plain (0 - 200 m), the ‘Sertão’ is a landscape of dissected pediplain with shallow bisiallitic grus that supports red Luvisols and brown Cambisols; (4) the sedimentary piedmont is composed of basal Neogene clastic sediments covered by paleosols (<b>Lixisols)</b> and of Pleistocene aeolian sands marked by poorly developed soils (Arenosols) ...|$|R
40|$|The TAO {{model of}} Transformation of Added Organic {{materials}} (AOM) calibrated on AOMs and substrates of temperate areas {{was used to}} assess the transformations in soil of carbon and nitrogen forms of AOMs: raw materials, selected mixtures and composts from Ouagadougou urban wastes. AOMs were studied in terms of chemical and biochemical contents and for their C and N mineralization during incubations in a typical Ferric <b>Lixisol</b> of the sub-urban agriculture of Ouagadougou. The TAO model was used to predict the transformations of C (very labile, resistant and stable organic C) and N (very labile, resistant and stable organic N, produced and immobilized inorganic N) forms driven by AOM biochemical data. Without any change in calibration formulae, TAO predicted accurately the C transformations and inorganic N production of most of the tested AOMs, with a tendency to slightly overestimate C mineralization of previously well-composted materials and re-mineralization of immobilized N. Complementary adjustments using more complete data from laboratory experiments are suggested, but the model agrees with other data collected in the field and appears as a promising tool to optimise the management of urban wastes in the tropical area as well as for agro industrial organic fertilizers of the temperate zone. This application suggests ways to improve the management of urban wastes aiming to optimize agricultural yields, system sustainability and C sequestration in soil...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Weathering and {{pedogenesis}} {{have been}} studied {{for a wide range}} of rocks and climates around the world. However, the eruption of rhyolitic magmas is a rare geological event, which leads to few studies associated with the rhyolite-soil-landscape relationship. In this context, this study evaluated the influence of rhyolite weathering on the properties of soils along a slope in an Atlantic Forest environment in the state of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. Four weathering profiles derived from rhyolites were classified and sampled for chemical, physical, mineralogical, micromorphological, differential thermal, and thermogravimetric analyses. The chemical properties reflect the original rock rich in felsic minerals, poor in bases, and the types of clay minerals. The clay fraction of the profiles consists mainly of 1 : 1 phyllosilicates and oxides, indicating intermediate weathering. However, variations in the degree of structure weathering were evidenced by the presence of partially preserved fragments of the original rock in the sand fraction of the soils. The tropical humid climate of the region influenced conversion of hematite to goethite through the xanthization process, and the subsurface drainage deficiency allowed the formation of halloysite in the lowest position of the landscape. Because it is an acid rock with an aphanitic texture and porphyritic relative size of crystals, rhyolite weathering resulted in the formation of dystrophic soils, with predominance of quartz in the silt fraction. From the top to the lower third of the slope, a Haplic Cambisol, an Abruptic <b>Lixisol,</b> and two Haplic Lixisols were formed...|$|E
40|$|In the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso, runoff on {{bare soil}} amounts to 40 ␘f annual {{rainfall}} and soil losses reach 4 to 8 Mg ha-? a-?, despite slopes of under 3 ÐSeveral {{studies have shown}} that mulching the soil surface can reduce runoff by over 60 ÐHowever, the scarcity of straw and the incompatibility of mulching with mechanical soil preparation have prevented the large-scale adoption of the technique. The study conducted in Saria village where annual rainfall is 800 mm,set out to evaluate the efficacy of sorghum-cowpea intercropping in reducing runoff and erosion. The study design comprised five plots set up so as to recover runoff and transported solids, on a Ferric <b>lixisol</b> with a slope of 0. 7 ÐThree years results showed that sorghum-cowpea intercropping reduces runoff by 20 - 30 ␌ompared to a sorghum monoculture and by 45 - 55 ␌ompared to a cowpea monoculture. Soil loss is also reduced with intercropping by at least a half compared to sorghumand cowpea monoculture. Moreover, it transpired that sorghum-cowpea intercropping is also beneficial in agricultural production terms, since the grain yield of the intercropped plots was double that obtained with sorghumor cowpea monocultures. The better crop production can be an asset for the widespread use of this technique in the country. An evaluation of the advantages of the legume in terms of nitrogen supplies to the cereal (N 2 symbiotic fixation) and of added soil OM will be useful in improving the cost-effectiveness of such a technique...|$|E
40|$|Spectacular damage by rill and {{gully erosion}} often hides the basic aspects of soil erosion and {{hydrology}} that {{occur at the}} level of very small plots. Processes not discernible at the field or watershed level are yet fundamental to provide concepts and knowledge required for efficient development of research. The present study intends to develop a local interrill soil erosion model, based on the mechanisms of detachment and transport of soil particles by splash erosion and sheet wash. Twenty-five sites representing the main regional soil units (Cambisols, Fluvisols, <b>Lixisols,</b> Vertisols and Planosols) of the semiarid area of Northern Cameroon, with different erosion classes, were subjected to artificial rainfall. Rain showers (three per plot) were simulated over one-square-meter plots at different intensities and durations, using a field rainfall simulator. Plots were bare and ploughed with a hand hoe. The method allowed the explicit consideration of factors determining both runoff and sediment concentration in detail. Samples of splashed-off material and runoff were taken every ten minutes throughout each simulated rain. The stability of the soil surface aggregates was investigated. The method consisted pressing a torvane apparatus with blades 4 cm high and 2 cm wide, 1 cm deep into the undisturbed soil surface next to the test plot before and after each rainfall simulation experiment. The pressure needed to rotate the blades through the soil was read on a movable scale on the torvane handle after removing the instrument from the soil. The scale was moved back to zero and the next reading was made. Ten readings were made on the same plot and averaged. All data were integrated, and the interactions among erosion parameters enabled a local interrill soil erosion model to b [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{degradation}} processes {{have achieved}} {{the recognition of}} a global environmental problem in recent years. It has been suggested by various international forums and organizations {{that in order to}} adequately establish methods to combat land degradation, it is necessary to evaluate this degradation locally and at a detailed scale. The evaluation of soil degradation of natural ecosystems at a detailed scale requires the definition of standards to which to compare this degradation. To define these standards and properly handle the processes that give rise to variations in soil quality and degradation, it is necessary to establish in some detail the pedogenic processes that have or have not taken place in a particular area and which lead to the formation of a mature soil. A mature soil should be considered as standard in these situations and, therefore, a non-degraded soil. This paper presents the possible evolutive and regressive sequences of soil, and provides some examples of using this methodology to evaluate the degradation of the same in the Monteverde of the island of Tenerife. It also presents some physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of climacic mature soils, degraded soils and low quality soils, and examines their similarities and differences in this bioclimatic environment and on different parent materials. Thus it is observed that the main processes of degradation in these areas are related to plant cover modifications that lead to the decreasing protection of the soil surface, which results in the long term, in the onset of degradation processes such as water erosion, biological degradation, loss of andic properties, compaction and sealing and crusting surface, loss of water retention capacity, illuviation, etc. Climacic soils that can be found in areas of steep lava flows are Leptosols, while gently sloping areas are Cambisols and Andosols. On pyroclastic materials there are vitric Andosols and andic Andosols according to their degree of evolution. The most characteristic regressive processes are illuviation/leaching, resulting in Luvisols, <b>Lixisols</b> and Alisols; and water erosion, causing the presence of secondary Leptosols...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{distribution}} of soil phenolic matter (SPM) in soil environments from a pedological perspective, with particular emphasis on soil horizonation and its involvement in pedogenic processes. The study was conducted on 15 soil profiles (Andosols, Calcisols, Cambisols, <b>Lixisols,</b> Phaeozems, Podzols, Umbrisols) covering five distinct ecosystems. Although the ecosystems were virtually homogeneous in and of themselves, they represented strongly contrasting climates, geolithology and morphology, land use and vegetation cover (intensive agriculture, chestnut grove, alpine pasture, woody reforestations, and natural woods). Three main SPM fractions were categorised: (i) “total” (SPMt), (ii) “soluble” and/or “labile” (SPMs), and (iii) the fraction with a “high” (SPMh) affinity for the soil body. The SPMh and SPMs contents varied significantly, averaging 2. 84 ± 0. 52 g kg − 1 and 0. 07 ± 0. 02 g kg − 1, respectively. Thus, these fractions appear to belong to different soil organic matter (SOM) pools. Indeed, the SPMs fraction was characterised by transitional, ephemeral low-weight molecules, which continuously reached the soil through both plant metabolism/decay and SOM degradation and were subsequently transformed into larger materials (humic matter, organo-mineral complexes) and/or lost by leaching and mineralisation. The SPMh fraction is likely involved in pedogenic processes that are primarily driven by the transport/translocation of colloidal phases under the following conditions: (i) {{in the early stages}} of horizon differentiation or, more specifically, in transport processes from the overlying A horizons and (ii) in cheluviation phenomena leading to the formation of spodic horizons. Moreover, SPMh also appears to be involved in early “in situ” alteration of cambic horizons. This involvement may result from the strong etching/complexing activity of soluble polyphenols from the overlying horizon, which promotes “in situ” weathering of the parent material. The total amount of SPM in a given environment greatly depended on the environmental conditions, which ranged from 0. 02 g kg − 1 in an intensively cultivated Haplic Cambisol to 13. 14 g kg − 1 in an Andic Cambisol under natural downy oak cover. Additionally, the SPMh/SPMs and SPMt/SOM...|$|R
