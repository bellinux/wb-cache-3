25|$|Experimental wind {{turbines}} were commissioned in 1978; however, high maintenance requirements and excessive power generation resulted in Diesel remaining the main power source. In 2004 a new 600kW wind-Diesel system was erected; other {{works at the}} time included upgrades to the power station and the installation of <b>low</b> <b>load</b> Diesel generators. The wind turbine delivers approximately 37% of Rottnest's power requirements and saves over 400,000 litres of Diesel fuel per year.|$|E

A system installed in Coral Bay, Western Australia, uses wind turbines coupled with a flywheel based control system and LLDs. The flywheel technology enables the wind turbines to supply up to 95 percent of Coral Bay’s energy supply at times, with a total annual wind penetration of 45 percent.|$|E

25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for <b>low</b> <b>load</b> torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

500|$|Fresh water aboard Queen Mary 2 is {{supplied}} by three seawater desalination plants. The plants, {{each with a}} capacity of [...] per day, use multiple effect plate (MEP) distillation technology. The plants' energy {{is supplied}} primarily by steam and cooling water from the ship's gas turbines and diesel engines, or if needed by steam from the ship's two oil-fired boilers. The traditional multiple-effect distillation technology has been improved for the ship's plant, so that scaling of plates is reduced, vastly reducing maintenance required. The desalinated water has a very low salt content of less than five parts per million. Average total water production is [...] per day with a capacity of [...] {{so that there is}} ample spare capacity. The ship could easily be supplied by only two of the three plants. Potable water tanks have a capacity of , enough for more than three days of supply. If the engines are running on <b>low</b> <b>load</b> (when the ship is running at a slow speed) the engine jacket cooling water temperature is insufficient to heat the seawater to run the desalination plants. In that case steam from oil-fired boilers is used to heat the sea water. This is uneconomical as generating steam is expensive. It may be cheaper, therefore, to buy water in a particular port than to produce it on board. The seawater intakes are located in the hull of the ship. Concentrated salt solution (brine) is discharged to the sea closer to the ship's stern together with cooling water from the engines. An additional plant was added during the 2016 refit works.|$|E

40|$|Induction {{machines}} {{usually have}} a reduced efficiency when supplied with non linear currents. Most of the induction machines are not used at nominal loading, but at a 60 % loading rate. In the paper it will be shown that derating factors for induction motors fed with nonlinear currents, like the NEMA MG 1 or the IEC 60034 - 17, are correct for nominal loading. At lower loading these derating factors can underestimate the losses. The measurements shown in this paper indicate that for <b>low</b> <b>loading</b> percentages, the phase angles of the harmonics have a significant influence on the peak induction and therefore the saturation level of the induction machine. For <b>low</b> <b>loading</b> rates the constant losses, including the magnetization losses, are the dominant losses.

30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Table  3, the {{friction}} coefficients in the CNCPM textured cylinder liner was smaller than that in the CE textured cylinder liner at the <b>low</b> <b>loads</b> (200  N and 400  N) while at the high load (600  N), the opposite is true. It was hypothesized that the CNCPM texturing method was better for cylinder liner than CE texturing method at the <b>low</b> <b>loads.</b> Moreover, at the <b>low</b> <b>loads</b> (200  N and 400  N), the mean values of friction coefficients with the CNCPM surface were 0.0407 and 0.0502, while the CE surface were 0.0681 and 0.0753. It was mainly because the processing methods changed the surface contact performance. The surface hardness under different texturing methods was measured using an automatic digital display Rockwell hard-tester (Huayin Ltd., China). The hardness of the untreated cylinder liner surface was 19.4 HRC, while the CE surface was 17.6 HRC and the CNCPM surface was 20.9 HRC. During the processing of CE, the hardness of wear surface became low, the normal forces loaded by hydraulic system were remained constant during the tests, so the soft surface processed by CE needed longer testing time to remove and the wear degree became more severe at <b>low</b> <b>loads</b> than that of the CNCPM. Consequently, the CE method may produce larger friction coefficients than the CNCPM. Because {{the friction}} force became larger during remove the effected surface of cylinder liners. But with the high load (600  N), the effected surface was removed during the beginning of the test, which can be proved by the curve variation tendencies of the first 3600  s in Table  3 (Micro-concave processed by CE, 600  N). As a result, the friction coefficient was firstly raised and then decreased during the loads increased. During the processing of CNCPM, the hardness of wear surface increases due to high processing temperature, so the wear degree became slight at <b>low</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, the existence of the micro-concave made the cylinder liner surface store a portion of the lubrication oil and improved the lubrication at <b>low</b> <b>loads.</b> With the increase of load, the condition of lubrication became worse. This ultimately increased the friction coefficients between the friction pairs. Finally, it led to a rise in friction coefficients.|$|R
