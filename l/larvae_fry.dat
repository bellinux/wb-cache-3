The distribution of gonatus {{was very similar}} to that found in 1978. During June-July, small gonatus were abundant in the northeastern Norwegian Sea, maximum 4000 specimens in half hours' hauls with a Harstad trawl, 18 x 18 m opening. Recordings with a Simrad EK- 120 echo sounder and integrator showed highest intensity in the area of maximum catches. In June-July mantle lengths were mostly 5 - 50 mm, maximum at 15 - 19 mm with average length 28 mm, but a few larger individuals, up to 80 - 84 mm, were found. Preliminary countings of growth rings in the statoliths indicated an age of 30 days for gonatus with mantle length 15 mm, 45 days for lengths of 25 - 35 mm, 65 - 75 days for lengths of 40 mm and 80 days for 50 mm.

Globally, opportunities exist to introduce or explore alternative species, new strains or highly selected stocks that represent substantial appeal to aquaculture. Movement of these products and organisms presents challenges to resolve potential interactions with the native ecology, the transfer of diseases to either freshwater fish culture or wild stocks and the potential transfer of contaminants or pathogens of concern for human food safety.

40|$|To {{investigation}} of the toxic effects of atrazine on newly hatched larvae and releasing age fry of the Caspian Kutum, Rutilus frisii kutum, the 96 h LC 50 was determined as 18. 53 ppm and 24. 95 ppm, respectively. Newly hatched larvae were exposed to three sublethal concentrations of atrazine (1 / 2 LC 50, 1 / 4 LC 50 and 1 / 8 LC 50) for 7 days. Different histopathological alterations were observed in fins and integument, gills, Kidney, digestive system, liver and the brain of the exposed <b>larvae.</b> <b>Fry’s</b> were exposed to one sublethal concentration of atrazine (1 / 2 LC 50) for four days, and like the larvae’s, many histopathological alterations were observed in fins and integument, gills, Kidney, digestive system, liver and the brain of the exposed fry’s, too. Also, measurements of the body ions: Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Cl- in atrazine exposed <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry’s</b> compare to control groups showed that atrazine is changed the body ions composition. No {{significant differences were found}} in length growth rate, weight growth rate and the condition factor of the atrazine exposed <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry.</b> Immunohistochemical localization of the Na+, K+-ATPase in integumentary and gill ionocytes, showed no differences in dispersion pattern of the ionocytes in atrazine exposed <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry,</b> compare to control group. Measuring the dimensions of the ionocytes and counting the ionocytes showed that atrazine is affecting on ionocytes by mild increasing in size and mild decreasing in number. Ultrastructural studies, using SEM and TEM, showed that atrazine have significant effects on cellular and subcellular properties. It caused necrosis in surface of the pavement cells in branchial epithelium, necrosis in endoplasmic reticulum of the ionocytes and changed the shape of the mitochondria in these cells. Results showed that sublethal concentrations of atrazine were very toxic to <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry</b> of the Rutilus frisii kutum, and at these levels can made some serious histopathological alterations in their tissues. Related to the severe histopathological alterations in osmoregulatory organs, like gill, kidney and digestive system, and the alterations in the body ion composition, it could be concluded that atrazine could interfere with the osmoregulation process of the Rutilus frisii kutum at {{the early stages of the}} life history...|$|R

San Francisco Bay Artemia with a good natural fatty acid profile and small body size could be offered earlier than the larger but HUFA-poor Great Salt Lake strain. The poor nutritional quality of the latter, however, could be corrected by enriching the nauplii with an Ï‰ 3 -HUFA emulsion for 24 h, after which time high levels of the Ï‰ 3 -HUFAs 20 : 5 and 22 : 6 were obtained. When the Artemia diet offered before metamorphosis included natural or supplemented essential fatty acids, {{no significant differences in}} dry weight, length or survival of the fish were noticed, as compared to fish fed the naturally deficient GSL Artemia. Onset of metamorphosis and physiological condition after metamorphosis, however, were influenced by the HUFA content of the ingested prey.

An indication of the physiological condition of the larvae and the early detection of the syndrome was possible by subjecting 21 - and 25 -day-old larvae to a stress test: abrupt exposure of the larvae to 65 -ppt saline water resulted in abundant and early mortality in HUFA-deficient fish <b>larvae.</b> <b>Fry</b> receiving Ï‰ 3 -HUFA-fortified Artemia had a superior physiological condition which was reflected by significantly lower mortality figures in the stress test...|$|E

To assess differential life stage sensitivity to common EDCs, we carried out short-term (4 day) exposures using three doses each of 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), 17 β-estradiol(E 2), and nonylphenol (NP) on four early life stages; embryos, yolk-sac larvae, feeding fry and 1 year old smolts. Differential response was compared using vitellogenin (Vtg, a precursor egg protein) gene transcription. Smolts were also examined for impacts on plasma Vtg, cortisol, thyroid hormones (T 4 /T 3) and hepatosomatic index (HSI). Compound-related mortality was not observed in any life stage, but Vtg mRNA was elevated in a dose-dependent manner in yolk-sac <b>larvae,</b> <b>fry</b> and smolts but not in embryos. The estrogens EE 2 and E 2 were consistently stronger inducers of Vtg than NP. Embryos responded significantly to the highest concentration of EE 2 only, while older life stages responded to the highest doses of all three compounds, as well as intermediate doses of EE 2 and E 2. Maximal transcription was greater for fry among the three earliest life stages, suggesting fry {{may be the most}} responsive life stage in early development. Smolt plasma Vtg was also significantly increased, and this response was observed at lower doses of each compound than was detected by gene transcription suggesting plasma Vtg is a more sensitive indicator at this life stage. HSI was increased at the highest doses of EE 2 and E 2, and plasma T 3 was decreased at the highest dose of EE 2. Our results indicate that all life stages are potentially sensitive to endocrine disruption by estrogenic compounds and that physiological responses were altered over a short window of exposure, indicating the potential for these compounds to impact fish in the wild...|$|E

The goal of this thesis was assess the suitability of individual commercially produced hormonal preparations for controlled reproduction of weatherfish and the possibility to replace with them unstandardized use of homogenate of carp pituitary. It was found that use of various hormonal preparations and dosage may to in some extent affect hatchability and survival rate of <b>larvae</b> (<b>fry),</b> the size of the yolk sac of larvae, and the amount of energy deposited in body tissues of larvae. However, demonstrable difference in studied parameters for the application of different preparations on the different hormonal basis (hCG versus GnRH) was not reported. The highest rate of hatching larvae (93. 3 ? 3. 8 %) was observed in the groups treated with preparation Pregnyl 3000 IU - kg- 1. In terms of overall survival of the larvae (from deployment of hatched eggs until the end of the experiment) have proven to be the most effective medication Pregnyl 3000 IU - kg- 1 (69. 9 ? 12. 1 %) and Dagin (60. 56 ? 11. 71 %). Within the thesis has been demonstrated no relationship between hormonal treatment used and the growth of larvae (in terms of achieved total length of body and dry weight).

40|$|The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii Mitchell 1838) is Australia's largest {{freshwater}} fish. Once highly {{abundant in}} the Murray-Darling river system, populations have drastically declined in recent decades. Many causes for this decline have been proposed, including over-fishing, habitat loss and altered river flow regimes. This study hypothesised that elevated salinities have led to selective mortality in some developmental stages, which have in turn depleted stock recruitment and adult populations. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the optimal, threshold, upper sublethal and lethal salinities for development of eggs, yolk-sac <b>larvae,</b> <b>fry</b> and fingerlings of M. peelii peelii. Investigation the impact of salinity on fertilisation utilised gametes of trout cod (M. macquariensis, Cuvier 1829) instead of M. peelii peelii. Studies were carried out in a controlled laboratory environment using test media prepared from commercial sea salt. The results showed that the eggs of the trout cod hatched only when fertilised and incubated in freshwater, and only larvae hatched in freshwater survived through the yolk absorption period of 12 days. Yolk utilisation efficiencies were not significantly different among the salinities of 0 - 0. 30 g/L. There was no effect of pre- or post- fertilising processes on the salinity tolerances of yolk-sac larvae. No larvae survived at salinities higher than 0. 30 g/L during the yolk utilisation period. Lethal salinity concentration in Trout cod and Murray cod larvae was exposure time dependent. The 1 day LC 50 of the larvae was 1. 97 and 2. 33 g/L respectively, compared with the 12 day LC 50 values of 0. 50 and 0. 35 g/L respectively. The threshold (no effect level) salinities of larvae of Trout cod and Murray cod were 0. 46 and 0. 34 g/L respectively at 12 days exposure. The salinity sensitivities of fry of Murray cod were moderated by increasing pH between pH 6. 2 and 8. 8, and stimulated by increasing temperatures from 15 to 30 C. The optimal salinity was only slightly affected by temperature. The threshold and upper sublethal salinities varied slightly depending on feeding regime. The salinity sensitivities of fingerlings of Murray cod were: LC 50 = 13. 7 g/L; optimal salinity from 4. 6 to 5. 0 g/L; threshold salinity from 5. 9 to 7. 4 g/L, and upper sub-lethal salinity from 9. 2 to 9. 9 g/L - with the range in all cases affected by acclimation period salinity. The blood osmolality at LC 50 of the fingerlings was 444 mOsmol/kgH 2 O or equivalent to 14. 2 g/L, and the dehydration rate was 4. 8 %. The osmolality increased significantly in salinities higher than 9. 0 and 6. 0 g/L when fish were exposed for a period of 1 day and 41 days respectively. The oxygen consumption increased significantly in salinities higher than 8. 0 g/L. Distortion of the notochord and corrosive skin syndrome were major symptoms describing sub-lethal effects found in the embryos, and fry and fingerlings of Murray cod respectively. Noting the risks of extrapolating directly from laboratory to field conditions, it is predicted that when salinity in natural habitats increases above 0. 34 g/L a significant impact on Murray cod recruitment will result...|$|E
40|$|Throughout North America {{populations of}} white {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser transmontanus) are threatened, {{in part due}} to poor annual recruitment. Definitive causes for this are not yet known, but the effects of contaminants are suspected to contribute. White sturgeon are exposed to a range of contaminants as they tend to inhabit industrialized river systems such as the Columbia and Fraser. White sturgeon are not commonly studied in ecotoxicology and their vulnerability as a species to contaminants of environmental concern is not well defined. To date, few exposure studies have been conducted with <b>larvae,</b> <b>fry,</b> and/or juveniles of this species; life stages often considered most susceptible to pollutants. Specifically, little work has been conducted to characterize effects of metals on white sturgeon. In the Upper Columbia River (UCR) a population of white sturgeon has been experiencing poor annual recruitment for over thirty years, and the effects of metal pollution have been hypothesized as a potential contributing factor. In particular, Teck Metals Ltd. (Teck) operates a metallurgical facility in Trail, BC, Canada that currently discharges processed effluent into the river and historically released other metal containing tailings such as slag. There are concerns that concentrations of trace-elements, such as copper, lead, cadmium, and zinc, associated with the effluent and/or slag, might have detrimental impacts on the surrounding ecosystem, including the local white sturgeon population. In 2006, a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) was initiated in the UCR, under the oversight of the US EPA, and this project is contributing to the portion dedicated to the risk assessment of the exposure of white sturgeon to metals. The goals of this project were to develop information on toxicity of water, sediments and associated slag to help characterize sensitivity of white sturgeon to metals, and assess associated risks of metals on the population of white sturgeon in the UCR. Previous work conducted as part of a MSc degree, examined the effects of liquid effluent released by Teck on early life stages of white sturgeon. In addition, baseline information of toxicity due to sub-chronic exposure of early life stage sturgeon to copper, cadmium, and zinc, were developed. The thesis presented herein builds upon this previous work and has three major components to further characterize sensitivity of white sturgeon to metals and risk of exposure in the UCR. Specifically, a series of acute dose-response experiments were conducted with various early life stages of white sturgeon and resulting threshold values compared to water quality standards to assess protectiveness. Sensitivity of white sturgeon to metals was characterized by conducting parallel experiments with standard test species, such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), as well as parallel field exposures in UCR water to develop water effect ratios (WERs) and assess relative bioavailability. A second set of experiments investigated whether exposure to water downstream of the metal smelter in Trail, BC affected survival or growth of white sturgeon. Mobile laboratories were situated riverside upstream and downstream of the smelter and the effects of potential contaminants within UCR water to early life stage white sturgeon were investigated under chronic exposure conditions. The third set of experiments involved characterizing UCR sediment toxicity and potential effects to sturgeon. Results from this research indicate that early life stage white sturgeon are relatively sensitive to copper, cadmium, lead, and zinc in comparison to other fishes. Sturgeon were particularly sensitive to copper, especially during early life stage development when larvae are transitioning to exogenous food. Thresholds for effects of copper on early life stage white sturgeon (LC 50 ’s ranged between 9 and 22 μg/L) bracket water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic life (7. 9 μg/L ± 1. 5). This result indicated that white sturgeon in the UCR might not be adequately protected. Environmentally relevant concentrations of metals, such as copper, found in water, sediment, or waters associated with sediment of the UCR, including pore water and overlying water, may approach or exceed water quality criteria and lethal concentration (LC) values for sturgeon. Results from the risk assessment portion of this project, however, indicated that contaminants in the water column downstream of the metal smelter at Trail did not likely affect survival of white sturgeon. Dilution of Teck effluent in the river is such that, at the major spawning site where early life stages of sturgeon are likely to be present and where the riverside experiments from the present project were conducted, there would be no toxicity expected. Contaminants associated with sediments in the UCR and their impact on survival of sturgeon is also of concern as early life stages inhabit benthic habitats, on surface sediments, or in interstitial space between stones. Analytical results from this project did indicate that UCR sediment downstream of the smelter facility were significantly greater (p < 0. 01) in concentrations of trace-elements, such as copper, lead, cadmium, and zinc, relative to reference sites. However, survival of white sturgeon was not adversely affected following exposure to UCR sediments. This project provided valuable information to help assess potential causes for poor recruitment of white sturgeon in the Columbia River. Advancements were made in characterizing the effects of metals to white sturgeon. In particular, life stage-specific sensitivities were identified that could {{have a significant impact on}} current risk assessment approaches and the derivation of protective water quality standards. There are several hypotheses as to why the number of white sturgeon have been decreasing in the UCR over the last few decades, but as of yet, no definitive cause for poor recruitment has been identified. As more research is conducted, possible causes for recruitment failure can be eliminated. Based on results from this project, metals in the UCR do not appear to be contributing directly to decreased survival of early life stage sturgeon...|$|E

The cortisol, testosterone, and 17 b-estradiol of maternal origin found in unfertilized eggs of white sturgeon probably regulate both growth and development of the embryo.

During the late stages of embryo development and immediately after hatching, endogenous production of cortisol and sexual steroids, respectively, occurred.

Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in oceanic surface waters, and include tiny crustaceans, and fish <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry</b> (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are filter feeders, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.|$|R
40|$|Convict {{cichlids}} (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum) form monogamous pair {{bonds and}} have cooperative biparental {{care of their}} eggs, <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry</b> {{for up to six}} weeks. This fish is widely used in laboratory studies as a model of biparental care. However, very little is known of its habits in its natural habitat. I studied four natural populations of convict cichlids, in 2 ̆ 7 pool 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 stream 2 ̆ 7 habitat, in Costa Rica during the long dry season, December to June in 1990 and 1991. The number of pairs guarding broods increased from December to a peak in mid-March, then rapidly declined. Twenty-eight percent of 175 males bred more than once per season (range 1 - 4), often in the same territory. Females generally bred only once per season (range 1 - 2); only 5...|$|R

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} components of macrozoobenthos was investigated on six fish farms with 8 - 10 ha- 1 each at "Donji Miholjac". The ponds were stocked with 200, 000 individuals per ha! of three-day-old carp <b>larvae.</b> The <b>fry</b> were fed with animal protein throughout the culturing season. The qualitative and quabtitative macrozoobenthos components formed mainly due to systematic groups of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. The average size of Oligohaeta varied in each pond from 119 to 944 individuals per m- 2 and from 2. 18 to 14. 09 g per m- 2, and the larvae of Chironomidae from 174 to 1086 ind. per m- 2 and from 2. 66 to 14. 09 g per m- 2. Variation s {{of the total}} macrozoobenthos was within the amplitude of from 28 to 5805 ind. per m- 2 and from 0. 11 to 73. 72 g. per m- 2. In mid summer {{it was determined that}} there was a fall in the amount of macrozoobenthos in all fish ponds (Table 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} bacteriological studies {{were carried out}} on vendace <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry,</b> in tank water in the course of fish rearing, and in fish feeds. Quantitative studies comprised bacteria indicatory of water pollution and sanitary state. Qualitative analyses paid attention to bacteria belonging to the different genera and to the family Enterobacteriaceae. The highest number of bacteria was observed for the groups of psychrophilic (TVC 20 °C- total viable count of psychrophilic bacteria on broth-agar after 72 h incubation in 20 °C), mesophilic (TVC 37 °C- total viable count of mesophilic bacteria on broth-agar after 24 h incubation in 37 °C), proteolytic and ammonifying microorganisms. Qualitative studies were used to reveal that bacteria from the genera Aeromonas and Flavobacterium, and from the family Enterobacteriaceae were present in fish, while tank water contained bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Flavobac-terium, and fish feed- those from the genera Aeromonas, Pseudomonas and Bacillus...|$|R
40|$|Contribution No. 111 of the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC. Effects of {{thyroxine}} (T 4) (0. 1 ppm; 0. 3 ppm; 0. 5 ppm) on Sarotherodon niloticus L. {{yolk sac}} larvae were studied after 4 weeks of treatment from hatching. T 4 at 0. 5 ppm accelerated yolk resorption {{but did not}} significantly increase growth after {{the first week of}} treatment. Increase in length and in weight among fry treated with T 4 at 0. 1 ppm and 0. 3 ppm was significant after the fourth week. T 4 at 0. 1 ppm increased significantly the length of the pectoral fin; but at 0. 3 ppm and 0. 5 ppm caused abnormal shapes in the pectoral fins as well as lordosis and scoliosis. T 4 reduced pigmentation in treated yolk sac larvae for 3 days only and caused thickening of the epidermis in both treated yolk sac <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry.</b> Thyroid follicles were absent in the yolk sac larvae but present in the fry...|$|R
40|$|This {{monograph}} provides {{updated information}} on diseases of marine and brackishwater cultured milkfish in the Philippines. The information presented here is {{largely based on}} the results of a three-year research project on milkfish at the University of the Philippines Visayas funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). The project involved surveillance and monitoring of hatchery, nursery and grow-out operations for occurrence of diseases as well as on disease diagnosis, prevention and control. Previously documented reports in the Philippines and in other documents, both published and unpublished, are also included in this monograph. The diseases are discussed on a culture phase basis, that is, disease problems encountered in hatchery-reared <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry</b> are listed first, followed by diseases observed in fingerlings and juveniles grown in nursery and grow-out culture areas, and adult stages maintained in broodstock facilities. Information regarding the causative agent, diagnostic procedures, and methods of prevention and control for each disease are provided, if available...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} localization of IGF-I, IGF-II and MSTN proteins {{was investigated}} during ontogenesis of triploid sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) by an immunohistochemical approach. The results {{were compared with}} those observed in diploids. IGF-I immunostaining was mainly observed in skin, skeletal muscle, intestine and gills of both diploids and triploids. From day 30 of larval life, IGF-I immunoreactivity observed in skeletal muscle, intestine, gills and kidney was stronger in triploids than in diploids. At day 30, triploids exhibited a standard length {{significantly higher than the}} one of diploids. Although IGF-II and MSTN immunoreactivity was detectable in different tissues and organs, no differences between diploids and triploids were observed. The spatial localization of IGF-I, IGF-II and MSTN proteins detected in this study is in agreement with previous findings on the distribution of these proteins in diploid <b>larvae</b> and <b>fry.</b> The highest IGF-I immunoreactivity observed in triploids suggests a possible involvement of ploidy in their growth performance...|$|R
5000|$|Sac fry or alevin - The {{life cycle}} of salmon begins and usually ends in the backwaters of streams and rivers. These are the salmon {{spawning}} grounds, where salmon eggs are deposited for safety in the gravel. The salmon spawning grounds are also the salmon nurseries, providing a more protected environment than the ocean usually offers. After 2 to 6 months the eggs hatch into tiny <b>larvae</b> called sac <b>fry</b> or alevin. The alevin have a sac containing {{the remainder of the}} yolk, and they stay hidden in the gravel for a few days while they feed on the yolk.|$|R
