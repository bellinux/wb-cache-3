40|$|Courts and {{commentators}} have {{struggled with the}} problem of cabining digital searches while still allowing law enforcement sufficient latitude to be efficient and effective. This Note examines current proposals, such as requiring search protocols or abandoning the plain view doctrine, before proposing a solution of its own: revisiting the constitutional requirement of particularity in the warrant. Focusing on particularity is not new; the problem is describing, ex ante, where to search within a corpus of seized data. The <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>files</b> and folders is both inadequate and incoherent for this task, but in rejecting it, courts have largely given up on particularly describing where in the data to search. Data is information, and information has meaning—semantics. Computers are increasingly able to sort and segregate data according to the human meaning it represents. Accordingly, magistrate judges can describe, ex ante in natural <b>language,</b> the type <b>of</b> data that examiners may search based on the evidence sought. Forensic examiners can then use automated tools to retrieve information responsive to that semantic description without searching the entirety of the data. Thus, the privacy of suspects, guilty and innocent, can be protected without giving up the plain view doctrine or compromising effective law enforcement...|$|R

40|$|Most {{web service}} {{discovery}} systems use keyword-based search algorithms and, although partially successful, sometimes fail to satisfy some users information needs. This {{has given rise}} to several semantics-based approaches that look to go beyond simple attribute matching and try to capture the semantics of services.

A study of four recent Irish plays, all produced by "regional" theatre companies, suggests that contemporary Irish theatre is dominated by two impulses, both of which arise from globalisation but which tend towards opposite outcomes : theatre companies are attempting to respond to globalisation by producing theatre with a regionalized perspective, works that may nonetheless travel freely across national and international bounders.

40|$|Abstract. We propose multi-language synchronization, a novel {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} migrating code from a legacy language (such as C) to a new language. We maintain two parallel versions <b>of</b> every source <b>file,</b> one in the legacy language, and one in the new <b>language.</b> Both <b>of</b> these <b>files</b> are fully editable, and the two files are kept automatically in sync so that they have the same semantic meaning and, where possible, have the same comments and layout. We propose non-deterministic language translation as a means to implement multi-language synchronization. If a file is modified in language A, we produce a new version in language B by translating the file into a non-deterministic description of many ways that it could be encoded in language B and then choosing the version that is closest to the old file in language B. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we have implemented a translator that can synchronize files written in a straw-man language, Jekyll, with files written in C. Jekyll is a high level functional programming language that has many of the features found in modern programming languages. ...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, by {{examining}} the interactions between ordinary people and legal procedures, this work carefully analyzes the whole case-filing procedure and finds that contradictions exist between systematic legal logics and living logics, {{as well as between}} legal practice and daily actions. “The detachment between the system and living world” mentioned by Habermas (1984 : 196) has new interpretations {{from the perspective of the}} case-filing procedure. For instance, although courts are regarded as places for justice that follow facts and rules, rules in courts are based on legal items that demand a strict corresponding relationship between evidence and legal items. The rules for ordinary people are more general: they have apparent local characteristics and are less strict in the corresponding relationship. Laws are based on legal rules, while rules of the ordinary people refer to only ethics of justice. They have different domains. Also, for the goal of resolving a dispute, although both laws and ethics pursue justice, the court’s goal is to achieve justice {{by examining}} detailed events and objects, while the goal of ordinary people is to achieve a synthetic and continuous justice that is a combination and balance of ethics, rules and laws (Wang and Wang 2012). Also, in the legal <b>language</b> <b>of</b> case <b>filing,</b> courts use normative, neutral, and straightforward legal language, whereas ordinary people use living language that is irregular, strongly emotional, general, and filled with moral judgment. Research on these contents as a part of the lawsuit procedure should be extended and deepened in the future.|$|R

This paper {{describes}} {{a tool for}} extracting multi-word number expressions, calculating their numerical values, and then generating them into another language, thus translating the expressions in that language. It {{is based on the}} fact that such expressions in many languages follow a simple recursive pattern. By changing the <b>language</b> configuration <b>files</b> <b>of</b> our tool, extraction and translation can be done for all the languages which use this pattern. We present the results of testing this tool on seven languages and twenty four language pairs. During testing, the analysis part (finding the numerical value) worked correctly for all the languages for which testing was done. Generation worked correctly for five languages but requires some modification for two languages due to the fact that word forms in languages like Telugu depend on the context. We also discuss some issues which remain and suggest solutions for some of these issues...|$|R
30|$|The {{autonomic}} configuration {{is in fact}} {{defined in}} application projects. It means every project has its own rules and reactions. In this perspective, the project structure is enriched with a new directory, called autonomic. The autonomic directory expects two kinds <b>of</b> <b>files.</b> Measures files include a set of measures to perform by the agent. Such a file {{is associated with a}} given component in the graph. Hence, we can consider the autonomic rules as an annotation on a component in the graph. Rules files define the actions to undertake by the DM when a measure has reached a given limit or a particular condition has met. Such a file is associated with the whole application. Both types <b>of</b> <b>files</b> consume a part <b>of</b> the DSL <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the platform.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to find a formal notation for finding various data relations in heterogenous tables. For the purpose, a <b>language</b> for description <b>of</b> log <b>file</b> structure and semantic has been developed along with a model <b>of</b> generic log <b>file</b> analysis (the GLAM model). The proposed method is represented by a <b>language</b> <b>of</b> analysis and supporting framework that allows efficient processing <b>of</b> log <b>files</b> at a high level of abstraction and with considerable amount of flexibility. The structure <b>of</b> a log <b>file</b> is provided by extra external information called metadata, that describes both syntax and semantics.
