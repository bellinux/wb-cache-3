5000|$|Deadlocking <b>latchbolt</b> (deadlatch) is an {{elaboration}} on the <b>latchbolt</b> {{which includes}} a guardbolt to prevent “shimming” or “jimmying” of the latch bolt. When the door is closed, the <b>latchbolt</b> and guardbolt are retracted together, and the door closes normally, with the <b>latchbolt</b> entering the strike plate. The strike plate, however, holds the guardbolt in its depressed position: a mechanism within the lockset holds the <b>latchbolt</b> in the projected position. This arrangement prevents the <b>latchbolt</b> from being depressed {{through the use of}} a credit card or some other tool, which would lead to unauthorized entry.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Latchbolt</b> : The <b>latchbolt</b> is spring-loaded, {{allowing}} {{the door to}} be closed without first retracting the bolt. In addition, the bolt may be fitted with a guardbolt, which is arranged to prevent the unwanted retraction of the <b>latchbolt</b> by an intruder; {{in this case the}} <b>latchbolt</b> is called a deadlocking <b>latchbolt.</b> There may be a provision on the inside handle to disable (lock) the outside handle from operating the latchbolt; this is referred to in the table below as the [...] "inside locking mechanism". This mechanism may consist of a push button or turn button in the inside handle.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Latchbolt</b> or Latch bolt An {{extremely}} common latch type, typically {{part of a}} lockset, it is a spring-loaded bolt with an angled edge. When {{the door}} is pushed closed, the angled edge of the <b>latchbolt</b> engages with {{the lip of the}} strike plate; a spring allows the bolt to retract. Once the door is fully closed, the bolt automatically extends into the strike plate, holding the door closed. The <b>latchbolt</b> is disengaged (retracted) typically when the user turns the door handle, which via the lockset's mechanism, manually retracts the <b>latchbolt,</b> allowing the door to open.|$|E
5000|$|Deadbolt - Deadbolts usually extend {{deeper into}} the frame and are not {{automatically}} retractable the way <b>latchbolts</b> are. They are typically manipulated with a lock {{on the outside and}} either a lock or a latch on the inside. Deadbolts are generally used for security purposes on external doors in case somebody tries to kick the door in or use a tool such as a crowbar or a hammer and screwdriver etc.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Latchbolt</b> - A bolt {{that has}} an angled surface which acts as a ramp to push the bolt in while the door is being closed. By {{the use of a}} <b>latchbolt,</b> a door can be closed without having to operate the handle.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>latchbolt</b> may be {{specified}} as the deadlocking type; if so, {{the fact}} is explicitly stated.|$|E

5000|$|Strike plate - A {{plate with}} a hole in the middle made to receive a bolt. If the strike is for a <b>latchbolt,</b> it {{typically}} also includes a small ramped area to help the bolt move inward while the door is being closed. (Also known as just [...] "strike") It's also available as electric strike which allows you to open the door even though the mechanical lock is locked.|$|E
50|$|A lockset (alternatively lock set) is the {{hardware}} and components {{that make up}} the locking or latching mechanism that can usually be found on a door or other hinged object but can also include sliding doors and dividers.The components of a lockset can include (but are not limited to) the door handles (commonly both inside and outside), <b>latchbolt,</b> dead bolt, face plate, strike plate, escutcheon, thumbturn, push button, turn button, and other trim. The lockset and associated hardware typically defines a door's function and how a user could (or could not) access the two adjacent spaces defined by the opening associated with the lockset.|$|E
