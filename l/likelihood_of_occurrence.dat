25|$|A hazard is any {{agent or}} {{situation}} that poses {{a level of}} threat to life, health, property, or environment. Most hazards remain dormant or potential, with only a theoretical risk of harm, and when a hazard becomes active, and produces undesirable consequences, it is called an incident and may culminate in an emergency or accident. Hazard and vulnerability interact with <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> to create risk, which can be {{the probability of a}} specific undesirable consequence of a specific hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of a specific activity. A hazard that is understood and acknowledged may present a lower risk if appropriate precautions are taken, and the consequences may be less severe if mitigation procedures are planned and in place.|$|E

Geometric and crystallographic observations from two orthogonal sections through a polycrystal using automated Electron Back-Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) were used as an input to the computer simulations to create a statistically representative threedimensional model. The microstructure is generated using a voxel-based tessellation technique. Assignment of orientations to the grains is controlled to ensure that both texture and nearest neighbor relationships match the observed distributions. The microstructures thus obtained are allowed to evolve using a Monte-Carlo simulation. Anisotropic grain boundary properties {{are used in the}} simulations.
