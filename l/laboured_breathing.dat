60|$|I {{went downstairs}} {{and carried the}} dog upstair in my arms. It's <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing</b> and glazing eye showed {{that it was not}} far from its end.

60|$|She sat in {{the dusk}} after Flossie had gone; and the <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing</b> of the tired city came to her through the open window. She had rather fancied that martyr's crown. It had not looked so very heavy, the thorns not so very alarming--as seen through the window. She would wear it bravely. It would rather become her.|$|E
60|$|To that cabin {{below the}} whole company {{repaired}} in all speed in the surgeon's wake, Sir Oliver coming last between his guards. They assembled about the couch where Lionel lay, leaden-hued of face, his <b>breathing</b> <b>laboured,</b> his eyes dull and glazing.|$|R
60|$|At {{first they}} had a {{carriage}} to themselves. They sat opposite each other with averted faces, looking out of the windows and watching the houses, the downs dead asleep in the sun, the embankments of the railway with exhausted hot flowers go slowly past out of their reach. They {{felt as if they}} were being dragged away like criminals. Unable to speak or think, they stared out of the windows, Helena struggling in vain to keep back her tears, Siegmund <b>labouring</b> to <b>breathe</b> normally.|$|R
60|$|Speechless, livid of face, {{his mouth}} {{distorted}} and his <b>breathing</b> <b>laboured,</b> Don Miguel de Espinosa received {{the irony of}} that man to whom he attributed his ruin and more beside.

60|$|She {{had opened}} the door so softly, that she took them both by surprise. To Carmina's excited imagination, she glided into their {{presence}} like a ghost. Her look and manner showed serious agitation, desperately suppressed. In certain places, the paint and powder on her face had cracked, and revealed the furrows and wrinkles beneath. Her hard eyes glittered; her <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing</b> was audible.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor devil! He has {{had much}} to embitter him,' he murmured, and {{straightway}} fainted again. As I knelt over him, marking the lad's white face and <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing,</b> and bethought me of his simple, kindly nature and of the affection which I had done so little to deserve, I am not ashamed to say, my dears, albeit I am a man somewhat backward in my emotions, that my tears were mingled with his blood.|$|E

40|$|Animal {{infection}} and disease Swine influenza (SI) is an acute viral {{infection of the}} respiratory tract in pigs. Sub-clinical infections are also common. The mortality is low and recovery usually occurs within 7 - 10 days [1]. A typical swine flu outbreak {{is characterized by a}} rapid onset of high fever, dullness, loss of appetite, <b>laboured</b> abdominal <b>breathing</b> and coughing but there can also be inapparent outbreaks [1]. In Europe, infection is common in many countries [2] {{but it is not a}} notifiable disease in the European Union (hence there are no routine EU data available). Influenza viruses in pigs have been detected for many years and circulating subtypes include H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2, H 1 N 2 and H 2 N 3 [3]. There have been more studies of the infection in North America of late than in Europe but the origin and nature of swine-like influenza viruses differ somewhat between Europe and the United States [1]. Swine origin influenza viruses also occur in wild birds, poultry, horses and humans, but interspecies transmission is considered a rare event [3]. ...|$|R
40|$|Heat stress {{occurs when}} animals {{are exposed to}} {{environmental}} temperatures in excess of 25 °C (the upper critical temperature), particularly in combination with high relative humidity or sunshine. High humidity makes the sweating mechanism relatively ineffective, thereby making cattle unable to maintain their core body temperature. Affected cows attempt to reduce heat load by reducing exercise, feed intake and lactation. They actively seek shade and wet areas. As their body temperature rises animals become agitated and distressed, have <b>laboured</b> open-mouth <b>breathing</b> and eventually collapse, convulse and die. Heat stress that is not life-threatening leads to reduced milk production and impaired reproductive performance, and may predispose amongst others to subclinical acidosis. Treatment of severely affected animals is by cooling with cold water and/or fans. Prevention is by providing good-quality drinking water and shade (natural or artificial), {{and the use of}} water sprinklers and/or fans. Changes to the diet (i. e. high energy density and low protein) are also beneficial and often implemented. However, there may be some potential risks associated with the nutritional management of heat stress in dairy cattle; i. e. the animals are at increased risk of developing subacute rumen acidosis, with ensuing laminitis/lameness, and displaced abomasum. The first part of this paper provides a brief review of heat stress in dairy cattle. The second part discusses how increasing the energy density of the diet (i. e. increasing the grain/forage ratio), as part of the nutritional management of heat stress, may put the cows at greater risk of the above mentioned digestive disorders...|$|R

60|$|The blinds {{were drawn}} {{down and the}} chamber was very dark. A pungent whiff of {{disinfectants}} issued from it, mingled with the dank, heavy smell of disease. The bed was in a far corner. Without seeing him, Girdlestone could hear the fast <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing</b> of the invalid. A trimly dressed nurse who had been sitting by the bedside rose, and, recognizing the visitor, whispered {{a few words to}} him and left the room. He pulled the cord of the Venetian blind so as to admit a few rays of daylight. The great chamber looked dreary and bare, as carpet and hangings had been removed to lessen the chance of future infection. John Girdlestone stepped softly across to the bedside and sat down by his dying friend.|$|E

There was something furtive in this movement, but directly afterwards his bearing changed. His <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing</b> gave him a resemblance to a man who had just run a desperate race; but a curious air of detachment, of sudden and profound indifference, replaced the strain of the striving effort.

60|$|The {{words were}} no sooner {{out of her}} mouth than she heard Arthur fling himself upon the intruder. She knew at once, with the {{certainty}} of an intuition, that it was Haddo. But how had he come in? What did he want? She tried to cry out, but no sound came from her throat. Dr Porhoët seemed bound to his chair. He did not move. He made no sound. She knew that an awful struggle was proceeding. It was a struggle to the death between two men who hated one another, but the most terrible part of it was that nothing was heard. They were perfectly noiseless. She tried to do something, but she could not stir. And Arthur's heart exulted, for his enemy was in his grasp, under his hands, and he would not let him go while life was in him. He clenched his teeth and tightened his straining muscles. Susie heard his <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing,</b> but she only heard the breathing of one man. She wondered in abject terror what that could mean. They struggled silently, hand to hand, and Arthur knew that his strength was greater. He had made up his mind what to do and directed all his energy to a definite end. His enemy was extraordinarily powerful, but Arthur appeared to create some strength from the sheer force of his will. It seemed for hours that they struggled. He could not bear him down.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course it}} is hard for me now to say how much I saw at that time, because my {{impressions}} were corrected by subsequent observation. First of all impressions was its enormous size; the girth of its body was some fourscore feet, its length perhaps two hundred. Its sides rose and fell with its <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing.</b> I perceived that its gigantic, flabby body lay along the ground, and that its skin was of a corrugated white, dappling into blackness along the backbone. But of its feet we saw nothing. I think also that we saw then the profile at least of the almost brainless head, with its fat-encumbered neck, its slobbering omnivorous mouth, its little nostrils, and tight shut eyes. (For the mooncalf invariably shuts its eyes {{in the presence of the}} sun.) We had a glimpse of a vast red pit as it opened its mouth to bleat and bellow again; we had a breath from the pit, and then the monster heeled over like a ship, dragged forward along the ground, creasing all its leathery skin, rolled again, and so wallowed past us, smashing a path amidst the scrub, and was speedily hidden from our eyes by the dense interlacings beyond. Another appeared more distantly, and then another, and then, as though he was guiding these animated lumps of provender to their pasture, a Selenite came momentarily into ken. My grip upon Cavor's foot became convulsive at the sight of him, and we remained motionless and peering long after he had passed out of our range.|$|E
60|$|With rapid, but {{noiseless}} steps, she sped {{down the}} stairs. The hall was empty. She knelt {{down upon the}} hearth with breathless eagerness; the tongue of the iron dog was unscrewed, and the spring clicked in another instant; then a trembling passing of the fingers {{at the back of}} the mantel piece; in a few moments she felt the projecting nob, and the door swung round on its hinges beside her. Taking up her candle, she flew up the narrow steps; she had no fear now of interruption from below, for no one passing through the hall would notice that open door in the fireplace. Up the first flight, into the secret chamber, and then up again. She knelt down upon the third step, and then looked at the wall by the step above her. The slight projection was visible, she pressed it, and the step rolled back, and disclosed a sort of receptacle, the width of the stair, and about a foot deep, filled with papers. She turned these over, her breath held, her hands trembling with excitement, her eyes staring and wild. The first three or four which she threw out were leases and deeds; the next that she came to was a bulky packet endorsed upon its back--The last Will and Testament of Herbert Harmer. Sophy seized it with a short sharp cry of delight, and then hurried down into the hall again. She closed the iron door behind her; blew out the candle, placed it on the table; and then opened the hall door, and without hat or covering on her head she flew down the drive at the top of her speed. She had it then at last, after all these years; it was hers, hers and her boy's! and Sophy with the greatest difficulty repressed the wild cries of delight which rose to her lips. Once past the lodge she kept on at her full speed towards the village, but when she reached the top of the hill she paused to listen. Below her she could see the bright lamps of an approaching vehicle, and in the still night air could hear the noise of a vehicle coming up the hill, and a man's voice urging the horse to his best speed. So she was only just in time. Father Eustace had returned. She hid herself behind a hedge, and as they came along, she could tell by the <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing</b> of the horse how fast he had been driven, and she could even catch what the men, who were walking up the hill to relieve it, were saying. The first voice she heard was that of the priest.|$|E
6000|$|From the garrulous old man I {{learned the}} melancholy {{end of my}} former acquaintances. Soon after I left town, he told me, C had been taken ill. It seems that A and B had been rowing on the river for a wager, and C had been running on the bank and then sat in a draught. Of course the bank had refused the draught and C was taken ill. A and B came home and found C lying {{helpless}} in bed. A shook him roughly and said, [...] "Get up, C, we're going to pile wood." [...] C looked so worn and pitiful that B said, [...] "Look here, A, I won't stand this, he isn't fit to pile wood to-night." [...] C smiled feebly and said, [...] "Perhaps I might pile a little if I sat up in bed." [...] Then B, thoroughly alarmed, said, [...] "See here, A, I'm going to fetch a doctor; he's dying." [...] A flared up and answered, [...] "You've no money to fetch a doctor." [...] "I'll reduce him to his lowest terms," [...] B said firmly, [...] "that'll fetch him." [...] C's life might even then have been saved but {{they made a mistake}} about the medicine. It stood {{at the head of the}} bed on a bracket, and the nurse accidentally removed it from the bracket without changing the sign. After the fatal blunder C seems to have sunk rapidly. On the evening of the next day, as the shadows deepened in the little room, it was clear to all that the end was near. I think that even A was affected at the last as he stood with bowed head, aimlessly offering to bet with the doctor on C's <b>laboured</b> <b>breathing.</b> [...] "A," [...] whispered C, [...] "I think I'm going fast." [...] "How fast do you think you'll go, old man?" [...] murmured A. [...] "I don't know," [...] said C, [...] "but I'm going at any rate."--The end came soon after that. C rallied for a moment and asked for a certain piece of work that he had left downstairs. A put it in his arms and he expired. As his soul sped heavenward A watched its flight with melancholy admiration. B burst into a passionate flood of tears and sobbed, [...] "Put away his little cistern and the rowing clothes he used to wear, I feel as if I could hardly ever dig again."--The funeral was plain and unostentatious. It differed in nothing from the ordinary, except that out of deference to sporting men and mathematicians, A engaged two hearses. Both vehicles started at the same time, B driving the one which bore the sable parallelopiped containing the last remains of his ill-fated friend. A on the box of the empty hearse generously consented to a handicap of a hundred yards, but arrived first at the cemetery by driving four times as fast as B. (Find the distance to the cemetery.) As the sarcophagus was lowered, the grave was surrounded by the broken figures of the first book of Euclid.--It was noticed that after the death of C, A became a changed man. He lost interest in racing with B, and dug but languidly. He finally gave up his work and settled down to live on the interest of his bets.--B never recovered from the shock of C's death; his grief preyed upon his intellect and it became deranged. He grew moody and spoke only in monosyllables. His disease became rapidly aggravated, and he presently spoke only in words whose spelling was regular and which presented no difficulty to the beginner. Realizing his precarious condition he voluntarily submitted to be incarcerated in an asylum, where he abjured mathematics and devoted himself to writing the History of the Swiss Family Robinson in words of one syllable.|$|E
