The BMW Motorrad Duolever front wheel suspension is not influenced by negative forces {{in the same manner}} as a conventional telefork whose fixed and take-off tubes twist laterally as well as longitudinally during jounce/rebound and steering. Its two trailing links absorb the forces resulting from the jounce/rebound and keep the wheel carrier stable. Thus, any torsioning is excluded and the front wheel suspension is very precise. The steering commands of the rider are converted directly and the feedback from the front wheel is transparent in all driving conditions.A kinematical anti-dive effect is additionally achieved, just as for the Telelever, due to the arrangement of the trailing <b>link</b> <b>bearings.</b> While a conventional telefork during strong braking manoeuvres jounces heavily or locks, the Duolever still has sufficient spring travel remaining in this situation and therefore the rider can still brake into the corner extremely late yet directionally stable.|$|R

They usually consist of a spherical bearing with the inner and outer elements separated by a composite glass fibre / PTFE resin-bonded textile liner. Previous work found that the wear of typical composite liners has three distinct phases – initial wear in, steady-state wear phase, final wear-out, and that humidity and environmental temperature can have a strong influence. Typical bearing-scale tests are long duration, and so a method of accounting for environmental factors and allowing the rapid screening of materials and test conditions is described here as an aid to technology development...|$|R

The dissertation presents three conceptual designs of a mechanical manipulator, based on specifications required for refurbishing of moulds and dies. Kinematics and mechanical requirements were derived from manufacturing processes and the recommended repair solutions (i. e. steps/operations) required for the specific defect. These requirements resulted in translating customer requirements into engineering/technical characteristics using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) techniques, specifically House of Quality (HoQ). This {{was followed by the}} concept design phase, which consisted of the use of the following techniques: Product Function Decomposition and the Morphological Matrix. A comparison study was performed on the conceptual designs, employing kinematic analysis and workspace analysis. The Pugh's Method was used as the concept-selection techniques to aid in selecting the most suitable RPKMT concept. It was for this concept that a model of the design was developed.

The time-domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings are processed for feature extraction. Both linear and non-linear features are extracted using Multi-Scale Fractal Dimension (MFD), Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients and kurtosis. The extracted features are then used to classify faults using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and hidden Markov Models (HMM).

This paper presents a methodology for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and wavelet packet transform (WPT). In order to obtain the useful information from raw data,db 02 and db 08 wavelets were adopted to decompose the vibration signal acquired from the bearing. Further Denoising technique based on wavelet analysis was applied. This de-noised signal was decomposed up to 7 th level by wavelet packet transform (WPT) and 128 wavelet packet node energy coefficients were obtained and analyzed using db 04 wavelet. The results show that wavelet packet node energy coefficients {{are sensitive to the}} faults in the bearing. The feasibility of the wavelet packet node energy coefficients for fault identification as an index representing the health condition of a bearing is established through this study.

We have shown that a simple five-bar linkage {{can be used as}} a load-sensitive continuously variable transmission (CVT) for a finger joint. The maximum fingertip force of our previous finger was limited by the mechanical strength of its <b>links</b> and <b>bearings,</b> not by the power of its DC motor. If the machine strength can be improved, a much greater fingertip force can be expected. To design a lightweight CVT with sufficient mechanical strength, we analyze the internal force of the CVT and select light plain bearings. We also analyze the stress by using the finite element method and select the materials of its links. Experimental results verify that the maximum fingertip force is more than 100 N near the singular configuration of the CVT and the maximum angular velocity is more than 550 deg/s. These motions are impossible without the CVT. We also developed a very light shape memory alloy brake of 0. 56 g. The CVT with the brake can hold a fingertip force of more than 100 N not only near the singular configuration. The electric energy consumed by the brake is much less than that by the DC motor.
