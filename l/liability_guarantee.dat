40|$|Bank <b>liability</b> <b>guarantee</b> schemes have {{traditionally}} been viewed as costless measures to shore up investor confidence and prevent bank runs. However, as the experiences of some European countries, most notably Ireland, have demonstrated, the credibility and effectiveness of these guarantees are crucially intertwined with the sovereign's funding risks. Employing methods from the literature on global games, we develop a simple model to explore the systemic linkage between the rollover risks of a bank and a government, which are connected through the government's guarantee of bank liabilities. We show the existence and uniqueness of the joint equilibrium and derive its comparative static properties. In solving for the optimal guarantee numerically, we show how its credibility can be improved through policies that promote balance-sheet transparency. We explain the asymmetry in risk transfer between the sovereign and the banking sector, following {{the introduction of a}} guarantee as being attributed to the resolution of strategic uncertainties held by bank depositors and the opacity of the banks' balance sheets...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{theories}} of the policy process typically assume that policy responses tend to go through long periods of stasis alternated with occasional bursts of intense activity. The concept of policy punctuations has been put forward to denote large-scale changes in public policies {{that take place in}} crisis moments. However, research on the dynamics of policy overreaction and underreaction is still in its infancy. It has mostly focused on either small-n cross-sectional analysis of government spending or case studies of single events. A comparative assessment of the extent of disproportionate responses in a crisis is still lacking. To fill this gap, in this paper we develop a framework to conceptualize, operationalize and ultimately assess disproportionate policy responses systematically from a cross-sectional perspective. We create a series of indexes to measure policy over- and underreactions among the EU member states that experienced the 2007 – 8 banking crisis. We found that a large majority of EU countries overreacted through public <b>liability</b> <b>guarantee</b> and budget commitment. On the other hand, regulatory responses are characterized by a greater variation...|$|E

40|$|A popular {{narrative}} amongst European policymakers is that Eurozone members facing {{problems in}} the bond market are {{paying the price for}} past budgetary excess. Fiscal consolidation in these countries is seen as the principal remedy for the crisis. It is clear however that Ireland’s problems derive mainly from a banking bust exacerbated by weaknesses in the design of Europe’s monetary union and the policy response of both the Irish authorities and the European Central Bank. From the Euro’s inception in 1999 up to 2007, both debt and deficit ratios in Ireland were comfortably within the Stability and Growth Pact ceilings. The gross debt ratio was only 25 % of GDP at the end of 2007. The Stability and Growth Pact was the only macroprudential measure in place at Eurozone level, and Irish adherence reflected public finances flattered by a credit-fuelled property bubble. The banks experienced intense liquidity pressures in September 2008 and the Irish government provided a blanket <b>liability</b> <b>guarantee.</b> The banks were in reality badly insolvent, the bank guarantee has cost 40 % of GDP and Ireland was forced from the bond market and into an EU/IMF programme just over two years later. There can be no presumption that it will emerge, and re-enter the bond market, on schedule at the end of 2013. This paper argues that the incomplete design of the currency union, with free capital movement and trans-border banking, but no centralised banking policy, contributed to the Irish debacle. The absence of bank resolution and any centralised system of liability insurance threw the burden of bank rescue on sovereigns. Countries in currency union are vulnerable to sovereign default, since they must borrow in what is, in effect, a foreign currency. Resort to official lenders enjoying seniority, combined with ECB insistence on sovereign repayment of bank senior bondholders, even in banks insolvent many times over, has undermined confidence in Irish sovereign debt. Closer fiscal union may prove necessary if the Eurozone is to survive. To avoid future sovereign debt crises, there is also a need for centralised bank supervision and resolution, as well as for a centralised system of liability insurance for banks. What happened in Ireland shows that sticking to purely fiscal rules is no guarantee of solvency for the sovereign in a currency union with inadequate mechanisms for the prevention and resolution of banking crises...|$|E

The model allows the authors {{to identify}} different notions of contagion, especially the distinction between"monsoonal effects","spillovers", and"switchers between equilibria". They discuss both domestic and international policy options. Domestic policies, they say, should be aimed at reducing financial fragility - that is, reducing unnecessary short-term debt commitments. With explicit commitments, the maturity of external debts should be lengthened. With implicit commitments, such as private <b>liability</b> <b>guarantees,</b> they emphasize limiting or eliminating such guarantees, to improve an economy's international liquidity and reduce its exposure to contagion. Internationally, they stress the need for improving financial standards, which makes it easier to assess when a country is subject to different kinds of contagion. The effectiveness of international rescue packages depends on the kind of contagion to which a country is exposed.

N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) and the E. C. Directive on Certain Aspects of the Sale of Consumer Goods and Associated Guarantees. The {{purpose of this study is}} to ask whether there is any need to introduce a unified liability system into Korean law and how to achieve the system under the existing law in order to overcome all the complexities caused by the separate existence of the general liability for non-performance and the seller's <b>guarantee</b> <b>liability.</b> A further purpose is to investigate how effectively the rules of the seller's liability for non-conforming goods protect the reasonable expectations of the parties; in particular, the interests of consumers and private sellers which are distinguished from those of commercial buyers and business sellers, respectively, and where the issue is not directly related to the particular interests of consumers or private sellers, the common interests of all the parties. The study is conducted by an internal evaluation within the boundaries of law in a legal context and an external evaluation in light of 'efficiency' as used by economists. It shows, first, that Korean law needs a unified liability system which is based on a contract to resolve the problems originating in the distinction between the general liability as a contractual liability and the seller's <b>guarantee</b> <b>liability</b> as a legal liability. Second, achieving a genuine unified liability system require one's interpretation that rescission and damages in the seller's <b>guarantee</b> <b>liability</b> should be as they are in the general liability. This would settle other problems inherent in the casuistic distinction between the general liability as a fault liability and the seller's <b>guarantee</b> <b>liability</b> as no-fault liability and its consequences in interpreting damages under the seller's <b>guarantee</b> <b>liability.</b> Finally, in what aspects of the seller's liability for non-conforming goods each jurisdiction fails to reflect the interests of consumers and private sellers, and the common interests of all the parties...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{liquidity}} risk in capital markets. The main {{aim is to}} help practitioners to better understand and manage liquidity risk by analyzing the following three topics: modeling correlations in a Liquidity Adjusted VaR (L − VaR) (Chapter Three), impact of regulatory interventions on stock liquidity (Chapter Four) and liquidity commonality and option prices (Chapter Five). The first topic focuses on an appropriate way to measure expected stock losses by considering liquidity risk (see Chapter Three). The {{need for a new}} measure, which also includes stock liquidity, is based on the concern of investors only being able to sell stock at a huge discount or not at all. In reaction, various papers with new methodologies have been published, including the liquidity adjusted Value at Risk (L − VaR) models proposed by Bangia et al. (1998) and Ernst et al. (2012). Based on their approach, we analyze different ways to extend these models and to optimize performance. This is done using advanced conditional volatility models like AR − GARCH and AR − GJR models and by considering correlations between spread and return data. The new model is called correlation and liquidity adjusted VaR (CL – VaR) and shows (based on a five-year observation period) better performance compared to the models by Bangia et al. (1998) and Ernst et al. (2012). The models are calculated and back-tested using unique data called Xetra Liquidity Measure (XLM) provided by Deutsche Börse. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 marked the beginning of a financial crisis affecting the entire world of finance. This period is characterized by increasing fear of further defaults by corporations (including banks) or even by countries. In reaction, investors began shifting their assets to more stable and secure investments and this resulted in stock market crashes. Various interventions were made by government institutions to restore stability. The target of the second topic is to analyze the impact of these interventions on liquidity (measured by volume-weighted bid-ask spreads) and market reaction (measured by returns) at the announcement date (see Chapter Four). In the event, we study abnormal changes of stocks listed on the Dax. The interventions which we consider are published by the Federal Reserve Bank (FED) {{in the form of a}} crisis time-line. Here they are further combined to the following categories: bank <b>liability</b> <b>guarantees,</b> liquidity and rescue interventions, unconventional monetary policy and other market intervention. The results show that, for example, the market reacts positively to liquidity and rescue interventions, whereas bank <b>liability</b> <b>guarantees</b> reduce liquidity. In addition, we show that international events have a significant impact on the domestic market in a "spillover effect". By analyzing the spreads of different traded volumes, an asymmetric increase can be detected at the announcement date. The last topic focuses on the link between equity and option markets (see Chapter Five). There we analyze, on one hand, the link between stock market liquidity and option prices and, on the other hand, the impact of liquidity commonality in equity and option markets. We can show that systematic liquidity (rather than idiosyncratic liquidity) gives a better explanation of changes in “at-the-money” implied volatility. This effect was especially strong during the financial crisis in 2008. Another result is that liquidity risk of higher traded stock volumes is not properly reflected in the option price. This can result in higher hedging costs, as mentioned by Certin et al. (2006). To shed more light into liquidity commonality within the stock market we calculate the LiqCom measure as mentioned by Chordia et al. (2000). The results show a continuously changing liquidity commonality which decreases with increasing traded volume. This is because the market maker focuses for bigger stock positions more on the idiosyncratic liquidity risks while for smaller stock positions the systematic liquidity risk is more important. We confirmed our findings with a robustness check...|$|R
