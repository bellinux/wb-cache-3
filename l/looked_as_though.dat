5|$|In 1936 the Belgian, Romain Maes, {{appeared}} to win but judges declared Frenchman Georges Speicher the winner and Maes second. Shouting {{began in the}} stands {{and for a moment}} it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> fighting would start, but calm returned and the result was upheld. A Belgian may not have won but there were seven Belgians in the first ten.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the first}} few months of the 2009 season the Mets and Phillies <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they would make this year into another close playoff race. By the end of May the Mets had won three out of the four games they played against each other; however, the Phillies {{retained}} a half game lead. Both clubs struggled in June as the Phillies slumped and the New York became plagued with injuries. By the end of June the Phillies had increased their division lead, but only to two and a half games.|$|E
5|$|In January 1689, a Convention Parliament {{assembled}} in England {{and declared that}} James had effectively abdicated when he fled, and that the thrones of England and Ireland were therefore vacant. The Parliament or Estates of Scotland took similar action, and William and Mary were declared monarchs of all three realms. The Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 settled the succession. Anne and her descendants were {{to be in the}} line of succession after William and Mary, and they were to be followed by any descendants of William by a future marriage. On 24 July 1689, Anne gave birth to a son, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, who, though ill, survived infancy. As King William and Queen Mary had no children, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Anne's son would eventually inherit the Crown.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, the Russian {{government}} outlined that it {{planned to}} purchase 164 aircraft by 2018. The Ukrainian government in October 2000 {{estimated that the}} country had a requirement for 65 aircraft. By then, the Russian government had awarded the Polyot plant, which was based in Omsk, the right to produce the aircraft, ahead of Aviakor and Aviastar of Samara and Ulyanovsk, respectively. The Kiev Aircraft Production Plant was expected to produce the first aircraft in 2003, and Polyot, in 2004. As the An-70 flight test programme had reached its final stages {{by the end of}} 2000, it was expected that the Russian and Ukraine Defence Ministries would approve of mass production at the start of 2001. On 27 January 2001, however, the second An-70 prototype made a crash landing on its belly after losing power in two engines on take-off during cold weather testing in Omsk, and was severely damaged. Four of the 33 people onboard were injured. It <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the A400M was now going to have the market all to itself. Antonov recovered the crashed aircraft and repaired it, but the project still lacked funding.|$|E
5|$|United again won {{the title}} back in 2002–03, when it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Arsenal would retain it. A late-season {{encounter}} between the teams ended in controversial circumstances after the match officials allowed Thierry Henry's second goal to stand despite the player being offside and Sol Campbell was sent off for an elbow on Ole Gunnar Solskjær in a 2–2 draw. Arsenal had beaten United {{on the way}} to FA Cup success and both teams contested the 2003 FA Community Shield {{at the start of the}} 2003–04 season. In a hotly-contested match, Phil Neville was booked in the first minute for a challenge on Vieira and a minute later, Ashley Cole received a booking for fouling Solskjær. Yellow cards were also given to Quinton Fortune and Paul Scholes for United and Vieira for Arsenal. Substitute Francis Jeffers was shown a straight red for a kick on Phil Neville and, despite originally going unpunished, Campbell was later given a three-match ban by the FA for kicking out at Eric Djemba-Djemba. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and United eventually won the Shield 4–3 on penalties.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Potemkin's {{scheme to}} develop a Russian {{presence}} in the rapidly disintegrating state of Persia failed. Plans for a full-scale invasion had previously been cut back and a small unit sent to establish a trading post there was quickly turned away. Potemkin focused instead on Russia's southern provinces, where he was busy founding cities (including Sevastopol) and creating his own personal kingdom, including his brand new Black Sea Fleet. That kingdom was about to expand: under the Treaty of Kuçuk Kainarji, which had ended the previous Russo-Turkish war, the Crimean Khanate had become independent, though effectively under Russian control. In June 1782 it was descending again into anarchy. By July 1783, Potemkin had engineered the peaceful annexation of the Crimea and Kuban, capitalizing {{on the fact that}} Britain and France were fighting elsewhere. The Kingdom of Georgia accepted Russian protection a few days later with the Treaty of Georgievsk searching for protection against Persia's aim to reestablish its suzerainty over Georgia; the Karabakh Khanate of Persia initially <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it might also, but eventually declined Russian help. Exhausted, Potemkin collapsed into a fever he barely survived. Catherine rewarded him with one hundred thousand roubles, which he used to construct the Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg.|$|E

5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E
25|$|For {{a couple}} of years in the late 1940s, Tremlett <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he might be the answer to some of England's post-war cricketing woes. A tall, curly-haired all-rounder, Tremlett had a whippy fast-medium bowling action that moved the ball off the pitch and was a pugnacious {{right-handed}} batsman, strong at driving.|$|E
25|$|To obtain {{money he}} seized church lands and property, {{and used the}} funds to pay his soldiers. The same Charles who had secured {{the support of the}} ecclesia by {{donating}} land, seized some of it back between 724 and 732. For a time, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Charles might even be excommunicated for his actions. But then came a significant invasion.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2014 Delgado had a solo {{exhibition}} entitled Even Less at Howard Griffin Gallery in Shoreditch London. Mr Howard-Griffin explained: “He {{wanted to make}} an exhibition that <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it isn’t there, so {{when you walk in}} it doesn’t <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there is an exhibition, you see nothing, but when you look around at the details you can see there are narratives and stories going on.” ...|$|R

25|$|Then on the Giants' next drive, rookie {{running back}} Ahmad Bradshaw fumbled a Manning {{hand-off}} and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Patriots' linebacker Pierre Woods had recovered {{the ball at}} the Giants' 30. But after the officials picked through the pile, {{it was determined that}} Bradshaw had made the recovery. The Giants maintained possession and wound up punting. New England's next drive ended with consecutive Giants' sacks, the first by linebacker Kawika Mitchell, the second by tackle Justin Tuck.|$|E
25|$|England {{managed to}} push {{on with the}} job of {{restoring}} some pride to their innings {{on the morning of}} the fifth day, thanks largely to the heroics of Jack Russell. From his overnight 47 not out, Russell soon pushed past fifty, and his partner Emburey <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he wasn't going to surrender his wicket easily either. They batted throughout the morning adding to their overnight partnership of 64. Russell looked confident, and it seemed Australia's bowlers were lost for ideas on how to remove the pair. The <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were willing to bat the day out and save the match. They soon took England past Australia's total, and set about building a lead, but with less than a days play remaining, an English victory looked out of the question. Emburey brought up his fifty, his first of the series. The pair looked to be quite comfortable, however soon after they had taken England past 200, Australia finally got the breakthrough they had sought. Alderman produced a brilliant outswinger which cut off the pitch, collecting the top of Emburey's off-stump, clean bowled for a well made 64.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} was a Saturday, and a then world record crowd of 90,800 (and still a record outside India) watched the play. Forty more runs were added by West Indies, with Solomon and Hall {{completing}} a useful ninth wicket partnership of 55. Australia reached 236-3 {{by the end of}} the day's play, with Burge 37 not out and Mackay 16 not out, and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they might establish a substantial lead. Simpson (75) and McDonald (91) put on 146 for the first wicket.|$|E
60|$|It was Miss Marjorie Malyoe, very white, and <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> stunned or {{bewildered by}} all that had befallen her.|$|R

25|$|With 76 overs {{remaining}} in the match, and a target of 371 more-or-less out of the question, England were able to attack, and when Caddick ripped out Boon, Mark Waugh and Border to add to Such's dismissals of the openers, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> an upset was on the cards, with Australia reeling on 115/6 at tea, but Steve Waugh (47* in three hours) and Brendan Julian (56* in just over two hours) provided stout resistance in the final session, and steered Australia {{to the safety of}} a draw.|$|E
25|$|The scoring {{was even}} 14-14 at halftime. The second half began with quarterback Vince Young scoring on the Wolverines with a 60-yard {{touchdown}} run. Michigan held a 10-point {{lead in the}} third quarter. Both teams traded scores and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Michigan would take {{the game with a}} late go-ahead field goal in the fourth quarter. But enough time remained for Texas to win. Driving 47 yards in ten plays, Texas had one final chance. Dusty Mangum's 37-yard field goal wobbled through the uprights as time expired.|$|E
25|$|Just {{weeks after}} Hurricane Katrina, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Houston {{would become the}} target of Hurricane Rita. White mobilized the {{citizens}} of Houston to evacuate. During a series of press conferences, White and Harris County County Judge Robert Eckels instructed Houstonians on when to evacuate. Officials employed a strategy that called for the evacuation of flood prone areas first. This evacuation, however, led to many problems as it caused multi-hour backups on all freeways in Houston. This prompted White to later lead an evacuation plan reform for Houston.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} ODI against South Africa at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua-Barbuda, West Indies {{appeared}} {{well on their}} way to a second consecutive loss. 200–6 in the 41st over, well short of their winning target of 301, Sammy joined Dwayne Bravo at the crease. But six sixes and two fours later, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> West Indies might just win. Sammy had amassed 58 runs, the fifty coming up off just twenty deliveries. It was the fastest fifty ever by a West Indies player, and more importantly, it had brought West Indies within reach of victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1895 and 1896, it {{was clear}} that Lockwood's failure in Australia was due to more than {{different}} conditions: his physical condition was clearly very poor and his weight was far too great for him to sustain first-class cricket. Only on rare occasions (for example, against Gloucestershire at the Oval in 1895) did his bowling have the sting of previous years, and apart from one innings of 158 against Warwickshire, his batting was disappointing. Lockwood was frequently dropped from the Surrey eleven, and after failing in early 1897 he was never recalled and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> has career was over.|$|E
25|$|His most {{significant}} ecumenical achievement as CDF Prefect was the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification {{signed with the}} Lutheran World Federation in 1999. Bishop George Anderson, head of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, publicly acknowledged that it was ‘Ratzinger who untied the knots’ when it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the document would be shipwrecked by officials from the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. Cardinal Ratzinger got the agreement back on track by organising {{a meeting with the}} Lutheran leaders at his brother’s house in Regensburg. Included in this agreement was the notion that the goal of the ecumenical process is unity in diversity, not structural reintegration.|$|E
