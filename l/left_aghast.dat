5|$|The king's {{court and}} the deputies of the National Constituent Assembly were all in {{comfortable}} residence at the royal city of Versailles, where they were considering momentous changes to the French political system. Reformist deputies had managed to pass sweeping legislation {{in the weeks after}} the Bastille's fall, including the revolutionary August Decrees (which formally abolished most noble and clerical privileges) and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Now their attention was turned {{to the creation of a}} permanent constitution. Monarchists and conservatives of all degrees had thus far been unable to resist the surging strength of the reformers, but by September their positions were beginning, however slightly, to improve. In constitutional negotiations they were able to secure a legislative veto power for the king. Many of the reformers were <b>left</b> <b>aghast</b> by this, and further negotiations were hobbled by contentiousness.|$|E
25|$|Yusuf's {{invasion}} of Armenia {{had left the}} kingdom in ruins and this fact resonated among the Armenian princes who were <b>left</b> <b>aghast</b> in witnessing the Arab ostikan's brutality. Gagik I was especially shaken and he soon disavowed his loyalty to Yusuf and began to campaign against him. With Yusuf distracted by the resistance put up by his former ally, Smbat's son Ashot II felt it appropriate to assume his father's throne. Ashot at once began to drive the Muslims out of his domains. Support for Ashot also arrived from the west: the Byzantine empress Zoe had watched the Arab {{invasion of}} Armenia unfold with consternation and so she ordered the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos to write an official letter to the Armenian Catholicos {{to form a new}} alliance with Armenia. The Catholicos responded amicably and in 914, Ashot accepted an invitation by Zoe to visit Constantinople. There, Ashot was well received, and a Byzantine force was created to assist Armenia in defeating the Arabs. The force, accompanying Ashot and led by the Domestic of the Schools Leo Phokas, moved out the next year and marched along Upper Euphrates, entering Taron with scant opposition from the Arabs.|$|E

50|$|Consequently, Englishmen like Thistlewood {{lived in}} an Africanised society that rested on the white control through fear, inequality, and brutality. With almost no {{societal}} restraints, slave owners ruled their slaves {{with a degree of}} violence that <b>left</b> outside observers <b>aghast.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Get out of that, my Lord,' {{said the}} man, {{in a broad}} brogue, and shoving him aside. On which the boy, crying 'Thieves! thieves!' drew out his little hanger, and ran at the man, and would have wounded him (for a small sword will wound {{as well as a}} great one); but his opponent, who was armed with a long stick, struck the weapon luckily out of the lad's hands: it went flying over his head, and <b>left</b> him <b>aghast</b> and mortified at his discomfiture.|$|R
5000|$|Following Charles Kennedy's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} resign {{as leader of the}} Liberal Democrats, Hemming announced on his weblog that he was taking soundings as to whether to stand. When Kennedy subsequently resigned, Hemming said that he would stand to ensure there was a contest. Hemming was a rank outsider in the contest (some betting odds were in excess of 400-1). The Times reported that he was [...] "an eccentric who <b>left</b> colleagues <b>aghast</b> by threatening to stand". On 13 January 2006, Hemming withdrew his candidature, saying that Lib Dem members did not believe he should stand. He was a nominator for Mark Oaten, but said {{he would be willing to}} do the same for any serious candidate. He subsequently declared for the eventual winner, Sir Menzies Campbell.|$|R
50|$|At the trial, Marshall {{is angry}} that Brad, his close friend, turned on him, but decides {{to hold his}} ground {{over the course of}} the hearing. While Marshall does his best to explain his camp's {{position}} on the case (including showing a bird from the lake suffering from acute dermatitis), Brad tries a different approach. He talks while using his muscular frame in several ways to try winning over the all-women jury and even the judge. He also questions a quack doctor and exhibits a video that aims to prove that Frog Lake was safe (mostly footage of him dipping in the water while flexing his body before the camera). However, upon seeing the video, Marshall calls Brad to the witness stand and asks him to unbutton his shirt; the jurors are <b>left</b> <b>aghast</b> at seeing Brad's chest having signs of acute dermatitis as a result of his frolicking in the lake. The judge finds Gruber Pharmaceuticals guilty of the contamination, but only orders that it pay $25,000 in damages instead of the original $25-million claim.|$|E

5000|$|Gerald {{offers to}} take Hester for a walk, leaving the {{remaining}} guests to gossip further about their social lives. Lady Hunstanton and Lady Stutfield {{comment on the}} yet unseen Lord Illingworth's amoral qualities towards women when the man himself enters the terrace. He declines their thanks for his hiring of Gerald Arbuthnot and says that he hired him out of personal interest. Lord Illingworth remains near Mrs. Allonby during the entire exchange until {{the two of them}} leave for the conservatory together, following a discussion of Hester's background and wealthy father. When Illingworth and Mrs. Allonby return, the remaining guests have already moved to have tea in another room. The two characters have a witty conversation involving marriage and women and men until Gerald and Hester enter the room. They have some short small talk, and Lord Illingworth and Mrs. Allonby are again left alone. Their aim of discussion turns toward Hester when Mrs. Allonby reprehends the young American for her casual talk of being eighteen and a Puritan. Lord Illingworth expresses that he rather admires Hester's beauty and actually uses the conversation to assert his flirtations toward Mrs. Allonby, claiming that he has never met a woman so puritanical as Hester that she would resist his advances. After some flirting between the two, a footman enters with a letter from Mrs. Arbuthnot, stating that she will arrive to the party after dinner. Lord Illingworth is <b>left</b> <b>aghast,</b> and when Mrs. Allonby asks who the woman is, he dubs her, [...] "A woman of no importance." ...|$|E
40|$|Henry Clay's easy {{ascent to}} the {{presidency}} here {{is in contrast to}} the serious difficulties experienced by his Democratic opponent James K. Polk. Clay has reached the top of a large pole and has the "Civic Crown" in his grasp. Below him Polk is pushed and prodded by influential supporters Andrew Jackson (left) and Thomas Hart Benton, while John C. Calhoun (far <b>left)</b> watches <b>aghast.</b> Clay: "With ease I reach the goal, when the hearts of my countrymen are with me. " Polk to Jackson, who prods him with his cane in the seat of his pants: "Almighty hero! desist. I beseech you: for this courtesy is more honored in the "breech" than in the observance. " Benton: "His situation Looks rather "pokerish. "" Calhoun: "Ye gods! what a climber this is! The more he is "poked," the more he don't go up!"Drawn by H. Bucholzer.
