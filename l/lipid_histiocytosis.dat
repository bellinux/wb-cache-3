40|$|<b>Lipid</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> of the {{gallbladder}} neck {{lymph node}} is rarely reported nowadays. Two obese patients presented with gallbladder lithiasis detected on CT scan. The treatment consisted in coelioscopic cholecystectomy. Microscopy revealed subacute/chronic lithiasic cholecystitis and foci of vacuolated {{cells in the}} gallbladder neck lymph node. These cells were positive for CD 68, CD 31, S 100 protein, and adipophilin and negative for cytokeratin and Alcian blue. In conclusion, we report lymph node <b>lipid</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> diagnosed microscopically after cholecystectomy. While such lesions may remain unidentified on imaging procedures, the microscopic analysis may require special stains and immunohistochemistry for ruling out adenocarcinoma metastasis...|$|E
40|$|The ATP binding {{cassette}} transporter A 1 (ABCA 1) {{is involved}} in the regulation of lipid trafficking and export of cholesterol from cells to high density lipoprotein (HDL). ABCA 1 gene defects cause Tangier disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the absence of HDL-cholesterol in plasma, abnormal deposition of cholesteryl esters in the reticuloendothelial system, defective platelet dense and lysosomal granule release, and disordered cellular cholesterol efflux. We describe the case of a 62 -year-old man with Tangier disease who presented with severe anaemia secondary to a spontaneous splenic haematoma. He underwent elective splenectomy without haemorrhage and his thrombocytopaenia resolved with a platelet count rising from 97 to 560 Ã— 109 /L. Macroscopically, the resected spleen was enlarged with evidence of splenic haematoma. Histologic analysis of sections of spleen revealed <b>lipid</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> consistent with the diagnosis of Tangier disease. DNA sequence analysis revealed the subject to be a homozygote for a novel ABCA 1 mutation c. 4121 C > T, which changes arginine 1270 to a stop codon (R 1270 X). In conclusion, we describe a case of Tangier disease in association with an unrecognised bleeding tendency, in a man homozygous for a novel ABCA 1 gene mutation, R 1270 X...|$|E
