50|$|Originally the bay {{sported a}} wide sandy beach and {{easy access to}} deep water via the J.G. Megler cannery dock. Crown Zellerbach {{modified}} the bay to create a <b>log</b> <b>dump,</b> filling part of the bay. Later, dredgings of the Columbia River were piled on the old Brookfield waterfront, creating large hillocks used for four-wheeling.|$|E
5000|$|A landing {{had been}} in use for many years, taking {{travelers}} to farmsteads and towns all along the way. The steamboats used cord wood to fuel the vessels. Seeing an opportunity, Ammi Wright and Charles Davis, loggers by trade, thought the location would be ideal for a logging base camp and railroad terminus. It was determined piers could be built, and <b>logs</b> <b>dumped</b> into the Mississippi River. The logs would then drift to the sawmills lower on the river. Though most of the timber near the river had already been cut by 1890, the two solved the problem by constructing a railroad up into the high elevation timberlands of the Gardner and Hibbing areas. Spurs went out to various stands of timber. The logs were sent down to Mississippi Landing and dumped off the cars into the river. During the season {{they were able to}} haul about 500,000 feet per day." [...] (Hibbing Sentinel ~ May 21, 1898) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the quantity and distribution of bark debris resulting from log rafting. Three distinct problems were studied: (I) the quantity of bark dislodged from the logs while being placed in the rivers and during transport in log rafts; (2) the percentage of the bark that sinks as a function of time; and (3) the amount of bark and debris in existing benthic deposits. Two major areas were studied covering both fresh and salt water: the Klamath River in South-Central Oregon and the Yaquina River estuary near Newport in Western Oregon. The logs stored in the Klamath River consisted primarily of ponderosa pine, and those in the Yaquina estuary were primarily Douglas fir. Studies by several authors listed high chemical oxygen demands and low dissolved oxygen contents in waters used for the storage of logs. Fish kills have been noted from bark deposits in lakes and streams. Photographic measurements of logs were used to determine the percentage of bark dislodged. For Douglas fir logs approximately 17 percent of the bark is dislodged during unloading and 5 percent during raft transport, for a total of 22 percent. Comparatively, the total for ponderosa pine was only 6 percent. Flotation studies showed a total of 10 percent sinkage in water within one day and 75 percent in two months, regardless of the species. The pine bark sank at a faster rate as compared to the fir bark; primarily due to the smaller size of the pine bark. Core samples were taken in areas free of log rafting, in areas of log raft storage and in areas of <b>log</b> <b>dumping</b> {{to determine the extent of}} bark debris in the benthic deposits. Samples consisting of primarily deposited bark had a volatile solids content of about 15 pounds per cubic foot. The average increase in volatile solids content in the log storage areas as compared to the control samples was approximately two pounds of volatile solids per cubic foot. For the <b>log</b> <b>dumping</b> areas this average increase ranged from 0. 5 to 15 pounds of volatile solids per cubic foot. The results of this study indicate clearly that large amounts of bark are added to the water courses used for log storage and that large amounts of bark debris presently exist in the benthic deposits of these water courses...|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s {{the site}} was bought by the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, which brought up to 1 million board feet of timber here {{annually}} by rail from all over Thurston and Lewis counties until it closed the site in 1984. A former logging railroad crosses Woodard Bay on a wooden trestle and a narrow peninsula. It runs out onto a pier in Henderson Inlet across the mouth of Chapman Bay. Here <b>logs</b> were <b>dumped</b> in the water, gathered into rafts and floated to mills in Everett, Washington.|$|R
50|$|An interpretive sign {{about the}} landing of Peter Puget at Mud Bay was placed by the county's {{historical}} commission along Mud Bay Road.

5000|$|The {{demand for}} wood {{products}} during the First World War {{led to the}} construction of a pulp mill, sawmill, shingle mill and community at Beaver Cove by Beaver Cove Lumber & Pulp Limited in 1917, which in turn brought about large-scale railway logging operations in the lower Nimpkish Valley. The active logging company was Wood & English (owned by the Nimpkish Timber Company) which established a logging camp ('Camp 8', later 'Nimpkish') and logging railway at the head of Nimpkish Lake. The logs cut from this area were hauled by an isolated <b>logging</b> railway, <b>dumped</b> into Nimpkish Lake, then towed down the lake to a reload centre where they were lifted {{out of the water and}} finally loaded onto railway cars for a short haul on a second rail line to Beaver Cove. The mill complex at Beaver Cove had a relatively short life, but in 1925 Wood & English built another sawmill across the bay from the pulp mill, and renamed the community [...] "Englewood"—a combination of the names Wood and English. That mill ceased operation in 1941 and few signs remain of the former mills and community. After this date all <b>logs</b> were <b>dumped</b> in the Beaver Cove booming grounds for towing to mills in the Vancouver area.|$|R

5000|$|In 1936, Weyerhaeuser {{incorporated}} the Chehalis Western Railroad as a publicly regulated, common-carrier shortline to carry lumber and forest products over a 10-mile stretch of track from Chehalis, Washington to Ruth, Washington that Weyerhaeuser had purchased from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, {{also known as}} the Milwaukee Road. [...] The Chehalis Western also operated on trackage rights over the Milwaukee Road from Chehalis to Western Junction, where the trains would join a Weyerhaeuser-owned logging line (known as the [...] "Vail" [...] line) that would go north to a <b>log</b> <b>dump</b> at South Bay, Washington. And Chehalis Western trains also operated on trackage rights over the Northern Pacific Railroad from Pe Ell, Washington to Milburn, Washington.|$|E
50|$|By 1913, the area's timber {{resources}} were already being depleted {{and as the}} lumber companies began to move out, the town began a steady decline. The post office closed in 1943, and Black Rock and the 19,000 acres surrounding it were incorporated into the U.S. tree farm system. Part of the tree farm burned in 1945 but it was replanted. By 1960, the town only had a <b>log</b> <b>dump</b> and a security guard. The railroad was abandoned in 1960, and logs were hauled to the mills using trucks; {{at some point the}} railroad tracks were removed. Although the USGS classifies Black Rock as a populated place, today there is nothing at the former townsite, which is entirely forested except for two mill ponds.|$|E

25|$|Tlalpan {{has some}} of the largest forested lands in the Federal District, with over 80% of this borough officially {{declared}} to be in conservation. However, only four percent of the borough is considered to be unharmed ecologically. The areas most affected by human activity are {{at the foot of the}} Xitle and Xictontle volcanos. The forest under protection in the borough equals 30,000 hectares but it is protected by only thirty-eight forest rangers, each with a territory of about 1,000 hectares of forest, canyons and volcanic areas. Three are provided by the Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente, fifteen from the Comisión de Recursos Naturales of the Federal District and twenty by the borough itself. These rangers work against illegal loggers, settlers and drug traffickers, who are often armed. The three main problems in the protected areas is illegal <b>logging,</b> the <b>dumping</b> of trash and rubble, squatting, and the theft of volcanic rock (for building materials). Most of the time, all the rangers can do is report the illegal activity to federal authorities but response is spotty.|$|R
5000|$|SP {{provided}} kerosene-powered {{rail cars}} known as McKeen cars. The rail cars were nicknamed [...] "The Skunk" [...] {{because of the}} smell from the exhaust fumes; these cars were discontinued by 1930. Its initial purpose and primary revenue source was logging. Logs from Black Rock were dumped into the Willamette River at varying points, including Winona and Holman. By 1949, a <b>log</b> <b>dump</b> had been installed. At Eola, gravel was dredged from the river and loaded into gondola cars for railroad use. Logging declined following World War II, and what demand remained was converted to truck transport. [...] The line between Falls City and Black Rock was abandoned in 1960 and removed two years later. By the mid-1960s, trips to Falls City were infrequent. Between West Salem and Gerlinger, the line was rarely used after 1964 and was essentially abandoned in the 1970s. In 1965, the section between Dallas and Falls City was cut back to Buman, where a 3-mile spur led to a lime quarry. Despite the infrequent use of the line for shipping, SP {{was not allowed to}} abandon this portion of the branch until 1968. In the early 1970s, the line was further reduced to a point about 1.5 miles west of Dallas.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Benthic {{samples were}} {{collected}} during the summer, winter and spring seasons from upper Yaquina Estuary, a region used by Georgia- Pacific Corporation for log dumping and storage. Samples came from an active <b>log</b> <b>dump</b> and storage areas as well as areas not associated with log handling activity. The samples were analyzed for total macrofauna (> 1. 0 mm) and sediment parameters. One of the sediment parameters measured was total organic or volatile solids which {{was used as an}} indicator of bark deposits. Diversity indices were calculated on total macrofauna collected during the three sampling periods and on the polychaete and crustacean subgroups. A similarity index was also calculated for all combinations of summer sampling stations. Multiple regression analysis of diversity with seven sediment parameters and water depth was generally insignificant. The trends in total summer macrofauna and crustacean diversities showed an increase in diversity with increasing volatile solids. A similar increase was noted in the summer macrofauna density. Winter and spring macrobenthic diversities were not significantly correlated to any of the parameters measured. Although population densities generally declined during these two seasons there was a positive correlation of density with water depth. This indicates that organisms associated with the more saline bottom waters were protected from severe osmotic stresses caused by the overlying river water. The results of the summer similarity analysis showed four groups of highly similar stations. Two groups were in fairly coarse sandy sediment, while the other two were in finer sand and silt sediments, One group of the latter two was associated exclusively with the log handling areas. The results indicate that bark debris in Yaquina Estuary did not result in decreased diversity or density of macrofauna but seem to result somewhat in an altered species type. Possible explanations for these results are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Routine {{operations}} involved two trains moving ten {{or twelve}} loaded pulpwood cars south from Eagle Lake to Umbazooksus Lake, and empty pulpwood cars northward in a round trip taking about 3 hours. The two trains would pass at a midpoint siding. One Plymouth switcher shunted loading cars at Eagle Lake and the other shunted unloading cars at Umbazooksus Lake. The inland rail of the 600-foot (180 m) long pulpwood unloading pier was six inches (15 cm) higher than the lakeside rail to expedite unloading. The floor of each pulpwood car sloped 12 inches (30 cm) to the unloading side; and the slatted {{side of the car}} was hinged at the top to swing open when latches were released so the pulpwood would slide out of the car into Umbazooksus Lake. Bark breaking off the pulpwood logs accumulated so the Plymouth switcher periodically dragged a rake adjacent to the pier to keep the water deep enough to float the pulpwood <b>logs</b> being <b>dumped.</b> Normal operations transferred 6,500 cords of pulpwood per week enabling Great Northern Paper Company to manufacture approximately one fifth of the United States' annual paper production.|$|R
5000|$|To {{create this}} reservoir, John S. Eastwood {{was hired in}} 1908 to {{construct}} a dam at Long Meadow. [...] Eastwood proposed constructing the world's first reinforced concrete multiple arch dam. Although unprecedented, {{at a cost of}} approximately $46,000, the dam's design was a less expensive alternative to a conventional rock fill dam that would have cost about twice as much to construct. The dam was completed in only 114 days, by the end of 1909, along with a mill immediately adjacent to the dam. [...] <b>Logs</b> were <b>dumped</b> into the reservoir by rail and floated to the dam where they were drawn up into the mill, cut and then dried in kilns next to the mill on the west bank of Tenmile Creek. From this location, lumber was floated to Sanger, California, in a flume filled with water from the reservoir. The flume was the longest ever created, eventually stretching 73 mi from Hume Lake to Sanger. Designed and built by James Carroll Goss, the flume was used by both the lumber company and tourists. Thrill seeking tourists would occasionally ride in the flume down from the Sierras in special boats designed with an open prow so that water would help keep the boats from flying off into the air. The flume was also reputedly utilized by the murderous bandits Chris Evans, and the Sontag Brothers (John Sontag and George Contant), who hid along the flume to evade capture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{forest area}} of the park has {{deteriorated}} due to natural and man-made reasons. [...] Some of the natural problems include {{the arrival of a}} larva that strips barks from trees and residual problems from a forest fire in 1998, which destroyed about 450 hectares in the higher elevations of the park. Now there is a fire station called Brigada Regional Uno de la Delegación Cuajimalpa in the community of La Venta and an observation tower at San Miguel peak to watch for fires. There are also trees that are dying from acid rain.Other problems are man-made, as there is insufficient control over human activities in the forest. No one lives in the park proper but urban development has nearly surrounded the entire forest and over 16,000 people live right on the park’s borders. There is insufficient vigilance and control of access especially in the southern section. [...] Parts of the park are being used for pasture, garbage <b>dumping,</b> <b>logging,</b> and off-path mountain biking.|$|R
