5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999 Don King and Oscar De la Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, agreed to co-promote a mega-fight for the Lineal, WBC and IBF welterweight championships on September 18, 1999, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. Early in the fight De <b>la</b> <b>Hoya</b> {{employed}} boxing to connect combinations while avoiding Trinidad's attacks. The second round began with both boxers trading punches but De <b>la</b> <b>Hoya</b> quickly returned to his previous tactic, which he employed in the third round. In the fourth round Trinidad pressured the offense while De <b>la</b> <b>Hoya</b> tried to avoid his punches by moving, both boxers eventually exchanged punches. In the fifth round Trinidad continued in the offensive while De <b>la</b> <b>Hoya</b> attempted {{to remain on the}} outside corners of the ring, Trinidad's eye was swollen following a trade of punches, and his nose was also bleeding. Trinidad was having a lot of problems finding De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> and couldn't connect as flush as usual with his punches, although he scored at times, Oscar's movement was not letting him land in combination and it was proclaimed by many to have been a lackluster fight. In the eighth round the swelling on Trinidad's eye was worsening. Oscar was scoring on Trinidad but halfway through the tenth, De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> stopped sticking and basically disengaged. De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> gassed out and had remained on his toes {{for the remainder of the}} bout, and Trinidad won all the final rounds.The judges gave Trinidad a very controversial majority decision, with scores of 115–113, 115–114 and 114–114.|$|E
5|$|As {{his career}} continued, he {{defeated}} Oscar De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> {{to win the}} WBC and lineal welterweight titles in 1999; Fernando Vargas to win the unified WBA and IBF light middleweight titles in 2000; and William Joppy to win the WBA middleweight title in 2001. Trinidad's first professional loss was against Bernard Hopkins later in 2001, and following this he retired from boxing for the first time. Trinidad made his ring return by defeating Ricardo Mayorga in 2004 and, after a losing effort against Winky Wright in 2005, retired for a second time. In 2008 he returned once more and lost to Roy Jones Jr. Subsequently, Trinidad entered a five-year hiatus without clarifying the status of his career.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} fight, Cotto fought former three-division {{champion}} Shane Mosley on November 10, 2007. Mosley had originally {{set his sights}} on fighting World Boxing Council (WBC) welterweight champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., but Mayweather was in negotiations to fight Ricky Hatton, and on July 28, 2007, Mayweather and Hatton officially agreed to the fight. With the two fights scheduled to take place a month apart from each other, the media speculated that the winners of the two fights would likely fight each other next. Cotto was successful in his third title defense, defeating Mosley by unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden in New York City, while one month later, Mayweather defeated Hatton by tenth round technical knockout at the MGM Grand in Paradise, Nevada. Following his victory, Mayweather announced that he would take a two-year layoff from boxing to focus on his promotional company. However, one month later, Mayweather began negotiations for a rematch with Oscar De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya.</b> With several top welterweight fighters unavailable, Cotto agreed to fight Alfonso Gomez, a fighter most notable for appearing on the first season of The Contender. The match took place on April 12, 2008, at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and resulted in a victory for Cotto after the ring doctor stopped the fight after round five.|$|E

25|$|At one time, Floyd Mayweather Sr. {{negotiated}} {{to train}} Oscar De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> {{and be in}} his corner during the fight, but De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> decided to train with Freddie Roach. Mayweather won the fight by a split decision in 12 rounds, capturing the WBC title. However, many analysts and ringside observers felt Mayweather should have received a unanimous decision. During the early rounds De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> had some success cutting off the ring, attempting to pound Mayweather on the inside. Despite his activity on the inside, however, many of De La Hoya's punches were ineffective and landed on Mayweather's arms or shoulders. By {{the middle of the}} fight, it was seen as an even bout by the announcers. Mayweather turned the tide in the middle and late rounds, often hitting De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> at will. Official scorecards read 116–112 (Mayweather), 115–113 (Mayweather), and 115–113 (De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya).</b> CompuBox had Mayweather out-landing De <b>La</b> <b>Hoya</b> 207–122 in total punches and 134–82 in power punches, with better accuracy throughout the fight.

50|$|Hoyalacerta is an extinct genus of lizard {{known from}} the type species Hoyalacerta sanzi, which is from the Early Cretaceous <b>Las</b> <b>Hoyas</b> fossil site in Spain. Hoyalacerta was named in 1999 and is {{considered}} either {{a member of the}} group Iguania or a stem squamate, meaning that it lies outside the squamate crown group that includes all living lizards and snakes. Hoyalacerta is a small lizard with an elongated body and short limbs. It is thought to have spent most of its time on the ground. Several other lizards are also known from <b>Las</b> <b>Hoyas,</b> including Meyasaurus (thought to have lived near the water), Scandensia (thought to be a climber), and Jucaraseps (which, like Hoyalacerta, probably lived on the ground away from water). Features of Hoyalacerta that distinguish it from other <b>Las</b> <b>Hoyas</b> lizards include smooth skull bones, simple cone-shaped teeth, and short limbs relative to body length.|$|R
