40|$|The {{increased}} use of mobile devices has prompted the need for efficient mobility management protocols to ensure continuity of communication sessions as users switch connection between available wireless access networks in an area. Locator/Identifier (LOC/ID) split architectures are designed to, among other functions, enable the mobility of nodes on the Internet. The protocols based on these architectures enable mobility by ensuring that the identifier (IP address) used for creating a communication session is maintained throughout the lifetime of the session and only {{the location of a}} mobile node (MN) is updated as the device moves. While the LOC/ID protocols ensure session continuity during handover, they experience packet loss and long service disruption times as the MN moves from one access network to another. The mobility event causes degradation of throughput, poor network utilisation, and affects the stability of some applications, such as video players. This poor performance was confirmed from the experiments we conducted on a laboratory testbed running <b>Locator</b> <b>Identifier</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> MN (LISP-MN) and Mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6). The MIPv 6, as the standardised IETF mobility protocol, was used to benchmark the performance of LISP-MN. The poor performance recorded is owed to the design of the LISP-MN’s architecture, with no specific way of handling packets that arrive during handover events. Our main aim in this thesis is to introduce an Improved Locator/Identifier Split Architecture (ILISA) designed to enhance the mobility of nodes running a LOC/ID protocol by mitigating packet loss and reducing service disruption in handovers. A new network node, Loc-server, is central to the new architecture with the task of buffering incoming packets during handover and forwarding the packets to the MN on the completion of the node’s movement process. We implemented ILISA with LISP-MN on a laboratory testbed to evaluate its performance in different mobility scenarios. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in the mobility performance of MNs as reflected by the different network parameters investigated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMobility {{management}} in a wireless environment {{has always been}} an important issue. There are many solutions proposed to target the problems faced by mobile nodes during mobility. The current Internet architecture is TCP/IP based and mobile nodes use Mobile IP or IP mobility, which is a protocol developed for mobile devices to roam from network to network maintaining their permanent IP addresses. However, with the inception of the idea of a network of interconnected objects, which generally termed as Internet of Things, motivated to have a new Internet architecture, where information supersedes the node centric concept of networking. Therefore, we have an information centric network than a node centric network like the contemporary Internet architecture. The project 4 WARD is one such approach. In this work, the proposed solution for mobility {{management in}} network is presented {{in the form of a}} mobile node architecture in which the main components are introduced. In this abstract the core function of Virtual Node Layer (VNL) is presented. The three core entities (VNL, ILCTR (Inner locator Construction Router) and OLCTR (Outer Locator Construction Router)) within the transport layer are responsible for the mobility management of Network of Information Mobile Node (NetInf MN). NetInf MN exhibits features introduced in <b>Locator</b> <b>Identifier</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> Mobile Node (LISP MN) plus innovative routing capabilities (ILCTR and OLCTR). In general, the basic contribution is to provide end host mobility in different mobility scnarios, while in particular, the idea focuses to provide mobility management in NetInf. The work presented here highlights the features of the NetInf MN architecture and VNL and is complemented with its working principle, advantages it exhibits and its supporting role in the NetInf MN architecture within the network. There are always certain criteria to follow whenever there is an issue of designing a Mobile IP protocol, architecture or framework because the basic idea in the end is to provide end host mobility. These criteria or constraints, force to address issues which in return can improve the overall performance in mobility management in terms of minimizing the latency during the handover stage, regular updates in terms of single or simultaneous movement of the hosts as well as managing the power in cases where the node is idle. In designing NetInf MN, all the parameters mentioned above are taken into account and a qualitative analysis of such parameters is planned for future work. Based on this analysis, we are going to develop a road map for further improvements in our proposal on which our simulation environment will be created...|$|E
40|$|Internet {{security}} poses complex challenges {{at different}} levels, {{where even the}} basic requirement of availability of Internet connectivity becomes a conundrum sometimes. Recent Internet service disruption events have made {{the vulnerability of the}} Internet apparent, and exposed the current limitations of Internet security measures as well. Usually, the main cause of such incidents, even {{in the presence of the}} security measures proposed so far, is the unintended or intended exploitation of the loop holes in the protocols that govern the Internet. In this thesis, we focus on the security of two different protocols that were conceived with little or no security mechanisms but play a key role both in the present and the future of the Internet, namely the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and the <b>Locator</b> <b>Identifier</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> (LISP). The BGP protocol, being the de-facto inter-domain routing protocol in the Internet, plays a crucial role in current communications. Due to lack of any intrinsic security mechanism, it is prone to a number of vulnerabilities that can result in partial paralysis of the Internet. In light of this, numerous security strategies were proposed but none of them were pragmatic enough to be widely accepted and only minor security tweaks have found the pathway to be adopted. Even the recent IETF Secure Inter-Domain Routing (SIDR) Working Group (WG) efforts including, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Route Origin authorizations (ROAs), and BGP Security (BGPSEC) do not address the policy related security issues, such as Route Leaks (RL). Route leaks occur due to violation of the export routing policies among the Autonomous Systems (ASes). Route leaks not only have the potential to cause large scale Internet service disruptions but can result in traffic hijacking as well. In this part of the thesis, we examine the route leak problem and propose pragmatic security methodologies which a) require no changes to the BGP protocol, b) are neither dependent on third party information nor on third party security infrastructure, and c) are self-beneficial regardless of their adoption by other players. Our main contributions in this part of the thesis include a) a theoretical framework, which, under realistic assumptions, enables a domain to autonomously determine if a particular received route advertisement corresponds to a route leak, and b) three incremental detection techniques, namely Cross-Path (CP), Benign Fool Back (BFB), and Reverse Benign Fool Back (R-BFB). Our strength resides in the fact that these detection techniques solely require the analytical usage of in-house control-plane, data-plane and direct neighbor relationships information. We evaluate the performance of the three proposed route leak detection techniques both through real-time experiments as well as using simulations at large scale. Our results show that the proposed detection techniques achieve high success rates for countering route leaks in different scenarios. The motivation behind LISP protocol has shifted over time from solving routing scalability issues in the core Internet to a set of vital use cases for which LISP stands as a technology enabler. The IETF's LISP WG has recently started to work toward securing LISP, but the protocol still lacks end-to-end mechanisms for securing the overall registration process on the mapping system ensuring RLOC authorization and EID authorization. As a result LISP is unprotected against different attacks, such as RLOC spoofing, which can cripple even its basic functionality. For that purpose, in this part of the thesis we address the above mentioned issues and propose practical solutions that counter them. Our solutions take advantage of the low technological inertia of the LISP protocol. The changes proposed for the LISP protocol and the utilization of existing security infrastructure in our solutions enable resource authorizations and lay the foundation for the needed end-to-end security.

40|$|Abstract — This article {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of using traffic optimization techniques {{within the context of the}} LISP (Locator/ <b>Identifier</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol)</b> framework. These techniques use Tunneling, Multiplexing and header Compression of Traffic Flows (TCMTF) in order to save bandwidth and to reduce the amount of packets per time unit. Taking into account that encapsulation is necessary in LISP, bandwidth can be drastically reduced in flows using small packets, which are typical of many real-time services. The ability of the LISP framework to manage the signaling of TCMTF options is also studied. An analytical expression of the savings, as a function of the different header sizes, is devised and used to calculate the maximum expected savings. Different services and scenarios of interest are identified, and this allows the consideration of tests with real traffic traces, showing the savings as a function of the multiplexing period, and demonstrating that the additional delays can be acceptable for real-time services.

LISP main argument is that the semantics of the IP address are overloaded being to be both <b>locator</b> and <b>identiﬁer</b> of an endpoint. LISP proposes to address this issue by separating the IP address into a locator part, which is hierarchical, and an identifier, which is flat. However this is a false distinction: in Computer Science it is impossible to locate something without identifying it and to identify something without locating it, since all the names are using for locating an object within a context. Moreover, LISP continues to use the locator for routing, therefore routes are computed between locators (inter- faces). However, a path does not end on a locator but on an identifier, in other words, the locator is not the ultimate destination of the packet but a point on the path to the ultimate destination. This issue leads to path-discovery problems, as documented by [...] whose solution is known not to scale.|$|R

However, {{as the number of}} connected devices increase, the burdens on the network infrastructure increase as well. The major challenges are the size of the routing tables and the efficiency of the current routing protocols in the Internet backbone. To address these problems, an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group, along with the research group at Cisco, are still working on the Locator/ID <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> as a routing architecture that can provide new semantics for the IP addressing, to simplify routing operations and improve scalability in the future of the Internet such as the Internet of Things. Nonetheless, The Locator/ID <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> is still at an early stage of implementation and the security Protocol e. g. Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), in particular, is still in its infancy. Based on this, three scenarios were considered: Firstly, in the initial stage, each Locator/ID Separation Protocol-capable router needs to register with a Map-Server. This is known as the Registration Stage. Nevertheless, this stage is vulnerable to masquerading and content poisoning attacks. Secondly, the addresses resolving stage, in the Locator/ID <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> the Map Server (MS) accepts Map-Request from Ingress Tunnel Routers and Egress Tunnel Routers. These routers in trun look up the database and return the requested mapping to the endpoint user. However, this stage lacks data confidentiality and mutual authentication. Furthermore, the Locator/ID <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> limits the efficiency of the security protocol which works against redirecting the data or acting as fake routers. Thirdly, As a result of the vast increase in the different Internet of Things devices, the interconnected links between these devices increase vastly as well. Thus, the communication between the devices can be easily exposed to disclosures by attackers such as Man in the Middle Attacks (MitM) and Denial of Service Attack (DoS). This research provided a comprehensive study for Communication and Mobility in the Internet of Things as well as the taxonomy of different security protocols. It went on to investigate the security threats and vulnerabilities of Locator/ID <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> using X. 805 framework standard. Then three Security protocols were provided to secure the exchanged transitions of communication in Locator/ID <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol.</b> The first security protocol had been implemented to secure the Registration stage of Locator/ID separation using ID/Based cryptography method. The second security protocol was implemented to address the Resolving stage in the Locator/ID <b>Separation</b> <b>Protocol</b> between the Ingress Tunnel Router and Egress Tunnel Router using Challenge-Response authentication and Key Agreement technique. Where, the third security protocol had been proposed, analysed and evaluated for the Internet of Things communication devices. This protocol was based on the authentication and the group key agreement via using the El-Gamal concept.
