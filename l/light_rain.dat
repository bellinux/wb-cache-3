50|$|Adults hunt {{in spring}} and summer, but only at night or during <b>light</b> <b>rains.</b> Spadefoot tadpoles are dimorphic. Within a cohort, some tadpoles have large mouthparts, while others have much smaller mouthparts. As well as {{consuming}} other types of food, large-mouthed individuals arecannibalistic, swallowing other tadpoles whole.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} mulch upon soil {{moisture}} content is complex. Mulch forms a layer between the soil and the atmosphere which prevents sunlight from reaching the soil surface, thus reducing evaporation. However, mulch can also prevent water from reaching the soil by absorbing or blocking water from <b>light</b> <b>rains.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{southwest}} of Queensland was again gripped by drought in from 1927 to 1929; despite some <b>light</b> <b>rains</b> Durham Downs {{was still in}} poor condition with little feed available for stock. The drought was broken in 1930 with good rainfall, {{so much that the}} normally dry Coopers Creek flowed for a time.|$|R
50|$|Summers are hot and humid, with {{frequent}} thunderstorms. Spring and fall bring pleasant temperatures. Winter is often considered chilly by U.S. standards, with <b>lighter</b> <b>rain</b> showers of longer duration. Sporadic snowfall {{can occur in}} winter, but is usually relatively light. Rainfall is spread evenly throughout the year, with 3 - 5 in falling each month.|$|R
5|$|From November28 to November30, {{the storm}} brought <b>light</b> <b>rains</b> {{to most of}} eastern Cuba. Although the cyclone had {{tropical}} storm-force winds at the time, the highest recorded wind in Cuba was 12mph (18km/h) in Havana and only 0.22in (5.58mm) of rain fell in the city. The Swan Islands, off the northern coast of Honduras, recorded 2.36in (59.94mm) of precipitation during a three-day span.|$|R
5|$|Alberto dropped light {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}} across Mexico, with a 24-hour total peaking at 4inches (100mm) in Peto, Yucatán. <b>Light</b> <b>rain</b> was also reported throughout Quintana Roo and in eastern Campeche.|$|E
5|$|August 30, 1988– Tropical Storm Chris {{moves across}} the {{northern}} portion of {{the state as a}} tropical depression. The system causes <b>light</b> <b>rain</b> of up to 1inch (3cm).|$|E
5|$|The {{hydraulic}} launch motor {{is capable}} of producing 20,800 peak horsepower (15.5 MW). Because of the high speed and open nature of the trains, the ride will not operate in <b>light</b> <b>rain.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Light</b> <b>rains</b> {{and winds}} spread into the Melbourne National Weather Service region.

50|$|Rainfall in a Kona {{storm is}} more {{pronounced}} than a cold front storm, and most intense from south to {{east of the}} storm {{and in front of}} the storm's center. Steady rains may last from several hours to days, with longer lasting storms typically interrupted by intervals of <b>lighter</b> <b>rain</b> and partial clearing. Intense showers may appear on more moderate but steady rain.|$|R
30|$|The nomads {{recognise}} {{the relationship}} between soil type and plant growth and put this knowledge into systematic use. Light sandy soils in the dune areas allow faster sprouting of grass and herbs than the heavy soils of the plain areas. Thus, the first <b>light</b> <b>rains</b> in the spring produce fresh grass much earlier on the sandy soils, and the nomads will move there accordingly.|$|R
5|$|December 23/24, 1989: <b>Light</b> <b>rain</b> in Jacksonville {{turns to}} {{freezing}} rain as temperatures drop, and later changes to snow. The snow totals several inches in some locations, {{and results in}} the first White Christmas in the city's history. Light snow falls across central Florida {{as far south as}} southern Pinellas County on the 23rd, though the official weather station in St. Petersburg experiences only a light sleet.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{initially}} posed {{a significant}} {{threat to the}} Lesser Antilles which had already suffered severe damages from Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Several watches and warnings were issued for the islands between August26 and 27; however, due to the northward turn, Gustav did not directly impact the region. Only <b>light</b> <b>rain</b> and large swells were reported. Offshore, a ship encountered the storm and sustained hull damage.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Isis spread across the southwestern United States, and rainfall reached over 0.75inches (19mm) in Nevada and Utah. Low-level moisture dissipated as it continued inland, due to dry air, although upper-level moisture produced <b>light</b> <b>rain</b> across the Northwestern United States; Pocatello, Idaho recorded 0.59inches (15mm), while Missoula, Montana recorded 0.39inches (10mm).|$|E
50|$|November to April is {{generally}} dry while wet {{for the rest}} of the year. The northeast monsoon (amihan) prevails from October to January bringing in moderated and <b>light</b> <b>rains.</b> From February to April, the east trade winds predominate but the Sierra Madre (Philippines) mountain range to the east disrupts the winds resulting to a dry period. From May to September, the southwest monsoon (habagat).|$|R

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{prompted the}} issuance of several tropical storm warnings for the Lesser Antilles. Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40flights and sandbags were distributed in the United States Virgin Islands. Danny ultimately only brought <b>light</b> <b>rain</b> to the region, with its effects considered beneficial due to a severe drought.|$|E
5|$|The rally began peacefully under a <b>light</b> <b>rain</b> on {{the evening}} of May 4.

A large number of on-duty police officers watched from nearby.|$|E
5|$|While Erika's {{precursor}} disturbance {{was moving}} across Florida, it dropped heavy rainfall. In south Texas, Erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60mph (80 to 95km/h) along with <b>light</b> <b>rain,</b> causing minor and isolated wind {{damage in the}} state. In northeastern Mexico, Erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flooding. There, two people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters.|$|E
