50|$|The {{treatment}} regimen was personalized {{for each person}} receiving the drug {{in order to maximize}} the radiation delivered to the tumor and to minimize the amount of radiation to which the person would be exposed. A first dose of <b>labelled</b> <b>antibody</b> was given once, and whole-body radiation was measured with a gamma camera over seven days. Analysis of that imaging data allowed an optimal dose of <b>labelled</b> <b>antibody</b> to be calculated, which was then administered once a day, for up to seven days. Each time the <b>labelled</b> <b>antibody</b> was administered, it was always preceded by unlabelled antibody because early clinical trials had shown that total body residence times of radioactivity were longer in people who first received unlabelled antibody, so that a lower dose of <b>labelled</b> <b>antibody</b> was needed to deliver the required total dose of radiation; additionally <b>labelled</b> <b>antibody</b> targeted tumors better in people pre-treated with unlabelled antibody.|$|E

5000|$|After a {{successful}} period as a postdoctoral fellow with Watson {{starting in the}} spring of 1965, Weber was hired as an Assistant Professor at Harvard and ran a joint laboratory with Watson and Walter Gilbert. During this period he worked on protein chemistry of RNA phages, but was beginning to shift his focus to animal cells and their viruses, and spent a sabbatical at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory learning the associated techniques. Weber became a Full Professor at Harvard (1972), at the age of 36, 10 years after obtaining an undergraduate degree. His wife was Mary Osborn, who he met when he was a research fellow in the Harvard laboratory. Together they produced the [...] "Weber and Osborn" [...] SDS-PAGE paper, which showed that proteins could be dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), reliably separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and their molecular weights determined with reasonable accuracy. The title of the paper was [...] "The reliability of molecular weight determinations by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis". This technique rapidly became standard lab practice around the world and the original paper {{became one of the most}} highly cited in the history of science. An article in the journal Nature identified the 100 most cited papers of all time and listed this paper as number 30, as of October 7, 2014, with 23,642 citations. The pair moved to Germany in 1975 when Weber was offered the position of Director of the Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen. There they pioneered another new technique: immunofluorescence microscopy. They and Elias Lazarides had previously found that they could tag the subunit proteins of microtubules, microfilaments, intermediate filaments and other cellular structures with specific antibodies and then tag these antibodies with a second fluorescently <b>labelled</b> <b>antibody</b> as described in a series of papers such as [...] "Actin antibody: the specific visualization of actin filaments in non-muscle cells". The fluorescent signal could be easily visualized using a fluorescence microscope and this allowed the rapid examination of the localization of molecules in cells and in tissues. This technique has also become a routine part of lab practice all around the world.|$|E

40|$|A time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) with europium-labelled {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs) {{was used}} to detect potato virus X (PVX) at a concentration of 5 pg/ml, in potato tuber extracts diluted up to 7 x 104 -fold and leaf extracts diluted up to 2 x 107 -fold. When mixed with potato leaf sap, PVX was detected at 100 pg/ml.

5000|$|So-called 'sandwich' immunoassays are {{particularly}} susceptible to this interference. (Sandwich immunoassay = two-site, noncompetitive immunoassays {{in which the}} analyte in the unknown sample is bound to the <b>antibody</b> site, then <b>labeled</b> <b>antibody</b> is bound to the analyte.

Heterophile antibodies may thus give false positives (by bridging the capture and signal antibody) or false negatives (by blocking one or the other).

Other options include the use of heterophile blocking reagents, steps to remove immunoglobulins, serial dilutions and using non-mammalian capture and/or detection antibodies.|$|R

50|$|The {{existence}} of HAMA can complicate laboratory measurements. HAMA interference's can give false {{positive or negative}} immunoassay results. HAMA bridging interference produces artificially higher results because HAMA's bind to immobilized mouse antibodies in place of substrate, secondary <b>labeled</b> <b>antibodies</b> will then bind to HAMA and produce a positive signal falsely indicative of substrate presence. In this manner, HAMA provides a bridge between immobilized <b>antibodies</b> and <b>labeled</b> secondary <b>antibodies.</b> In contrast, HAMA blocking interference produces no signal for substrate presence when substrate is present. HAMA's will capture immobilized mouse antibodies. In the heterogenous immunoassay the separation step will wash away the free substrate unable to bind due to HAMA blocking; only the immobilized mouse antibodies and the HAMA remain in the immunoassay when the <b>labeled</b> secondary <b>antibodies</b> are administered. Since the substrate {{will no longer be}} able to bind to the immobilized mouse antibodies because of HAMA interference, <b>labeled</b> secondary <b>antibodies</b> will not give a signal for substrate presence.|$|R
30|$|Antibodies {{have been}} used as {{radionuclide}} carriers for imaging and therapywell before the discovery of monoclonal antibodies. The ability to produce unlimited amounts of homogenous products has prompted the development of antibodies for in vivo imaging and therapy, mostly in oncology. Contrary to the commercial and clinical success of naked therapeutic <b>antibodies,</b> only one <b>labelled</b> therapeutic <b>antibody,</b> Zevalin, for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas (Grillo-López 2002), and a few <b>labelled</b> <b>antibodies</b> for imaging (Goldenberg 1997) remain on the market. There are multiple reasons why <b>labelled</b> <b>antibodies</b> have not been commercially successful. Firstly, the pharmaceutical industry favours non-labelled products, as evidenced by the number of antibody-drug conjugates under development (Thomas et al. 2016), even though they do not outperform <b>labelled</b> <b>antibodies</b> in terms of efficacy or tolerance (Chatal et al. 2016). Secondly, referring physicians are reluctant to prescribe products they do not control.And finally, current therapeutic radiolabelled antibodies have a low therapeutic index..Indeed, radiolabelled antibodies in the form of intact IgG molecules, by far the most commonly used so far, have a very long persistence in the circulation, which can cause severe haematological side-effects. If tumour accretion may reach high levels (more than 10 % of injected activity per gram of tumour in mice and as much as 0.1 % per gram of tumour in humans), this is only hours or days after activity injection and circulating activities remain elevated for days (Jain et al. 2007).|$|R
