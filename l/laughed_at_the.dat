He <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

25|$|A Fistful of Dollars was {{at first}} {{intended}} by Leone to reinvent the western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite {{the fact that even}} Hollywood began to gear down production of such films, Leone knew that there was still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting.|$|E
25|$|He {{was a major}} {{participant}} in the Rosebud campaign, and saw action in the Battle of the Rosebud. General George Crook and his officers, having retreated from the Rosebud, were hunting {{in the foothills of}} the Bighorns when Grouard, known to the Brulé as 'One-Who-Catches' and to the Hunkpapa as 'Standing Bear', was acting as guide. Between 9 and 10 in the morning of June 25, 1876 Crook's forces were in Goose Creek Valley when Grouard saw the smoke from Indian signal fires in the distance, which indicated that George Armstrong Custer's command was engaged with the enemy, outnumbered, and being badly pressed. The officers present used their field glasses but could make no sense of the smoke signals and <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> idea that a half-Indian could have such knowledge of their meaning. To prove that he was right, at noon Grouard mounted his horse and rode towards the signals, reaching the Little Bighorn, a distance of some seventy miles, at 11 pm on June 25. Here he discovered the bodies of the slain before being chased back to Goose Creek by hostiles, bringing the news of Custer's death to Crook.|$|E

The first Warden of Alcatraz, James A. Johnston, was reputed to have heard a woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison. Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching around in a circle before vanishing. Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going off on their own accord have all been reported. The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the Occupation of Alcatraz, is also reputed to be haunted; {{during the time of the}} penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove. A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from the fog of San Francisco bay.|$|E

500|$|On January 23, 2007, Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins made a {{statement}} that may have set the rivalry in a dead heat: [...] "I think we are {{the team to beat}} in the NL East… but that's only on paper."

The Mets, meanwhile, sat firmly in the NL East lead for almost all of the season.|$|E

500|$|Shostakovich {{fell from}} {{official}} favour in 1936. The year {{began with a}} series of attacks on him in Pravda, in particular an article entitled, [...] "Muddle Instead of Music". Shostakovich was away on a concert tour in Arkhangelsk when he heard news of the first Pravda article. Two days before the article was published on the evening of 28 January, a friend had advised Shostakovich to attend the Bolshoi Theatre production of Lady Macbeth. When he arrived, he saw that Joseph Stalin and the Politburo were there. In letters written to his friend Ivan Sollertinsky, Shostakovich recounted the horror with which he watched as Stalin shuddered every time the brass and percussion played too loudly. Equally horrifying was the way Stalin and his companions <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> love-making scene between Sergei and Katerina. Eyewitness accounts testify that Shostakovich was [...] "white as a sheet" [...] when he went to take his bow after the third act.|$|E
500|$|Cope {{took his}} sinking {{fortunes}} in stride.

I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus." [...] Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of [...] "Cope" [...] and [...] "hater", Anisonchus cophater. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.|$|E

500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E
2500|$|A BBC frequency, 7325kHz, {{has also}} been used. This {{prompted}} {{a letter to the}} BBC from a listener in Andorra. She wrote to the World Service Waveguide programme [...] complaining that her listening had been spoiled by a female voice reading out numbers in English and asked the announcer what this interference was. The BBC presenter <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> suggestion of spy activity. He had consulted the experts at Bush House (BBC World Service headquarters), who declared that the voice was reading out nothing more sinister than snowfall figures for the ski slopes near the listener's home. After more research into this case, shortwave enthusiasts are fairly sure that this was a numbers station being broadcast on a random frequency.|$|E

However, Wood framed his shots for the widescreen format, expecting that the ephemera {{at the top and}} bottom of the screen would be cropped in projection. Only when the film is viewed in its original widescreen format does it become apparent that Wood did compose his scenes correctly, and that the various objects intruding on the picture were never meant to be seen by the audience. Recent DVD releases of Plan 9 restore the image to its proper dimensions, in a manner consistent with the director's original intentions.|$|E

In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed [...] "a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room."
