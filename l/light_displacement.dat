40|$|There are {{a number}} of design {{challenges}} facing mooring systems of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) platforms in an offshore environment. Some unique aspects of the FOWT industry should be considered when examining applicability of established offshore mooring practices. Important among these are: economy and cost effectiveness; light weight minimal platforms; and water depths ranging from 50 – 300 m. A <b>lighter</b> <b>displacement</b> platform in shallow water, supported by lines with light to moderate pre-tension can result in a higher probability of slack line events and hence snap loads during re-engagement. Such loads can result in shock on the line material and considerably reduce the fatigue life. Such events have the potential to occur in various sea states, and not necessarily limited to extreme conditions. These conditions will be dependent on structure resonant motions, which are influenced by wind loads and moments, wave conditions and mooring line properties. Model tests of typical concepts for FOWT reported in literature have shown occasional slack line episodes. This paper is a review of literature on snap load occurrence in marine applications, including lifting and lowering operations, ROV and diving bell operations. This paper presents a case study of a FOWT. Special focus is on mooring systems which are affected by impact load conditions. Criteria are reviewed and consequences are documented...|$|R

40|$|Optical fiber sensors offer {{advantages}} over traditional electromechanical sensors, making them particularly well- suited for certain measurement applications. Generally speaking, optical fiber sensors {{respond to a}} desired measurand through modulation of an optical signal's intensity, phase, or wavelength. Practically, non- contacting fiber optic displacement sensors are limited to intensity-modulated and interferometric (or phase- modulated) methodologies. Intensity-modulated fiber optic displacement sensors relate target displacement to a power measurement. The simplest intensity-modulated sensor architectures are not robust to environmental and hardware fluctuations, since such variability may cause changes in the measured power level that falsely indicate target displacement. Differential intensity-modulated sensors have been implemented, offering robustness to such intensity fluctuations, and the speed of these sensors is limited only by the combined speed of the photodetection hardware and the data acquisition system (kHz-GHz). The primary disadvantages of intensity-modulated sensing are the relatively low accuracy ([mu]m-mm for low-power sensors) {{and the lack of}} robustness, which consequently must be designed, often with great difficulty, into the sensor's architecture. White <b>light</b> interferometric <b>displacement</b> sensors, on the other hand, offer increased accuracy and robustness. Unlike their monochromatic- interferometer counterparts, white light interferometric sensors offer absolute, unambiguous displacement measurements over large displacement ranges (cm for low- power, 5 mW, sources), necessitating no initial calibration, and requiring no environmental or feedback control. The primary disadvantage of white <b>light</b> interferometric <b>displacement</b> sensors is that their utility in dynamic testing scenarios is limited, both by hardware bandwidth and by their inherent high-sensitivity to Doppler-effects. The decision of whether to use either an intensity-modulated interferometric sensor depends on an appropriate performance function (e. g., desired displacement range, accuracy, robustness, etc.). In this dissertation, the performance limitations of a bundled differential intensity-modulated displacement sensor are analyzed, where the bundling configuration has been designed to optimize performance. The performance limitations of a white <b>light</b> Fabry-Perót <b>displacement</b> sensor are also analyzed. Both these sensors are non- contacting, but they have access to different regions of the performance-space. Further, both these sensors have different degrees of sensitivity to experimental uncertainty. Made in conjunction with careful analysis, the decision of which sensor to deploy need not be an uninformed on...|$|R
