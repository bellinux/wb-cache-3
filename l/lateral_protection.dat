Aluminium accounts for 45 kg of the weight of the SmILE (7%), through replacement of both axles, wheel suspension and seat structure. In average cars in Europe this is 65 kg (6%) and rising. One problem with aluminium is the high energy cost of primary production. However, recycled aluminium has a much lower energy cost and identical mechanical properties.|$|R

The track is in a trough, and as such is often incorrectly {{referred to as a}} side-friction coaster. The train actually makes no contact with the trough walls; they are present simply to provide some <b>lateral</b> <b>protection</b> from derailment as the running wheels are flanged like those of railway vehicles.

A long falling plume was sometimes attached to this type of helmet. The need for unimpeded vision and good hearing was particularly acute for cavalrymen, therefore this type of helmet was used primarily by mounted troops.

40|$|Abstract—The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is a {{ground-based}} differential GPS system being developed to support aircraft precision {{approach and landing}} navigation with guaranteed integrity. To quantitatively evaluate navigation integrity, an aircraft computes vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>protection</b> levels as position-error bounds using integrity parameters broadcast by a nearby LAAS Ground Facility (LGF). These parameters include {{a standard deviation of}} ionosphere spatial decorrelation because the range errors introduced by the ionosphere vary between LGF receivers and LAAS users. Thus, it is necessary to estimate typical ionosphere gradients for nominal days and to determine an appropriate upper bound to sufficiently cover the differential error due to the ionosphere spatial decorrelation.

A well estimation of the <b>lateral</b> <b>protection</b> distance is crucial in predicting the protection area of the lightning rod. This paper focus on a 3 -D numerical modelling of lightning attachment based on physical phenomena leading to the formation and the development of the positive upward discharges. The application of our physical model was made for rods on earthed structures. Our model takes into account the real nature of the protected area. The influence of the edges and the corners of the structure on the LPS is investigated. The purpose of our 3 D model is to present numerical predictions in order to ensure an efficient lightning protection system.

40|$|The {{throwing}} {{power of the}} Zinc-Hydrogel Anode for sacrificial protection of steel in concrete was studied in the laboratory under controlled environments. The anode to steel ratio in the specimens was 1. The corrosion state of the rebar is moderate. The results indicate that for a concrete resistivity of 600 Qm and higher the ohmic drop in the concrete {{is an important factor}} in the <b>lateral</b> <b>protection</b> of steel with diameter of 8 mm and a cover of 15 mm. For 600 Qm a lateral {{throwing power}} of 220 mm or more was obtained, while for 1900 SZm this decreases to less than 120 mm. Our results on the throwing power in the depth direction indicate that for a concrete resistivity between 600 and 1000 Qm protection of two corroding rebar layers of 8 mm diameter at two different depths between 0 and 150 mm can be obtained. The measurements show that for a higher concrete resistivity proper protection is questionabl...|$|E
40|$|The edge plasma {{interactions}} of the actively cooled radio-frequency heating launchers in Tore Supra- ion-cyclotron range-of-frequencies (ICRF) antennas and lower-hybrid (LH) grills-are studied using infrared video imaging. On the two-strap ICRF antennas, operated in fast-wave electron heating or current drive mode, hot spots with temperatures of 500 - 900 {degrees} C are observed {{by the end}} of 2 -s power pulses of 2 MW per antenna. The distribution and maximum values of temperature are determined principally by the relative phase of the two antenna straps: dipole (heating) phasing results in significantly less antenna heating than does 90 ` (current drive) phasing. Transient heat fluxes of 1 - 20 MW/m{sup 2 } are measured on the <b>lateral</b> <b>protection</b> bumpers at ICRF turn-on; these fluxes are primarily a function of plasma and radio frequency (rf) control, and are not simply correlated with the strap phasing or the final surface temperature distributions. The remarkable feature of the lower hybrid edge interaction is the production of beams of heat flux in front of the grills; these beams propagate along the helical magnetic field lines and can deliver fluxes of 5 - 10 MW/m{sup 2 } over areas of several cm{sup 2 } to plasma-facing components such as the grill or antenna lateral bumpers. Both the ICRF and LH phenomena appear to result from the acceleration of particles by the near fields of the launchers. Modeling of the heat flux deposition on components and its relation to sputtering processes is presented, and possibilities for controlling these interactions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Many work zone devices, such as truck-mounted attenuators, cones, and barrels, {{are used}} to {{separate}} workers from the traveling public during construction and maintenance activities. However, these devices do not provide <b>lateral</b> impact <b>protection.</b> Conversely, concrete barriers are often used to physically separate workers and moving traffic at long-term construction projects. Unfortunately, many work activities are of shorter duration or require continuous movement along the roadway, and so cannot be protected through concrete barrier placements. This paper describes a set of functional requirements developed for highly-portable positive protection technologies that protect highway workers. These requirements were based on an assessment {{of a large number}} of construction and maintenance work activities that are highly mobile and thus would potentially benefit from such a system. Specific roadway design features believed to have the most significant impact upon the functional requirements of a highly-portable positive protection system were also considered. While it is desirable to have a protective device that covers a wide possibility of work zone conditions, this preliminary study shows there are some practical limits to activities that ca...|$|R
40|$|Annulus grouting, or non-grouting, {{is often}} the {{question}} {{in the minds of}} municipal engineers when considering trenchless sliplining technique for pipe rehabilitation. For ease of installation in sliplining rehabilitation, the outside diameter of the liner pipe is usually at least 10 % smaller than the inside diameter of the host pipe, resulting in an annular space (or annulus) between the two pipes. Currently the decision on annulus grouting is mainly based on its impact on construction and cost. Based on a three-year study on the performance of a sliplined water main in the City of Ottawa, the effect of the grout on the performance of slipline pipe is presented in this paper. The pros and cons are explained in terms of buckling resistance, potential shear failure at <b>lateral</b> connections, <b>protection</b> of liner pipe when the host pipe fails, load-carrying capacity and control of load-sharing. Furthermore, how grouting can be used to maximise the desired performance of slipline pipe, or to strengthen an existing culvert is suggested in the paper. This paper fits well with the theme of INFRA 2003 as it shares proven solutions to sliplining rehabilitation and promotes innovation in construction to maximize pipe performance...|$|R
50|$|The Gould GR61X is {{a further}} {{evolution}} of the Gould line of hillclimb cars. It was produced {{around the same time}} as the GR55B as a one-off design produced for father and son duo Roger and Scott Moran. It sees further refinements to the aerodynamics as well as offering enhanced <b>lateral</b> head <b>protection</b> from its higher cockpit sides and padded cockpit surround. It utilises the same 3.5-litre Nicholson-McLaren V8 engine as Martin Groves' GR55B. The car was instantly competitive when it hit the hills in 2005 and ultimately culminated in Scott Moran clinching back-to-back titles in 2008 and 2009 with further titles taken in 2011, 2013, 2014 & 2016 which make Roger and Scott Moran the first father and son title winners in British Hillclimbing as Roger claimed Pilbeam's final British title in 1997. After Roger retired from top-flight hillclimbing at the end of the 2014 season Alex Summers added to the success of this chassis, winning the 2015 title driving the car alongside Scott Moran. The GR61X was the first Gould chassis to be fitted with F1-style paddle shift sequential gears and traction control, which have since been fitted to GR55 chassis (Rob Turnbull and John Bradburn's GR55's were the first to have paddle shift fitted - the Geartronics system) as well as the Pilbeam M97.|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of gunshot residues (GSRs) on human body in firearm related fatalities may be {{essential for the}} evaluation of gunshot wounds and for the analysis of the shooting distance. The present study introduces the elemental analysis of the GSRs by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer analysis (ICP-AES) performed on skin samples. ICP-AES was used to increase the accuracy of the analysis in gunshots fired from long and medium distance. In this experimental study, a series of 50 test shots have been performed in an open space with <b>lateral</b> wind <b>protection.</b> As target we used pig skin cut into 20  cm ×  20  cm squares. The firing distances were 0. 2, 5, 50, 100 and 150  cm. To exclude environmental contamination, each skin sample was carefully washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature in a closed box before the shooting test. We choose 9  ×  21 and the 7. 65  mm calibers handguns, loaded with different ammunitions. At ICP-AES analysis a clearly decreasing trend in the quantity and the concentration of the different elements of GSR by increasing the firing distance for both the guns used in the test was evident for every portion of skin samples analyzed. The analytical results obtained by ICP-AES confirmed very high concentrations of Pb, Sb, and Ba in the close-range shots and low concentrations of these particles in the intermediate and distant shots. In particular, the concentration of Sb, Ba, and Pb was significantly different from loose values when the firing distance was 100 – 150  cm for both the 9  ×  21 and the 7. 65  mm calibers...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} is surveyed to determine human tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. Pertinent {{human and animal}} experiments applicable to space flight and to crash impact forces are analyzed and discussed. These data are compared and presented {{on the basis of}} a trapezoidal pulse. The effects of body restraint and of acceleration direction, onset rate, and plateau duration on the maximum tolerable and survivable rapidly applied accelerations are shown. Results of the survey indicate that adequate torso and extremity restraint is the primary variable in tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. The harness, or restraint system, must be arranged to transmit the major portion of the accelerating force directly to the pelvic structure and not via the vertebral column. When the conditions of adequate restraint have been met, then the other variables, direction, magnitude, and onset rate of rapidly applied accelerations, govern maximum tolerance and injury limits. The results also indicate that adequately stressed aft-faced passenger seats offer maximum complete body support with minimum objectionable harnessing. Such a seat, whether designed for 20 -, 30 -, or 40 -G dynamic loading, would include lap strap, chest (axillary) strap, and winged-back seat to increase headward and <b>lateral</b> G <b>protection,</b> full-height integral head rest, arm rests (load-bearing) with recessed hand-holds and provisions to prevent arms from slipping either laterally or beyond the seat back, and leg support to keep the legs from being wedged under the seat.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (i) to compare the reproducibility of lateral tooth contacts of casts mounted in a semi-adjustable articulator when condylar guidance was set by different methods and (ii) to assess the margin of error of the variations of condylar guidance without changing lateral tooth contacts, {{depending on the type of}} lateral guidance. In subjects with different types of lateral guidance, intraoral lateral tooth contacts identified with occlusal registration strips were compared with those identified by use of a semi-adjustable articulator, setting the condylar guidance in four different ways: using protrusive wax wafers, by axiography and by adding and subtracting 5 degrees from the value of condylar guidance obtained by protrusive wax wafers. Tolerance to variations of condylar guidance without changing lateral tooth contacts was determined by increasing and decreasing the value of condylar guidance until lateral tooth contacts changed. Different ways of setting condylar guidance on a semi-adjustable articulator give rise to different values of condylar guidance in the same subject. The occlusal repercussions of these variations of condylar guidance values depend on the type of <b>lateral</b> guidance. Canine <b>protection</b> had the greatest tolerance to variations in the setting of condylar guidance without changing lateral occlusal contacts...|$|R
