40|$|Foremost, I {{would like}} to express my sincere {{gratitude}} to Dr. Mondher Bouzayen for allowing me {{to be part of}} their teams. To my two supervisors Dr. Jean-Claude Pech and Dr. Christian Chervin, thanks for their guidance, advice, involvement and support in my work. And they helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. I would have never made this if without the help of Dr. Alain <b>Latché</b> who was there in all the phases of the project...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe discuss several {{techniques}} for proving compactness of sequences of approximate solutions to discretized evolution PDEs. While the well-known Aubin-Simon kind functional-analytic techniques were recently generalized to the discrete setting by Gallouët and <b>Latché</b> [15], here we discuss direct {{techniques for}} estimating the time translates of approximate solutions {{in the space}} $L^ 1 $. One important result is the Kruzhkov time compactness lemma. Further, we describe a specific technique that relies upon the order-preservation property. Motivation comes from studying convergence of finite volume discretizations for various classes of nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations. These and other applications are briefly described...|$|E
40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to thank my PhD supervisors, Prof. Mondher Bouzayen and Dr. Farid Regad, for {{supporting}} me during these past four years. Words cannot express how much I appreciate Prof. Bouzayen for guiding, motivating, supporting and training me throughout these years of my studies in the GBF laboratory. Dr. Regad has always been supportive and has given me enough freedom to pursue independent work. I would have never succeeded in my project without his help and support. I am also very grateful to Dr. Julien Pirrello for his supervision at the beginning of my Ph. D. research project in plant molecular biology. His advices helped me all the time. I {{would like to}} express my gratitude and respect to Prof. Zhengguo Li, Prof. Jean-Claude Pech, Dr. Alain <b>Latché</b> and Prof. Jean-Paul Roustan, for their scientific advices and many insightful discussions and suggestions. My sincere thanks also go to Lydie, Dominique, Olivier and Laure for their help in genetic transformation, culture and phenotyping of tomato plants. The outcome of my research project is mainly based on the unique genetic material they produced. I {{would like to thank}} Isabelle, Benoit, Corinne, Christian, Simo, Pierre, Alexandra, Eli...|$|E
40|$|Immediate {{access to}} needed {{information}} is essential if medical personnel are to provide quality health care. At the Washington Hospital Center, Literature Attached to Charts, LATCH, {{was created in}} 1967 to provide the required information quickly. As a collection of a few relevant articles attached to the patient's chart, it supplies current literature on {{some aspect of the}} patient's illness. Following an account of the program's inception, an analysis of 1, 935 LATCH requests for the years 1968 [...] 1975 reveals that new physicians, that is, interns and first-year residents, requested <b>LATCHes</b> most often. Requests in areas of internal medicine were the most common. The data also show that the program has been well received by its users. LATCH has affected the medical library in several ways. The program has been partially responsible for increases in staff, in the number of journal subscriptions, and in the number of literature searches requested. The program has also brought about greater access to the collection via the card catalog. An important effect has been the tremendous development of professional expertise in the staff preparing the LATCH...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comThe treatment of grape berries (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) with the ethylene-releasing compound, 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid (2 -CEPA), at veraison is a method known to enhance grape skin colour. We observed that it produced a 6 -fold increase, up to 30 pmol g 1 FW, of the cluster internal ethylene compared to untreated controls within the 24 h following treatment. This ethylene upsurge was associated with increased levels of chalcone synthase (CHS) and flavanone 3 -hydroxylase (F 3 H) transcripts, which persisted over the following 20 days. Transcript levels of leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) and UDP glucose-flavonoid 3 -O-glucosyl transferase (UFGT) were similarly enhanced by 2 -CEPA, although to a lesser extent. The effect on UFGT was confirmed at the protein level by an immunoblot analysis. The transcript accumulation of dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DFR) was unaffected by 2 -CEPA treatment. Examination of the levels of CHS, F 3 H and UFGT mRNAs in berries during bunch exposure to ethylene, revealed elevated levels of each transcript within the first 6 h of treatment when compared to nonethylene-treated controls. HPLC analyses of berry skin extracts showed that levels {{of each of the}} anthocyanins analysed (delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin) increased over the 10 days following the ethylene burst, and decreased thereafter. However, anthocyanin levels at harvest were still higher in ethylene treated grapes than in controls. This data is the first evidence that ethylene triggers gene expression related to anthocyanin synthesis in grapes, and in addition, our results also confirm the existence of other regulatory modes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway.
