We studied the impacts of J. curcas plantations on adjacent <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems</b> focusing on spontaneous occurrence of seedlings, seed dispersal mechanisms, seed predation by animals, and germination success of dispersed seeds. No spontaneous regeneration was observed in <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems</b> adjacent to J. curcas plantations. Primary seed dispersal was limited, predominantly under the canopy of the mother plant. Rodents and shrews dispersed and predated J. curcas seeds and fruits. They transported the seeds up to 23 Â m from the sources and repositioned them in their burrows up to 0. 7 Â m deep, but none of these seeds could establish. Germination experiments in adjacent <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems</b> revealed 4 % germination success at the soil surface, and 65 % if buried artificially at 1 - 2 Â cm depth, yet the latter is unlikely to occur under natural conditions. These findings show that J. curcas seeds may be dispersed by animals to adjacent <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems,</b> but no natural recruitment was observed given low germination on the surface and none in burrows. Altogether these results suggest that the plant currently does not show an elevated risk of invasion to adjacent <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems,</b> at least in the investigated case study.

5000|$|Accessibility based {{planning}} is a spatial planning methodology that centralises goals {{of people and}} businesses and defines accessibility policy as enhancing people and business opportunities. Traditionally, urban transportation planning has mainly focused on {{the efficiency of the}} transport system itself and is often responding to plans made by spatial planners. Such an approach neglects the influence of interventions in the transport system on broader and often conflicting economic, social and environmental goals. Accessibility based planning defines accessibility as the amount of services and jobs people can access within a certain travel time, considering one or more modes of transport such as walking, cycling, driving or public transport. Using this definition accessibility does not only relate to the qualities of the transport system (e.g. travel speed, time or costs), but also to the qualities of the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>system</b> (e.g. densities and mixes of opportunities). It thus provides planners with the possibility to understand interdependencies between transport and land use development. Accessibility planning opens the floor to a more normative approach to transportation planning involving different actors. For politicians, citizens and firms it might be easier to discuss the quality of access to education, services and markets than it is to discuss the inefficiencies of the transport system itself. Accessibility is also defined as [...] "the potential for interaction".|$|E

The term “home garden” is often considered synonymous to the kitchen garden. However, they differ in terms of function, size, diversity, composition and features (Sthapit et al., 2006). In Nepal, 72% of households have home gardens of an area 2-11% of the total land holdings (Gautam et al., 2004). Because of their small size, the government has never identified home gardens as an important unit of food production and they thereby remain neglected from research and development. However, at the household level the system is very important as {{it is an important}} source of quality food and nutrition for the rural poor and, therefore, are important contributors to the household food security and livelihoods of farming communities in Nepal. The gardens are typically cultivated with a mixture of annual and perennial plants that can be harvested on a daily or seasonal basis. Biodiversity that has an immediate value is maintained in home gardens as women and children have easy access to preferred food. Home gardens, with their intensive and multiple uses, provide a safety net for households when food is scarce.

In the quantification of new <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems</b> for <b>land</b> units, often equilibrium conditions with respect to soil resources are assumed, following a so-called target-oriented approach. This facilitates ex ante computation of inputs and emissions of nutrients and allows their use in static optimization models based on LP. The condition of equilibrium in soil resources is often not met, nor is it the ultimate aim. Hence, the dynamics in new systems are insufficiently dealt with. This paper presents an approach for the design of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems</b> (crop rotations) and their quantification in terms of input and output coefficients, using particular yields and dynamics in soil resources as targets. Interactions between N input and output of succeeding crops are explicitly taken into account. A simple N-balance model is used describing major processes affecting soil N-dynamics. For the Koutiala region in Mali five crop rotations are evaluated that differ in target crop yield, crop choice, crop residue management and external N source. Modeled crop rotations aiming at high yields, in combination with incorporation of crop residues and legumes, result in depletion of soil N stock. Only in crop rotations aiming at high yields and with incorporation of crop residues combined with a supply of large quantities of animal manure, soil N depletion can be prevented. Four approaches are presented of how to use the dynamic input¿output coefficients of these <b>systems</b> in <b>land</b> <b>use</b> studies using LP: (i) use of average coefficients, (ii) use of discounted coefficients, (iii) use of pessimistic estimates of coefficients in an optimization of the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> allocation followed by a recalculation of the objective values for the optimized <b>land</b> <b>use</b> with optimistic coefficients, and (iv) a combined <b>use</b> of <b>systems</b> characteristics, i. e. cumulative N-inputs of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems</b> over the time horizon and the magnitude of the soil N pool at the end of the time horizon, which can be used as filters for <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>systems.</b> Though none of the approaches completely captures the dynamics in input¿output coefficients, they enable a well-founded consideration of the consequences of dynamics in, for instance, soil N stocks in static optimization approaches for farm and regional studies...|$|R
