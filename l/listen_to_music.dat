5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to reveal the}} relationship between everyday <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> and emotion among col-lege students. Participants were 13 female and 2 male college students who were given booklets to record the following over an 8 -day period: dates and times of their everyday experiences of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music,</b> duration of <b>listening,</b> locations and contexts of listening, active or passive listening, emotions before and after listening, and tiles and artists <b>to</b> which they <b>listened.</b> Results indicated that the participants <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> for 5 <b>to</b> 30 minutes while driving or riding in a car. Emotions reported {{both before and after}} <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> were mainly ‘happy’, ‘calm’, and ‘dull’. When participants <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> actively, their emotions before and after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> were essentially the same as the above. With respect to the relation between emotions before <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> and characteristics of the <b>music</b> they chose <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to,</b> when feeling ‘sad’, ‘anxious’, or ‘lonely’ before listening, they actively chose music having positive as well as negative affective characteristics.

50|$|Generally, {{studies suggest}} that athletes use music in {{purposeful}} ways to facilitate training and performance. In one study, seventy elite Swedish athletes completed a questionnaire relating the empirical motives for <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music.</b> The results showed that most of they often <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> during pre-event, pre-training sessions, and warm-ups.

5|$|After the Second Test, McCabe was {{involved}} in an infamous incident that has caused speculation ever since. His captain Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable Irish Catholic minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Bradman denied having prior knowledge of the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the press. Opening batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of undermining Bradman's authority, laziness, lack of attention to fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman denied that he was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the effects of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> in inpatients {{diagnosed}} with schizophre-nia, on their auditory hallucinations, and positive and negative symptoms. Methods: A quasi-experimental research design with 2 × 2 cross-over trial and convenience sample was used. Eleven patients (Group AB) <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> followed by a wash out period and then a usual care period, and 12 patients (Group BA) had a usual care period followed by a wash out period and then <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>music.</b> For one week those who were in the experimental period <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> individualized <b>music</b> using an MP 3 player whenever they heard hallucinations. Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in the fre-quency of auditory hallucinations after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the <b>music.</b> There was a decrease in the mean scores for positive symp-toms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music,</b> but only negative symptoms showed a statistically significant decrease. The treatment effects on scores for positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology were greater in Group BA than Group AB.

25|$|Many {{students}} <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> {{while they}} study. Many {{of these students}} maintain that the reasons why they <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some even believe that background music facilitates better work performance. However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory. They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system. This disturbance {{can be explained by}} the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does. This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music. Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process. Current research coincides with this idea and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music. However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test.|$|E
25|$|Cortical {{thickness}} {{and reduced}} white matter – {{in a recent}} study, voxel-based morphometry, an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right inferior frontal gyrus of amusic individuals as compared to controls. Lack of extensive exposure to music could be a contributing factor to this white matter reduction. For example, amusic individuals may be less inclined to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> than others, which could ultimately cause reduced myelination of connections to the frontal areas of the brain.|$|E

25|$|According to the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, {{the risk}} of hearing damage from digital audio players depends on both sound level and {{listening}} time. The listening habits of most users are unlikely to cause hearing loss, but some people are putting their hearing at risk, because they set the volume control very high or <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> at high levels for many hours per day. Such listening habits may result in temporary or permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, and difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments.|$|E

25|$|Music {{has been}} found to be an {{effective}} tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found that children who listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did not <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> while having an IV inserted.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{different}} Jewish communities observe different {{periods of}} mourning.

Some Sephardic Jewish families begin the period of mourning from {{the first day of the}} Hebrew month of Iyar and continue for thirty-three days until the third of Sivan. The custom among Jerusalemites (minhag Yerushalmi) is to follow the mourning practices during the entire Counting of the Omer, save for the day of Lag BaOmer and the last three days of the counting (sheloshet yemei hagbalah) prior to the onset of Shavuot. The extent of mourning is also based heavily on family custom, and therefore Jews will mourn to different degrees.|$|E
25|$|The {{social and}} {{economic}} reasons for {{the appearance of the}} blues are not fully known. The first appearance of the blues is usually dated after the Emancipation Act of 1863, between 1870 and 1900, a period that coincides with post-emancipation and later, the establishment of juke joints as places where blacks went to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music,</b> dance, or gamble after a hard day's work. This period corresponds to the transition from slavery to sharecropping, small-scale agricultural production, and the expansion of railroads in the southern United States. Several scholars characterize the development of blues music in the early 1900s as a move from group performance to individualized performance. They argue that the development of the blues is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the enslaved people.|$|E

Yamaguchi wrote a song that was similar in style to songs in a Japanese school chorus competition: songs without a chorus but with multiple different verses. He made the first section begin with a kayōkyoku-inspired pop melody, so that the song could be understood by casual pop music listeners.|$|E
