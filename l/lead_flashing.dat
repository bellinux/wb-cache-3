5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or <b>lead</b> <b>flashing</b> used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some pipe {{connections}} and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some <b>lead</b> <b>flashing</b> is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{paints and}} roofing {{materials}} may cause contamination. In particular, a Melbourne Water publication advises that lead-based paints never be used. Tar-based coatings are also not recommended, as {{they affect the}} taste of the water. Zinc can also be a source of contamination in some paints, as well as galvanized iron or zincalume roofs, particularly when new, should not collect water for potable use. Roofs painted with acrylic paints may have detergents and other chemicals dissolve in the runoff. Runoff from fibrous cement roofs should be discarded for an entire winter, due to leaching of lime. Chemically treated timbers and <b>lead</b> <b>flashing</b> should not be used in roof catchments. Likewise, rainwater should not be collected from parts of the roof incorporating flues from wood burners without a high degree of filtration. Overflows or discharge pipes from roof-mounted appliances such as air-conditioners or hot-water systems should not have their discharge feed into a rainwater tank.|$|E

25|$|The 1896 {{lighthouse}} is a timber-framed structure clad in corrugated iron, standing twelve metres {{high and}} capped with a domed lantern. The tower is conical in form with a base diameter of approximately 4.3 metres reducing to a top diameter of 2.26 metres. It has been reinstalled at its original location on a round concrete slab {{placed over the}} top of the original 1896 footing when it was returned from Golden Beach in 1999. Corrugations in the iron sheeting taper inwards for the full height of the tower. Most exterior sheeting is early, slip-sheeted in places with zinc sheeting to repair rusted sections. A small timber-framed entry projects from the northern side, clad in corrugated iron with an arched corrugated iron roof. The door is made from tongue and groove boards on a timber frame. Four small, rectangular windows provide daylight to the interior – two at ground level and two corresponding to the level of the central interior platform. They are vertical sliders, framed with cedar and weather-proofed on the exterior by <b>lead</b> <b>flashing.</b> The exterior of the tower is painted white, with the exception of a red border on the entry door.|$|E

50|$|During {{its early}} period, Court Farm had a high, open-trussed roof, {{visible from the}} floor of the main hall and of an {{elaborate}} design, with double roll and hollow moulding. Bredwardine Court and Porthaml Mansion, two other ancestral homes of the Vaughans, have similar surviving roofs. However, part of the original roof of Court Farm was lowered and flattened during alterations made during the 19th century, and the carved ornamental detail of the original trussed roof was lost. In addition, the original stone tiles, which needed a more steeply pitching roof, were replaced with Caernarvon slates (as reported in Mr. Driver’s survey), and the roof valleys were finished off with <b>lead</b> <b>flashing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before the {{availability}} of sheet products for flashing builders used creative methods to minimize water penetration such as angling roof shingles away from the joint, placing chimneys at the ridge, building steps into the sides of chimneys to throw off water and covering seams between roofing materials with mortar flaunching. The introduction of manufactured flashing decreased water penetration at obstacles such as chimneys, vent pipes, walls which abut roofs, window and door openings, etc. thus making buildings more durable and reducing indoor mold problems. In builders books, by 1832 Loudons An Encyclopædia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture... gives instruction on installing <b>lead</b> <b>flashing</b> and 1875 Notes on Building Construction gives detailed instruction and is well illustrated with methods still used today.|$|E

The fire broke out during opening hours. Many works of art and pieces of furniture were carried out of the burning building by members of the Meade-Fetherstonehaugh family, National Trust staff and members of the public. Although the garret and first floors collapsed onto the lower floors and the garret and first floor contents were lost completely, the floors largely fell clear of the ground floor walls and much of the panelling and decoration survived. Much of the contents of the ground floor was crushed but not burned; metalwork was able to be straightened and cleaned, crystal chandeliers were able to be reassembled, and even the elaborate tassels on the chandelier ropes were able to be conserved. The decision to restore the house came after it was determined that restoration would be a cheaper insurance settlement than complete payout for a total loss.|$|E

40|$|This {{overview}} of rainwater tanks in the Australian urban landscape shows that even small tanks (e. g. 5 kL) {{can be very}} effective in supplying non-potable water to a detached dwelling and reducing mains water use. However this self-sufficiency comes at an energy cost compared with reticulated mains supply. Public health is another core performance criterion, and risk assessment research suggests that zoonotic pathogens occur at concentrations that will adversely impact on public health if rainwater is ingested without disinfection. However epidemiological studies do not support this predictions. The quality of rainwater in Australian cities is likely to meet ADWG (2004) on all chemical criteria unless exposed <b>lead</b> <b>flashing</b> on the roof contaminates the collected rainfall. Changes in state regulation have largely mandated internally plumbed tanks and {{this has led to}} a change in the hydro social contract where householders are now expected to take on some responsibility for their water supply. The results from social/market research in SEQ is not encouraging that new householders understand this change in their responsibilities. We conclude the overview with a brief economic assessment, and report that small internally plumbed rainwater tanks connected to large roof areas can supply water at a levelised cost ($/kL) competitive with the future mix of mains water supplies...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{prolonged}} droughts {{in recent}} years, {{the use of}} rainwater tanks in urban areas has increased in Australia. In order to apportion sources of contribution to heavy metal and ionic contaminants in rainwater tanks in Brisbane, a subtropical urban area in Australia, monthly tank water samples (24 sites, 31 tanks) and concurrent bulk deposition samples (18 sites) were collected during mainly April 2007 –March 2008. The samples were analysed for acid-soluble metals, soluble anions, total inorganic carbon and total organic carbon, and characteristics such as total solid and pH. The Positive Matrix Factorisation model, EPA PMF 3. 0, was used to apportion sources of contribution to the contaminants. Four source factors were identified for the bulk deposition samples, including ‘crustal matter/sea salt’, ‘car exhausts/road side dust’, ‘industrial dust’ and ‘aged sea salt/secondary aerosols’. For the tank water samples, apart from these atmospheric deposition related factors which contributed in total to 65 % of the total contaminant concentration on average, another six rainwater collection system related factors were identified, including ‘plumbing’, ‘building material’, ‘galvanizing’, ‘roofing’, ‘steel’ and ‘lead flashing/paint’ (contributing in total to 35 % of the total concentration on average). The Australian Drinking Water Guideline for lead was exceeded in 15 % of the tank water samples. The collection system related factors, in particular the ‘lead flashing/paint’ factor, contributed to 79 % of {{the lead in the}} tank water samples on average. The concentration of lead in tank water was found to vary with various environmental and collection system factors, in particular the presence of <b>lead</b> <b>flashing</b> on the roof.
