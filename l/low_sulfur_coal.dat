40|$|Nearly {{ninety percent}} of U. S. {{coal-fired}} utility boilers are equipped with electrostatic precipitators (ESP). Cost effective retrofittable ESP technologies are the only means to accomplish Department of Energy's (DOE) goal of a major reduction in fine particulate and air toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants. Particles in the size range of 0. 1 to 5 {micro}m typically escape ESPs. Metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, molybdenum and antimony, concentrate on these particles. This is the main driver for improved fine particulate control. Vapor phase emissions of mercury, selenium and arsenic are also of major concern. Current dry ESPs, which operate at temperatures greater than 280 F, provide little control for vapor phase toxics. The need for inherent improvement to ESPs has to be considered keeping in perspective the current trend towards the use of <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>coals.</b> Switching to <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>coals</b> is the dominant approach for SO{sub 2 } emission reduction in the utility industry. <b>Low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>coals</b> generate high resistivity ash, which can cause an undesirable phenomenon called ''back corona. '' Higher particulate emissions occur if there is back corona in the ESP. Results of the pilot-scale testing identified the ''low temperature ESP'' concept to have the biggest impact for the two <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>coals</b> investigated. Lowering the flue gas temperature to 220 F provided the maximum impact in terms of decreased emissions. Intermediate operating temperatures (reduction from 340 to 270 F) also gave significant ESP performance improvement. A significant reduction in particulate emissions was also noted when the flue gas humidity was increased (temperature held constant) from the baseline condition for these moderately high resistivity ash coals. Independent control of flue gas humidity and temperature was an important and a notable element in this project. Mercury emissions were also measured {{as a function of}} flue gas temperature. Mercury emissions decreased as the flue gas temperature was lowered, indicating the native ability of ash to capture the mercury. Pulsed operation of the ESP with the SIR module provided a 2 to 3 -fold reduction in emissions at the higher operating temperatures. In light of the positive results from Phase I, we propose proof of concept testing in the field in Phase II. The main objective of the Phase II testing would be to determine the ESP performance improvement as a function of flue gas temperature and humidity for a range of low-sulfur coals being fired by utilities. Equally important will be the long-term evaluation of the risk of corrosion and plugging (due to acid condensation) associated with low temperature operation. The impact of higher flue gas velocities (lower SCA-specific collection area), compared to the laboratory pilot program, would also need to be evaluated. A secondary objective would be to examine mercury capture by the ESP at the different temperatures and with sorbent injection...|$|R

40|$|Design {{work has}} been {{completed}} for a Gas Reburning-Sorbent Injection (GR-SI) system to reduce emissions of NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } from a wall fired unit at Central Illinois Light Company`s Edwards Station Unit 1, located in Bartonville, Illinois. The goal {{of the project was}} to reduce emissions of NO{sub x} by 60 %, from the as found baseline of 0. 98 lb/MBtu and to reduce emissions of SO{sub 2 } by 50 %. Since the unit currently fires a blend of high <b>sulfur</b> Illinois <b>coal</b> and <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> Kentucky <b>coal</b> to meet an SO{sub 2 } limit of 1. 8 lb/MBtu, the goal at this site was amended to meeting this limit while increasing the fraction of high <b>sulfur</b> <b>coal</b> to 57 % from the current 15 % level. GR-SI requires injection of natural gas into the furnace {{at the level of the}} top burner row, creating a fuel-rich zone in which NO{sub x} formed in the coal zone is reduced to N{sub 2 }. Recycled flue gas is used to increase the reburning fuel jet momentum, resulting in enhanced mixing.

Dry hydrated lime sorbent is injected into the upper furnace to react with SO{sub 2 }, forming solid CaSO{sub 4 } and CaSO{sub 3 }, which are collected by the ESP.

The CAAA 90 take a markedly different approach to pollution control from stationary sources when compared to past `clean air ' legislation.

The prime objective {{of this study is}} also to see the outcome of the oxidative desulfurization (ODS) process with those high <b>sulfur</b> <b>coals</b> in presence of the ILs. The ODS process includes oxidation of sulfur compounds followed by their extraction in solvents. The use of green solvents like ILs in this present coal cleaning process for high <b>sulfur</b> <b>coals</b> makes the process partially green and efficient. The process may also be considered in clean coal technology.|$|R

Power plants spend nearly 50 billion dollars a year on fuel cost. Presently coal accounts for over 75 % of the electricity generated in this country. Due to increasingly harsh environmental regulations, the demand for <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> (S) <b>coal</b> has dramatically increased. This increase in demand is expected to cause the price of coal to rise. Such a senario has caused the utilities to explore the possibilities of supplementing coal with fuel alternatives such as the byproducts of process industries. The supplemental fuel for utilities located near feedlots (e. g. Northwest Texas) happens to be feedlot manure. Feedlot manure is attractive because it is nearly ten times cheaper than coal and is relatively inexpensive to transport. There exists nearly six million head of cattle in Northwest Texas which produce 25, 000 tons of manure each day. Feedlot manure presents water and air pollution concerns if not disposed of properly. As such, the feedlot operators are eager to find methods of safely disposing of the feedlot manure. A small scale boiler burner facility has been constructed to simulate a utility class boiler. Experiments were conducted with coal only and then for coal/feedlot manure. Three types of feedlot manure are examined; raw feedlot manure, partially composted feedlot manure, and finished composted feedlot manure. Performance characteristics and emission data were taken for each case. A summary of the results is as follows: (I) <b>sulfur</b> Wyoming <b>coal</b> was fired and a gasification efficiency of 66 % was measured. (i I) Emissions measurements were recorded and it was seen that emissions of NO,, and S 02 increased as the burnt mass fraction increased. However, all emissions were within NSPS guidelines. (iii) The successful firing of coal and feedlot manure was achieved, a gasification efficiency in the range of 86 % was measured, which is higher than 66 % obtained when firing coal alone. (iv) When the fuel blend is fully burnt, the NO,, emissions with the blend firing was lower than the firing of coal alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the project {{is to build a}} multi-product ash beneficiation plant at Kentucky Utilities 2, 200 -MW Ghent Generating Station, located in Carroll County, Kentucky. This part of the study includes the examination of the feedstocks for the beneficiation plant. The ash, as produced by the plant, and that stored in the lower pond were examined. The ash produced by the plant was found to be highly variable as the plant consumes high and <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> bituminous <b>coal,</b> in Units 1 and 2 and a mixture of subbituminous and bituminous coal in Units 3 and 4. The ash produced reflected this consisting of an iron-rich ({approx} 24 %, Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }), aluminum rich ({approx} 29 % Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }) and high calcium (6 %- 7 %, CaO) ash, respectively. The LOI of the ash typically was in the range of 5. 5 % to 6. 5 %, but individual samples ranged from 1 % to almost 9 %. The lower pond at Ghent is a substantial body, covering more than 100 acres, with a volume that exceeds 200 million cubic feet. The sedimentation, stratigraphy and resource assessment of the in place ash was investigated with vibracoring and three-dimensional, computer-modeling techniques. Thirteen cores to depths reaching nearly 40 feet, were retrieved, logged in the field and transported to the lab for a series of analyses for particle size, loss on ignition, petrography, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray fluorescence. Collected data were processed using ArcViewGIS, Rockware, and Microsoft Excel to create three-dimensional, layered iso-grade maps, as well as stratigraphic columns and profiles, and reserve estimations. The ash in the pond was projected to exceed 7 million tons and contain over 1. 5 million tons of coarse carbon, and 1. 8 million tons of fine (< 10 {micro}m) glassy pozzolanic material. The size, quality and consistency of the ponded material suggests that it is the better feedstock for the beneficiation plant...|$|R
