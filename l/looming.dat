5|$|In the USSR itself, glasnost {{weakened}} the bonds {{that held the}} Soviet Union together and by February 1990, with {{the dissolution of the}} USSR <b>looming,</b> the Communist Party was forced to surrender its 73-year-old monopoly on state power.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{a decade in}} the state legislature, Slaughter was elected the fourth Lieutenant Governor, serving under Charles Scott. With the War of 1812 <b>looming</b> {{at the end of}} his tenure, Slaughter ran for governor against Isaac Shelby, the state's first governor and a noted military leader. Shelby beat Slaughter soundly. Four years later, Slaughter was again elected as lieutenant governor, serving under George Madison.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} {{assassination}} investigation, suspicion naturally focused on deposed governor Taylor, who fled to Indianapolis, Indiana under the <b>looming</b> threat of indictment. The governor of Indiana refused to extradite Taylor, {{and he was}} thus never questioned about {{his knowledge of the}} plot to kill Goebel. Taylor became a successful lawyer in Indiana, and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
25|$|The Lancashire <b>Loom</b> was {{the first}} {{semi-automatic}} <b>loom.</b> Jacquard <b>looms</b> and Dobby <b>looms</b> are <b>looms</b> that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate <b>looms,</b> or mechanisms added to a plain <b>loom.</b> A Northrop <b>Loom</b> was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern <b>looms</b> run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet <b>looms,</b> water jet <b>looms</b> and rapier <b>looms.</b>|$|R

5|$|Filming, {{originally}} {{scheduled to}} begin in Los Angeles in July2008, began in Kamloops, Savona, Cache Creek and Ashcroft, British Columbia. With a Screen Actors Guild strike <b>looming,</b> the film's producers made a contingency plan to salvage it. Uncharted Territory, Digital Domain, Double Negative, Scanline, and Sony Pictures Imageworks were hired to create 2012 computer-animated visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Finley & Figg {{are still}} blissfully {{unaware of the}} storm ahead of them. With a large {{settlement}} seemingly <b>looming,</b> Oscar hastens to start divorce proceedings against his wife, Paula, with whom had long been at odds, so as to cash out before the big Krayoxx money comes in.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1941, with Operation Barbarossa <b>looming,</b> Felix was {{amended to}} Operation Felix-Heinrich, whereby German {{troops would be}} {{withdrawn}} from the USSR to capture Gibraltar. As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco's intransigence, the operation was postponed, modified, and ultimately abandoned.|$|E

Modern <b>looms</b> include air-jet, rapier <b>loom</b> with electronic jacquard, projectile.|$|R
50|$|Next {{process in}} the textile {{production}} is fabric manufacturing. Fabric Manufacturing laboratory has variety of weaving machines from hand <b>loom</b> to high speed air jet <b>loom.</b> This laboratory consist of dobby and jacquard hand <b>looms,</b> dobby and jacquard shuttle <b>looms,</b> terry towel <b>looms,</b> rapier dobby and jacquard <b>looms,</b> air jet <b>loom,</b> sectional warping machine and sizing machine.|$|R
5000|$|An air-jet <b>loom</b> is a {{shuttleless}} <b>loom</b> {{that uses}} a jet of air to propel the weft yarn through the shed. It {{is one of two}} types of fluid-jet <b>looms,</b> the other being a water-jet <b>loom,</b> which was developed previously. [...] Fluid-jet <b>looms</b> can operate at a faster speed than predecessor <b>looms</b> such as rapier <b>looms,</b> but they are not as common.|$|R
5|$|Set {{to become}} {{unrestricted}} free agents on 1 July 2009, Daniel and Henrik began {{negotiating with the}} Canucks in the off-season and {{were reported to have}} asked for 12-year, $63 million contracts in mid-June. With free agency <b>looming,</b> Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis visited the Sedins in Sweden, where they agreed on identical five-year, $30.5 million contracts on 1 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{disorders}} {{were not}} {{the product of a}} revolutionary plot, but Crispi chose to believe otherwise. On the basis of dubious documents and reports, Crispi claimed that there was an organised conspiracy to separate Sicily from Italy; the leaders of the Fasci conspired with the clerics and were financed by French gold, and war and invasion were <b>looming.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two one-sheet posters for {{the film}} were {{released}} in August 2007, one showing the three masked Strangers, and the other displaying a wounded Liv Tyler. In April 2008, roughly {{two months before the}} film's official theatrical debut, the final, official one-sheet {{for the film}} was released, featuring Liv Tyler standing in a darkened kitchen with a masked man <b>looming</b> behind her in the shadows.|$|E
50|$|Several {{other types}} of hand <b>looms</b> exist, {{including}} the simple frame <b>loom,</b> pit <b>loom,</b> free-standing <b>loom,</b> and the pegged <b>loom.</b> Each of these can be constructed, and provide work and income in developing societies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} {{path of the}} <b>looms</b> {{is a key to}} study on the <b>looms</b> in ancient China. Based on the studies on historical materials and archeological findings of the <b>looms</b> in ancient China, we found that there were two paths in the development process of the <b>looms</b> in ancient China. Before the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), plain weave and figure-weave fabrics were produced on similar <b>looms.</b> But after the Han Dynasty, the two kinds of <b>looms</b> evolved into all kinds of the treadle <b>loom,</b> the multi-heald and multi-treadle <b>loom</b> and the draw <b>loom...</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} between the selvages in handweaving and in industry, because while industrial <b>looms</b> originally very closely mimicked handweaving <b>looms,</b> modern industrial <b>looms</b> are very different. A <b>loom</b> with a shuttle, such as most hand weaving <b>looms,</b> will produce a very different selvage from a <b>loom</b> without a shuttle, {{like some of the}} modern industrial <b>looms.</b> Also in industry sometimes the selvage is made thicker with a binding thread.|$|R
5|$|After World War I, {{and with}} another European war <b>looming,</b> {{leaders from the}} {{historic}} peace churches met to strategize about how {{to cooperate with the}} government to avoid the difficulties of World War I. Holding a common view that any participation in military service was not acceptable, they devised a plan of civilian alternative service, based on experience gained by American Friends Service Committee work in Europe during and after World War I and forestry service done by Russian Mennonites in lieu of military service in Tsarist Russia.|$|E
5|$|After a naval career lasting {{more than}} forty years, in 1912 he was {{appointed}} First Sea Lord, the professional head of the British naval service. With World War I <b>looming,</b> he took steps to ready the British fleet for combat, but his background as a German prince forced his retirement once the war began, when anti-German sentiment was running high. He changed his name and relinquished his German titles, {{at the behest of}} King George V, in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential <b>looming</b> disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
50|$|Originally, power <b>looms</b> used {{a shuttle}} {{to throw the}} weft across, but in 1927 the faster and more {{efficient}} shuttleless <b>loom</b> came into use. Sulzer Brothers, a Swiss company had the exclusive rights to shuttleless <b>looms</b> in 1942, and licensed the American production to Warner & Swasey. Draper licensed the slower rapier <b>loom.</b> Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of <b>looms</b> designed to maximise production for specific types of material. The most common of these are Sulzer shuttleless weaving machines, rapier <b>looms,</b> air-jet <b>looms</b> and water-jet <b>looms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a weaving shed was to provide spaces for {{rows and rows of}} {{identical}} <b>looms.</b> A standard shed would house 1200 <b>looms,</b> and it was common to think in multiples of 400 <b>looms.</b> These <b>looms</b> would be tentered by weavers who worked from four to eight <b>looms</b> each and were paid on piece-rate. The <b>looms</b> would be maintained by a skilled tackler who would be on hand to gait the <b>looms</b> and effect instant repairs or adjustments. There would be four tacklers for 400 <b>looms.</b> The <b>looms</b> were powered by leather belts from overhead cross-shafts, on bevel gears from the line shaft that ran the length of the shed.|$|R
50|$|Shemma, shama, and kuta are all cotton-based cloths {{used for}} making Ethiopian clothing. Three types of <b>looms</b> {{are used in}} Africa: the double heddle <b>loom</b> for narrow strips of cloth, the single heddle <b>loom</b> for wider spans of cloth, and the ground or pit <b>loom.</b> The double heddle <b>loom</b> and single heddle <b>loom</b> might be of African origin. The ground or pit <b>loom</b> {{is used in the}} Horn of Africa, Madagascar, and North Africa and is of Middle Eastern origins.|$|R
5|$|By 1939, it {{was clear}} that war was <b>looming,</b> and the team began to turn their primary {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum range that was barely adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} morning of 13 March 1806 {{he was in the}} Mid-Atlantic when his lookouts spotted sails in the distance. Turning his force around to investigate, Linois hoped to {{encounter}} a merchant convoy but instead discovered the large British second rate HMS London <b>looming</b> out of the darkness ahead. Unable to escape, Linois fought until his ships were battered and he himself was badly wounded, but he eventually surrendered to the squadron under Admiral Warren that had followed London. Napoleon's fury at Linois was unabated and the French admiral remained a prisoner of war for the next eight years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the <b>looming</b> possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E
50|$|Two {{different}} shedding {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} harness loom-one where any one harness or combination of harnesses was lifted while the other harnesses remained stationary. This type of <b>loom</b> {{is known as a}} rising shed <b>loom,</b> and examples include the table <b>loom,</b> dobby <b>loom</b> or the Jack <b>loom.</b> The other method used in harness <b>looms</b> is where some harnesses are raised while others are lowered. The second method lessened the effort of lifting the selected harnesses because they no longer needed to be raised as high as in a rising shed <b>loom.</b> Counterbalance and countermarch <b>looms</b> are of this second type.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} general types of {{vertical}} <b>looms,</b> {{all of which}} can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village <b>loom,</b> the Tabriz or Bunyan <b>loom,</b> and the roller beam <b>loom.</b>|$|R

5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect <b>looming,</b> Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E
5|$|Mega Mendoeng was {{released}} in early 1942, the seventh and final film completed by Union. With a Japanese invasion <b>looming,</b> the February 1942 edition of the film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would {{move away from the}} colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Union, though already beginning production of a film set in the Majapahit era titled Damar Woelan, was forced to close shop; it never reopened. Soekarno returned to the film industry in the 1950s and was active until the 1970s, mostly credited as Rendra Karno.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines <b>looming,</b> the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park under cover of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
