5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the <b>line</b> <b>width.</b>|$|E
5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower <b>line</b> <b>width.</b> 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E

25|$|With {{the natural}} Poisson {{distribution}} {{due to the}} random arrival and absorption times of the photons, there is an expected natural dose (photon number) variation of at least several percent 3 sigma, making the exposure process susceptible to stochastic variations. The dose variation leads to {{a variation of the}} feature edge position, effectively becoming a blur component. Unlike the hard resolution limit imposed by diffraction, shot noise imposes a softer limit, with the main guideline being the ITRS <b>line</b> <b>width</b> roughness (LWR) spec of 8% (3s) of linewidth. Increasing the dose will reduce the shot noise, but this also requires higher source power.|$|E

25|$|Diamond is {{notorious for}} having a {{relatively}} large lattice strain. Strain splits and shifts optical transitions from individual centers resulting in broad lines in the ensembles of centers. Special care is taken to produce extremely sharp N-V lines (<b>line</b> <b>width</b> ~10nbsp&MHz) required for most experiments: high-quality, pure natural or better synthetic diamonds (type IIa) are selected. Many of them already have sufficient concentrations of grown-in N-V centers and are suitable for applications. If not, they are irradiated by high-energy particles and annealed. Selection of a certain irradiation dose allows tuning the concentration of produced N-V centers such that individual N-V centers are separated by micrometre-large distances. Then, individual N-V centers can be studied with standard optical microscopes or, better, near-field scanning optical microscopes having sub-micrometre resolution.|$|E

40|$|Rotational CARS N- 2 {{thermometry}} {{has been}} developed for improved accuracy in spatial flame regions with high concentrations of either H- 2 or CH 4, which are typical conditions on the fuel side of diffusion flames. In initial validation experiments up to 700 K, rotational CARS measurements were performed in binary mixtures of H- 2 and N- 2. Subsequent spectral evaluation with commonly used N- 2 -N- 2 Raman <b>line</b> <b>widths</b> clearly underestimated the real temperatures. Inclusion of recently calculated N- 2 -H- 2 spectral line-broadening coefficients weighted by the concentration of hydrogen resulted in CARS temperatures in much better agreement with the true temperatures. Based on this validation work, improved temperature accuracy was achieved in flame measurements on the fuel side of a hydrogen diffusion flame by probing nitrogen simultaneously with the detection of the hydrogen S- 0 -transition at 354 cm(- 1), and weighting the species specific Raman <b>line</b> <b>widths</b> with the information of relative concentration. The validation experiments were repeated for binary mixtures of nitrogen and methane up to 500 K. It was shown that N- 2 -N- 2 Raman <b>line</b> <b>widths</b> gave reproducible temperatures independent of methane concentration in binary mixtures with nitrogen, thus no explicit knowledge on N- 2 -CH 4 Raman <b>line</b> <b>widths</b> is needed for this temperature region.
