2500|$|Harris holds nuanced {{views about}} Israel and Judaism. He has said, [...] "I don't think Israel should {{exist as a}} Jewish state. I think it is obscene, irrational and unjustifiable to have a state {{organized}} around a religion. So I don't celebrate the idea that there's a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. I certainly don't support any Jewish claims to real estate based on the Bible. Though I just said that I don't think Israel should exist as a Jewish state, the justification for such a state is rather easy to find. We need <b>look</b> <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> fact {{that the rest of}} the world has shown itself eager to murder the Jews at almost every opportunity. So, if there were going to be a state organized around protecting members of a single religion, it certainly should be a Jewish state. Now, friends of Israel might consider this a rather tepid defense, but it's the strongest one I've got. I think the idea of a religious state is ultimately untenable." ...|$|E

6000|$|Second. They {{are under}} the law also who do not only so break and disobey the law, but follow after the law as hard as ever they can, seeking {{justification}} thereby--that is, though a man should abstain from the sins against the law, and labour to fulfill the law, and give up himself to the law, yet if he <b>look</b> <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> law he is still under the law, and for all his obedience to the law, the righteous Law of God, he shall be destroyed by that law. Friend, you must not understand that none but profane persons {{are under the}} law; no, but {{you must understand that}} a man may be turned from a vain, loose, open, profane conversation and sinning against the law, to a holy, righteous, religious life, and yet be in the same state, under the same law, and as sure to be damned as the other that are more profane and loose. And though you may say this is very strange, yet I shall both say it and prove it to be true. Read with understanding that Scripture in Romans 9:30-31, where the Apostle, speaking of the very thing, saith, [...] "But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness"; mark, that followed after the law of righteousness; they notwithstanding their earnest pursuit, or hunting after the law of righteousness, [...] "hath not attained to the law of righteousness." [...] It signifies thus much to us, that let a man be never so earnest, so fervent, so restless, so serious, so ready, so apt and willing to follow the law and the righteousness thereof, if he be under that covenant, he is gone, he is lost, he is deprived of eternal life, because he is not under the ministration of life if he die there. Read also that Scripture, Galatians 3:10, which saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse"; mark, they that are of the works of the law. Now, for to be of the works of the law, it is to be of the works of the righteousness thereof--that is, to abstain from sins against the law, and to do the commands thereof as near as ever they can for their lives, or with all the might they have: and therefore I beseech you to consider it, for men's being ignorant of this is the cause why so many go on supposing they have a share in Christ, because they are reformed, and abstain from the sins against the law, who, when all comes to all, will be damned notwithstanding, because they are not brought out from under the Covenant of Works, and put under the Covenant of Grace.|$|E

It is not known when the beginnings or first vestiges of Igbo music sprung up.
