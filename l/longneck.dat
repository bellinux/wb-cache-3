25|$|In February 2002, The Living End's line up {{changed as}} Demsey left and was {{replaced}} on drums in April by Andy Strachan (ex-Pollyanna). Dempsey wanted {{to spend more time}} with his family, and had a dislike of heavy touring; in August that year he joined Fez Perez, and later joined a punk, folk rock group, The Currency. The Living End developed a side project, The Longnecks, to test out Strachan and new material for their third album, Modern ARTillery, without attracting wide public attention. The name is a reference to <b>longneck</b> beer bottles. The Longnecks name was re-used by the band to try out potential material for later albums. They have also played under other names: Glen Waverley & The Mentones, The Dovetones, Roller Toasters, Doncaster & The Dandenongs and Redwings; at various venues in regional Victoria.|$|E
2500|$|The name {{refers to}} the [...] "Grain Belt" [...] of the American Midwest {{where much of the}} world's supply of barley, corn, {{soybeans}} and other grains are produced. [...] The diamond-shaped logo was introduced early on, though it wasn't until the late 1930s that a rendering of a bottlecap was added as background. After prohibition a large billboard was erected on Nicollet Island next to the Hennepin Avenue Bridge around 1940. [...] For years, it flashed the letters in sequence ("G-R-A-I-N B-E-L-T BEER"). This sign still stands today as a local landmark. Grain Belt introduced cap-sealed conetop cans in the 1930s. At the same time, the company offered its beers in <b>longneck</b> bottles and on draft.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{separate}} and earlier CFZ blog, Drinnon reviewed Bruce Champagne's sea-serpent categories {{and argued that}} several referred to known animals, the whales in particular. Drinnon basically recognises the <b>Longneck,</b> Marine Saurian and Super-eel categories in this blog as well, with the modification that the Marine Saurian as spoken of by Champagne is more likely a large crocodile akin to the saltwater crocodile and {{that there has been}} a suggestion that an eel-like animal is involved in certain [...] "Many-finned" [...] observations. The whale categories he identifies are: BC 2A-Possible Odobenocetops, BC2B, Atlantic gray whale or Scrag Whale, BC 4B, as being similar to an unidentified large-finned beaked whale otherwise reported in the Pacific, and BC 5, the large Father-of-All-the-Turtles, as a humpback whale turned turtle.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{noticing that}} every treesweet is gone, all the dinosaurs {{in the valley}} are {{standing}} in front of the tree; many of them, including Topsy, suspecting Littlefoot to be the guilty party. Littlefoot, afraid to admit it was his fault that the treesweets fell off the tree, blames everything on the tiny <b>longnecks.</b> At first, no one believes him, but when they see evidence of tiny teeth marks on a tree sweet, he is believed and everyone starts looking for the tiny <b>longnecks,</b> preparing to drive them out of the valley once they have been found. As Littlefoot and Cera are searching the valley, Littlefoot falls down a pothole in the ground where, it turns out, the tiny <b>longnecks</b> are hiding in. First being afraid of them, Littlefoot flees deeper into the cave; but soon enough, he finds out that the tiny <b>longnecks</b> are not as bad as he thought and befriends them. Upon hearing how difficult it is for the tinysauruses to find food, he promises to help bring them as many treestars as he can every night.|$|R
5000|$|Littlefoot's herd {{reaches a}} large crater where {{hundreds}} of <b>Longnecks</b> have gathered. There, he meets his father, Bron, for the first time. After been separated from his mate in an earthshake, he has become guardian to a young Brachiosaurus, Shorty, who becomes jealous of Littlefoot taking all of his father's attention. Meanwhile, Pat shares to Littlefoot's friends that the <b>Longnecks</b> are being driven by a tradition involving a solar eclipse, which was taken {{as a sign that}} the Sun will be sent crashing down into the Earth. Every solar eclipse, <b>Longnecks</b> from all around the world gather in one location to stretch their necks up and [...] "catch" [...] the Sun, so they can propel it back up into the sky. Soon after, Pat steps into a pool of magma, which scalds his leg, but he is still able to move.|$|R

50|$|A North American <b>longneck</b> {{is a type}} of {{beer bottle}} with a long neck. It is known as the {{standard}} <b>longneck</b> bottle or industry standard bottle (ISB). The ISB longnecks have a uniform capacity, height, weight and diameter and can be reused on average 16 times. The U.S. ISB <b>longneck</b> is 355 ml. In Canada, in 1992, the large breweries all agreed to use a 341 ml <b>longneck</b> bottle of standard design (named AT2), thus replacing the traditional stubby bottle and an assortment of brewery-specific long-necks which had come into use in the mid-1980s.|$|E

"It's Not Over" [...] was {{previously}} recorded by Chesnutt {{on his third}} album, 1992's <b>Longnecks</b> & Short Stories, and before that by Reba McEntire on her 1984 album My Kind of Country. The version included on this album {{is the same as}} on <b>Longnecks</b> & Short Stories. Chesnutt chose to include it because he felt that it should have been released as a single from the original album, and suggested that it be included to replace another song that he felt did not fit thematically {{with the rest of the}} album.|$|R

5000|$|Eventually, Littlefoot feels {{ready to}} tell his friends about the colony of tiny <b>longnecks</b> living in the {{underground}} caverns. They all {{get to see the}} tiny <b>longnecks</b> for themselves, and promises not to tell the adults. Even Cera, who is still angry with her father, promises to keep it secret, mainly because she finds out that she can relate more to them than she would've imagined. Many of the tinysauruses in the colony feel that their leader, Big Daddy, bosses them around a bit too much, though he simply wants their best. As to the reason that he doesn't trust the [...] "bigger" [...] dinosaurs is that they, in his opinion, only seem to think: [...] "Because they're bigger, it makes them more important".|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} few days, {{incidents}} of bad luck plague the Valley. After a tornado hits the Valley, the adults blame Doc, as the misfortunes apparently occurred after his arrival, while Littlefoot blames himself and his friends, recalling the breaking of Saurus Rock. Eager to exonerate Doc, Littlefoot attempts {{to take one of}} the Sharptooth's teeth to replace the broken stone. In the process, he discovers the Sharptooth is still alive. During the chase, Littlefoot is attacked by another Sharptooth, and Grandpa and Doc intervene, having been led there by Littlefoot's friends. The two <b>Longnecks</b> work together to pull down a category of rocks and crush the carnivores to death. After the Sharpteeth are down by the rocks (where the two <b>longnecks</b> have encased them into), one of the teeth from the Allosaurus falls out and lands on the ground. Then the children use the tooth (from the Allosaurus) for Saurus Rock.|$|R

5000|$|Stubbies are {{a type of}} bottle {{which is}} shorter and with a {{slightly}} larger diameter than the now predominant <b>longneck</b> bottle. Starting in 1962 almost all beer in Canada was sold in stubbies (with 341ml of content) until the beer companies chose to switch to the American-style <b>longneck</b> bottle, between 1982 and 1986. The last major label to {{be available in the}} stubby was Labatt's Crystal which switched to the <b>longneck</b> in the summer of 1986. Brick Brewery of Waterloo began selling Red Cap Ale in Stubby's as recently as the mid 2000s, although this may no longer be the case. At least a few craft breweries also use this bottle format.|$|E
