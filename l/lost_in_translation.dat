5|$|In Variety opinion, Johansson's {{roles in}} <b>Lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>Translation</b> and Girl with a Pearl Earring {{established}} her {{as among the}} most versatile actresses of her generation. Johansson had five releases in 2004, three of which—the teen heist film The Perfect Score, the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long, and the drama A Good Woman—were critical and commercial failures. Co-starring with John Travolta, Johansson played a discontented and suspicious teenager in A Love Song for Bobby Long, {{which is based on}} the novel Off Magazine Street by Ronald Everett Capps. Variety David Rooney wrote that Johansson's and Travolta's portrayals rescued the film. Johansson earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama nomination for the film.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{shifted to}} adult roles in 2003 with her {{performances}} in <b>Lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>Translation</b> (for which {{she won a}} BAFTA Award for Best Actress) and Girl with a Pearl Earring.

Other films during this period include the mystery thriller The Prestige (2006) and the comedy-drama Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). She also released two albums: Anywhere I Lay My Head (2008) and Break Up (2009), both of which charted on the Billboard 200.|$|E

25|$|Valéry's {{technique}} is quite orthodox in its essentials. His verse rhymes and scans in conventional ways, {{and it has}} {{much in common with}} the work of Mallarmé.

5000|$|Much later, Martin Heidegger {{said that}} the {{original}} {{meaning of the word}} ousia was <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> its <b>translation</b> to the Latin, and, subsequently, <b>in</b> its <b>translation</b> to modern languages. For him, ousia means Being, not substance, that is, not some thing or some being that [...] "stood"(-stance) [...] "under"(sub-). Moreover, he also uses the bi-nomial parousia-apousia, denoting presence-absence, and hypostasis denoting existence.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the meaning and detail <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the <b>translation</b> of the director's words, the two central characters in the film—Bob and Charlotte—are also <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> other ways.

Micah {{describes}} {{the destruction of the}} lesser towns of Judah (referring to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib, 701BC).

For example, the inhabitants of Beth-le-aphrah (“house of dust”) are told to “roll yourselves in the dust.” 1:14. Though most of the Paronomasia is <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>translation,</b> it is the equivalent of ‘Ashdod shall be but ashes,’ where the fate of the city matches its name.|$|E
