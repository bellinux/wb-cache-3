On 26 July 2005, the airline went into administration and all EUjet flights ended, along with all non-freight operations at the airport, owing to financial difficulties with the airline and airport owner, PlaneStation. Their business plan was ambitious and when the bank lenders foreclosed many passengers were left stranded abroad. London Manston Airport plc went into <b>liquidation.</b> <b>Operations</b> then temporarily ceased, and Manston's aerodrome traffic zone and radar services were suspended, until after a new buyer could be found.|$|E

The world was struck by natural disasters during its long history. As well as the strengthening of natural disasters, {{the appearance of the}} disasters caused by human activity has been increasing in recent times, and at present and their after-affects are more destructive. This diploma is taken as a overall cross { [...] } sectional study of the topic of logistic indemnity of medical interference within the area of multiple victim accidents. After a brief approach of the history of prehospital care the diploma is focused on legislative regulation of this theme including processing of emergency plans and traumatological plans, financing of crisis set-ups, special training, procedure of salvage and <b>liquidation</b> <b>operations</b> of the units of integrated rescue systems and logistic indemnity of medical interference in the form of material and technical special equipment including human sources and psychological support.

Magwitz, the {{commander}} of the Teschen headquarters of Gestapo, and targeted innocent victims, never involved in the guerilla operation. Their only guilt was in their opposition to the German assimilation program, preserving their Polish or Czech identity. The corpses were transferred from Orlová to Životice when the war was over. On 25 September 1949, a memorial by Franciszek Świder, a Karviná-based sculptor, was unveiled to commemorate the Životice victims. In 1984, a new building was opened next to the memorial to accommodate the exhibition Occupation and Resistance Movement in Cieszyn Silesia 1938-1944. The memorial is dedicated to all victims of German occupation, commemorating the suffering of local residents. This massacre is known as Tragedia Żywocicka in Polish or Životická tragédie in Czech.|$|R

His particular forte was the liternoye (top secret) or <b>liquidation</b> <b>operation.</b> He engineered the assassination of the Ukrainian nationalist Yevhen Konovalets in Rotterdam in May 1938, the execution of the defector Ignace Reiss in Switzerland in September 1937, and the kidnapping of the leader of Russian All-Military Union (ROVS), General Evgenii Miller, in France in September 1937. It has also been suggested that he was the mastermind behind the murder-decapitation of the Trotskyist leader of the Fourth International, Rudolf Klement, in France in July 1938, and the murder of the defector Georges Agabekov in France in 1937. When Slutsky died in February 1938, poisoned by order of Nikolai Yezhov, Spigelglas became the acting director of foreign intelligence.|$|R

Hookers licence-built the Gnôme engine, amongst other things, and for the aero engines chose to be known as The British Gnôme and Le Rhône Engine Co. They had become expert at working Y alloy. The post-war {{reduction}} in demand, and the plentiful supply of war-surplus engines, made times hard for all engine and component makers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present certain trends in the {{distribution}} of value created by businesses for groups of stakeholders as part of a conception of sustainable growth. The subject of this analysis is the LW Bogdanka S. A. mining company, which was studied in terms of distribution of value for the period from 2009 to 2015. In this paper, the main stakeholders of the operation were identified as the shareholders, capital providers, employees, suppliers, local governments and the state. A method for measuring distributed value based on cash flow is demonstrated.

This foundation financed the ship up {{until the end of the}} journey to China and in 2010, its economical commitment ended. The second foundation, a non-profitable foundation, for the ship was created shortly afterwards. The business is operated by The Swedish East India Company Ltd. In January 2011, questions were raised about the future of the ship. The Gothenburg Municipality was willing to pay for the ongoing maintenance of the ship if sponsors made contributions for the expeditions and other activities. An immediate <b>liquidation</b> of the <b>operation</b> and turning the ship into a museum was also suggested. In February 2011, the future plans for the ship were postponed by the Västra Götaland Regional Council.|$|R

40|$|Water is {{basis of}} the {{existence}} of life on earth and its invaluable because it’s an essential requirement for all the human beings but, presently water preparation and processing systems are suffering from different problems such as real-time operations problems, loss of large amounts of water in the <b>liquidation</b> and distribution <b>operations,</b> less amount of water sources, i. e. The increase in water problems coincides with the increase in population numbers and residential areas such as (water distribution, consumption, Interrupted water sources problems as well as water quality). Therefore, to eliminate these problems and make more efficient water systems, effective and reliable there is necessity for accurate monitoring and proper controlling system. In this paper, we are focusing on the design of water system in real-time and on the continuous monitoring of water based on IoT cloud computing and Arduino microcontroller. Water system with proper control algorithm and continuous monitoring any place and any time makes a stable distribution so that, we can have a record of height of water in tanks and we can change the devices status in the plant. Internet of things is a network of physical connected objects equipped with software, electronics circuits, sensors, and network connection part which allow monitoring and controlling anywhere around the world. Through using cloud computing proved by free severs, the water system’s data continuously is uploaded to cloud allowing the real time monitoring operation by the use of sensors and microcontroller (Arduino) as Minicomputer to control and monitor the system operation from cloud with efficient (client to server) connection...|$|R
