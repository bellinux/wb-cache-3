40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{validate}} optical segment tracking, a new method for in vivo human tibia deformation measurements and to assess bending in a three-point bending test. The approach relies upon optical motion capturing of reflecting marker clusters affixed to the bone via screws inserted three millimeters into the corticalis in local anesthesia. The method was tested in five healthy subjects. Screws were left in place for six to eight hours and a variety of exercises performed. A pain questionnaire was used to assess pain levels. PQCT-images were taken to <b>locate</b> <b>screw</b> holes in the bone. A three-point bending test was performed and repeatability evaluated.

40|$|Distraction osteogenesis is {{a common}} {{clinical}} procedure to correct mandibular retrognathia cases. In spite of consolidated clinical use, lots of questions still remain to be answered concerning distraction osteogenesis. One of them {{is to determine the}} best screw configuration providing boneremodelling in a healthy way due to the stabilization of callus. In this study, some suggestions will be presented about the points “what best screw locations are” and “what the optimum screw quantity is”. A three dimensional solid model was obtained by processing patient-specific computed tomography data in DICOM format. Teeth, cortical and trabecular bone segments were modelled separately with the segmentation process. Ramus and corpus segments were separated from each other by virtual surgery and corpus segment was positioned 11 mm forward. The distractors modelled were assembled into the mandible after modelling the callus. The volume meshes created for all the parts were transferred to a finite element software. Finite element analyses were run as bilaterally symmetric which means the same screw configurations were set for both sides of the mandible. The studies carried out in this paper have shown that <b>screws</b> <b>located</b> closer to the osteotomy line provide more stability, and triangular configuration has a better impact on stability than linear configuration. The reference stabilization case was identified as the scenario of using 22 screws in total, including 8 screws in ramus segment and 14 screws in corpus segment. This case was assumed as maximum stabilization case and other analyses were compared with this result. The results of the configuration including triangularly <b>located</b> 3 <b>screws</b> in ramus segment and closely <b>located</b> 2 <b>screws</b> near the osteotomy line in corpus segment have shown similarity with the reference stabilization case.

40|$|The idea we are {{developing}} is the Vex screw sorter. Our screw sorter {{is intended to}} sort Vex screws based on their size/length. The problem is that people cannot sort their screws efficiently and machines cannot sort screws accurately. We have tried many ideas and designs {{but none of them}} seem to work as good as we hoped. Our concept is to put pegs along a plexiglass surface. The head of the screw will move along the top edge of a piece of plexi‐glass on a downhill angle. The pegs will have a tripping effect on the screws and eliminate their route starting from longest to shortest. After the screw is knocked off the plexiglass it will fall into a bin underneath the peg corresponding to its length. To get the screws to this point, we will dump them into a V‐shaped funnel system in which the screw is hanging from the bottom point of the V. This system will work efficiently, accurately, and hopefully solve the burden of sorting screw by hand. This system will save the time and energy of engineering students and teachers having to divide and <b>locate</b> <b>screws.</b> The time it currently takes to sort screws takes away from teachers educating their students and students working on their projects.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} in vitro biomechanical {{properties}} of a 4. 5 mm narrow locking compression plate (PIP-LCP) with 2 abaxially <b>located</b> transarticular <b>screws</b> and a 4. 5 mm limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) with 2 abaxially <b>located</b> transarticular <b>screws</b> using equine pasterns. Study Design: Experimental. Paired in vitro biomechanical testing of 2 methods for stabilizing adult equine forelimb PIP joints. Animal: Adult equine forelimbs (n= 8 pairs). Methods: Each pair of PIP joints were randomly instrumented {{with either a}} PIP-LCP or LC-DCP plate axially and 2 parasagitally positioned 5. 5 mm transarticular screws. The proximal aspect of the proximal phalanx (P 1) and the distal aspect of the middle phalanx (P 2) were embedded to allow for mounting on a mechanical testing machine. Each construct was tested in both cyclic and subsequently single cycle to failure in 4 -point bending. The displacement required to maintain a target load of 1 kN over 3600 cycles at 1 Hz was recorded. Maximum bending moment at failure and construct stiffness was calculated from the single cycle to failure testing. Results: In cyclic testing, significantly more displacement occurred in the LC-DCP (0. 46 ± 0. 10 mm) than for the PIP-LCP (0. 17 ± 0. 11 mm) constructs (P=. 016). During single cycle testing {{there was no significant}} difference in the bending moment between the LC-DCP (148. 7 ± 19. 4 Nm) and the PIP-LCP (164. 6 ± 17. 6 Nm) constructs (P=. 553) and the stiffness of the LC-DCP (183. 9 ± 26. 9 Nmm) was significantly lower than for the PIP-LCP (279. 8 ± 15. 9 N/mm) constructs (P=. 011). All constructs failed by fracture of the bone associated with the transarticular screws and subsequently bending of the plates at the middle hole.

40|$|Twenty-eight feline pelves (56 hemipelves) were {{examined}} {{in order to identify}} the location for optimal sacroiliac screw placement in sacroiliac fracture-luxation repair. A drill hole was started on the median plane of the hemipelvis in the centre of the body of the first sacral segment until it penetrated the lateral cortex of the ilial wing, thus providing optimal drill hole placement. The position of the drill hole on the articular surface of the sacral wing and on the lateral surface of the ilial wing was measured. The distance of the drill hole from the cranial margin of the sacral wing was 51 % of sacral wing length, just cranial to the crescent shaped hyaline cartilage. The distance from the dorsal margin was 47 % of sacral wing height. The drill bit direction has to be adjusted to the cranio-caudal inclination (range 10 ° to 29 °) and dorso-ventral inclination (range 2 ° to 25 °) of the sacral wing. A notch in the cranial edge of the sacral wing was present, with variable position, in 34 % of the specimens and is consequently not a useful landmark for sacroiliac screw placement.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for the fault {{diagnosis}} of complex structures {{based on an}} optimized virtual beam-like structure approach. A complex structure {{can be regarded as}} a combination of numerous virtual beam-like structures considering the vibration transmission path from vibration sources to each sensor. The structural ‘virtual beam’ consists of a sensor chain automatically obtained by an Improved Bacterial Optimization Algorithm (IBOA). The biologically inspired optimization method (i. e. IBOA) is proposed for solving the discrete optimization problem associated with the selection of the optimal virtual beam for fault diagnosis. This novel virtual beam-like-structure approach needs less or little prior knowledge. Neither does it require stationary response data, nor is it confined to a specific structure design. It is easy to implement within a sensor network attached to the monitored structure. The proposed fault diagnosis method has been tested on the detection of loosening <b>screws</b> <b>located</b> at varying positions in a real satellite-like model.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{condensed}} {{version of the}} author's thesis [Bolles 1976], which investigates a subclass of visual information processing referred to as verification vision (abbreviated VV). VV uses {{a model of a}} scene to locate objects of interest in a picture of the scene. The characteristics that distinguish VV from the other types of visual information processing are: (1) the system {{has a great deal of}} prior knowledge about the type, placement, and appearance of the objects that form the scene and (2) the goal is to verify and refine the location of one or more objects in the scene. VV includes a significant portion of the visual feedback tasks required within programmable assembly. For example, <b>locating</b> a <b>screw</b> hole and determining the relative displacement between a screw and the screw hole are both VV tasks. Two types of VV tasks are discussed in the thesis: inspection and location. This paper only discusses location tasks, but essentially the same capabilities are required for both types of tasks. This paper describes (1) a structure for a VV system that makes it easier for programmers who are not experts in computer vision to program VV feedback, and (2) a set of combination rules that are capable of using the results of several different types of operators to estimate the confidences and precisions that are necessary within VV. An interactive VV system based upon these ideas has been implemented. It helps the programmer select potentially useful operator/feature pairs, provides a training session to gather statistics on the behavior of the operators, automatically ranks the operator/feature pairs according to their expected contributions, and performs the desired task.

40|$|Background: The best {{operative}} {{management for}} open-book pelvic injury with anterior sacroiliac disruption (OTA/AO B 1. 1 classification) is still debated. This biomechanical study aimed {{to find the}} best internal fixation technique for such injury. Methods: Open-book injury with anterior sacroiliac joint disruption was simulated on 25 artificial pelvic bones. Twenty five artificial pelvic bones were divided into 5 groups (n= 5 /group) and fixated with five different fixation techniques: 1). 1 SP+ 1 IS; 2). 2 SP; 3). 2 SP+ 2 SIP; 4). 1 SP+ 2 IS S 1, and 5). 1 SP+ 1 IS S 1 +S 2. Biomechanical properties of each fixation technique were assessed using Tensilon® RTF- 1310 to measure the resistance to translation and load to failure. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Bonferroni test. Results: The highest mean load to failure of axial forces (1490. 36 N) was achieved by the fixation technique using one symphyseal plate and two iliosacral <b>screws</b> <b>located</b> at S 1 dan S 2. The addition of one iliosacral screw significantly increased the mean load to failure for axial compression (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The addition of sacroiliac joint posterior fixation, either with plate or screw, will increase the fixation biomechanical strength. Single symphyseal plate and two iliosacral screws on S 1 and S 2 provided the best mechanical resistance to axial loading. Thus, it can be concluded that such fixation technique is best for open-book pelvic injury with anterior sacroiliac disruption. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Bone {{deformation}} stimulates {{bone and}} {{is crucial for}} astronauts during space flight. Knowledge on bone deformation during activities could help improve astronaut training and osteoporosis treatment. A new method for in vivo bone deformation measurements {{was developed by the}} authors, offering technical advantages over previous approaches. Using motion capturing, it computes deformation from the relative displacement between reflective markers attached to the bone via screws. This technique is less invasive than strain gauges attached to the bone surface. However, feasibility of the approach had been almost unanimously rejected by colleagues and experts in the up-run for this study. Their main concerns were pain and infection. Materials and Methods: Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate feasibility regarding surgical technique, pain, risk of infection, bleeding and wound healing in five healthy subjects between 26 and 50 years of age (mean 37. 2 years +/- 7. 8). Three titanium screws were inserted 3 mm into the cortical bone of the tibia in local anesthesia fig. 1). Screws were in place for 6 to 8 hours, during which a variety of exercises were performed including running, jumping, stairs and squats. A pain questionnaire was used to assess pain levels during experiments. The visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10 and open questions were employed. Bone scans were taken to <b>locate</b> and evaluate <b>screw</b> holes. Opening of the medulla would aggravate outcomes in case of infection. Results: Feasibility was good and screws remained in place throughout experiments. The average pain level throughout the experiment day was 0. Screw implantation and explantation can be done in local anesthesia, and a large number of exercises can be performed with only a minimum of pain medication. PQCT-images showed the bone medulla was not opened in any case. In the first subject, bleeding caused interruptions. This problem was controlled through size-reduction of skin incisions, application of ‘steri strips’ and extensive cauterization. Wound healing was without complications in all subjects. Discussion: The new optical method is feasible from a surgical point of view with astoundingly low levels of pain and discomfort. The threat of infection was minimized. Bleeding was efficiently reduced and wound healing was without complications. The new method is feasible from a surgical point of view and opens a variety of options for new clinical and scientific applications...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. In part 1 of the study, the morphometry of {{thoracic}} pedicles and bony landmarks for {{pedicle screw}} placement were evaluated. In part 2, pedicle screws were inserted in fresh cadavers, {{using a different}} entry point in {{the left and right}} pedicles. Objectives. To identify the safest entry point and screw orientation for pedicle screws in the thoracic spine. Summary of Background Data. A few morphometric investigations have been performed on thoracic vertebrae, but the safest technique for screw insertion in thoracic pedicles has not been analyzed. Methods. Mean, range, and standard deviations of pedicle transverse diameter and pedicle orientation were measured in 99 dried thoracic vertebrae. We evaluated the position of the bottom of the superior facet and that of the superior border of the transverse process in relation {{to the center of the}} pedicle. The relation between the pedicle axis and the superior facet in the frontal plane was also assessed. In part 2 of the study, pedicle screws were inserted in fresh cadavers at the intersection between the superior border of the transverse process and the middle of the superior facet (entry point A) and between the former and the lateral two thirds of the facet (entry point B). Results. The smallest transverse diameter was found at T 6 (mean 4. 3 mm) where pedicles measured less than 5 mm in 68 % of the specimens. In the frontal plane, the pedicle axis intersected the middle of the superior facet inn 15 % of specimens, the lateral two-thirds in 62 %, and the lateral border of the facet in 23 %. Of the 126 screws inserted in fresh human cadavers, 15 (24 %) of the screws inserted using entry point A and 10 (16 %) of those inserted using entry point B violated the pedicle cortex (P < 0. 05). Six (10 %) of the screws inserted using entry point A compared with no screw inserted using entry point B penetrated the anterior vertebral cortex (P = 0. 03). Conclusions. Pedicles between T 4 and T 8 may not be wide enough for screw fixation. An entry point for pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>located</b> at the intersection between the superior border of the transverse process and the lateral two thirds of the superior facet seems more likely to be line with the pedicle axis than do other entry points.

40|$|To {{create new}} types of cars, raise their reliability, gain {{operational}} life, and decrease in metal consumption of products {{it is necessary to}} improve mechanical, physical, and also special properties of the constructional materials applied in mechanical engineering. Presently, there are intensive researches and developments under way to create materials with ultrafine-grained structure (the sizes of grains in their crystal lattice make less than 1 micron in one of the measurements). BMSTU developed a manufacturing technology of multilayer steel sheets with steady ultrafine-grained structure based on the multiple hot rolling of billet as a composition consisting of the alternating metal sheets. A principled condition for implementation of such technology is existence of different crystallographic modifications in the adjoining sheets of the composition at specified temperature of rolling. Power parameters of rolling are important technical characteristics of the process. Usually, to determine a deformation resistance value when rolling the diverse multilayer materials, is used the actual resistance value averaging in relation to the components of the composition. The aim of this work is a comparative analysis of known calculated dependences with experimental data when rolling the 100 -layer samples. Objects of research were the 100 -layer compositions based on the alternating layers of steel 08 H 18 N 10 and U 8. Experimental samples represented the vacuumized capsules with height, width, and length of 53 mm x 53 mm x 200 mm, respectively, in which there were the 100 -layer packs from sheets, each of 0. 5 mm, based on the composition of steels (U 8 + 08 H 18 N 10). Rolling was made on the double-high mill with rolls of 160 mm in diameter during 19 passes to the thickness of 7 mm with the speed of 0, 1 m/s. Relative sinking in each pass was accepted to be equal 10 ± 2, 5 %. Rolling forces were measured by the strain-gauging method using the measuring cells, <b>located</b> under press <b>screws</b> of the mill. The oven thermocouple controlled a rolling temperature, and two pyrometers Optris CTlaser 3 MH 3 at the input and output parts of the mill made records. Comparison of the rolling forces of the multilayer composition U 8 + 08 H 18 N 10, which were received during experiment, with the calculated values, shows that with accumulative nature of deformations the real forces of rolling 1. 5 – 2 times exceed the calculated values. The analysis of experimental data showed illegality of using the averagely proportional value of the flow limit to calculate the rolling forces of compositions with the large number of the alternating thin layers of various steels. For calculations of the rolling forces of such super-multilayer materials, a deformation resistance of each composition ought to be determined using the experimental data. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the feasibility of integrating the cognitive architecture Soar with a robotic system to aid in the disassembly of electronic waste (e-waste). This study was broken up into different parts, first, to examine how well the different sensors and tools that composed the system worked before finally integrating the cognitive architecture Soar to assess how it improved the systems performance. Due to the increasing amounts of e-waste and the adverse effects it has on human health, a robotic system that can aid in the disassembly of e-waste is essential. ^ The first part in {{this study was to investigate}} the performance of three different models of the Microsoft Kinect sensor using the OpenNI driver from Primesense. The study explored the accuracy, repeatability, and resolution of the different Kinect models’ abilities to determine the distance to a planar target. An ANOVA analysis was performed to establish if the model of the Kinect, the operating temperature, or their interaction were significant factors in the Kinect’s ability to calculate the distance to the target. Different sized gauge blocks were also used to test how well a Kinect could reconstruct precise objects. Machinist blocks were used to examine how accurately the Kinect could reconstruct objects set up on an angle and determine the location of the center of a hole. All the Kinect models could determine the location of a target with a low standard deviation (less than 2 mm). At close distances, the resolutions of all the Kinect models were 1 mm. Through the ANOVA analysis, the best performing Kinect at close distances was the Kinect model 1414, and at farther distances was the Kinect model 1473. The internal temperature of the Kinect sensor influenced the distance reported by the sensor. Using different correction factors, the Kinect could determine the volume of a gauge block and the angles machinist blocks were setup at, with under a 10 percent error. ^ After the Kinect’s performance was characterized, the study continued and investigated the performance of an automated robotic system, which used a combination of vision and force sensing to remove screws from the back of laptops. This robotic system used two webcams, one that is fixed over the robot and the other mounted on the robot, as well as a sensor-equipped (SE) screwdriver. Experimental studies were conducted to test the performance of the SE screwdriver and vision system. The parameters that were varied included the internal brightness settings on the webcams, the method in which the workspace was illuminated, and color of the laptop case. A localized light source and a higher brightness setting as the laptop’s case became darker produced the best results. In this study, the SE screwdriver successfully removed 96. 5 % of the screws from laptops. ^ Since a method to <b>locate</b> and remove <b>screws</b> from a laptop automatically, and guidelines to find holes based on the laptop color and camera brightness were established, the study continued and added the cognitive architecture language Soar to the system. Soar’s long term memory module, semantic memory, was used to remember pieces of information regarding laptop models and screw holes. The system was trained with multiple laptop models, and the method in which Soar was used to facilitate the removal of screw was varied to determine the best performance of the system. In all cases, Soar could determine the correct laptop model and in what orientation it was placed in the system. Remembering the locations of holes decreased all the trial times for all the different laptop models by at least 60 %. The system performed the best when the amount of training trials that were used to explore circle locations was limited as this decreased the total trial time by over 10 % for most laptop models and orientations. ...|$|R
