500|$|Whitemore, {{along with}} Hagley, has {{historically}} {{had one of}} the highest concentrations of stud farms breeding pedigree livestock, in Australia. In the 1950s there were more than 100 registered studs within [...] of the town's centre. The Poll Dorset, an important breed in prime <b>lamb</b> <b>production</b> in Australia, was first bred at a Whitemore stud. Whitemore farmers, the French family, began breeding Ryeland lambs in early 21st century. The family had originally farmed this breed in the 1930s, but it had now become uncommon in Australia due to changing fashions in meat. The Heazlewood family breeds the Border Leicester, another sheep breed that is now uncommon in Australia. The family was honoured by the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania in 2013 for their involvement in the Tasmanian sheep industry over the previous one hundred years.|$|E
500|$|Forage {{conversion}} to milk with Shetland ewes is excellent, {{second only to}} Lleyn ewes in the UK. Because of the Shetland ewe's forage conversion efficiency, lamb growth is fast. A good Shetland ewe on adequate forage can wean off 150% of her body weight in purebred twins by fall. Some ewes wean singles nearly as big as themselves. A heavier Shetland ewe at 80 lbs (36 kg) can wean 60 lb (27 kg) purebred twins. What makes the Shetland ewe an optimal maternal base for grassfed <b>lamb</b> <b>production</b> is her prowess in producing hybrid market lambs: take the same ewe and breed her to, for example, a Leicester, Texel, Charollais or Berrichon ram, and keep her on the same pasture management system. In some flocks, ewes can wean off pairs of 90 lb (40 kg) twins at only 120-150 days old- each crossbred lamb weighing more than their dam.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of creep feeding and creep grazing on the pasture characteristics and on performance and productivity of sheep. Three systems of <b>lambs</b> <b>production</b> on Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp.) pastures oversown with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) were studied: lambs with dams until slaughter without supplementation (1); lambs with dams until slaughter fed concentrate in creep feeders at 2 % BW. day- 1 (2); and lambs with dams until slaughter and supplemented with white clover (Trifolium repens) in creep grazing system ad libitum (3). The characteristics of the pasture did not differ (P> 0. 05) among the systems. Individual lamb growth was higher with creep feeding (307 g/day) and creep grazing (274 g/day) compared to no supplemented systems (204 g/day; p< 0. 05). Animal productivity per area on supplemented treatments (2. 4 kg BW/ha/day) was significantly greater than no supplemented one (1. 8 kg BW/ha/day; p< 0. 05).

5000|$|In New Zealand, {{nearly half}} of {{anthropogenic}} greenhouse gas emission is associated with agriculture, which {{plays a major role}} in the nation’s economy, and a large fraction of this is assignable to the livestock industry. [...] Some fraction of this is assignable to meat production: FAO data indicate that meat accounted for about 7 percent of product tonnage from New Zealand's livestock (including poultry) in 2010. [...] Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents, according to US EPA figures compiled using UNFCCC methodologies. [...] Not all forms of meat and animal-based foods affect the environment equally. One study estimates that red meats are 150% more greenhouse gas intensive than chicken or fish. [...] According to another research group, the ranking of some food products in relation to greenhouse gas emissions is lamb (#1), beef (#2), cheese (#3), and pork (#4).

The other two ‘systems’ were based on a self-replacing composite breed (Romney × Coopworth base) and the lambs were sold as finished slaughter lambs or stores. Based on the assumptions used the analysis highlighted that the potential economic gain per unit change was high for several factors examined and the relative importance of these critical control points differed between production systems.
