40|$|This paper {{presents}} the 2 D FEM {{which used to}} calculate the dynamic electromagnetic torque of TRL 5 magnetic <b>latching</b> <b>relay</b> in ANSYS. The operation principle of magnetic <b>latching</b> <b>relay</b> is introduced and the generation mechanism of Lorenz forces is analyzed as well. The magnetic theory applied to obtain the electromagnetic torque of the magnetic <b>latching</b> <b>relay</b> actuator is discussed by the authors. Furthermore, the Maxwell stress tensor and virtual work methods, which are employed in ANSYS to calculate the electromagnetic torque are investigated. The coordinates’ variation characteristics of the yoke and permanent magnet during the whole operation of relay shows that the dynamic electromagnetic torque can be calculated by using coordinate changes. Thus, we transform the dynamic solution into a static solution successfully, which reduces the difficulty and complexity of modeling and calculation greatly. Finally, the calculation sample of TRL 5 magnetic <b>latching</b> <b>relay</b> is given to explain the modeling process in ANSYS. The simulation results indicate that the electromagnetic torque increases with the increase of the rotation angle and it reaches the maximum when the armature pulls in completely...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>latching</b> <b>relay</b> (also called [...] "impulse", [...] "keep", or [...] "stay" [...] relays) {{maintains}} either contact position indefinitely {{without power}} {{applied to the}} coil. The advantage is that one coil consumes power only for an instant while the relay is being switched, and the relay contacts retain this setting across a power outage. A <b>latching</b> <b>relay</b> allows remote control of building lighting without the hum that may be produced from a continuously (AC) energized coil.|$|R

50|$|Some early {{computers}} used ordinary relays {{as a kind}} of latch—they store bits {{in ordinary}} wire spring relays or reed relays by feeding an output wire back as an input, resulting in a feedback loop or sequential circuit. Such an electrically latching relay requires continuous power to maintain state, unlike magnetically <b>latching</b> <b>relays</b> or mechanically racheting relays.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic <b>latching</b> <b>relays</b> {{can have}} either single or dual coils.

50|$|The {{computer}} controlled the magnetic <b>latching</b> <b>relays</b> by Signal Distributors (SD) packaged in the Universal Trunk frames, Junctor frames, or in Miscellaneous Trunk frames, {{according to which}} they were numbered as USD, JSD or MSD. SD were originally contact trees of 30-contact wire spring relays, each driven by a flipflop. Each magnetic latching relay had one transfer contact dedicated to sending a pulse back to the SD, on each operate and release. The pulser in the SD detected this pulse to determine that the action had occurred, or else alerted the maintenance software to print a FSCAN report. In later 1AESS versions SD were solid state with several SD points per circuit pack generally on the same shelf or adjacent shelf to the trunk pack.|$|E

40|$|As a {{spacecraft}} performs its mission, various loads {{are connected to}} the spacecraft power bus in response to commands from an on board computer, a function called power distribution. For the Mariner Mark II set of planetary missions, the power bus is 30 volts dc and when loads are connected or disconnected, both the bus and power return side must be switched. In addition, the power distribution function must be immune to single point failures and, when power is first applied, all switches must be in a known state. Traditionally, these requirements have been met by electromechanical <b>latching</b> <b>relays.</b> This paper describes a solid state switch which not only satisfies the requirements but incorporates several additional features including soft turn on, programmable current trip point with noise immunity, instantaneous current limiting, and direct telemetry of load currents and switch status.

The primary focus of this thesis is to explore deterministic methods for the global optimization of hybrid systems. While the areas of modeling, simulation and sensitivity analysis of hybrid systems have received much attention, there are many challenging difficulties associated with the optimization of such systems. The contents of this thesis represent the first steps toward deterministic global optimization of hybrid systems in the continuous time domain. There are various reasons for wanting to solve optimization problems globally. (cont.) In particular, there are many applications which demand that the global solution be found, for example, formal safety verification problems and parameter estimation problems. In the former case, a suboptimal local solution could falsely indicate that all safety specifications are met, leading to disastrous consequences if, in actuality, a global solution exists which provides a counter example that violates some safety specification. In the latter case, a suboptimal local solution could falsely indicate that a proposed model structure did not match experimental data in a statistically significant manner, leading to the false rejection of a valid model structure. In addition, for many optimization problems in engineering, the presence of nonlinear equality constraints makes the optimization problem nonconvex such that local optimization methods can often fail to produce a single feasible point, even though the problem is indeed feasible. The control parameterization framework is employed for the solution of the optimization problem with continuous time hybrid systems embedded. A major difficulty of such a framework {{lies in the fact that}} the mode sequence of the embedded hybrid system changes in the space of the optimization decision variables for most nontrivial problems. (cont.) This makes the resulting optimization problem nonsmooth because the parametric sensitivities of the hybrid system do not exist everywhere, thus invalidating efficient gradient based optimization solvers. In this thesis, the general optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems, and tackled individually: (a) when the mode sequence is fixed, and the transition times are fixed; (b) when the mode sequence is allowed to vary, and the transition times are fixed; and (c) when the mode sequence is fixed, and the transition times are allowed to vary. Because even these subproblems are nontrivial to solve, this thesis focuses on hybrid systems with linear time varying ordinary differential equations describing the continuous dynamics, and proposes various methods to exploit the linear structure. However, in the course of solving the last subproblem, a convexity theory for general, nonlinear hybrid systems is developed, which can be easily extended for general, nonlinear hybrid systems. Subproblem (a) is the easiest to solve. A convexity theory is presented that allows convex relaxations of general, nonconvex Bolza type functions to be constructed for the optimization problem. This allows a deterministic branch-and-bound framework to be employed for the global optimization of the subproblem. (cont.) Subproblems (b) and (c) are much more difficult to solve, and require the exploitation of structure. For subproblem (b), a hybrid superstructure is proposed that enables the linear structure to be retained. A branch-and-cut framework with a novel dynamic bounds tightening heuristic is proposed, and it is shown that the generation of cuts from dynamic bounds tightening can have a dramatic impact on the solution of the problem. For subproblem (c), a time transformation is employed to transform the problem into one with fixed transition times, but nonlinear dynamics. A convexity theory is developed for constructing convex relaxations of general, nonconvex Bolza type functions with the nonlinear hybrid system embedded, along with the development of bounding methods, based on the theory of differential inequalities. A novel bounding technique that exploits the time transformation is also introduced, which can provide much tighter bounds than that furnished utilizing differential inequalities. by Cha Kun Lee.

The <b>latching</b> <b>relay</b> on the battery power line can be switched by a voltage signal from the external board to start using the batteries just before deployment of the magnetometer system from the vessel.

(4 lines x 40 characters per line x 6 bits per character= 960 bits in one delay line) They were also used very successfully in several models of early desktop electronic calculator, including the Friden EC-130 (1964) and EC-132, the Olivetti Programma 101 desktop programmable calculator introduced in 1965, and the Litton Monroe Epic 2000 and 3000 programmable calculators of 1967.|$|R
