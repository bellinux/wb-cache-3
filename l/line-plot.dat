40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the need for}} better representations of aquifer architecture to understand hydraulic connectivity and manage groundwater allocations for the ~ 140 m-thick alluvial sequences in the Lower Namoi Catchment, Australia. In the 1980 s, an analysis of palynological and groundwater hydrograph data resulted in a simple three-layer stratigraphic/hydrostratigraphic representation for the aquifer system, consisting of an unconfined aquifer overlying two semi-confined aquifers. We present an analysis of 278 borehole lithological logs within the catchment and show that the stratigraphy is far more complex. The architectural features and the net-to-gross <b>line-plot</b> of the valley-filling sequence are best represented by a distributive fluvial system, where the avulsion frequency increases at a slower rate than the aggradation rate. We also show that an improved understanding of past climates contextualises the architectural features observable in the valley-filling sequence, and that the lithofacies distribution captures information {{about the impact of}} climate change during the Neogene and Quaternary. We {{demonstrate the}} correlation between climate and the vertical lithological succession by correlating the sediment net-to-gross ratio <b>line-plot</b> with the marine benthic oxygen isotope <b>line-plot</b> - a climate change proxy. Pollens indicate that there was a transition from a relatively wet climate in the mid-late Miocene to a drier climate in the Pleistocene, with a continuing drying trend until present. Groundwater is currently extracted from the sand and gravel belts associated with the high-energy wetter climate. However, some of these channel belts are disconnected from the modern river and flood zone. We show that the cutoff between the hydraulically well- and poorly connected portions of the valley-filling sequence matches the connectivity threshold expected from a fluvial system. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} code Blackthorn {{has been written}} to model the radiography of an imploding fusion target using an x-ray backlighter. Blackthorn traces x rays from the backlighter source through the target to a camera, which is at an arbitrary viewing angle. Blackthorn can model the target at any specified time and x-ray energy, drawing a contour plot that imitates an actual image produced by an x-ray backlighter, including self-emission, {{from the perspective of}} the viewing position. Input files from a {{computer code}} SAGE, which contains a 3 D grid of center of mass radius, are combined with input files from another code, LILAC, which contains 1 D profiles of mass density and electron temperature versus radius, to produce a 3 D representation of the target density. The capabilities of Blackthorn are illustrated by application to a f usion target proposed for shock-ignition polar-drive experiments on t he National Ignition Facility (NIF). A view from the polar position can be u sed to diagnose the azimuthal uniformity of the target, while a view from the equator can be used to diagnose the balance of compression between the polar and eq uatorial positions.

40|$|Mining and {{underground}} archaeology are two {{domains of}} expertise where three-dimensional data take {{an important part}} in the associated researches. Up to now, archaeologists study mines and underground networks from <b>line-plot</b> surveys, cross-section of galleries, and from tool marks surveys. All this kind of information can be clearly recorded back from the field from threedimensional models with a more cautious and extensive approach. Besides, the volumes of the underground structures that are very important data to explain the mining activities are difficult to evaluate from "traditional" hand-made recordings. They can now be calculated more accurately from a 3 D model. Finally, reconstructed scenes are a powerful tool as thinking aid to look back again to a structure in the office or in future times. And the recorded models, rendered photo-realistically, can also be used for cultural heritage documentation presenting inaccessible and sometimes dangerous places to the public. Nowadays, thanks to modern computer technologies and highly developed software tools paired with sophisticated digital camera equipment, complex photogrammetric processes are available for moderate costs for research teams. Recognizing these advantages the authors develop and utilize image-based workflows in order to document ancient mining monuments and underground sites as a basis for further historical and archaeological researches, performed in collaborative partnership during recent projects on medieval silver mines and preventive excavations of undergrounds in France...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Intensive forest {{management}} has promoted a {{rapid increase in}} Finland’s moose (Al-ces alces) population since the 1970 s. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the role of moose browsing in modifying natural processes of protected forests that are influenced by high moose populations in adjacent managed forests. This study occurred in Liesjärvi National Park located in the mid-boreal vegetation region of Finland. Forest stands were sampled with <b>line-plot</b> sampling (50 m plots at 100 m distances) in the older (OA; 1956) and newer (NA; 2005) parts of the Park. We found that long-term selective browsing in OA retarded the development of young stands in favor of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and low-growing broadleaf species. Browsing in recent years was relatively intensive in NA where young regeneration areas still existed from previous {{forest management}}. The most intensive browsing occurred on 18. 6 % of trees in NA and 3. 1 % in OA; young palatable tree species were taller in NA than OA. Also, in OA the density of preferred aspen (Populus tremula) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) trees was relatively low in the height class that produces the dominant tree canopy. Despite short-term intensive browsing, NA appeared better able to recover to a natural forest state. Fecal pellet groups associated with young Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and browsing of birch (Betula spp.) and aspen indicated the importance and role of forage quantity and quality on winte...|$|E

Since {{all of these}} forest are the first plantation, {{there is still no}} {{establishment}} of the estimation method for their growing stock and growth of forest stand. Forest inventory by sampling has never been conducted yet. In this study, the systematic <b>line-plot</b> sampling, which is an effective method for the estimation of growing stock, has been experimentally applied on a stand of 1 Talhao (25 ha). Further, for the growth of forest stand estimation, the increment core survey was also conducted. In studies area, 35 plots of 0. 04 ha has been investigated, and for the growth of forest stand estimation 105 stem of sample trees have been measured. The survey was conducted by a team consists of 4 persons, during 5 days. As the result, the estimated values for the mean and total number of trees, and for the mean and total volume (per 1 Talhao) are as follows.

40|$|This is an ecologically and managerially {{oriented}} {{research of}} Boswellia papyrifera {{in the western}} and southern sub-hills of Jebel Marra, an isolated volcanic massif {{in the heart of}} African content. The research was conducted in the period from April 2001 to Nov. 2002. This research attempted to study Boswellia papyrifera under the following aspects: land forms and soils, the growing stock, natural regeneration, seed and seed germination, phenology and resin collection. Four representative Boswellia sites were chosen for this study. Composite soil samples were taken for physical and chemical analysis. The systematic circular <b>line-plot</b> design was used for the inventory of the growing stock, quadrats as subplots were used for natural regeneration surveys. Germination and viability tests were carried out for the seeds. Resin collections on the basis of diameter at breast height were made, interviews with resin producers were carried out and finally the phenology of the species was observed. The most important results of this research are: Sloping sites were found to be representative for the occurrence of Boswellia papyrifera. Soils of Boswellia papyrifera are sandy loam to sandy clay loam. ٦ Boswellia papyrifera was found to be dominant, frequent, abundant and with an importance value index of 188. 5. Boswellia is a prolific seed producer, the seeds are three folds, empty, insect infested and viable seeds, and the latter are the smallest in number. The germination of seeds does not exceed 7 % under all treatments and the seedlings survival rates ranges from 27. 6 - 31. 8 %. The most important outcome of this study is the lack of natural regeneration. The main reasons behind are grazing, fires, weed competition and water erosion. The phenophases of the species were found to be determined by rain fall and the flowering habit of Boswellia papyrifera is indeterminate. The average annual resin production per tree is 1. 44 kg/tree, and the optimum productive diameter at breast height ranges between 16 - 34 cm., trees with diameters at breast height over 34 cm are less productive. Resin production was found to be affected by season. In the early season resin production is low and the intervals of collection is prolonged to four weeks, while in the late season resin production increases and the intervals of collections is shortened to two weeks...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the existing, or potential, risk of invasion by street trees into an urban forested park (Breithaupt Park, a 32. 5 hectare semi-forested park, and its surrounding residential neighbourhood in the City of Kitchener.). The primary research question is: What are the spatial distribution and dispersal patterns of street trees and park trees in urban areas? For street populations, height, crown spread, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree condition, trunk condition and foliage transparency were measured. Qualitative tree health indicators were used to gauge {{the condition of the}} street tree population only. For trees in Breithaupt Park, a point-quarter sampling method combined with a <b>line-plot</b> sampling method was used. There were 33 identified (and several unidentified) species of street trees and 24 identified species of forest trees. Acer platanoides was the most abundant street tree species, while Acer saccharum was the most abundant forest tree species. 52 % of the street tree population and 9 % of the forest tree population were exotic species; however, the exotics were mainly species not originating from the nearby streets (i. e. Rhamnus cathartica). Despite the well-established population of exotic invasive species such as Acer platanoides on the streets, spatial assessment of the nearby forested park revealed that relatively few exotic species had actually established there. Acer platanoides composed 1. 9 % of all trees, 3. 2 % of all saplings and 2. 7 % of all seedlings in the forest sample. The four possible sources of Acer platanoides seeds were trees planted on the street, trees planted in backyards, the leaf drop site {{in the parking lot of}} Breithaupt Park (only in the fall) and trees potentially planted directly in the forest. Explanations for the lack of invasion by Acer platanoides (in particular) include: 1) houses located between Acer platanoides street trees and Breithaupt Park functioning as a barrier to seed dispersal; 2) the highway traversing the northeast corner of the park; 3) the short length of time since Acer platanoides street trees reached their age of maturity to produce enough viable seeds to invade the forest and the lag time in the establishment phase; 4) unique park characteristics; and 5) opposing predominant wind directions. While Acer platanoides may be more invasive under different circumstances, it was concluded that Acer platanoides is not currently invading the park at a considerable rate but may be tending towards a future invasion. The main recommendations are: 1) to not cut down the Acer platanoides currently growing as street trees as they do not pose a high risk of invasion (though this is specific to the current study); 2) to manage the forest for invasive species and remove and restore the ecology of the forest as necessary; 3) to remove Acer platanoides currently growing in the forest; and 4) to replace dead street trees with non-invasive, hardy native trees instead of the historical planting of Acer platanoides and other exotics, in case the risk of invasion changes because of climate or urban design changes...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{was carried out in}} Bardia National Park and in the Bardia-Katarniaghat (Khata) corridor, which is one of five {{priority}} areas identified by Terai Arc Landscape Program (TAL) for habitat restoration due to heavy degradation of forest. The study was conducted from 15 th October to 26 th November 2011. The main objectives of the study were to compare the composition and abundance of tiger prey in both study areas and to draw inference on tiger habitat quality in the corridor. The <b>line-plot</b> pellet count technique of Wegge (1976) was adopted to assess the composition and abundance of tiger prey. Habitat compositions in the park and the corridor were determined on the basis of proportional length of different habitats along transects. Land use changes in the corridor from 1997 to 2011 were found out by the help of GIS using a topographic map and a Google Earth image. Corridors are connections between separate areas of similar habitat (Bolen & Willam 1995) and geographical extensions, continental or maritime, whose function is to connect areas and facilitate the movement of plants and animals and provide natural conditions that guarantee their conservation (Rivera et al. 2002). The study found out that the abundance of major tiger prey species like chital (Axis axis) and hog deer (A. porcinus) was extremely low in the Khata corridor compared to the south-western part of the park. The less abundant swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli) was restricted to phanta in the park, but was absent in the corridor. Other preferred prey species, such as sambar deer (C. unicolor) was rare in the park, but absent in the corridor. Similarly, nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and barking deer (Muntiacus muntjac) were scarce in both study areas. Livestock pellet groups were recorded only in the corridor with the highest abundance after wild boar. Relatively small areas of important prey habitats like phanta and tallgrass floodplain ((p ≤ 0. 05) in the corridor than in the park, and their poor quality was the main reason for the low density of chief tiger prey species in the corridor. Habitat assessment in the Khata corridor showed that the forest area remained unchanged and there was an insignificant increase in other land types from 1997 to 2011. The study indicated that the effect of past anthropogenic activities, current excessive livestock pressure and infestation of the alien plant Lantana camara were important factors affecting the habitat quality in the corridor. This suggested that tiger habitat quality was not satisfactory in the corridor. Nevertheless, the higher density of wild boar in the corridor may fulfill the feeding requirements of the tiger and can help its transboundary dispersal in some extent. On the other hand, the tiger population may increase with the restoration of habitats, which in turn may increase tiger human conflicts due to the small habitat area. All these issues should be addressed to restore the tiger habitat in the Khata corridor and facilitate its smooth dispersal through it...|$|E
