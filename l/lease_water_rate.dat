40|$|Abstract. Water markets form {{differently}} {{across the}} western United States, {{depending on the}} relative importance of water supply uncertainty and impediments to water transfers. In many locations, trades take the form of short-term <b>leases</b> of <b>water,</b> where the underlying property rights remain unaffected. In other regions, water right transfers predominate. A theoretical model developed here shows the conditions that favor <b>leasing</b> <b>water</b> or purchasing rights. Econometric analysis of 3, 499 transactions reported in the Water Strategist over 1990 - 2008 supports the conclusion that institutions have influenced not only whether water trades occur, but also the style of the trades.

The goal of this research is to test the feasibility of a water market in the river basin and determine if price differentials are found in a prior appropriations setting. This was done through a laboratory experiment to test if participants would simulate an effective <b>water</b> <b>leasing</b> market in a basin within New Mexico. In order to assess {{the potential for a}} <b>water</b> <b>leasing</b> market, a <b>water</b> <b>leasing</b> market was designed to incorporate the hydrologic, engineering, institutional, and economic market of the Upper Mimbres Basin (Broadbent et. al., 2009). Using experimental economics, which uses computer programs and simulation to test an economic theory, the market value of water was induced through the set up of the experiment. The set up involved double auction where all bids and offers are presented publically and each bid and offer is presented simultaneously. The advantages of conducting a laboratory experiment is predominantly time, data that would usually take a year to collect can be done in a short amount of time. By simulating the <b>water</b> <b>leasing</b> market we can test participants’ reactions to drought conditions, which could take years to occur in the real setting of New Mexico...|$|R

Several residents also argued why the systems needed to be leased, considering that, if the lease succeeded, profits from the water and sewer systems would go into private coffers instead of public funds. Additionally, the Mayor's administration spent an undisclosed amount of public funds on hiring Public Finance Management (PFM) to research the situation and sell the public {{on the idea of}} <b>leasing</b> <b>water</b> and sewer systems.

40|$|The water soft path (WSP) {{has been}} {{formulated}} as a progressive paradigm in water management. The WSP {{has four main}} principles: water {{should be viewed as}} a service; ecological sustainability is of utmost importance; water quantity and quality should be conserved; and planning should be done from the future backwards, not projected from the present. It may be possible to use conservation-based water pricing programs, especially at the residential level, in order to incrementally implement the WSP. Moreover, the implementation of residential seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> has been suggested as a method to curb peak demand in municipal water systems, thereby deferring infrastructure expansion. The purpose of this thesis is to answer the question: what are the barriers to implementing residential seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in the Region of Waterloo? This question is addressed using a variety of data sources, with the majority of the information coming from academic and non-academic literature, and from interviews with water professionals and local councillors. The results provide a descriptive case study concerning the barriers to implementing seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in one particular region of southwestern Ontario, but the conclusions can be generalized to describe some of the barriers to the implementation of seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in Ontario. Results suggest that some barriers are more severe than others, and that the more serious ones may be addressed by: expounding the potential for seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> to curb peak demand; carefully designing a rate study to be administered with non-price programs; and implementing the designed rate structure as a pilot study. It is suggested that the implementation of seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> can be used as an incremental step towards the adoption of WSP principles, but not without first envisioning a desirable future...|$|R
