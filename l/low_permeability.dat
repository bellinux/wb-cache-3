5|$|Most polar {{molecules}} {{have low}} solubility in the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have {{a higher rate of}} diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer, as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.|$|E
25|$|The European name, {{porcelain}} in English, {{come from}} the old Italian porcellana (cowrie shell) because of its resemblance to the translucent surface of the shell. Porcelain is {{also referred to as}} china or fine china in some English-speaking countries, as it was first seen in imports from China. Properties associated with porcelain include <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> and elasticity; considerable strength, hardness, toughness, whiteness, translucency and resonance; and a high resistance to chemical attack and thermal shock.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{substantial}} aquifers are the Pacific Coastal Plain alluvium and the {{karstic and fractured}} limestone that extend beneath the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes, Sierra de Chama, and Peten Lowlands. Other more limited aquifers are important for small-scale local demands. The mountains and hills of Guatemala contain many other types of aquifers, including volcanic pyroclastic and lava deposits, <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> sediments, igneous, and metamorphic aquifers. Alluvial plains, valleys and lowlands make up about 50% of the countries territory and contain about 70% of the available ground water reserves.|$|E
30|$|Permeability—the {{main focus}} of this contribution—was {{measured}} on oven-dry (hereafter simply called “dry”) samples using a benchtop gas (nitrogen) permeameter (schematic provided in Farquharson et al. 2016; Heap and Kennedy 2016) either in a steady-state setup (for high permeabilities) or in a pulse decay setup (for <b>low</b> <b>permeabilities).</b> All permeability measurements were conducted under a confining pressure, P_c, of 1  MPa.|$|R

25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer. If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{carried out}} in the Barnett Shale is done by pumping a mixture of water, sand, and various chemical additives (to affect viscosity, flow rates, etc.) into the well bore at a sufficient pressure to create and propagate a fracture in the surrounding rock formation down hole. This is crucial in <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> rock as it exposes more of the formation to the well bore and greater volumes of gas can be produced by the increased surface area. Without hydraulic fracturing, the wells would not produce at an economically feasible rate.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} primary {{function}} {{of being the}} discharge of treated stormwater, infiltration systems are generally positioned as the final element in a WSUD system. Infiltration trenches should not be located on steep slopes or unstable areas. A layer of geotextile fabric {{is often used to}} line the trench in order to prevent the soil from migrating into the rock or gravel fill. Infiltration systems are dependent on the local soil characteristics and are generally best suited to soils with good infiltrative capacity, such as sandy-loam soils, with deep groundwater. In areas of <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> soils, such as clay, a perforated pipe may be placed within the gravel.|$|E

50|$|This {{is similar}} to the {{equation}} for electrical resistance in materials, with permeability being analogous to conductivity; the reciprocal of the permeability is known as magnetic reluctivity and is analogous to resistivity. Longer, thinner geometries with <b>low</b> <b>permeabilities</b> lead to higher reluctance. Low reluctance, like low resistance in electric circuits, is generally preferred.|$|R

25|$|If a rock unit of low {{porosity}} {{is highly}} fractured, {{it can also}} make a good aquifer (via fissure flow), provided the rock has a hydraulic conductivity sufficient to facilitate movement of water. Porosity is important, but, alone, it does not determine a rock's ability {{to act as an}} aquifer. Areas of the Deccan Traps (a basaltic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock formations with high porosity but <b>low</b> <b>permeability,</b> which makes them poor aquifers. Similarly, the micro-porous (Upper Cretaceous) Chalk of south east England, although having a reasonably high porosity, has a low grain-to-grain permeability, with its good water-yielding characteristics mostly due to micro-fracturing and fissuring.|$|E
25|$|Porosity (n) is a {{directly}} measurable aquifer property; it is {{a fraction}} between 0 and 1 indicating {{the amount of}} pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability {{is an expression of}} the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it has lots of holes between its constituent grains), but a <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{groundwater}} {{is thought}} of as water flowing through shallow aquifers, but, in the technical sense, it can also contain soil moisture, permafrost (frozen soil), immobile water in very <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> bedrock, and deep geothermal or oil formation water. Groundwater is hypothesized to provide lubrication that can possibly influence the movement of faults. It is likely that much of Earth's subsurface contains some water, which may be mixed with other fluids in some instances. Groundwater may not be confined only to Earth. The formation {{of some of the}} landforms observed on Mars may have been influenced by groundwater. There is also evidence that liquid water may also exist in the subsurface of Jupiter's moon Europa.|$|E

30|$|The {{modeling}} {{shows that}} gas transfer rates increase coherently {{with permeability in}} environments having high levels of gas saturation. For the <b>lowest</b> <b>permeability</b> case (10 − 11  m 2), the model CO 2 transfer time of 28, 000  s equates to a velocity of[*]~[*] 0.03  m/s, whereas the rate for the highest permeability considered here (10 − 9 m 2) is[*]~[*] 1.9  m/s.|$|R
40|$|Depending on {{the rock}} permeability, {{different}} mass transport mechanisms have to be distinguished. Whereas mass transport through porous rocks characterized by <b>low</b> <b>permeabilities</b> is governed by diffusion, mass transport through highly permeable rocks is governed by advection. Coupled diffusive-advective mass transport then plays an important roll in many geoengineering systems, such as mineralization, ore body genesis and pollutant migration (including the transport of bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms).

25|$|The {{calculus}} for {{peak oil}} has {{changed with the}} introduction of unconventional production methods. In particular, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays. Analysts expect that $150 billion will be spent on further developing North American tight oil fields in 2015. The large increase in tight oil production {{is one of the reasons}} behind the price drop in late 2014. Certain rock strata contain hydrocarbons but have <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> and are not thick from a vertical perspective. Conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons. Horizontal drilling, extending horizontally through the strata, permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata. Hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the wellbore.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of the scaffold material {{is perhaps the most}} important decision to be made. It must be biocompatible and biodegradable; in addition, it must be able to incorporate any physical, chemical, or biological cues desired, which in the case of some chemical cues means that it must have a site available for chemically linking peptides and other molecules. The scaffold materials chosen for nerve guidance conduits are almost always hydrogels. The hydrogel may be composed of either biological or synthetic polymers. Both biological and synthetic polymers have their strengths and weaknesses. It {{is important to note that}} the conduit material can cause inadequate recovery when (1) degradation and resorption rates do not match the tissue formation rate, (2) the stress-strain properties do not compare well to those of neural tissue, (3) when degrading swelling occurs, causing significant deformation, (4) a large inflammatory response is elicited, or (5) the material has <b>low</b> <b>permeability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{slope of}} the inner trench slope of an accretionary {{convergent}} margin reflects continuous adjustments to the thickness and width of the accretionary prism. The prism maintains a ‘critical taper’, established in conformance with Mohr–Coulomb theory, with slope determined by the material properties of the sediments. A package of sediments scraped off the downgoing lithospheric plate deforms until it and the accretionary prism {{that it has been}} added to attain the maximum slope supported by the sediments. Once this critical taper is attained, the wedge slides stably along its basal décollement. Strain rate and hydrologic properties also influence the strength of the accretionary prism and the angle of critical taper. Fluid pore pressures modify rock strength. <b>Low</b> <b>permeability</b> and rapid convergence may result in pore pressures that exceed lithostatic pressure and thus a relatively weak accretionary prism with a shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high permeability and slow convergence result in lower pore pressure, stronger prisms, and steeper geometry.|$|E

25|$|Calcein-AM, A highly {{permeable}} {{derivative of}} calcein readily penetrates into intact cells, where the endogenous esterases rapidly hydrolyze {{it to the}} fluorescent calcein. In contrast to calcein-AM, calcein has <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> and therefore gets trapped in the cell and accumulates. As calcein-AM is an excellent substrate of the MDR1 and MRP1 efflux transporters, cells expressing MDR1 and/or MRP1 transporters pump the calcein-AM out of the cell before esterases can hydrolyze it. This results in a lower cellular accumulation rate of calcein. The higher the MDR activity is in the cell membrane, the less Calcein is accumulated in the cytoplasm. In MDR-expressing cells, the addition of an MDR inhibitor or an MDR substrate in excess dramatically increases the rate of Calcein accumulation. Activity of multidrug transporter is reflected by {{the difference between the}} amounts of dye accumulated in the presence and the absence of inhibitor. Using selective inhibitors, transport activity of MDR1 and MRP1 can be easily distinguished. This assay can be used to screen drugs for transporter interactions, and also to quantify the MDR activity of cells. The calcein assay is the proprietary assay of SOLVO Biotechnology.|$|E

On 16August 2011, Langan International officially announced their involvement and that {{the foundation}} and piling had to be uniquely designed to overcome subsurface issues such as soft bedrock and porous coral rock, which normally could not support a skyscraper without settling. The foundation will be {{similar to that of}} the Burj Khalifa, but larger; it is expected to average around [...] deep with a concrete pad of area around [...] The concrete will have to have <b>low</b> <b>permeability</b> to keep out corrosive salt water from the Red Sea. Its depth and size are also considered to be an indicator of what the tower's final height will be.

The idea is that it settles evenly enough so that the building doesn't tip or put undue stress on the superstructure. Computer modeling programs performed tests at the site to confirm that the foundation design would work. [...] A later design for the foundation, to be constructed by Bauer in 2013, calls for 270 bored piles up to [...] deep which have to be installed into the difficult ground conditions.

30|$|Recharge {{water in}} central-Icelandic {{hydrothermal}} systems is mainly meteoric water {{because it can}} easily penetrate highly permeable volcanic rocks (Arnorsson 1995; Marks et al. 2010). In Reykjanes and Svartsengi areas, recharge water mainly consists of seawater (Kristmannsdottir 1979). During the Pleistocene, the recharge water in Reykjanes was meteoric (Marks et al. 2010). Arnorsson (1995) estimated with the available permeability data that the age of geothermal waters emerging in wells {{was no more than}} a few tens of years, and a few hundreds of years in areas having the <b>lowest</b> <b>permeability.</b>|$|R

In [...] "tight" [...] rock (<b>low</b> <b>permeability)</b> like the Barnett Shale, the gas uses fractures {{to move out}} of the rock and into the wellbore.
