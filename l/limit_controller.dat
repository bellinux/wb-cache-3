Blowers in electric furnaces move air over one to five resistance coils or elements which are usually rated at five kilowatts. The heating elements activate one at a time to avoid overloading the electrical system. Overheating is prevented by a safety switch called a <b>limit</b> <b>controller</b> or limit switch.

Both valves have electro-hydraulic actuators which are operated via two hardware outputs to the two coils of the electro-hydraulic actuators. Undesirable compressor operation is prevented via the compressor pressure ratio <b>limit</b> <b>controller</b> (also known as π controller). The function of the cool air <b>limit</b> <b>controller</b> is to rule out mode of operations, which leads to inadequate flow of cooling air to the turbine blades. The system exhausted temperature is being controlled by the IGVs by varying the air mass flow into the combustion chamber. Exhausted temperature is measured immediately downstream of the gas turbine via 24 triple-element thermocouples (MBA 26 CT 101 A/B/C to MBA 26 CT 124 A/B/C) placed around the surroundings of the exhaust diffuser. All B and C signals from the 24 triple-element thermocouples are {{used to calculate the}} mean turbine outlet temperature. These IGVs signal is influenced, in such a way, by two signals: one from the exhausted temperature control and the other from the compressor pressure ratio <b>limit</b> <b>controller</b> (Daewoo E&C, Siemens 2009 Approval).

An output error prediction model is built using BP neural network to deal with the time delay between sensor node and controller node. The principle of this model is to revise the predictive output of general predictive control model using predictive error signal; if the value of time delay exceeds the upper <b>limit,</b> <b>controller</b> nodes will immediately produce the control strategies adopting the revised predictive output, and thus the compensation for time delay between sensor nodes and controller nodes would be accomplished.

40|$|The {{class of}} systems know as VTOL {{vehicles}} encapsulates {{a wide variety}} of real world systems of interest including helicopters, jets and unmanned aerial vehicles. These VTOL vehicles exhibit heavily nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, nonlinear control techniques are required to achieve global stabilisation. Often, VTOL vehicles are stabilised using nonlinear cascade techniques. However, if care is not taken, such controllers will contain a singularity that may be encountered during aggressive stabilisation maneuvers. This problem is often overcome through the use of embedded saturation in the controller design such that the singularity is avoided. However, this saturation has the potential to <b>limit</b> <b>controller</b> performance when very aggressive stabilisation is required. In this paper, we propose an alternative design technique for the cascade control of VTOL vehicles.

30|$|In recent years, gas {{turbines}} (GT) have easily reached a primary position in {{thermal power generation}} field because of their fast deliveries of power and availability of natural gas (NG) (Rayaprolu 2009). GT as simple cycle or integrated with {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG) to form a combined cycle (CC) power plant has become very popular generation technology in many countries. However, the manufacturers of such devices are doing great effort to achieve improved efficiencies and lower pollutant emissions that compete coal and clean coal technologies. Nowadays, apart from reliability and fuel cost optimization, novel power generation techniques demand much improved load demand tracking that lead to lessen frequency variations of power system with better corresponding plant efficiency. It has been noticed that improving the operation performance of gas turbine can significantly lead to higher cycle efficiency and better dynamic performance. Achieving better compressing ratios and maintaining the exhausted gas temperature within certain limits despite load stochastic variations is likely to do just that improvement. In the developed countries, it is, however, reported that the efficiency of CC power plants from 1960 to 2000 has been improved from 35  % up to nearly 60  % respectively (Rayaprolu 2009). In general, the literature of thermal power plants has often suggested optimal and predictive control theories that meet wide acceptance in industry and power plants (Lee and Ramirez 2001). In particular, some articles has been written and published on CC power plants’ control that sought to optimize combined cycle power plants with regard to efficiency and load following capability (Saez et al. 2007; Matsumoto et al. 1996; Lalor et al. 2005). A fuzzy predictive control based on genetic algorithms for power plant {{gas turbines}} is developed which provides the optimal dynamic set point for the regulatory level with contribution to capturing the nonlinearity of the plant (Saez et al. 2007). Start-up process optimization by an expert system has been proposed under NOx emission regulation and management of machine life (Matsumoto et al. 1996). The influence of gas turbine short-term dynamics on the performance of frequency control can also be investigated through suitable modelling for knowledge of frequency excursions in the grid in advance (Lalor et al. 2005). However, there are other important factors that have a direct influence on the system output performance and the grid frequency, which are studied in this paper and not considered in many papers. For instance, in the previous literature the emphasis of fuel flow changes was given only to the valve position of natural gas (NG); however, the position of pilot gas valve can also be manipulated to stabilize the flames in the premix and ensure steady combustion at all time. In addition, the compressor pressure ratio signal (the ratio of the discharged pressure of the compressor to the inlet atmospheric pressure) passes through the compressor pressure <b>limit</b> <b>controller</b> to influence the inlet guide vane (IGV) pitch controller which in turn affects the combustion process and flow of air to the GT. If the system automation is upgraded with potential to correct such signals by the MPC, these signals will optimize in advance which means reduced process variations while keeping faster load following capability due to higher stored/kinetic energy in the plant. This also can make the CCGT works close to its optimum efficiency by expanding the pressure ratio and the firing temperature by MPC. These potent motivations have to be investigated on gas turbines through advanced technique of system identification and control system design. However, without digital simulation, the gap between theory and practice cannot be easily bridged in this task. A model has been developed and verified via identification technique which is assessed and published in our research (Mohamed et al. 2015). The scientific contribution added to this paper is to integrate MPC to the developed identified model representing the real GT with emphasis on the strategic influences discussed above for the target of performance enhancement. The present paper is organized as follows. “Combined (deterministic/stochastic) subspace identification” section clarifies the technique of subspace identification. “The application of subspace identification to gas turbine process” section discusses the developed model of real gas turbine by subspace identification method for different operating regions. Simulation results of identification and verification procedure have shown model accuracy and capability of reflecting the key variables of the turbine. “Predictive controller design and implementation” section presents the designed model predictive control to be applied to the system. “Simulation results” section then mentions simulation scenarios that have offered the advantage of the proposed upgraded strategy. Finally, the present paper has concluded the work with suggested further opportunities for future research.|$|E

Experimental data from combustor rigs and physics-based models {{are used to}} motivate the relevance of both the linear and nonlinear thermoacoustic models. For linear models, Bode integral-based analysis is used to explain peak-splitting observed in experiments. It is shown that large delay in the feedback loop and limited actuator bandwidth are the primary factors that limits {{the effectiveness of the}} active control. Explicit bounds on obtainable performance in the presence of delay, unstable dynamics, and <b>limited</b> <b>controller</b> bandwidth are obtained. A multi-input describing function framework is proposed to extend this analysis to the study of nonlinear models that also incorporate the effects of noise. The fundamental limitations are interpreted for a modified sensitivity function defined with respect to noise balance. The framework is applied to the analysis of linear thermoacoustic models with nonlinear ON-OFF actuators and Gaussian noise. The results of the analysis are well-supported by experiments and model simulations.

40|$|Abstract—In NAND Flash-based SSDs, {{deduplication}} {{can provide}} an effective resolution of three critical issues: cell lifetime, write performance, and garbage collection overhead. However, deduplication at SSD device level distinguishes itself from the one at enterprise storage systems in many aspects, whose success lies in proper exploitation of underlying very limited hardware resources and workload characteristics of SSDs. In this paper, we develop a novel deduplication framework elaborately tailored for SSDs. We first mathematically develop an analytical model that enables us to calculate the minimum required duplication rate {{in order to achieve}} performance gain given deduplication overhead. Then, we explore a number of design choices for implementing deduplication components by hardware or software. As a result, we propose two acceleration techniques: sampling-based filtering and recency-based fingerprint management. The former selectively applies deduplication based upon sampling and the latter effectively exploits <b>limited</b> <b>controller</b> memory while maximizing the deduplication ratio.
