In ANA positive serum samples (23. 5 % of referred serum samples), ANA were identified by indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia, by immunodiffusion, and by <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay.</b> Because anti-SSA antibodies were the most frequently identified ANA, sensitively detected by <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay,</b> additional immunoassays were developed to confirm the specificity of the <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> result.  RESULTS—At least one fine reactivity could be identified in 21. 1 % of ANA positive serum samples: anti-dsDNA in 3. 2 %; anti-ENA (anti-SSA 10. 5 %, anti-SSB 6. 7 %, anti-RNP 2. 7 %, anti-Sm 1. 8 %, anti-Scl 70 1. 2 %, anti-Jo- 1 0. 2 %) in 15. 8 %, rRNP and anti-Cenp-B in respectively 0. 5 % and 4. 0 %. Multiple reactivities were found in 7. 9 %. For anti-ENA antibodies, <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> was more sensitive than immunodiffusion (15. 4 % v 7. 7 %; p< 0. 0001). The sensitive detection of anti-SSA antibodies by <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> was confirmed by additional assays.  CONCLUSIONS—The data from this analysis are useful in estimating the probabilities of detecting specific ANA. <b>Line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> was {{shown to be a}} sensitive test for the detection of anti-ENA antibodies. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Immunity status, {{individual}} {{response to}} disease {{and types of}} antibodies produced are well known to vary from person to person, place to place and probably from population to population. A broad spectrum of specific auto antibodies that have so far been associated with specific rheumatic diseases, as noted in Western literature, has been well taken as a reference standard all over the world. There is neither research work nor any data correlating the auto antibodies and their antinuclear antibody (ANA) patterns with the immunoprofile in the Indian population to date. Aims: To understand a definite association between ANA patterns and specific antibodies in the serum in the Indian study population and to document similarities / differences with the West. Settings and Design: This prospective and retrospective double blind study was undertaken on the South Indian population referred for ANA testing by Indirect Immunofluorescence method and by immunoline methods. Materials and Methods: Serum samples of patients from a random South Indian population who sought medical help for rheumatic disease were subjected for ANA testing by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) method and <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> {{during the study period}} of 27 months. Serum samples were processed in dilution of 1 : 100 using HEp - 2010 / liver biochip (Monkey) (EUROIMMUN AG). The serum samples which were further processed for <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> were treated in 1 : 100 dilution on nylon strips coated with recombinant and purified antigens as discrete lines with plastic backing (EUROIMMUN AG) coated with antigens nRNP / Sm, Sm, SSA, Ro- 52, SSB, Scl- 70, PM-Scl, PCNA, Jo- 1, CENP-B, dsDNA, nucleosomes, histones, ribosomal protein-P, anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA-M 2) along with a control band. The analysis was done by comparing the intensity of the reaction with positive control line by image analysis. Results: The antinuclear antibody indirect immunofluorescence (ANA - IIF) patterns obtained were projectable to visualize a certain spectrum of specific antibodies such as homogenous (45. 5 &#x 0025;) with dsDNA, nucleosomes, histones, SSA / Ro- 52, RIB and RNP / Sm, speckled pattern (35. 6 &#x 0025;) with Sm, RNP, SSA/Ro- 52, SSB, Sm and RIB; nucleolar pattern with Scl- 70, Sm, RNP and centromere pattern with CENP-B. The methodology indicated that, cytoplasmic pattern noted in ANA also needs to be correlated with primate liver in a biochip, which should prompt further decision for a request for <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> and it is preferable for two pathologists to report independently and sign out a consensus ANA report for better predictive value. Conclusions: As a definite correlation between the ANA patterns and the group of antibodies was detected by <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay,</b> one could predict presence of certain specific auto antibodies for a particular ANA pattern identified. This may restrict one from requesting for <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay,</b> which is expensive and economizes on the cost of laboratory investigations in a developing country like India. Thus, screening of sera by ANA-IIF method alone may suffice and probably reduce the expense of detailed immunological work-up with minimal loss in diagnostic accuracy.

40|$|The {{international}} consensus for {{the classification}} of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) requires clinical and laboratory criteria to be considered at an equal level for diagnosing APS. Thus, detection of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) being a hallmark of APS has been the object of intensive investigation over the past 40 years. However, appropriate detec-tion of aPL still remains a laboratory challenge due to their heterogeneity comprising auto-antibodies reactive to different phospholipid-binding plasma proteins, such as beta- 2 glycoprotein I (b 2 GPI) and prothrombin.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence, mutual associations, clinical manifestations, and diagnoses associated with serum autoantibodies, as detected using recently available immunoassays, in patients with autoimmune myositis (AIM). Sera and clinical data were collected from 100 patients with AIM followed longitudinally. Sera were screened cross-sectionally for 21 autoantibodies by multiplex addressable laser bead <b>immunoassay,</b> <b>line</b> blot <b>immunoassay,</b> immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated recombinant protein, protein A assisted immunoprecipitation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Diagnoses were determined using the Bohan and Peter classification as well as recently proposed classifications. Relationships between autoantibodies and clinical manifestations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. One or more autoantibodies encompassing 19 specificities were present in 80 % of the patients. The most common autoantibodies were anti-Ro 52 (30 % of patients), anti-Ku (23 %), anti-synthetases (22 %), anti-U 1 RNP (15 %), and anti-fibrillarin (14 %). In the presence of autoantibodies to Ku, synthetases, U 1 RNP, fibrillarin, PM-Scl, or scleroderma autoantigens, at least one more autoantibody was detected in the majority of sera and at least two more autoantibodies in over one-third of sera. The largest number of concurrent autoantibodies was six autoantibodies. Overall, 44 distinct combinations of autoantibodies were counted. Most autoantibodies were unrestricted to any AIM diagnostic category. Distinct clinical syndromes and therapeutic responses were associated with anti-Jo- 1, anti-fibrillarin, anti-U 1 RNP, anti-Ro, anti-Ro 52, and autoantibodies to scleroderma autoantigens. We conclude that a significant proportion of AIM patients are characterized by complex associations of autoantibodies. Certain myositis autoantibodies are markers for distinct overlap syndromes and predict therapeutic outcomes. The ultimate clinical features, disease course, and response to therapy in a given AIM patient may be linked to the particular set of associated autoantibodies. These results provide a rationale for patient profiling and its application to therapeutics, because it cannot be assumed that the B-cell response is the same even in the majority of patients in a given diagnostic category...|$|R

Methods: PML and Sp 100 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and analysed by SOS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody and MALDI-ToF fingerprinting. A. quantitative PML and Sp 100 LIA were developed and testing was performed in 150 anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) positive, 20 AMA-PBCs and 130 controls. Results: Thirty-five (23 %) of 150 AMA + PBCs (18 anti-MND+) were anti-PML+ (12 %) or anti-Sp 100 + (20 %). 10 being anti-PML+/Sp 100 +, 5 single anti-PML+ and 20 single anti-Sp 100 +. Six (30 %, 5 anti-MND+) AMA-PBCs were anti-PML+ or Sp 100 +. Only 2 (1. 7 %) pathological controls were anti-PML+ and/or anti-Sp 100 +. Levels of anti-PML correlated with those of anti-Sp 100 (R = 0. 64, p< 0. 0001). The autoantibody profile largely remained unchanged over a 10 year-follow up (52 patients, 352 samples). Anti-PML, Sp 100 or MND-reactive PBCs were younger and had longer disease duration than the seronegative (p = 0. 06, for both). Anti-Sp 100 levels correlated with the Mayo risk score (r = 0. 63, p = 0. 01). Anti-PML+/Sp 100 + patients had more advanced disease compared to patients negative for anti-PML/Sp 100 (p = 0. 04).

The size and surface morphology of AuNPs were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-Vis spectrophotometer {{was used to determine}} the wavelength and absorption of AuNPs. In the seed stage, the effect of trisodium citrate volume was studied. The size of AuNPs at seed stage was varied from 15 to 40 nm with decreasing volume of trisodium citrate. In the growth stage, the effects of seed solution volume and concentration of hydroxylamine were studied. The size of AuNPs produced became larger when the amount of seed solution was reduced. This approach was beneficial to produce AuNPs with the size range from 15 to 150 nm. The increase of hydroxylamine concentration increased the size of AuNPs. However, after the concentration of hydroxylamine reached supersaturation condition (3 M NH 2 OH. HCl), the AuNPs formed in a bulk and clusters.

Serological testing has the potential to circumvent the problem of specimen sampling in invasive C. trachomatis infections of the upper genital tract. However, only a few defined chlamydial antigens have been used in a standardized diagnostic assay format. In this study, we used serological two-dimensional proteomic analysis to broaden the spectrum of diagnostically relevant C. trachomatis proteins. The genes encoding an assortment of already known chlamydial antigens, as well as immunogenic proteins that have not been described before, were cloned, and the recombinant proteins were purified in order to compare their diagnostic usefulness in parallel with a newly developed <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay.</b> With 189 sera collected from patients with and without C. trachomatis infection, recombinant major outer membrane protein (MOMP), chlamydial protease-like activity factor (CPAF), outer membrane protein 2 (OMP 2), translocated actin-recruiting protein, and polymorphic membrane protein D (PmpD) showed the highest level of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In patients suffering from ascending and invasive C. trachomatis infections, such as pelvic inflammatory disease and lymphogranuloma venereum, the sensitivity reached with these proteins ranged between 71 % (PmpD) and 94 % (OMP 2), and the specificity ranged between 82 % (PmpD) and 100 % (MOMP and OMP 2). Recombinant thio-specific antioxidant peroxidase, ribosomal protein S 1 (RpsA) and hypothetical protein 17 showed lower sensitivity but comparably high specificity, ranging from 94 % to 100 %. The novel <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> based on defined recombinant antigens has promise for improved serodiagnosis in severe and invasive C. trachomatis infections...|$|E

One individual (a 56 -year-old Baka Pygmy hunter) {{was found to be}} HTLV- 3 infected; however, there was a low proviral load in blood cells. Complete sequence analysis of this virus (HTLV- 3 (Lobak 18)) indicated a close relationship to human HTLV- 3 (Pyl 43) and simian STLV- 3 (CTO 604) strains. Plasma samples from Lobak 18, the HTLV- 3 infected individual, exhibited a peculiar "HTLV- 2 -like" pattern on Western blot analysis and were serologically untypeable by <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay.</b> These results were different from those for the 2 previously reported HTLV- 3 strains, raising questions about serological confirmation of infection with such retroviruses...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Laboratory {{diagnosis}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection {{is based on}} the detection of anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) techniques. However, a consensus related to the problem of low titer (Serum/Cut-off; S/C= 1. 0) anti-HCV antibodies is still lacking. The study attempts to evaluate the clinical status of the patients with low titer anti-HCV antibodies detected by third generation anti-HCV tests during February 2013 - May 2014 retrospectively.

40|$|Background HIV {{surveillance}} requires {{monitoring of}} new HIV diagnoses and differentiation of incident and older infections. In 2008, Switzerland implemented {{a system for}} monitoring incident HIV infections {{based on the results}} of a <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> (Inno-Lia) mandatorily conducted for HIV confirmation and type differentiation (HIV- 1, HIV- 2) of all newly diagnosed patients. Based on this system, we assessed the proportion of incident HIV infection among newly diagnosed cases in Switzerland during 2008 - 2013. Methods and Results Inno-Lia antibody reaction patterns recorded in anonymous HIV notifications to the federal health authority were classified by 10 published algorithms into incident (up to 12 months) or older infections. Utilizing these data, annual incident infection estimates were obtained in two ways, (i) based on the diagnostic performance of the algorithms and utilizing the rela-tionship ‘incident = true incident + false incident’, (ii) based on the window-periods of th...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{differences in}} clinical signs and symptoms, and in antinuclear antibodies (ANA), between patients with juvenile-onset and adult-onset {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE). Methods: Clinical and serological data of 56 patients with juvenile-onset SLE were compared with data of 194 patients with adult-onset SLE. ANA were determined by <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> and by indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae. Results: Renal involvement, encephalopathy and haemolytic anaemia were seen, and anti-dsDNA, anti-ribosomal P and antihistone antibodies found, significantly more often in juvenile-onset SLE. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were directly associated, and anti-ribosomal P antibodies inversely associated, with renal involvement in juvenile-onset SLE. In juvenile patients with SLE and anti-dsDNA and without anti-ribosomal P antibodies the odds ratio for glomerulonephritis was 9. 00; no patients with anti-ribosomal P but without anti-dsDNA had renal involvement. Conclusion: Patients with juvenile-onset SLE more often have renal involvement and encephalopathy than patients with adult-onset SLE. Anti-ribosomal P, anti-dsDNA and antihistone antibodies are more often found in patients with juvenile-onset SLE...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tests {{for recent}} infections (TRIs) are {{important}} for HIV surveillance. We have shown that a patient's antibody pattern in a confirmatory <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> (Inno-Lia) also yields information on time since infection. We have published algorithms which, with a certain sensitivity and specificity, distinguish between incident (, = 12 months) and older infection. In order to use these algorithms like other TRIs, i. e., based on their windows, we now determined their window periods. Methods: We classified Inno-Lia results of 527 treatment-naı¨ve patients with HIV- 1 infection, = 12 months according to incidence by 25 algorithms. The time after which all infections were ruled older, i. e. the algorithm's window, was determined by linear regression of the proportion ruled incident in dependence of time since infection. Window-based incident infection rates (IIR) were determined utilizing the relationship ‘Prevalence = Incidence x Duration ' in four annual cohorts of HIV- 1 notifications. Results were compared to performance-based IIR also derived from Inno-Lia results, but utilizing the relationship ‘incident = true [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infections in}} {{a cohort of}} {{chimpanzees}} were studied retrospectively. All animals had been inoculated intravenously with materials derived from a single-source chim-panzee plasma implicated in non-A, non-B hepatitis, prepared by extensive ultracentrifugation. Anti-HCV and HCV RNA were monitored by the confirmatory <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> and by an RNA-capture polymerase chain reaction method, respectively. In a chronically infected chim-panzee, HCV RNA was detectable after 32 days and throughout the acute phase, dropped tran-siently below detection level, and became detectable again. In 3 other chimpanzees with acute resolving infections, HCV RNA was detected 7 - 11 days after inoculation and became perma-nently undetectable after alanine aminotransferase normalization. Various anti-HCV profiles were detected among the chimpanzees. Analysis of the hypervariable region in E 2 /NSI in 7 chimpanzees suggested genome stability on transmission, revealed different mutation frequen-cies during chronic infection, and suggested the importance of immune selection during chronic HCV infection.

40|$|Abstract Background Serologic testing {{algorithms}} {{for recent}} HIV seroconversion (STARHS) provide important information for HIV surveillance. We {{have shown that}} a patient's antibody reaction in a confirmatory <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> (INNO-LIA TM HIV I/II Score, Innogenetics) provides information on the duration of infection. Here, we sought to further investigate the diagnostic specificity of various Inno-Lia algorithms and to identify factors affecting it. Methods Plasma samples of 714 selected patients of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study infected for longer than 12 months and representing all viral clades and stages of chronic HIV- 1 infection were tested blindly by Inno-Lia and classified as either incident (up to 12 m) or older infection by 24 different algorithms. Of the total, 524 patients received HAART, 308 had HIV- 1 RNA below 50 copies/mL, and 620 were infected by a HIV- 1 non-B clade. Using logistic regression analysis we evaluated factors that might affect the specificity of these algorithms. Results HIV- 1 RNA Conclusions The specificity of most Inno-Lia algorithms was high and not affected by HIV- 1 variability, advanced disease and other factors promoting false-recent results in other STARHS. Specificity should be good in any group of untreated HIV- 1 patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} using a single multi-parameter test based mainly on recombinant autoantigens {{for the detection of}} anti-nuclear autoantibodies, and analyzed the agreement between this test format and conventional techniques. METHODS: The presence of autoantibodies was determined by a <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> (LIA) in 755 sera derived from patients with different autoimmune connective tissue disorders. All sera were previously tested by standard assays that are routinely used at the 8 participating European centers. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of autoantibody detection by LIA was similar or higher as compared to combined conventional techniques (CCT). In particular, the detection of anti-Ro 52 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) sera (P = 0. 004) and anti-LA in both SLE (P < 0. 0009) and in Sjögren's syndrome (P < 0. 0009) sera was significantly more sensitive when using LIA compared to CCT. By contrast, CCT was never more sensitive than LIA for any of the markers. CONCLUSION: The LIA is a reliable alternative to a combination of conventional techniques for the detection of specific anti-nuclear autoantibodies. The multi-parameter test also reveals autoantibody reactivities that may not be detected when {{only a limited number of}} conventional techniques are applied...|$|E
40|$|Background Serologic testing {{algorithms}} {{for recent}} HIV seroconversion (STARHS) provide important information for HIV surveillance. We have previously demonstrated that a patient's antibody reaction pattern in a confirmatory <b>line</b> <b>immunoassay</b> (INNO-LIA™ HIV I/II Score) {{provides information on}} the duration of infection, which is unaffected by clinical, immunological and viral variables. In this report we have set out to determine the diagnostic performance of Inno-Lia algorithms for identifying incident infections in patients with known duration of infection and evaluated the algorithms in annual cohorts of HIV notifications. Methods Diagnostic sensitivity was determined in 527 treatment-naive patients infected for up to 12 months. Specificity was determined in 740 patients infected for longer than 12 months. Plasma was tested by Inno-Lia and classified as either incident (< = 12 m) or older infection by 26 different algorithms. Incident infection rates (IIR) were calculated based on diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of each algorithm and the rule that the total of incident results {{is the sum of}} true-incident and false-incident results, which can be calculated by means of the pre-determined sensitivity and specificity.
