5000|$|The {{basic concept}} {{continued}} to be studied through the 1960s and 70s. A serious {{problem was that the}} interceptor missiles had to be very fast to reach the ICBM before its motor stopped firing, which required a larger motor on the interceptor, meaning higher weight to <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> As the difficulties of this problem became clear, the concept evolved into the [...] "ascent phase" [...] attack, which used more sensitive seekers that allowed the attack to continue after the ICBM's motor had stopped firing and the warhead bus was still ascending. In all of these studies, the system would require an enormous amount of weight to be lifted into orbit, typically hundreds of millions of pounds, well beyond any reasonable projections of US capability. The US Air Force repeatedly studied these various plans and rejected them all as essentially impossible.|$|E
50|$|Mueller is {{currently}} the CTO of Propulsion Development at SpaceX, responsible for all propulsion development, including the Dragon spacecraft propulsion systems and Merlin rocket engine family that powers the Falcon 9 launch vehicle to orbit. The Merlin is the highest-performing hydrocarbon engine made in the United States and the first hydrocarbon booster engine made in the United States in 40 years. Mueller developed the Merlin 1A and Kestrel engines for the Falcon 1, the first liquid fueled orbital rocket launched by a private company as well as leading the team that developed the Merlin 1C, Merlin 1D and MVac engines for the Falcon 9, the first to <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> and recover a spacecraft.

50|$|The {{events of}} Winter Hawk {{transpire}} {{over a few}} days in which the Soviet Union will <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> {{the first in a series}} of laser battle stations, the existence of which they have kept a closely guarded secret. The launch is meant to coincide with the signing of a new and apparently groundbreaking treaty dramatically reducing nuclear weapons to be kept by both sides, but excluding space based weapons such as the one the Soviets will be launching, mostly because none are known to exist. The Americans know of the weapon because a Soviet technician named Philip Kedrov has been supplying them information, operating under the code-name “Cactus Plant”. The Soviet space weapon places the Americans in a painful dilemma: they can neither sign a treaty that will dramatically cede the balance of power to the Soviet Union, nor can they back out of the treaty lacking proof of the Soviet weapon. The only alternative is a deep cover extraction mission of Kedrov and his evidence from the Soviet’s space launch complex, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The mission, involving two stolen Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters to be flown by CIA pilots — one of whom is CIA pilot Mitchell Gant — is codenamed “Winter Hawk”.|$|E

5000|$|During Mitchell, Gypsy overheard The Mads {{talking about}} {{eliminating}} Mike, the temp worker who was assisting {{them with an}} [...] "evil-scientist audit". Hearing them refer to Mike as a [...] "be-jumpsuited fool" [...] and thinking they were actually talking about Joel, she struggled to think of some way to help Joel escape his alleged fate. Joel escaped the Satellite of Love (S.O.L.) in a previously undiscovered escape pod (named the Deus Ex Machina) mislabeled as a crate of [...] "Hamdingers" [...] that Mike told Gypsy about. Mike managed to override The Mads' control over the S.O.L. so that Gypsy could get Joel into the escape pod and launch it. After Joel's departure from the S.O.L., the Mads tried to rescue him, but gave up seconds later when they discovered that he had already safely landed in the Australian Outback. Instead of killing Mike, as they initially planned, they sent him up to take Joel's place. After Joel's departure he returned just once, in the show's final season (episode 1001: Soultaker), having turned the escape pod into a makeshift spaceship. He returned to the S.O.L. to make repairs to parts that were programmed to self-destruct {{a decade after the}} ship's <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> and give Mike a pep talk, after which he left the satellite through the corridor to the theater, where he had entered it earlier in that episode. Joel reported that, since leaving the ship, he had traveled around the Australian outback, doing pyrotechnics for the band [...] "Man or Astro-man?", and that he was currently working as a manager at a Hot Fish Shop in Osseo, Minnesota.

40|$|Experiments in long {{distance}} {{quantum key distribution}} have motivated the development of ruggedised single photon sources, capable of producing useful correlations even when removed from the warm, nurturing environment found in most optics laboratories. As {{part of an ongoing}} pro- gramme to place such devices into low earth orbit (LEO), we have developed and built a number of rugged single photon sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion. In order to evalu- ate device reliability, we have subjected our design to various thermal, mechanical and atmospheric stresses. Our results show that while such a device may tolerate <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit,</b> operation in orbit and casual mishandling by graduate students, it is probably unable to survive the forcible disassembly of a launch vehicle {{at the top of a}} ball of rapidly expanding and oxidising kerosene and liquid oxygen.

40|$|First-day {{spacecraft}} failures frequently {{occur as}} a result of the loads experienced during <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> These loads include structural vibrations transmitted at points of structural contact, and structural-acoustic vibrations created by the excitation of the payload fairing cavity. Structural control techniques, using piezoelectric actuators, have previously been studied as cost-effective ways of reducing the structural-acoustic vibrations being transmitted into the fairing cavity. These structural control methods, while effective at reducing the sound transmitted into a structure, have not been as effective for controlling acoustic reflections from surfaces. This is due to large impedance mismatches at the solid-fluid interface where control is applied. Recent developments in plasma engineering have made it possible to create a uniform glow-discharge plasma over a surface at one atmosphere (OAUGDP). This creates a thin active layer with almost no impedance mismatch to the surrounding fluid. This thin layer can be used to actuate the air around it much like a speaker...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} stellar source {{selection}} for validating {{the quality of}} image is investigated for a low Earth orbit optical remote sensing satellite. Image performance of the optical payload needs to be validated after its <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> The stellar sources are ideal source points {{that can be used}} to validate the quality of optical images. For the image validation, stellar sources should be the brightest as possible in the charge-coupled device dynamic range. The time delayed and integration technique, which is used to observe the ground, is also performed to observe the selected stars. The relations between the incident radiance at aperture and V magnitude of a star are established using Gunn & Stryker's star catalogue of spectrum. Applying this result, an appropriate image performance index is determined, and suitable stars and areas of the sky scene are selected for the optical payload on a remote sensing satellite to observe. The result of this research can be utilized to validate the quality of optical payload of a satellite in orbit...|$|E
