Then, we proceed to examine simultaneous magnetic field measurements from the multi-satellite topside ionosphere mission ST 5. Additionally, we look to magnetic and electric field data from Cluster 4 -spacecraft mission for the same event and check the ground magnetic station Island Lake of the CARISMA array, which is the closest station to the CHAMP’s footprint. CHAMP and Island Lake analysis results show evidence for simultaneous observed Pc 3 wave activity from 20 : 07 to 20 : 35 UT at the frequency range between 22 and 32 mHZ with peak intensity centered approximately around 20 : 25 UT (the peak wave power is probably seen earlier in CHAMP data and on the ground D component in comparison to H component).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a {{preliminary}} {{analysis of the}} impact of Global Navigation Satellite System Reﬂections (GNSS-R) data on ionospheric monitoring over the oceans. The focus will be on a single polar Low Earth Orbiter (<b>LEO)</b> <b>mission</b> exploiting GNSS-R as well as Navigation (GNSS-N) and Occultation (GNSS-O) total electron content (TEC) measurements. In order to assess impact of the data, we have simulated GNSS-R/O/N TEC data as would be measured from the LEO and from International Geodesic Service (IGS) ground stations, with an electron density (ED) ﬁeld generated using a climatic ionospheric model. We have also developed a new tomographic approach inspired by the physics of the hydrogen atom and used it to effectively retrieve the ED ﬁeld from the simulated TEC data near the orbital plane. The tomographic inversion results demonstrate the signiﬁcant impact of GNSS-R: three-dimensional ionospheric ED ﬁelds are retrieved over the oceans quite accurately, even as, in the spirit of this initial study, the simulation and inversion approaches avoided intensive computation and sophisticated algorithmic elements (such as spatio-temporal smoothing). We conclude that GNSS-R data over the oceans can contribute signiﬁcantly to a Global/GNSS Ionospheric Observation System (GIOS).

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study has}} been performed at GFZ Potsdam, which shows the anticipated improvement of the lunar gravity field model with respect to current (LP 150 Q model) or near-future (SELENE) knowledge {{in the framework of}} the planned German Lunar Explorations Orbiter (<b>LEO)</b> <b>mission,</b> based on PRARE-L (Precise Range And Range-rate Equipment – Lunar version) Satellite-to-Satellite (SST) and Satellite-Earth-Satellite (SEST) tracking observations. It is shown that the global mean error of the lunar gravity field can be reduced to less than 0. 1 mGal at a spatial resolution of 50 km. In the spectral domain, this means a factor of 10 (long wavelengths) and some 100 (mid to short wavelengths) improvement as compared to predictions for SELENE or a factor of 1000 with respect to LP 150 Q. Furthermore, a higher spatial resolution of up to 28 km seems feasible and would correspond to a factor of 2 – 3 improvement of SELENE results. Moreover, PRARE-L is expected to derive the low-degree coefficients of the lunar gravity field with unprecedented accuracy. Considering long mission duration (at least 1 year is planned) this would allow {{for the first time a}} precise direct determination of the low-degree tidal Love numbers of the Moon and, in combination with high precision SEST, would provide an experimental basis to study relativistic effects such as the periselenium advance in the Earth–Moon system...|$|E

40|$|Microsat and nanosat {{developers}} have mastered the challenges involved in developing low-cost, high-performance satellite missions in low Earth orbit. Here we describe a proposed small-microsat-scale (~ 20 kg) planetary exploration mission {{based on the}} same design approach used in those <b>LEO</b> <b>missions.</b> The “GRavimetric Asteroid Surface Probe” (GRASP) spacecraft is being designed by Gedex and SFL, to carry out fundamental science and exploration activities on the surface of a small asteroid. It will carry a novel, extremely-high-accuracy space gravimeter instrument (VEGA, the VEctor Gravimeter for Asteroids) being developed by Gedex. Emplaced on an asteroid’s surface, VEGA will make measurements of the local gravity field strength (with nano-G accuracy) and direction (with arc-minute accuracy). A single such measurement will enable an asteroid’s mass to be determined, even for a very small asteroid. Measurements at multiple locations will enable inferences to be made about the asteroid’s internal density distribution, and hence its internal structure and composition. While much of the equipment used in LEO nanosats and microsats is suitable for use in GRASP, the mission’s asteroid landing and roving objectives, and the asteroid orbit and surface environment, lead to several design features not generally seen in <b>LEO</b> <b>missions.</b> Here we review GRASP’s mission objectives, highlighting the challenges which drive the design. We discuss the main mission and system level requirements which GRASP will meet, and describe the overall GRASP design...|$|R

From the beginning of VES 16 Lithium-ion cell development, a wide lifetime tests program has been implemented in order to evaluate the different degradation modes due to the conditions applied in LEO cycling, as presented in Table 1. This program has allowed assessing the influence of different parameters such as EOCV (End Of Charge Voltage), DoD (Depth of Discharge), charge current and temperature. New MP 176065 XTD Lithium-ion cell, developed & qualified by Saft, with an operating range extended from − 40 °C to + 85 °C, has already been selected for EXOMARS Rover mission. Promising results in accelerated LEO cycling conditions at 30 %DOD has been observed and compared to VES 16 lithium-ion cell results. Manufactured on a mass production industrial line, this cell is well suited for low cost missions (eg. Mega Constellations…).

40|$|The Space Launch System (SLS) is envisioned as a {{heavy lift}} vehicle {{that will provide}} the {{foundation}} for future beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) missions. While multiple assessments have been performed to determine the optimal configuration for the SLS, this effort was undertaken to evaluate the flexibility of various concepts for the range of missions that may be required of this system. These mission scenarios include single launch crew and/or cargo delivery to LEO, single launch cargo delivery missions to LEO in support of multi-launch mission campaigns, and single launch beyond LEO missions. Specifically, we assessed options for the single launch beyond <b>LEO</b> <b>mission</b> scenario {{using a variety of}} in-space stages and vehicle staging criteria. This was performed to determine the most flexible (and perhaps optimal) method of designing this particular type of mission. A specific mission opportunity to the Jovian system was further assessed to determine potential solutions that may meet currently envisioned mission objectives. This application sought to significantly reduce mission cost by allowing for a direct, faster transfer from Earth to Jupiter and to determine the order-of-magnitude mass margin that would be made available from utilization of the SLS. In general, smaller, existing stages provided comparable performance to larger, new stage developments when the mission scenario allowed for optimal LEO dropoff orbits (e. g. highly elliptical staging orbits). Initial results using this method with early SLS configurations and existing Upper Stages showed the potential of capturing Lunar flyby missions as well as providing significant mass delivery to a Jupiter transfer orbit...|$|E
