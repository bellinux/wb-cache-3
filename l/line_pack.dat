50|$|The BBL (Bacton-Balgzand line) {{terminal}} {{is located}} within the Shell terminal, it receives gas from the compressor station in Anna Paulowna in the Netherlands. The Bacton reception plant is owned by BBL Company and the plant is operated by Shell. Gas arrives at Bacton at approximately seabed temperature and a pressure of up to 135 bar but which varies depending {{on the amount of}} <b>line</b> <b>pack.</b> Bacton’s role is to reduce the pressure for entry to the National Transmission System. As such, significant Joule-Thomson cooling may occur prior to gas injection into the NTS. Therefore, four identical parallel streams are installed at Bacton, each equipped with a direct-fired water bath heater on a slipstream and designed to operate as three duty and one standby at maximum flow conditions, in order to control the delivery temperature and pressure of the gas. The BBL Pipeline is 235 km long and was commissioned in December 2006.|$|E

In our study, gas wells are the main gas source, and gas derived from storage facilities is employed over all periods owing to its economic efficiency. In addition, Fig.  6 c indicates that <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> {{also serves as a}} means of gas storage; indeed, the range of <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> exceeds the combined range of well production and gas storage over the modelled period. Two gas well supply peaks are shown in Fig.  6 b, where the first peak corresponds to a gas demand peak and the second peak corresponds to a power supply peak. Moreover, gas is stored by means of <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> from 1 : 00 to 6 : 00, when the gas load is relatively low, and the <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> later releases gas in response to increasing gas demand. Thus, the <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> also enables flexible operation of the integrated system.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an integrated production–distribution scheduling model in a make-to-order supply chain con-sisting of one supplier and one customer. The supplier receives {{a set of}} orders from the customer {{at the beginning of}} a planning horizon. The supplier needs to process all the orders at a single production <b>line,</b> <b>pack</b> the completed orders to form delivery batches, and deliver the batches to the customer. Each order has a weight, and the total weight of the orders packed in a batch must not exceed the capacity of the delivery batch. Each delivery batch incurs a fixed distribution cost. The problem is to find jointly a schedule for order processing and a way of packing completed orders to form delivery batches such that the total distribution cost (or equivalently, the number of delivery batches) is minimized subject to the constraint that a given customer service level is guar-anteed. We consider two customer service constraints—meeting the given deadlines of the orders; or requiring the average delivery lead time of the orders to be within a given threshold. Several problems of the model with each of those constraints are considered. We clarify the complexity of each problem and develop fast heuristics for the NP-hard problems and analyze their worst-case performance bounds. Our computational results indicate that all the heuristics are capable of generating near optimal solutions quickly for the respective problems.

40|$|Multi-antenna {{systems have}} been shown to offer {{tremendous}} capacity increase in ideal rich scattering conditions. Transmit beamforming and receive combining are low complexity techniques that help in achieving the full diversity afforded by the multiantenna channel. Even if complete channel knowledge at the receiver maybe a realistic assumption in these systems, the same may not be true at the transmitter side. Thus, quantized beamforming with limited feedback on a reverse link has been a topic that has attracted great attention recently. But almost all of the work to date has focussed on modeling the channel with independent, identically distributed (i. i. d.) Rayleigh fading between antenna pairs. In this report, we first review the earlier works which focus on Grassmannian <b>line</b> <b>packing.</b> We then consider the correlated channel case, and show that Grassmannian <b>line</b> <b>packing</b> is an artificial artifact of the i. i. d. assumption. We show that there are dominant peaks in the eigen-domain when correlation is imposed and the code-book construction should be matched to the correlation in the channel, which renders the problem in this case easier than for the i. i. d. channels. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Transmit {{beamforming}} {{and receive}} combining are simple methods for exploiting the significant diversity {{that is available}} in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems. Unfortunately, optimal performance requires either complete channel knowledge or knowledge of the optimal beamforming vector; both are hard to realize. In this correspondence, a quantized maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beamforming technique is proposed where the receiver only sends the label of the best beamforming vector in a predetermined codebook to the transmitter. By using {{the distribution of the}} optimal beamforming vector in independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading matrix channels, the codebook design problem is solved and related to the problem of Grassmannian <b>line</b> <b>packing.</b> The proposed design criterion is flexible enough to allow for side constraints on the codebook vectors. Bounds on the codebook size are derived to guarantee full diversity order. Results on the density of Grassmannian line packings are derived and used to develop bounds on the codebook size given a capacity or SNR loss. Monte Carlo simulations are presented that compare the probability of error for different quantization strategies.

30|$|Efforts to {{separately}} {{optimize the}} two networks can fail {{to capitalize on}} the potential economic benefits of an integrated energy network [4]. Moreover, far worse is that neglecting the interdependencies can lead to inappropriate decisions [5, 6]. A number of studies have focused on modeling integrated natural gas and electric power systems. An optimal power flow model for combined gas and electric networks, denoted as GEOPF, was proposed in [7, 8, 9]. Here, the primary elements in a gas network were modeled to resemble an electric system. However, electricity travels at the speed of light, while a natural gas system features considerably slower transient processes caused by load swings, leading to gas flow coupling in time and space. Consequently, efforts to optimize integrated gas and electric systems have increasingly employed multi-period models. A detailed gas network model was formulated, and considerations of gas storage and <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> were introduced in [10, 11]. Moreover, it was argued that, although a steady-state model is applicable for an electric system, it is not applicable for gas systems due to the low gas velocity. Therefore, dynamic approximations for a gas system are required to guarantee a reliable optimal solution to an integrated model [12]. From this viewpoint, the optimization of an integrated gas and electric system has been recently conducted in the field of unit commitment [13]. However, most researchers have formulated integrated systems as a linear programming problem using linearized electric power/gas flow models to guarantee a global optimum solution. Despite the computational efficiency, the obtained solution may not be the representative of a solution to the original nonlinear problem. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, multi-period integrated gas and electric system optimal power flow (M-GEOPF) has not been formulated based on precise nonlinear electric power and gas flow models.|$|E
40|$|Gas {{and power}} {{networks}} are tightly coupled {{and interact with}} each other due to physically interconnected facilities. In an integrated gas and power network, a contingency observed in one system may cause iterative cascading failures, resulting in network wide disruptions. Therefore, understanding the impacts of the interactions in both systems is crucial for governments, system operators, regulators and operational planners, particularly, to ensure security of supply for the overall energy system. Although simulation has been widely used in the assessment of gas systems as well as power systems, there is a significant gap in simulation models that are able to address the coupling of both systems. In this paper, a simulation framework that models and simulates the gas and power network in an integrated manner is proposed. The framework consists of a transient model for the gas system and a steady state model for the power system based on AC-Optimal Power Flow. The gas and power system model are coupled through an interface which uses the coupling equations to establish the data exchange and coordination between the individual models. The bidirectional interlink between both systems considered in this studies are the fuel gas offtake of gas fired power plants for power generation and the power supply to liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and electric drivers installed in gas compressor stations and underground gas storage facilities. The simulation framework is implemented into an innovative simulation tool named SAInt (Scenario Analysis Interface for Energy Systems) and the capabilities of the tool are demonstrated by performing a contingency analysis for a real world example. Results indicate how a disruption triggered in one system propagates to the other system and affects the operation of critical facilities. In addition, the studies show the importance of using transient gas models for security of supply studies instead of successions of steady state models, where the time evolution of the <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> is not captured correctly.

3000|$|There {{has been}} {{tremendous}} search {{in the field}} of gas pipeline optimization, but still a strong potential exists in this area. Traditional techniques such as gradient search techniques (Rozer 2003; Tabkhi 2007), dynamic programming techniques (Carter 1998), and heuristic methods (Ríos-Mercado et al. 2006; Conrado and Rozer 2005) have been quite popular. In most of these cases, the techniques used have a noteworthy downside of getting easily caught in neighbourhood optima. Hence, they are ineffective at reaching the global optimal solution because of zero-gradient optimality criteria. Also, these methods lack flexibility in handling discrete design variables and are incompetent in optimizing a partial gas pipeline network that is often required by the pipeline operator. To overcome these drawbacks, evolutionary methods are presently getting into the mainstream. Evolutionary algorithm is probabilistic search techniques that emulate the common natural advancement or the communal conduct of natural species. Some of the popular stochastic methods include: differential evolution (Qin et al. 2009), simulated annealing (Wright and Somani 1998), ant colony (Chebouba et al. 2009), genetic algorithm (Goldberg and Kuo 1985) and particle swarm optimization (Xia et al. 2014). These methods have the advantage that they do not require any gradient information and search for an optimal solution is obtained by continuing to evaluate multiple solution vectors simultaneously. However, amongst the various evolutionary methods, the application of ant colony in optimizing gas pipeline operations has been rare. For example, the technique was successfully exploited to find the optimal pipe diameter (Mohajeri et al. 2012), lowering fuel cost in compressors (Chebouba et al. 2009) and reducing fuel expended in compressors for a fixed throughput (Arya and Honwad 2015). However, these applications are limited only to a single-objective optimization. In the recent years, the application of evolutionary methods for multiobjective optimization is becoming popular. For example, global optimization technique that utilizes the concept of interval analysis and constraint propagation has been utilized for solving multiobjective problem of minimizing energy cost and minimizing net revenue (Bonnans and Spiers 2011). Genetic algorithm has been used for minimizing fuel cost and maximizing <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> volume (Chebouba 2015). However, there has been no application of ant colony for solving multiobjective problem of gas pipeline transportation network. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop and apply multiobjective ant colony optimization technique to solve multiobjective pipeline problem of minimizing fuel consumption and maximizing throughput of the gas pipeline network.|$|E

The project considered the impact of flexibility across the whole CCS chain, as well as studying the interfaces between each element of the system; e. g. at the entry to the pipeline system from the capture plant and at the exit from the pipeline to the storage site. The factors identified are intended to allow CCS network designers to determine the degree of flexibility in the system, allowing them to react effectively to short, medium and long term variations in the availability and flow of CO 2 from capture plants and the constraints imposed on the system by CO 2 storage sites. The work of the project is reviewed in this paper which explores the flexibility of power plants operating with post combustion capture systems; quantifies the available time to store (<b>line</b> <b>pack)</b> liquid CO 2 in the pipeline as a function of pipeline size, the inlet mass flow rate and operating pressure; and explores the influence that uncertainty in storage parameters have on the design of the pipeline. In addition, parameters influencing short and longer term network designs are discussed in terms of varying flow rates. Two workshops contributed to the direction of the project. The first workshop identified and confirmed key questions to be considered {{in order to understand the}} most likely impacts of variability in the CO 2 sources and variability in CO 2 sinks on CO 2 transport system design and operation.

The work is expected to inform a broad range of stakeholders and allow network designers to anticipate potential problems associated with the operation of a CCS network. For an effective design of CCS infrastructure, all of the factors that will have a substantial impact on CO 2 flow will have to be analysed at an early stage to prevent possible bottle necks in the whole chain...|$|E
