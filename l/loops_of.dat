5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E

Its termini are both on business <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> Interstate 94 (I-94); the eastern one coincides with an intersection with I-69. Between Kalamazoo and Marshall it passes through Comstock, Galesburg, Augusta, and Battle Creek intersecting I-194/M-66 in Battle Creek and I-94 in Emmett Township.|$|E
5|$|After {{handling}} audio engineering for {{the recording}} of Achtung Baby, Robbie Adams was invited by U2 to manage sound mixing on the Zoo TV Tour. Adams also recorded the group's tour soundchecks. In January 1993, the band asked him to compile these recordings and create <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> interesting parts that they could play to in the studio. After Adams spent a few weeks assembling loops, the group entered The Factory in Dublin that February to begin composing rough demos. Bono and The Edge were most involved during this initial demoing process, which lasted six weeks.|$|E

5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|Over its history, US27 {{had several}} {{business}} loops associated with it. Since {{the conversion of}} the highway into a freeway starting in the 1950s, these business loops served Marshall, Charlotte, Lansing, St. Johns, Ithaca, Alma, St. Louis, Mount Pleasant, Clare and Harrison. The business loops north of Lansing were redesignated as business <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> US127 in 2002 while the Charlotte loop had been reassigned BL I-69 with the completion of I-69 through the area. In addition, Michigan had a US27A designation through Alma and a Truck US27 in Lansing.|$|E
5|$|The {{paratope}} {{is shaped}} at the amino terminal {{end of the}} antibody monomer by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is {{also referred to as}} the FV region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> Œ≤-strands, there each on the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs).|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} five {{different}} business routes of US Highway23 {{in the state}} of Michigan. These business routes were designated along former sections of US Highway23 (US23) to provide signed access from the main highway to the downtowns of cities bypassed by new routings of US23. Two are still extant, connecting through downtown Ann Arbor and Rogers City. Three others have been decommissioned. The former Business US23 (Bus. US23) in Fenton was split in half during the 1970s and later completely turned back to local control in 2006. The former business loops through Saginaw and Bay City were renumbered as business <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> Interstate 75 in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main {{handwritten}} {{forms of the}} Deseret alphabet: a cursive version and a printed version. Over the lifetime of the alphabet, the cursive form fell out of favor among most users of the alphabet and by 1856 no more cursive documents exist. Its impact on the glyphs can however still be plainly seen in the <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> certain characters such as êëÖ, êëÄ and êêº. The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and cursive forms side-by-side, suggesting that a cursive form {{was part of the}} plan from the very beginning.|$|E
5|$|The Reed City Bus. US10 {{was created}} by 1960 to follow Chestnut and Church streets into the community's central {{business}} district and through adjacent residential areas. In 1975 when US10 was rerouted to follow the freeways around Clare, the former routing through downtown on McEwan and Fifth streets was redesignated as a business loop; it was also signed to provide connections between US10 and what is now US127 because of an incomplete interchange between those two freeways. The Midland business loop dates back to 1961 and follows Eastman Avenue and two sets of one-way streets before completing its routing as a freeway. The two business loops created for Flint and Pontiac were designated in 1941 and 1961, respectively. They followed streets that were once part of US 10, but after additional changes to US10's routing in Michigan, they were renumbered as business <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> other highways in 1962 and 1986, respectively. Near Flint, part of US10 was replaced by M-54 when the US Highway was moved to a freeway, and near Pontiac it was replaced by US24 after US10 was truncated in the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{pharyngeal}} jaws of teleosts, {{a second}} set of jaws contained within the throat, are composed of five branchial arches, <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> bone which support the gills. The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials, ceratobranchials, epibranchials and pharyngobranchials. The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate. The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and sometimes additionally, some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial. The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second, third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper. In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium, pectoral girdle, and hyoid bar. Their function is limited to merely transporting food, and they rely mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity. In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it.|$|E
5|$|These {{non-human}} antibodies {{are recognized}} as foreign by the human immune system and may be rapidly cleared from the body, provoke an allergic reaction, or both. To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed chimeric and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, everything is replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> amino acid sequences at the outside of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may have to remain non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production. Thus, the human/mouse chimeric antibody basiliximab ends in -ximab just as does the human/macaque antibody gomiliximab. Purely human antibodies used -u-.|$|E
5|$|Bows of {{any kind}} seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian {{laminated}} bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records {{of any kind}} are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100‚Äì1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string <b>loops)</b> <b>of</b> bows; {{there is no indication}} that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50‚Äì70cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E
