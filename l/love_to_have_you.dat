Dr. Taylor, the head medical officer, told him, [...] "You are clearly talented and we would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> but I am not sure about your motives for joining." [...] He was told to travel for a few months and reconsider.

6000|$|Next {{morning when}} I {{went to see}} my lord as usual, {{he told me that}} as he had handsomely {{provided}} for my daughter, and sent her to the Indies with a man of merit and fortune, he sincerely wished her great prosperity. [...] "And," [...] he added, [...] "to let you see, madam, that I should never have parted from my first engagements of <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>had</b> <b>you</b> not laid yourself so open to censure for your misconduct, my next care shall be to provide for your son Thomas in a handsome manner, before I concern myself with my son by you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'You {{are worth}} it,' I said, {{speaking}} without intending her to hear; 'you are worth it, my dearest one; worth pride and praise and all things. <b>Love!</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> is worth them all together.' And at {{the murmur of}} my voice she turned about.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd love to {{be friends}} with you," [...] she said slowly. [...] "I've often thought I'd like to know you. Isn't it odd that we have the same name? It was so nice of you to come and see me. I--I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> come often." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{really are}} the queerest person, Julien," [...] she declared. [...] "How you were ever a {{success as a}} diplomatist I can't imagine! You came in with the air of one charged with a high and holy mission. It was so obvious and yet {{for a moment it}} puzzled me. How I would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been with <b>you</b> this morning--with you and my mother, I mean--somewhere behind a curtain! Never mind, you've done the really right and honorable thing--you have given me my chance. I am very grateful, Julien." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is so hard}} {{to write}} things, Mr. Tavernake," [...] she said, [...] "but, of course, it is {{something}} to know that if the worst happens I can send her a letter.

5000|$|Although Doncaster offered Roberts a new deal, he {{opted to}} join Derby instead. Of the deal, Doncaster manager Sean O'Driscoll said: [...] "We {{have done what}} we can to keep him but we are still far away from what he has been offered. Since we (O'Driscoll and his {{management}} team) walked through the door, he has been a first class professional and got better. That is football and I think that he has found the decision difficult and at his age you understand that if he wants to move to pastures new, not to push him away as I would <b>love</b> him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stayed, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be practical." ...|$|R
5000|$|A lidérc is {{mentioned}} in the famous historical novel The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco.

Then <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> let the eggs rot {{in a pile of}} horse dung (and he had one ready {{in a corner of the}} vegetable garden where nobody ever went), and there a little devil would be born from each egg, and would then be at your service, procuring for you all the delights of this world.|$|R

I must say that, if he is my brother. He has no bad habits and he's a great worker, and you can depend on him. 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.' He told {{me to tell you}} he'd be quite willing to wait till you got through college, if you insisted, though he'd RATHER get married this spring before the {{planting}} begins.

6000|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. George, don't take my son {{away from}} me.

6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} tell you of my heart, and I hope you won't think it silly. I do so because I believe you to be a gentleman, and a man of honor." [...] He blushed at the words and the tone in which they were spoken, but his heart fell still lower. [...] "Mr. Anderson, I am engaged." [...] Here she paused a moment, but he <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> say. [...] "I am engaged to marry a gentleman whom I love with all my heart, and all my strength, and all my body. I love him so that nothing can ever {{separate}} me from him, or, at least, from the thoughts of him. As regards all the interests of life, I feel as though I were already his wife. If I ever marry any man I swear to you that it will be him." [...] Then Mr. Anderson felt that all hope had utterly departed from him. She had said that she believed him to be a man of truth. He certainly believed her to be a true-speaking woman. He asked himself, and he found it to be quite impossible to doubt her word on this subject. [...] "Now I will go on and tell you my troubles. My mother disapproves of the man. Sir Magnus has taken upon himself to disapprove, and Lady Mountjoy disapproves especially. I don't care two straws about Sir Magnus and Lady Mountjoy. As to Lady Mountjoy, it is simply an impertinence on her part, interfering with me." [...] There was something in her face as she said this which made Mr. Anderson feel that if he could only succeed in having her and the pair of ponies he would be a prouder man than the ambassador at Paris. But he knew that it was hopeless. [...] "As to my mother, that is indeed a sorrow. She <b>has</b> been <b>to</b> me the dearest mother, putting her only hopes of happiness in me. No mother was ever more devoted to a child, and of all children I should be the most ungrateful were I to turn against her. But from my early years she <b>has</b> wished me <b>to</b> marry a man whom I could not bring myself <b>to</b> <b>love.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> heard of Captain Scarborough?" ...|$|R

5000|$|.....to move to California and try screenwriting — Bryan {{was already}} living there. And then I was offered my own agency in Florida. I was 22 years old, and was being given this {{opportunity}} to run my own business. So I called Bryan and he said, “Listen, I’d <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> out here but there’s nothing going on; you should probably go to Florida.” So I told them I would do it ... and then, out of nowhere, it fell through. ...

He had made a short film called [...] "Lion’s Den", with Ethan Hawke -... {{and we tried to}} make a feature-length film out of it. The script was horrible. My parts of it were written by hand. So Bryan called me and said that these people had seen [...] "Lion’s Den" [...] and really liked it and had asked to see another script. And he made up a three-second pitch off the top of his head, which evolved into Public Access. ... He asked me if I wanted to write it. ... I wrote a draft in 15 days. ... Bryan then got Michael Dougan involved in the writing, and he came in and took this basically glorified episode of Murder, She Wrote and really darkened it up. I took a look at his rewrite and was like, [...] "Oh, you mean I can be dark with it…" ...|$|E
