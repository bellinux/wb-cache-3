5|$|Early on October26, a {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} central Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into Hurricane Juan while meandering northward. The storm had a large wind field and was somewhat subtropical in nature. Due to weak steering currents, Juan <b>looped</b> once offshore Louisiana and later <b>looped</b> again over the state, weakening into {{a tropical}} storm over land on October29. The storm turned eastward and later northeastward, striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan turned to the north over land and became extratropical on November1 over Tennessee. After the remnants of Juan continued to the north into Canada, it spawned an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley. This low continued to the east through North Carolina, bringing moderate rainfall throughout the region, and saturating soils; overcast skies and the weak sunlight of early November prevented much of the rains from evaporating.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Philippe {{initially}} {{formed to}} the east of the Lesser Antilles on September 17 and moved to the north strengthening as it did so. Philippe became a hurricane on September 18 and stayed as such for two days before increasing wind shear from a non-tropical system took its toll on September 20 and weakened Philippe into a tropical storm. Philippe continued to weaken as it <b>looped</b> around this low and was absorbed by it on September 23.|$|E
50|$|In {{their basic}} form, P <b>loops</b> and eye <b>loops</b> are “open” <b>loops.</b> This {{means that the}} <b>loop</b> can be opened {{mechanically}} {{to allow it to}} connect to another component. The opposite of an open <b>loop</b> is a closed <b>loop.</b> In a closed <b>loop,</b> the end of the wire is wrapped around the stem of the <b>loop</b> so that the <b>loop</b> is permanent and can’t be opened. A closed <b>loop</b> is also called a wrapped <b>loop</b> and it is this technique that resulted in this approach to making jewelry being called wire wrapping. A connection between two wrapped <b>loops</b> must be performed BEFORE the second <b>loop</b> is wrapped closed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loop</b> fission or <b>loop</b> distribution: <b>Loop</b> fission {{attempts}} {{to break a}} <b>loop</b> into multiple <b>loops</b> over the same index range but each taking {{only a part of}} the <b>loop's</b> body.

5|$|A {{review of}} the National Waymarked Trails in Ireland by the National Trails Office in 2010 {{acknowledged}} these shortcomings and recommended that the Wicklow Way be selected as one of fourteen trails to be upgraded to a National Long Distance Trail. This is a proposed new standard of trail in Ireland, intended to meet international standards for outstanding trails. It would require sections on unsuitable roads to comprise less than 10% of the total trail and for appropriate support services – accommodation, meals, transport, luggage transfer etc. – to be available. The review also recommended the development of shorter <b>looped</b> walks off the Wicklow Way and improving parking facilities.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{formed on}} November9 {{to the east}} of Diego Garcia, possibly the result of the MJO. A circulation was evident by November11, and the following day it developed into Tropical Disturbance 2 about 830km (515mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. Also on November12, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02S. It moved to the southwest, but <b>looped</b> back to the east on November13, during which time the MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status. Later that day, the agency ceased issuing advisories, but the system reorganized on November14. On November17, it turned back to the southwest, but the MFR discontinued advisories on the next day.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be <b>looped</b> out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E

Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and <b>looped</b> grooves, an innovative technique at the time.

While the ride had a considerably more mild experience than Beecher's original Flip Flap Railway, it was not popular and it attracted few repeat riders.

5|$|Arsenal {{went into}} {{the final day of}} the {{competition}} knowing a draw was enough to win the Emirates Cup. Alexandre Lacazette started for Arsenal, as did Mesut Özil, while Ben Yedder continued to lead the line for Sevilla in a front three – either side of Nolito and Joaquín Correa. After an uneventful first half which saw both sides create few chances, Sevilla took the lead when Ben Yedder's reverse ball found an incoming Correa who slotted the ball past Petr Čech. Lacazette equalised for Arsenal, but the hosts went behind again after Steven N'Zonzi's long shot <b>looped</b> into the far top corner. Sevilla held on to win, but despite a 100% record they finished second because Arsenal's points and goal difference was identical to theirs, and the Spanish club had scored fewer goals over the two days.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we explore how to utilize a <b>loop</b> cache {{to relieve the}} {{unnecessary}} pressure placed on the trace cache by <b>loops.</b> Due to the high temporal locality of <b>loops,</b> <b>loops</b> should be cached. We have observed that when <b>loops</b> contain control flow instructions in their bodies {{it is better to}} collect traces on a dedicated <b>loop</b> cache instead of using trace cache space. The traces of instructions within <b>loops</b> tend to exhibit predictable patterns that can be detected and exploited at run-time. We propose to capture dynamic traces of <b>loop</b> bodies in a <b>loop</b> cache. The novelty of this <b>loop</b> cache consists of dynamically capturing <b>loop</b> iterations with conditional branches and correlating them to unique <b>loops.</b> Once <b>loop</b> iterations are cached in the <b>loop</b> cache, their bodies can be provided by the <b>loop</b> cache without polluting the trace cache and without any instruction cache accesses. The proposed <b>loop</b> cache includes hardware capable of dynamically unfolding <b>loops</b> such that large traces of instructions are accessed in a single <b>loop</b> cache interrogation. We evaluate our <b>loop</b> cache and compare it against a baseline machine with a larger first-level instruction cache. We also consider how the <b>loop</b> cache can compliment the introduction of a trace cache by filtering out <b>loop</b> traces that needlessly dominate the trace cache space. We quantify th...|$|R
