5|$|When Franklin and Providence/Stoughton service {{returned}} to the main <b>line,</b> <b>service</b> on the Midland had become popular enough to justify a continued shuttle service along the line from Boston to Fairmount. The Fairmount Shuttle was extended to Readville on November 30, 1987 as the Fairmount Line. Since 1987, Providence/Stoughton <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> has run through Readville without making a station stop, {{even though there are}} platforms in place to allow such use.|$|E

5|$|At ground level, the three-track Northeast Corridor {{runs through}} the station. There are two side {{platforms}}; however, Providence/Stoughton Line trains do not stop at Readville in regular service. The platforms are occasionally used during service disruptions when Fairmount <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> is not running or when trains cannot stop at Hyde Park.|$|E
5|$|Because of its Red Line connection, Porter Square {{can serve}} as a {{temporary}} inbound terminus for the Fitchburg <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> when commuter rail service is disrupted between Porter and Boston's North Station. It served this role during the 2004 Democratic National Convention, when North Station was closed for a week for security purposes, and during Green Line Extension construction in 2015 and 2017.|$|E

50|$|From December 2001, the 215 series fleet {{was removed}} from Tōkaidō <b>Line</b> Acty <b>services,</b> and reassigned to new Shōnan-Shinjuku <b>Line</b> <b>services</b> between Shinjuku and Yokosuka. Their use on Shōnan-Shinjuku <b>Line</b> <b>services</b> {{continued}} until 16 October 2004, from which date all Shōnan-Shinjuku <b>Line</b> <b>services</b> were standardized with E231 series rolling stock.|$|R

5|$|Princess Matoika—outfitted for 350cabin-class and 500third-class {{passengers}} and at —kicked off her U.S. Mail <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> on 20 January 1921 when she sailed from New York to Naples and Genoa {{on her first}} of three roundtrips between these ports. After a storm damaged the Matoikas steering gear, {{she had to be}} towed back in to New York on 28January.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route. The plan would have sent Blue Line trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> than would be required to run Blue <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Blue Line operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnant of}} the IRT Ninth Avenue Line at 155th Street would connect with the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, giving riders of the Jerome Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> to Manhattan's West Side. This project was never {{undertaken}} {{because of the high}} cost of modifying the third rail in the Sedgwick Avenue and Anderson–Jerome Avenues tunnel section to accommodate new subway cars.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street {{opened on}} March 20, 1933, {{as the first}} station of the IND Culver <b>Line.</b> <b>Service</b> began {{one month after the}} {{expansion}} of the IND into Brooklyn to Jay Street–Borough Hall. The station's construction was expedited in order to both connect with and compete with the Bergen Street and Smith Street streetcar lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). Construction was slightly stalled due to delays in the delivery of steel flues for the ventilation system.|$|E
5|$|Express trains {{operated}} by NSB {{have always been}} the primary passenger service on Bergensbanen. Passenger trains follow the Drammen Line and the Asker Line to Drammen, before heading north to Hønefoss on the Randsfjord Line. The express trains offer both transport from villages along the line to either Bergen or Oslo, as well travel between Norway's two largest cities. Expresses are locomotive-hauled trains with modernized coaches. Six nights a week there is a night train service. Several parts of the <b>line</b> <b>service</b> places without road access, such as Finse and Myrdal. Operating deficits are covered by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.|$|E

5|$|From 1944 to 1979, the {{configuration}} of Readville was static: the two-story depot served the lower level (Northeast Corridor) tracks, while the elevated track to Franklin and beyond was served by a small shack with stairs to the lower level. Starting in 1979, construction of the Southwest Corridor necessitated closure of the main line between Back Bay and Forest Hills. From November 3, 1979 until October 5, 1987, all Franklin Line and Providence/Stoughton <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> ran to Boston on the Midland Division via Readville.|$|E
5|$|The Orange Line of the Washington Metro {{consists}} of 26 rapid transit stations from Vienna to New Carrollton. It has stations in Fairfax County and Arlington, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Prince George's County, Maryland. Half of the line's stations are {{shared with the}} Blue Line and over two thirds are shared with the Silver Line. Orange <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> began on November 20, 1978.|$|E
5|$|The Rush+ {{realignment}} {{was intended}} to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to Largo Town Center were now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line trains running {{all the way up}} the Green Line to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver <b>Line</b> <b>service,</b> excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between Pentagon and Rosslyn. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The Yellow Line of the Washington Metro {{consists}} of 17 rapid transit stations from Huntington in Virginia to either Mount Vernon Square (where peak hours trains terminate) or Fort Totten (outside of peak hours). Additional Yellow Line trains may continue passenger service to Greenbelt during off-peak hours and weekends {{in order to}} stage them for Green <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> or for storage at the Greenbelt rail yard. In non rush/peak hours, almost all regularly scheduled trains run to Fort Totten.|$|E
5|$|The {{above ground}} tracks {{continue}} along DC Route 295 between Minnesota Avenue and Deanwood stations and then follow the CSX/Amtrak railroad in Prince George's County, Maryland {{to the eastern}} terminus at New Carrolton. The route includes a train yard adjacent to the West Falls Church station. Orange <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> travels along {{the entirety of the}} K Route (from the terminus at Vienna/Fairfax-GMU to the C & K junction just south of Rosslyn), part of the C Route (from the C & K junction just south of Rosslyn to Metro Center), and the entire D Route (from Metro Center to New Carrollton).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Metropolitan & St. John's Wood Railway was to run to underground north-east to Hampstead Village, and indeed this appeared on some maps. Although in the event this was not completed in full and the line was built in a north-western direction instead, a short heading of tunnel was built north of Swiss Cottage station {{in the direction of}} Hampstead. This is still visible today when traveling on a southbound Metropolitan <b>line</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sets {{originally}} {{sported a}} yellow bodyside line when used on Yurakucho <b>Line</b> <b>services,</b> but were gradually reliveried with brown, gold, and white stripes coinciding with use on Fukutoshin <b>Line</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
