25|$|Pythagoras in the 6th-century BC and Parmenides in the 5th-century {{stated that}} the Earth is spherical, the spherical view spread rapidly in the Greek world. Around 330 BC, Aristotle {{maintained}} {{on the basis of}} physical theory and observational evidence that the Earth was spherical, and reported on an estimate on the circumference. The Earth's circumference was first determined around 240 BC by Eratosthenes. By the second century AD, Ptolemy had derived his maps from a globe and developed the system of <b>latitude,</b> <b>longitude,</b> and climes. His Almagest was written in Greek and only translated into Latin in the 11th century from Arabic translations.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} spherical coordinate systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a geographical coordinate system positions are measured in <b>latitude,</b> <b>longitude</b> and height or altitude. There are a {{number of different}} celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the -axis to the -axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the horizontal coordinate system. The polar angle is often replaced by the elevation angle measured from the reference plane. Elevation angle of zero is at the horizon.|$|E

2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a fluid. As such, {{the idea of}} numerical weather prediction is to sample {{the state of the}} fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. [...] On land, terrain maps, available at resolutions down to [...] globally, are used to help model atmospheric circulations within regions of rugged topography, in order to better depict features such as downslope winds, mountain waves, and related cloudiness which affects incoming solar radiation. [...] The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Models are initialized using this observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms. The grid used for global models is geodesic or icosahedral, spaced by <b>latitude,</b> <b>longitude,</b> and elevation. The data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast.|$|E
