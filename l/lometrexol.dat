5000|$|Inhibition of enzymes {{involved}} in purine biosynthesis {{has been exploited}} as a potential drug target for chemotherapy. Cancer cells require high concentrations of purines to facilitate division [...] and tend to rely on de novo synthesis rather than the nucleotide salvage pathway. Several folate based inhibitors {{have been developed to}} inhibit formylation reactions by GAR transformylase and AICAR transformylase. The first GAR transformylase inhibitor <b>Lometrexol</b> (6R)5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate was developed in the 1980s through a collaboration between Eli Lilly and academic laboratories.Although similar in structure to N10-formyl-THF, <b>lometrexol</b> is incapable of carrying out one carbon transfer reactions. Additionally, several GAR based inhibitors of GAR transformylase have also been synthesized.Development of folate based inhibitors {{have been found to be}} particularly challenging as the inhibitors also down regulate the enzyme folypolyglutamate synthase, which adds additional Î³-glutamates to monoglutamate folates and antifolates after entering the cell for increased enzyme affinity. This increased affinity can lead to antifolate resistance.|$|E
50|$|Folate {{metabolism}} {{has already}} {{been the subject of}} chemotherapeutic strategies, but SHMT inhibition, while researched, had not really been taken advantage of in commercial anticancer drugs. However, because the folates used by folate metabolic and folate dependent enzymes are all very similar in structure and folate mimics already being common in medical use, it has not been difficult to find potential molecular structures that may inhibit SHMT. For example, pemetrexed is already used as an antifolate to treat mesothelioma and was found to be an effective inhibitor of SHMT and screening other antifolates revealed <b>lometrexol</b> as another effective inhibitor of SHMT.|$|E
40|$|The novel antifolate <b>lometrexol</b> (5, 10 -dideazatetrahydrofolate) {{inhibits}} de novo purine biosynthesis, and co-incubation with hypoxanthine abolishes its cytotoxicity. The {{prevention of}} hypoxanthine rescue from an antipurine antifolate by the nucleoside transport inhibitor dipyridamole was investigated {{for the first}} time in nine human and rodent cell lines from seven different tissues of origin. In A 549, HeLa and CHO cells, dipyridamole prevented hypoxanthine rescue and so growth was inhibited by the combination of <b>lometrexol,</b> dipyridamole and hypoxanthine, but in HT 29, HCT 116, KK 47, MDA 231, CCRF CEM and L 1210 cells dipyridamole had no effect and the combination did not inhibit growth. Dipyridamole inhibited hypoxanthine uptake in A 549 but not in CCRF CEM cells. Dipyridamole prevented the hypoxanthine-induced repletion of dGTP pools, depleted by <b>lometrexol,</b> in A 549 but not in CCRF CEM cells. Thus, the selective growth-inhibitory effect of the combination of <b>lometrexol,</b> dipyridamole and hypoxanthine is apparently due to the dipyridamole sensitivity (ds) or insensitivity (di) of hypoxanthine transport. Both the human and murine leukaemic cells are of the di phenotype. If this reflects the transport phenotype of normal bone marrow it would suggest that the combination of <b>lometrexol,</b> dipyridamole and hypoxanthine might be selectively toxic to certain tumour types and have reduced toxicity to the bone marrow...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{reprogramming}} of {{tumor cells}} toward serine catabolism is now {{recognized as a}} hallmark of cancer. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), the enzyme providing one-carbon units by converting serine and tetrahydrofolate (H 4 PteGlu) to glycine and 5, 10 -CH 2 -H 4 PteGlu, therefore represents a target of interest in developing new chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, 13 folate analogues under clinical evaluation or in therapeutic use were in silico screened against SHMT, ultimately identifying four antifolate agents worthy of closer evaluation. The interaction mode of SHMT with these four antifolate drugs (<b>lometrexol,</b> nolatrexed, raltitrexed, and methotrexate) was assessed. The mechanism of SHMT inhibition by the selected antifolate agents was investigated in vitro using the human cytosolic isozyme. The {{results of this study}} showed that <b>lometrexol</b> competitively inhibits SHMT with inhibition constant (Ki) values in the low micromolar. The binding mode of <b>lometrexol</b> to SHMT was further investigated by molecular docking. These results thus provide insights into the mechanism of action of antifolate drugs and constitute the basis for the rational design of novel and more potent inhibitors of SHMT...|$|E

40|$|Many new antifolate {{compounds}} {{with unique}} clinical properties {{are currently in}} clinical development. Some of these agents have been rationally designed to circumvent known mechanisms of resistance to methotrexate, the most useful and extensively studied antifolate in clinical practice. Resistance to methotrexate can result from decreased active transport into cells, decreased polyglutamation resulting in enhanced drug efflux from cells, mutations in dihydrofolate reductase which reduce drug binding affinity, and increased expression of dihydrofolate reductase due to gene amplification or increased translational efficiency. As a consequence, the newer antifolates may differ from methotrexate because of increased lipid solubility, improved cellular uptake or increased ability to undergo polyglutamation. Several of these newer agents also uniquely target specific folate-dependent enzymes such as thymidylate synthase or glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase. Antifolates currently in clinical development include trimetrexate, edatrexate, piritrexim, ZD 1694, <b>lometrexol,</b> AG 337, LY 231514 and 1843 U 89.

40|$|The {{shape of}} a normal human red blood cell (RBC) is well known: under resting {{conditions}} it {{is that of a}} biconcave discocyte. However, RBCs can easily undergo transformation to other shapes with stomatocytes and echinocytes as extremes. Various anticancer agents, generally reactive and labile substances, e. g., oxazaphosphorines and fluoropyrimidines, can induce severe deformation of shape. Shape changes in erythrocytes can induce rheological disturbances, which occasionally have pathophysiological. consequences. It is difficult to estimate the impact of shape changes on the in vivo behavior of agents of biological interest. However, it has been demonstrated for various anticancer agents that erythrocytes fulfill an important role in their uptake, transport, and release. Moreover. some anticancer agents are capable of influencing important transporters such as MRP and GLUT- 1. Monitoring of erythrocyte concentrations of certain cytotoxic agents is therefore of interest as the data generated can have a predictive outcome for therapeutic efficacy.

40|$|Glycinamide {{ribonucleotide}} transformylase (GAR Tfase) {{has been}} the target of anti-neoplastic intervention for almost two decades. Here, we use a structure-based approach to design a novel folate analogue, 10 -(trifluoroacetyl) - 5, 10 -dideazaacyclic- 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydrofolic acid (10 -CF(3) CO-DDACTHF, 1), which specifically inhibits recombinant human GAR Tfase (K(i) = 15 nM), but is inactive (K(i) > 100 microM) against other folate-dependent enzymes that have been examined. Moreover, compound 1 is a potent inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation (IC(50) = 16 nM, CCRF-CEM), which represents a 10 -fold improvement over <b>Lometrexol,</b> a GAR Tfase inhibitor that has been in clinical trials. Thus, this folate analogue 1 is among the most potent and selective inhibitors known toward GAR Tfase. Contributing to its efficacious activity, compound 1 is effectively transported into the cell by the reduced folate carrier and intracellularly sequestered by polyglutamation. The crystal structure of human GAR Tfase with folate analogue 1 at 1. 98 A resolution represents the first structure of any GAR Tfase to be determined with a cofactor or cofactor analogue without the presence of substrate. The folate-binding loop of residues 141 - 146, which is highly flexible in both Escherichia coli and unliganded human GAR Tfase structures, becomes highly ordered upon binding 1 in the folate-binding site. Computational docking of the natural cofactor into this and other apo or complexed structures provides a rational basis for modeling how the natural cofactor 10 -formyltetrahydrofolic acid interacts with GAR Tfase, and suggests that this folate analogue-bound conformation represents the best template to date for inhibitor design...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that ceramide synthase 6 (CerS 6) is elevated {{in response to}} folate stress in cancer cells, leading to enhanced production of C 16 -ceramide and apoptosis. Antifolate methotrexate (MTX), a drug commonly used in chemotherapy of several types of cancer, is a strong inhibitor of folate metabolism. Here we investigated whether this drug targets CerS 6. We observed that CerS 6 protein was markedly elevated in several cancer cell lines treated with MTX. In agreement with the enzyme elevation, its product C 16 -ceramide was also strongly elevated, so as several other ceramide species. The increase in C 16 -ceramide, however, was eliminated in MTX-treated cells lacking CerS 6 through siRNA silencing, while the increase in other ceramides sustained. Furthermore, the siRNA silencing of CerS 6 robustly protected A 549 lung adenocarcinoma cells from MTX toxicity, while the silencing of another ceramide synthase, CerS 4, which was also responsive to folate stress in our previous study, did {{not interfere with the}} MTX effect. The rescue effect of CerS 6 silencing upon MTX treatment was further confirmed in HCT 116 and HepG 2 cell lines. Interestingly, CerS 6 itself, but not CerS 4, induced strong antiproliferative effect in several cancer cell lines if elevated by transient transfection. The effect of MTX on CerS 6 elevation was likely p 53 dependent, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that the protein is a transcriptional target of p 53. In line with this notion, <b>lometrexol,</b> the antifolate inducing cytotoxicity through the p 53 -independent mechanism, did not affect CerS 6 levels. We have also found that MTX induces the formation of ER aggregates, enriched with CerS 6 protein. We further demonstrated that such aggregation requires CerS 6 and suggests that it is an indication of ER stress. Overall, our study identified CerS 6 and ceramide pathways as a novel MTX target...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of clonogenic {{potential}} by the glycinamideribonucleosyl transformylase inhibitor 5, 10 -dideazatetrahydrofolic acid (DDATHF, <b>Lometrexol)</b> {{was evaluated}} in vitro {{in a human}} ovarian carcinoma cell line, SW 626. Drug-induced inhibition of clonogenic potential {{is a function of}} the dose and time of exposure and is independent of the formation of DNA single-strand breaks or de novo synthesis of protein. Simultaneous treatment with 100 microM hypoxanthine completely prevented the inhibition of clonogenic potential caused by 0. 5 microM DDATHF. DDATHF blocked cells in the early-middle S-phases of the cell cycle, and there was a corresponding marked reduction in the rate of DNA synthesis after drug withdrawal. The cytotoxic potential of DDATHF was modulated by the folic acid concentration present in the medium. In a medium containing 0. 22 microM folic acid, DDATHF cytotoxicity was at least 100 times that in a regular medium containing 2. 22 microM folic acid, levels which, however, are about 100 times those found in human plasma. DDATHF cytotoxicity differed moderately when folic acid concentrations varied between 0. 22 and 0 microM, suggesting that folic acid does not necessarily antagonise DDATHF anti-tumour activity. Folinic acid at a concentration as low as 0. 1 microM can completely rescue cells when given simultaneously with 0. 5 microM DDATHF. When folinic acid was given 24 h after DDATHF, a reversal of cytotoxicity was observed at 0. 5 and 1 microM, but to a much lesser extent than simultaneous treatment. When folinic acid was added after 48 or 72 h of DDATHF washout, even at a high concentration and for a long time, no reduction in DDATHF cytotoxicity was found. In conclusion, the study highlights the modulation of DDATHF cytotoxicity by folic acid or by folinic acid and provides further rationale for in vivo clinical investigation with these combinations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lometrexol</b> (5, 10 -dideazatetrahydrofolic acid; DDATHF), is a {{specific}} inhibitor of glycinamideribonucleosyl (GAR) transformylase with anti-tumour activity in murine and human carcinomas. The cytotoxicity activity of DDATHF was evaluated in vitro in NIH/ 3 T 3 cells transfected with human alpha-folate-binding protein (FBP) complementary DNA to examine {{the role of the}} receptor. In FBP-transfected NIH/ 3 T 3 (FBP-tNIH/ 3 T 3) cells, which internalised about three times more 5 -methyltetrahydrofolic acid than the mock-transfected cells, the cytotoxtic potential of DDATHF showed a clear increase. Subsequently, we analysed four ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OVCAR 3, IGROV 1, SKOV 3, and SW 626) expressing different amounts of FBP. Cells were conditioned to grow in medium depleted of folic acid then tested by MOv 18 and folic acid binding. Only SKOV 3 and SW 626 cells grown in folic acid-depleted medium showed increased FBP expression, about 3 - and 8 -fold respectively. The cytotoxic potential of DDATHF was evaluated by a standard clonogenic assay. In a medium containing 2. 27 microM folic acid the DDATHF IC 50 values were 50 nm on OVCAR 3, 500 nM on SW 626 and 1000 nM on IGROV 1. In folic acid-free medium IC 50 values were 2 nM on OVCAR 3 and Sw 626 and 40 nM on IGROV 1. Only on SKOV 3 cells was DDATHF cytotoxicity the same regardless of the amount of folic acid in the medium (IC 50 8 nM). Thus, DDATHF did not inhibit the growth of IGROV 1 cells depleted of folic acid after stripping FBP with phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C, even at a dose toxic for cells constitutively expressing FBP.

40|$|Folic acid is an {{essential}} vitamin utilized in the one-carbon metabolism pathway for the synthesis of purine and thymidine nucleotides, which are necessary for cell growth and proliferation. As a result, the enzymes that participate in the metabolism of folic acid have been good targets for cancer chemotherapy. Folylpoly-Î³-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) is an enzyme in the folate metabolism pathway that catalyzes the addition of glutamic acid to the naturally occurring folates, thereby allowing the retention of folate cofactors in cells. Similarly, {{in the case of}} cancer chemotherapy, antifolates, such as <b>Lometrexol</b> and Tomudex are retained in cells through the activity of FPGS. Consequently, any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that exist in the fpgs gene may decrease or increase the cytotoxicity of antifolates and, ultimately, the clinical response rate to antifolate therapy. The goal of this project is to define the position and frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mRNA made from the fpgs gene from peripheral blood of one hundred normal individuals. Six Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) primers were designed to amplify the gene as three overlapping pieces and four primers were designed for sequencing of the three PCR products. In this study, we found polymorphic sites at nucleotides 64, 123, 253, 423, 1334 and 1781. The majority of the samples (49 / 88) expressed rnRNA with point mutations on at least one allele at base 64, while 8 samples had a SNP at base 123. At nucleotide 123, 6 samples expressed the heterozygote GIA genotype, and one sample expressed the homozygote A/A allele at this site. At nucleotide 423, two samples expressed a G allele and also the common C allele. While the SNPs at nucleotide 64, 123, and 423 caused a silent or conservative mutation in the gene, in sample 82, a mutation C 253 T produced an amino acid change from an arginine to tryptophan, which may cause a functional change in the fpgs protein, due to the significant change in size and charge of the wild type amino acid. Similarly, sample 26 expessed a homozygote T/T allele at nucleotide 1334 instead of the common C/C allele expressed in the remaining samples. This point mutation caused a valine to alanine amino acid change. We also detected a SNP that is expressed after the stop codon in sample 40...|$|E
