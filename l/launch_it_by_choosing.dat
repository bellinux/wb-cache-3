50|$|Micro Center was {{the first}} {{retailer}} in the United States to sell the DJI Mavic Pro drone, <b>launching</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> hosting a three-day demonstration in their Columbus store's parking lot which was open {{to the press and}} the public.|$|R

50|$|NAA {{had also}} {{been working on the}} SM-64 Navaho cruise missile project, which used the same engine as a booster to get the missile up to speed so its ramjet engines could light. The Air Force {{continually}} demanded higher performance from the Navaho, which forced NAA to build larger aircraft, and larger boosters to <b>launch</b> <b>it.</b> <b>By</b> the early 1950s, the basic engine design had been enlarged to produce 120000 lbf kN.|$|R
50|$|The LA100 {{follows a}} pre-programmed flight path. The {{operational}} procedure implies mounting GoPro {{camera on the}} wing (GoPro Hero, Hero2, Hero 3 for oblique images or Hero3 for vertical images), switching the engine on by reclining the aircraft and <b>launching</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> hand. The LA100 is capturing footage from a height of 100 meters for 4min30sec and then {{coming back to the}} launch site with HD aerial photos or videos on the SD card.|$|R
50|$|In 1968 the new triples {{disappointed}} the American BSA-Triumph management, {{who knew}} that Honda had a motorcycle under development. They felt the price of $1,800 (£895) was too high, and technical details (like vertically-split crankcases and a pushrod OHV valve train were too conventional. However, they acknowledged that the bike was fast and the US sales team <b>launched</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> setting speed records at Daytona (which were only broken in 1971 by the Kawasaki Z1).|$|R
50|$|The Insiders have {{secretly}} built a scan-proof {{boat and}} <b>launch</b> <b>it,</b> manned <b>by</b> secret volunteers {{to escape the}} island and tell the outside world about Absolom. However, somehow the boat is detected by the attack helicopters and is destroyed.|$|R

25|$|If {{there is}} a graph {{requiring}} 5 colors, then {{there is a}} minimal such graph, where removing any vertex makes it four-colorable. Call this graph G. Then G cannot have a vertex of degree 3 or less, because if d(v) ≤ 3, we can remove v from G, four-color the smaller graph, then add back v and extend the four-coloring to <b>it</b> <b>by</b> <b>choosing</b> a color different from its neighbors.|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{an earlier}} work on fractional-action {{cosmology}} with a periodic weight function [1], we extend <b>it</b> <b>by</b> <b>choosing</b> a power-law weight {{function in the}} action. In this approach, we obtain a varying gravitational coupling constant. We then model dark energy in this paradigm and obtain relevant cosmological parameters.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{algorithms}} for obtaining the NAF {{representation of a}} value given in binary.

40|$|Searching for {{mathematical}} concepts being {{indicated in}} a document {{is not easy}} with the existing technologies because the current information retrieval technology has been designed for words and mathematical concepts are often made of more than single words. Skills-text-box is an approach to this retrieval problem: it lets users use the classical search by words paradigm {{to search for the}} concept then identify <b>it</b> <b>by</b> <b>choosing</b> through a finite list. Skills-text-box is the device used to support the search engine of i 2 geo. net: at contribution and search time. In this paper for MathUI 2012, we sketch the current technical development Skills-text-box, and present its advantages and limits as have been experimented by multiple mathematics teachers in Europe...|$|R
