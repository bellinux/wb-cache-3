The aorta is a <b>large</b> <b>artery</b> that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E

40|$|Resistance of <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> {{appears to}} be greater in the {{cerebral}} circulation than in other vascular beds. <b>Large</b> <b>arteries</b> contribute importantly to total cerebral vascular resistance and are major determinants of local microvascular pressure. Recent {{studies have shown that}} resistance of <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> and cerebral microvascular pressure are affected by several physiological stimuli, including changes in systemic blood pressure, increases in cerebral metabolism, activity of sympathetic nerves, and humoral stimuli such as circulating vasopres-sin and angiotensin. Stimuli such as sympathetic stimulation and vasopressin produce selective responses of <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> and, thereby, regulate microvascular pressure without a significant change in cerebral blood flow. These findings lead to the new hypothesis that the brain may be sensitive to changes in cerebral microvascular pressure, resulting in activation ofcompensatory neurohumoral mechanisms. Important changes occur in <b>large</b> cerebral <b>arteries</b> under patho-physiological conditions. Chronic hypertension increases resistance of <b>large</b> cerebral <b>arteries,</b> which protects the microcirculation against hypertension.

500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} modalities {{exist to}} demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The gold standard is cerebral angiography (with or without digital subtraction angiography). This involves puncture of a <b>large</b> <b>artery</b> (usually the femoral artery) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the aorta towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, radiocontrast is injected and its downstream flow captured on fluoroscopy (continuous X-ray imaging). The vessel may appear stenotic (narrowed, 41–75%), occluded (blocked, 18–49%), {{or as an}} aneurysm (area of dilation, 5–13%). The narrowing may be described as [...] "rat's tail" [...] or [...] "string sign". Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure, and it requires large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as kidney damage. Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood in the vessel wall, as opposed to more modern modalities. The only remaining use of angiography is when endovascular treatment is contemplated (see below).|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} {{classification}} systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, {{also known as}} the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), lacunar infarct (LACI) or posterior circulation infarct (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain that is affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis. The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, a stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a <b>large</b> <b>artery,</b> (2) an embolism originating in the heart, (3) complete blockage of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation).

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{possible}} role of leukocytes in the pathogenesis of vasospasm. We hypothesized that vasoactive products released by leukocytes might produce constriction of atherosclerotic arteries. To test this hypothesis, we infused fmet-leu-phe (fMLP), a peptide that activates leukocytes to release their vasoactive products, into the perfused hind limb of normal and atherosclerotic cynomolgus monkeys. Infusion of fMLP did not change resistance of <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> in normal monkeys. In contrast, fMLP produced pronounced constriction of <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> in atherosclerotic monkeys. To determine whether leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, or prostaglandin E ^ (PGEJ, which are released by leukocytes, may contribute to leukocyte-induced vasoconstriction in atherosclerotic monkeys, we injected leukotriene D 4, platelet-activating factor, and PGE ^ intra-arterially into the perfused hind limb.

Resistance of the total limb and <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> was measured at constant flow. In normal monkeys, collagen produced a decrease in total limb resistance, with a modest constrictor response of the <b>large</b> <b>arteries.</b> In atherosclerotic monkeys, collagen produced a transient, small decrease in total limb resistance, with pronounced constriction of <b>large</b> <b>arteries.</b> Indomethacin (5 mg/kg i. v.) and the thromboxane Aj/prostaglan-din H 2 receptor antagonist SQ 29, 548 (2 mg/kg i. v.) virtually abolished the large-artery constrictor response to collagen in atherosclerotic monkeys.

In WKY rats, 2. 5 % of the arterial smooth muscle nuclei in elastic, muscular and resistance arteries incorporated BrdUrd. In SHR, DNA synthesis was more marked in <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> than in resistance arteries.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{vascular}} rarefaction (the loss of small arteries) on {{the circulation of}} blood are studied using a multiscale mathematical model that can predict blood flow and pressure in the systemic and pulmonary arteries. We augmented a model originally developed for the systemic arteries (Olufsen et al. 1998, 1999, 2000, 2004) to (a) predict flow and pressure in the pulmonary arteries, and (b) predict pressure propagation along the small arteries in the vascular beds. The systemic and pulmonary arteries are modelled as separate, bifurcating trees of compliant and tapering vessels. Each tree {{is divided into two}} parts representing the ‘large’ and ‘small’ arteries. Blood flow and pressure in the <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> are predicted using a nonlinear cross-sectional area-averaged model for a Newtonian fluid in an elastic tube with inflow obtained from magnetic resonance measurements. Each terminal vessel within the network of the <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> is coupled to a vascular bed of small ‘resistance’ arteries, which are modelled as asymmetric structured trees with specified area and asymmetry ratios between the parent and daughter arteries. For the systemic circulation, each structured tree represents a specific vascular bed corresponding to major organs and limbs. For the pulmonary circulation, there are four vascular beds supplied by the interlobar arteries. This manuscript presents the first theoretical calculations of the propagation of the pressure and flow waves along systemic and pulmonary <b>large</b> and small <b>arteries.</b> Results for all networks were in agreement with published observations. Two studies were done with this model. First, we showed how rarefaction can be modelled by pruning the tree of arteries in the microvascular system.

40|$|Noradrenaline induces a meagre {{vasoconstriction}} {{in small}} muscular pulmonary <b>arteries</b> compared to <b>large</b> conduit pulmonary <b>arteries.</b> We have examined whether {{this may be}} partially related to differences in the β-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation component and, in particular, β-adrenoceptor-mediated NO release. Noradrenaline induced a bell-shaped concentration-response in large (1202 ± 27 [*]μm) and small (334 ± 12 [*]μm) pulmonary arteries of the rat. In <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> tension increased to 95. 6 ± 1. 8 % of 75 [*]mM KCl (KPSS; n= 8) at 2 [*]μM, above which tension declined. The response in small arteries was meagre (12 ± 1. 5 % KPSS, n= 9), peaking at 0. 2 [*]μM. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 100 [*]μM) abolished the decline in tension induced by higher concentrations of noradrenaline in <b>large</b> <b>arteries,</b> and increased maximum tension (117 ± 3. 5 % KPSS, n= 5, P< 0. 05). In small arteries peak tension doubled (22. 0 ± 3. 4 % KPSS, n= 6, P< 0. 01), but still declined above 0. 2 [*]μM. Propranolol (1 [*]μM) abolished the decline in tension at higher concentrations of noradrenaline in both groups, but increased tension substantially more in small (37. 4 ± 3. 7 % KPSS, n= 5, P< 0. 001) than in <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> (112. 2 ± 3. 7 % KPSS, n= 9, P< 0. 05). In the presence of L-NMMA, propranolol had no additional effect on <b>large</b> <b>arteries,</b> whereas in small arteries there was greater potentiation than for either agent alone (67. 8 ± 5. 9 % KPSS, n= 4). β-Adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was examined in arteries constricted with prostaglandin F 2 α (50 [*]μM). In the presence of propranolol isoprenaline caused an unexpected vasoconstriction, which was abolished by phentolamine (10 [*]μM). In the presence of phentolamine, isoprenaline caused a maximum relaxation of 43. 3 ± 2. 1 % (n= 6) in large, and 49. 0 ± 4. 5 % (n= 6) in small arteries. L-NMMA substantially reduced relaxation in <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> (7. 4 ± 1. 5 %, n= 6, P< 0. 01), but was less effective in small arteries (26. 8 ± 5. 8, n= 5, P< 0. 05). Atenolol (β 1 -antagonist, 5 [*]μM) reduced relaxation to isoprenaline (large: 34. 8 ± 4. 5 %, n= 5; small: 35. 0 ± 1. 9 %,n= 6), but in combination with L-NMMA had no additional effect over L-NMMA alone. ICI 118551 (β 2 -antagonist, 0. 1 [*]μM) reduced isoprenaline-induced relaxation more than atenolol (large: 18. 0 ± 4. 6 %, n= 6, P< 0. 05; small: 25. 6 ± 10. 7 %, n= 6, P< 0. 05). ICI 118551 in combination with L-NMMA substantially reduced relaxation (large: 4. 8 ± 2. 6 %, n= 9; small: 6. 5 ± 3. 6 %, n= 5). Salbutamol-induced relaxation was reduced substantially by L-NMMA in <b>large</b> <b>arteries</b> (control: 34. 7 ± 6. 4 %, n= 6; +L-NMMA: 8. 3 ± 1. 3 %, n= 5, P< 0. 01), but {{to a lesser extent}} in small arteries (control: 50. 9 ± 7. 5 %, n= 6; +L-NMMA: 23. 0 ± 0. 7 %, n= 5, P< 0. 05).
