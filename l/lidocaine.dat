5|$|A pudendal nerve block, {{also known}} as a saddle nerve block, is a local {{anesthesia}} technique used in a obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor. In this procedure, an anesthetic agent such as <b>lidocaine</b> is injected through the inner wall of the vagina about the pudendal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{medication}} such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) {{helps in}} the management of pain associated with strep throat. Viscous <b>lidocaine</b> may also be useful. While steroids may help with the pain, they are not routinely recommended. Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical <b>lidocaine</b> {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, epinephrine, <b>lidocaine</b> and vasopressin.|$|E
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as <b>lidocaine</b> and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
25|$|Relative {{insensitivity}} to <b>lidocaine</b> is genetic. In hypokalemic sensory overstimulation, relative insensitivity to <b>lidocaine</b> {{has been}} described in people who also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In dental anaesthesia, a relative insensitivity to <b>lidocaine</b> can occur for anatomical reasons due to unexpected positions of nerves. Some people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are insensitive to <b>lidocaine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} <b>lidocaine</b> {{as a local}} anaesthetic {{is characterized by a}} rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, <b>lidocaine</b> is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; <b>lidocaine,</b> though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of <b>lidocaine,</b> almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of <b>lidocaine</b> makes local numbing less painful. <b>Lidocaine</b> drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
25|$|In {{some forms}} of neuropathy, {{especially}} post-herpetic neuralgia, the topical application of local anesthetics such as <b>lidocaine</b> is reported to provide relief. A transdermal patch containing <b>lidocaine</b> is available commercially in some countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{elimination}} half-life of <b>lidocaine</b> is biphasic {{and around}} 90min to 120min in most patients. This may be prolonged {{in patients with}} hepatic impairment (average 343min) or congestive heart failure (average 136min). <b>Lidocaine</b> is excreted in the urine (90% as metabolites and 10% as unchanged drug).|$|E
25|$|Viscous <b>lidocaine</b> {{relieves}} pain by numbing the mucus membranes.|$|E
25|$|For gastritis, {{drinking}} viscous <b>lidocaine</b> {{may help}} with the pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine,</b> {{also known}} as {{xylocaine}} and lignocaine, is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area. It {{is also used to}} treat ventricular tachycardia and to perform nerve blocks. <b>Lidocaine</b> mixed {{with a small amount of}} adrenaline (epinephrine) is available to allow larger doses for numbing, to decrease bleeding, and to make the numbing effect last longer. When used as an injectable, it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. <b>Lidocaine</b> mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area.|$|E
25|$|ADRs {{associated}} with the use of intravenous <b>lidocaine</b> are similar to toxic effects from systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (≥3mg/min). Common ADRs include: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or paraesthesia. Infrequent ADRs {{associated with}} the use of <b>lidocaine</b> include: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle twitching, seizures, coma, and/or respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine</b> and Novocaine {{belong to}} a class of local anesthetics which block sodium ion channels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine</b> is the INN and BAN while lignocaine is the AAN {{and former}} BAN.|$|E
25|$|There is {{tentative}} {{evidence for}} topical <b>lidocaine</b> for neuropathic pain and skin graft donor site pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine</b> viscous is not {{recommended}} by the FDA to treat teething pain in children and infants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine</b> is {{also the}} most {{important}} class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute myocardial infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or cardiac catheterization) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. <b>Lidocaine</b> should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventative dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{review on}} {{treatment}} for neonatal seizures recommended intravenous <b>lidocaine</b> {{as a second}} line treatment, if phenobarbital fails to stop seizures.|$|E
25|$|Impingement {{syndrome}} may {{be confirmed}} when injection {{of a small}} amount of anesthetic (<b>lidocaine</b> hydrochloride) into the space under the acromion relieves pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine,</b> {{along with}} ethanol, ammonia, and acetic acid, {{may also help}} in {{treating}} jellyfish stings, both numbing the affected area and preventing further nematocyst discharge.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, <b>lidocaine,</b> terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Overdoses with <b>lidocaine</b> can be {{a result}} of {{excessive}} administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children who are more susceptible to overdose, accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgical procedures. These occurrences have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults. <b>Lidocaine</b> and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. It is important in the interpretation of analytical results to recognize that <b>lidocaine</b> is often routinely administered intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parental feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more commonplace {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include <b>lidocaine,</b> {{mepivacaine}}, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), <b>lidocaine</b> and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include <b>lidocaine,</b> ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
25|$|When {{used as an}} {{injectable}} {{it typically}} begins working within four minutes and lasts {{for half an hour}} to three hours. <b>Lidocaine</b> is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half-life than <b>lidocaine,</b> but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker. The volume of distribution is 1.1L/kg to 2.1L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine,</b> {{the first}} amino amide–type local anaesthetic, was first {{synthesized}} {{under the name}} xylocaine by Swedish chemist Nils Löfgren in 1943. His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anaesthesia experiments on himself.|$|E
25|$|Porphyria, {{especially}} acute intermittent porphyria; <b>lidocaine</b> {{has been}} classified as porphyrogenic {{because of the}} hepatic enzymes it induces, although clinical evidence suggests it is not. Bupivacaine is a safe alternative in this case.|$|E
25|$|Favored {{treatments}} are certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressant and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), anticonvulsants (pregabalin and gabapentin), and topical <b>lidocaine.</b> Opioid analgesics {{are recognized as}} useful agents but are not recommended as first line treatments.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{treatment}} such as <b>lidocaine</b> patches {{can be used}} {{to treat}} pain locally. The chemical is released to the skin to act as a numbing agent that feels cool, then feels warm, much like IcyHot.|$|E
25|$|There is no cure. Treatments {{may include}} {{immunosuppressive}} medication such as corticosteroids and lifestyle changes. <b>Lidocaine</b> mouthwash may {{help with the}} pain. Colchicine may decrease the frequency of attacks. The condition often improves {{with the passage of}} time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine,</b> {{the first}} amino amide–type local anesthetic, was first {{synthesized}} {{under the name}} 'xylocaine' by Swedish chemist Nils Löfgren in 1943. His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anesthesia experiments on himself. It was first marketed in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Both propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are potent {{blockers}} {{of cardiac}} membrane sodium channels {{and are more}} potent than <b>lidocaine,</b> quinidine, and procainamide in this respect. As a result, propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene appear to have {{the characteristics of a}} Vaughn-Williams Class Ic antiarrhythmic.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} with {{intravenous}} use include sleepiness, muscle twitching, confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low {{blood pressure and}} an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine. <b>Lidocaine</b> is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. <b>Lidocaine</b> works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When used locally as a numbing agent, local neurons cannot signal the brain.|$|E
25|$|Impaired liver {{function}} - people with lowered hepatic function {{may have an}} adverse reaction with repeated administration of <b>lidocaine</b> because the drug is metabolized by the liver. Adverse reactions may include neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, nausea, muscle twitches, vomiting, or seizures).|$|E
25|$|<b>Lidocaine</b> {{has been}} used in cases that do not improve with other more typical medications. One concern is that {{seizures}} often begin again 30 minutes after it is stopped. Additionally, it is not recommended in those with heart or liver problems.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} {{safe to use}} <b>lidocaine</b> with vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers and toes. While concerns of tissue death if used in these areas have been raised evidence does not support these concerns.|$|E
