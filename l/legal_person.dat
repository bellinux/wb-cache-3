Based on theoretical and practical findings, this thesis aims to analyze whether the current state of law in the area of sanctioning of <b>legal</b> <b>persons</b> in the act on criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>persons</b> is perfect and fully sufficient, or whether it requires amending. The preface introduces the topic of sanctioning of criminal persons and the structure and the main goals of this thesis. Subsequently, the thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with theoretical issues. It covers different approaches to sanctioning of <b>legal</b> <b>persons</b> throughout Europe and key arguments both in favor and against the introduction of new regulation of sanctioning of <b>legal</b> <b>persons</b> in the Czech Republic.

25|$|There are {{differences}} between Islamic and Western legal systems. For example, sharia classically recognizes only natural persons, and never developed {{the concept of}} a <b>legal</b> <b>person,</b> or corporation, i.e., a legal entity that limits the liabilities of its managers, shareholders, and employees; exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders; and that can own assets, sign contracts, and appear in court through representatives. Interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting.

25|$|Corporations {{are created}} as legal persons {{by the laws}} and {{regulations}} of a particular jurisdiction.

This allows the entity to hold property {{in its own right}} without reference to any particular real person. It also results in the perpetual existence that characterizes the modern corporation. The statutory granting of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation (which is the general case) or from a statute to create a specific corporation, which was the only method prior to the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is mainly based on geographical division. Every member belongs to the parish of their domicile, with parish boundaries following municipal boundaries. Large cities, on the other hand, are usually divided into several parishes, with the geographical location of the members' homes determining parish membership. The membership of a parish varies from a few hundred in small municipalities to around 60,000 members in the parish of Malmi, Helsinki. According to the Church Act, the parish is responsible for all the practical work performed by the church. The parish is headed by the vicar and the parish council. Both are elected by the members, using equal, closed voting. The term of the parish council is four years while the vicar is elected for life or until he reaches sixty-eight years of age. A parish is a <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> of public nature, capable of taxing its members. The amount of tax collected is decided by the parish council and falls between 1 and 2.25 percent of personal income. In practice, the tax is collected by the state, for a fee.|$|E
25|$|Corporate insolvencies {{happen because}} {{companies}} become excessively indebted. Under UK law, {{a company is}} a separate <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> {{from the people who}} have invested money and labour into it, and it mediates a series of interest groups. Invariably the shareholders, directors and employees' liability is limited to the amount of their investment, so against commercial creditors they can lose no more than the money they paid for shares, or their jobs. Insolvencies become intrinsically possible whenever a relationship of credit and debt is created, as frequently happens through contracts or other obligations. In the section of an economy where competitive markets operate, wherever excesses are possible, insolvencies are likely to happen. The meaning of insolvency is simply an inability to repay debts, although the law isolates two main further meanings. First, for a court to order a company be wound up (and its assets sold off) or for an administrator to be appointed (to try to turn the business around), or for avoiding various transactions, the cash flow test is usually applied: a company must be unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Second, for the purpose of suing directors to compensate creditors, or for directors to be disqualified, a company must be shown to have fewer overall assets than liabilities on its balance sheet. If debts cannot be paid back to everybody in full, creditors necessarily stand in competition with one another for a share of the remaining assets. For this reason, a statutory system of priorities fixes the order among different kinds of creditor for payment.|$|E
500|$|At {{the most}} basic level, a king's power rested on the {{existence}} of his bodyguard or war-band. In the British language, this was called the teulu, as in teulu Dewr (the [...] "War-band of Deira"). In Latin the word is either comitatus or tutores, or even familia; tutores is the most common word in this period, and derives for the Latin verb tueor, meaning [...] "defend, preserve from danger". The war-band functioned {{as an extension of the}} ruler's <b>legal</b> <b>person,</b> and was the core of the larger armies that were mobilised from time to time for campaigns of significant size. In peace-time, the war-band's activity was centred on the [...] "Great Hall". Here, in both Germanic and Celtic cultures, the feasting, drinking and other forms of male bonding that kept up the war-band's integrity would take place. In the epic poem Beowulf, the war-band was said to sleep in the Great Hall after the lord had retired to his adjacent bedchamber. It is not likely that any war-band in the period exceeded 120–150 men, as no hall structure having a capacity larger than this has been found by archaeologists in northern Britain. Pictish stones, like that at Aberlemno in Angus, show mounted and foot warriors with swords, spears, bows, helmets and shields. The large number of hill forts in Scotland may have made open battle less important than in Anglo-Saxon England and the relatively high proportion of kings who are recorded as dying in fires or drowning suggest that sieges were a more important part of warfare in Northern Britain.|$|E

This is the kind of slavery that existed under Roman law and in the antebellum Southern United States. [...] The Christian church very early treated slaves as persons, and they were allowed to be baptised, marry, and also be ordained. [...] This tended to be reflected in slavery laws of Catholic countries, so that French slaves, for example, were allowed to marry slaves or free people, though neither baptism nor marrying a free person emancipated them - an issue in the leading French legal case of Jean Boucaux (1737).|$|E

The rights are enforceable by the courts through section 24 of the Charter, which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied. This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the Charter and might damage the reputation of the justice system. Section 32 confirms that the Charter is binding on the federal government, the territories under its authority, and the provincial governments.|$|E

2500|$|The {{period after}} World War II saw {{moderate}} growth in dacha development. Since {{there was no}} actual law banning the construction of dachas, people began occupying unused plots of land near cities and towns, growing gardens and building sheds, huts, and more prominent dwellings that served as dachas. As time passed, the number of squatters grew geometrically and the government {{had no choice but}} to officially recognise their right to amateur farming. The 1955 legislation introduced a new type of <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> into the Soviet juridical system, a gardeners' partnership ( [...] , sadovodcheskoye tovarishchestvo), similar to community gardens in other countries. The gardeners' partnership received the right to permanent use of land exclusively for agricultural purposes and permission to connect to public electrical and water supply networks. In 1958, yet another form of organisation was introduced, a cooperative for dacha construction ( [...] , dachno-stroytelniy kooperativ), which recognised the right of an individual to build a small house on the land leased from the government.|$|E
2500|$|In many European nations, the European Convention on Human Rights {{provides}} {{protection from}} an appropriation {{of private property}} by the state.

This right is expanded by Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention, which states that [...] "Every natural person or <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions." [...] Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or public interest, is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of taxes.
