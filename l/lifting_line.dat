60|$|When he {{had been}} down for some time, Jimmy, turning the pump in {{obedience}} to the plucking of the signal line, began to wonder when he would come up. Bethune seemed particular about his air supply, and Jimmy surmised that he found it needful to move the case along the bottom to get a clear lead for the <b>lifting</b> <b>line</b> because the Cetacea had altered her position. Moran {{put his hand on}} the crank when required, but at other times he stood motionless, watching the ice with an imperturbable brown face. Indeed, Jimmy, as a relief from the tension, began to speculate about his comrade and wonder what he thought. Though they had toiled hard and faced many perils together with mutual respect and confidence, he felt that he knew very little about the man. Moran’s reserve and stolid serenity were baffling. When strenuous action was required he could be relied upon, but even then he was seldom hurried, and his movements somehow suggested that his splendid frame was endowed with unreasoning, automatic powers. For all that, Jimmy knew that such a conception of his friend was wrong. He had seen the cool judgment and indomitable courage that controlled the man’s strength in time of heavy stress.|$|E

5000|$|... i) <b>Lifting</b> <b>line</b> {{theory for}} wings, wing tip {{vortices}} and induced drag. A wing has a finite span, and the circulation at any {{section of the}} wing varies with the spanwise direction. This variation is compensated by the release of streamwise vortices (called trailing vortices), due to conservation of vorticity or Kelvin Theorem of Circulation Conservation. These streamwise vortices merge to two counter-rotating strong spirals, called wing tip vortices, separated by distance close to the wing span and may be visible if the sky is cloudy. Treating the trailing vortices {{as a series of}} semi-infinite straight line vortices leads to the well-known <b>lifting</b> <b>line</b> theory. By this theory, the wing has a lift force smaller than that predicted by a purely two-dimensional theory using the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. Most importantly, there is an induced drag. This induced drag is a pressure drag which {{has nothing to do with}} frictional drag.|$|E

5000|$|Instead of {{only one}} {{horseshoe}} vortex per wing, as in the <b>lifting</b> <b>line</b> theory, the VLM utilizes a lattice of horseshoe vortices, as described by Falkner in his first paper on this subject in 1943. The number of vortices used vary with the required pressure distribution resolution, and with required accuracy in the computed aerodynamic coefficients. A typical number of vortices would be around 100 for an entire aircraft wing; an Aeronautical Research Council report by Falkner published in 1949 mentions {{the use of an}} [...] "84-vortex lattice before the standardisation of the 126-lattice" [...] (p. 4).|$|E

50|$|Adolf Busemann {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the swept wing and presented this 1935 at the 5. Volta-Congress in Rome. Sweep theory in general was a subject of development and investigation throughout the 1930s and 1940s, but the breakthrough mathematical definition of sweep theory is generally credited to NACA's Robert T. Jones in 1945. Sweep theory builds on other wing lift theories. <b>Lifting</b> <b>line</b> theory describes lift generated by a straight wing (a wing in which the leading edge is perpendicular to the airflow). Weissinger theory describes the distribution of lift for a swept wing, but does not have the capability to include chordwise pressure distribution. There are other methods that do describe chordwise distributions, but they have other limitations. Jones' sweep theory provides a simple, comprehensive analysis of swept wing performance.|$|E
50|$|Free vortex models (FVM) and Lagrangian {{particle}} vortex methods (LPVM) {{are both}} active {{areas of research}} that seek to increase modelling accuracy by accounting {{for more of the}} three-dimensional and unsteady flow effects than either BEM or RANS. FVM is similar to <b>lifting</b> <b>line</b> theory in that it assumes that the wind turbine rotor is shedding either a continuous vortex filament from the blade tips (and often the root), or a continuous vortex sheet from the blades' trailing edges. LPVM can use a variety of methods to introduce vorticity into the wake. Biot-Savart summation is used to determine the induced flow field of these wake vorticies' circulations, allowing for better approximations of the local flow over the rotor blades. These methods have largely confirmed much of the applicability of BEM and shed insight into the structure of wind turbine wakes. FVM has limitations due to its origin in potential flow theory, such as not explicitly modelling model viscous behavior (without semi-empirical core models), though LPVM is a fully viscous method. LPVM is more computationally intensive than either FVM or RANS, and FVM still relies on blade element theory for the blade forces.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lifting</b> <b>line</b> vortex {{models have}} been widely used to predict flow fields around wind turbine rotors. Such models are known to be {{deficient}} in modelling flow fields close to the blades due to the assumption that blade vorticity is concentrated on a line and consequently the influences of blade geometry are not well captured. The present study thoroughly assessed the errors arising from this approximation by prescribing the bound circulation as a boundary condition on the flow using a <b>lifting</b> <b>line</b> free-wake vortex approach. The bound circulation prescribed to free- wake vortex model was calculated from two independent sources using (1) experi- mental results from SPIV and (2) data generated from a 3 D panel free-wake vortex approach, where the blade geometry is fully modelled. The axial and tangential flow fields around the blades from the <b>lifting</b> <b>line</b> vortex model were then compared with those directly produced by SPIV and the 3 D panel model. The comparison was carried out for different radial locations across the blade span. The study revealed the cumulative probability error distributions in <b>lifting</b> <b>line</b> model estima- tions for the local aerofoil flow field under both 3 D rotating and 2 D non-rotating conditions. It was found that the errors in a 3 D rotating environment are consider- ably larger than those for a wing of infinite span in 2 D flow.

40|$|The {{unsteady}} {{evolution of}} trailing vortex sheets {{in ground effect}} is simulated {{by the use of}} a discrete vortex method. The ground effect is included by image method. Two cases of unsteady vortex evolution behind lifting lines (an elliptic loading and a fuselage/flap-wing configuration) are simulated for several ground heights. The present method is validated by comparison of the simulated wake roll-up shapes to published numerical results. For a <b>lifting</b> <b>line</b> with an elliptic loading, the ground has the effect of moving the wingtip vortices laterally outward and suppressing the development of the vortex. An increase in the wing loading has the effect of moving the wingtip vortex more laterally outward. The rotation of the wake vortices behind a fuselage/part-span flap configuration in ground effect is less than the case of flight out of the ground effect.
