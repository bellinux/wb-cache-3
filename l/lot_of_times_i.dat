40|$|Abstract This {{study will}} look at the gipsy’s people’s {{thoughts}} about their experience in the Swedish school. I have experience about the gipsy people from my home country Yugoslavia. In most cases, the gipsy people had a hard time and problems {{to be a part of}} the society, for example to get a job or finish the elementary school. I’m now living In Sweden and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> have wonder about gipsy’s situation in our country. Questions like, what is there experience about the Swedish school system? Is there a different if you compare the situation with former days? Is there a different between boys and girls? This is also questions that are in focus in this study. After the literature study, where I collected information about gypsies and their situation in Sweden, I did some interviews over telephone. The questions were about their experience about their situation during their time in school. During the study I have met people who were positive when I asked them about their situation. Other people were worried about my questions and some of them didn’t attend in the study. Maybe this can sees as a natural reaction when this ethnics group had a problematic time in the Swedish history, but maybe why many people today don’t trust people who are working in school or other part of the public sector. The result of this study is that changes have been positive for the gipsy people. Now days don’t feel that school is a place for alienation and discrimination. One successful reason is that the contact between the school and home is much better. The study has also looked at how the school working with questions about gender. The result is that there never has been a different in the way how personal working with girls and boys in school. In spite of everything there is a lot more work to do in the Swedish school. This is a work that is covering personal, parents but also students. One thing who is missing now days is more teachers who can educate children and youth in the gipsy language. It’s also a problem that there are few antitypes in school, not only for the gipsyes as an ethnics group, but also for other minority groups...|$|E
