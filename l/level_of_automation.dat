40|$|An {{understanding}} of the complexity factors that affect controller workload under higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> for conflict detection and resolution and under higher traffic densities is critical for future operations. This paper examines traffic complexity variables under higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> where the human controller {{is still in the}} loop, but is being supported by advanced conflict detection and resolution automation. The study involved two conflict resolution automation modes (i. e., trial-planning automation and advisory automation) and three traffic densities (i. e., 1 X, 2 X and 3 X). The results indicate that under the 1 X traffic condition, controller workload was the lowest with advanced <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation.</b> The complexity and workload increased progressively for the 2 X and 3 X traffic conditions. Results also showed that several variables such as horizontal proximity, aircraft density, separation criticality index, and two degrees of freedom indices appear to be relevant complexity measures for higher traffic densities. The degrees of freedom index for aircraft in conflict appears to be a relevant measure for higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation.</b> Regression results show that automation resolution mode, number of aircraft, number of conflicts, separation criticality index, and degrees of freedom for aircraft in conflict represent complexity an...|$|R

40|$|Sheridan’s “Levels <b>of</b> <b>Automation</b> ” were {{explored}} {{in an experiment}} on fault management of a continuous process control task which included situation adaptive <b>automation.</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> with more or less automation autonomy, and different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> advice to the operator were compared, with automatic diagnosis whose reliability varied. The efficiency of process control and of fault management {{were explored}} under human control and automation in fault management, and aspects of the task in which human or automation were the more efficient defined. The results are related to earlier work on trust and self confidence in allocation of function by Lee, Moray, and Muir. ILntroduction Despite the interest in supervisory control since the concept was introduced by Sheridan, there has been rather little experimental research on how to optimize the relation between human and automation until the i-ecent series of symposia organized by Parasuraman and others. In particular, {{there has been little}} research on different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation,</b> despite the existence of the hierarchy defined by Sheridan many years ago. This study examines the effect <b>of</b> different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> as defined by Sheridan (Sheridan and Verplank, 1978; Sheridan, 1987). Inagaki and his co-workers have proved theoretically that under certain conditions it is mandatory for automation to over-ride human operators if safety is to be achieved during fault management, (Inagaki, 1993, 1995), but {{little is known about the}} relative merits <b>of</b> different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> in the sense of Sheridan. This study presents experimental results in which <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> and modes <b>of</b> control were manipulated, so that allocation of function could be dynamically chosen by operators and automation during a process control task. We explore the relative virtues of the two kinds of agents as a function of different kinds of faults, and using a variety of measures of performance and subjective rating of relations between humans and automation...|$|R

40|$|Companies {{operating}} in the wood processing industry need to increase their productivity by implementing automation technologies in their production systems. An increasing global competition and rising raw material prizes challenge their competitiveness. Yet, too extensive automation brings risks such as a deterioration in situation awareness and operator deskilling. The concept <b>of</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automation</b> is generally seen as means to achieve a balanced task allocation between the operators’ skills and competences {{and the need for}} automation technology relieving the humans from repetitive or hazardous work activities. The aim of this thesis was to examine to what extent existing methods for assessing <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automation</b> in production processes are applicable in the wood processing industry when focusing on an improved competitiveness of production systems. This was done by answering the following research questions (RQ) : RQ 1 : What method is most appropriate to be applied with measuring <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automation</b> in the wood processing industry? RQ 2 : How can the measurement <b>of</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automation</b> contribute to an improved competitiveness of the wood processing industry’s production processes? Literature reviews were used to identify the main characteristics of the wood processing industry affecting its automation potential and appropriate assessment methods for <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automation</b> in order to answer RQ 1. When selecting the most suitable method, factors like the relevance to the target industry, application complexity or operational level the method is penetrating were important. The DYNAMO++ method, which covers both a rather quantitative technical-physical and a more qualitative social-cognitive dimension, was seen as most appropriate when taking into account these factors. To answer RQ 2, a case study was undertaken at a major Swedish manufacturer of interior wood products to point out paths how the measurement <b>of</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automation</b> contributes to an improved competitiveness of the wood processing industry. The focus was on the task level on shop floor and concrete improvement suggestions were elaborated after applying the measurement method for <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automation.</b> Main aspects considered for generalization were enhancements regarding ergonomics in process design and cognitive support tools for shop-floor personnel through task standardization. Furthermore, difficulties regarding the <b>automation</b> <b>of</b> grading and sorting processes due to the heterogeneous material properties of wood argue for a suitable arrangement of human intervention options in terms of work task allocation.   The application of a modified version of DYNAMO++ reveals its pros and cons during a case study which covers a high operator involvement in the improvement process and the distinct predisposition of DYNAMO++ to be applied in an assembly system...|$|R

40|$|The Air Traffic Management (ATM) {{system and}} its {{operators}} are under increasing pressure to improve the efficiency of their operation. One solution involves increasing the utilization <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> within the ATM system. The success {{of this approach is}} reliant on Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCO) willingness to accept increased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> in their role. The primary aim of the research described in this thesis is to examine the drivers that underlie the ATCOs willingness to accept or refuse high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> in their professional role, and to investigate where, on a continuum from no automation to full automation, resistance can be anticipated ( the tipping point). The first of three experiments reveals that the traditional predictors <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> acceptance such as trust and job satisfaction explain between 4 and 7 % of ATCOs willingness to accept automation in their role. The results also reveal a threshold in users acceptances <b>of</b> <b>automation,</b> this being at a point where the decision-making was removed from the ATCO. Experiment 2 surveyed 20 professional ATCOs in an attempt to identify what other factors could account for their willingness to accept high(er) <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> in their role. The results reveal that user-friendliness, functionality, and quality <b>of</b> the <b>automation</b> are important predictors of user acceptance. Experiment 3 tests these new constructs with a sample of non-ATCOs under various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation,</b> in order to assess their predictive validity as well as the robustness of the tipping point. The results reveal that the three new constructs help very little in terms of predictive significance with this sample. In addition, the results reveal the stability of the tipping point to be at the same level as was detected with the ATCO sample...|$|R

40|$|Various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> can be {{introduced}} by intelligent decision support systems, from fully automated, where the operator is completely {{left out of}} the decision process, to minimal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation,</b> where the automation only makes recommendations and the operator has the final say. For rigid tasks that require no flexibility in decision-making and with a low probability of system failure, higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> often provide the best solution. However, in time critical environments with many external and changing constraints such as air traffic control and military command and control operations, higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> are not advisable because of the risks and the complexity of both the system and the inability of the automated decision aid to be perfectly reliable. Human-inthe-loop designs, which employ automation for redundant, manual, and monotonous tasks and allow operators active participation, provide not only safety benefits, but also allow a human operator and a system to respond more flexibly to uncertain and unexpected events. However, there can be measurable costs to human performance when automation is used, such as loss of situational awareness, complacency, skill degradation, and automation bias. This paper will discuss the influence <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> bias in intelligent decision support systems, particularly those in aviation domains. Automation bias occurs in decision-making because humans have a tendency to disregard or not search for contradictory information in light of a computer-generated solution that is accepted as correct and can be exacerbated in time critical domains. Automated decision aids are designed to reduce human error but actually can cause new errors in the operation of a system if not designed with human cognitive limitations in mind. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{the global}} {{environment}} where industrial enterprises strive for competitiveness, the ability to adjust quickly to changing conditions is important. This global industrial context challenges the companies to develop new capabilities. Capacity flexibility is an important measure of competitiveness and one important capability for improving productivity and effectiveness. Available resources contribute to capacity (output) and influence capacity flexibility. Thus, the way resources are managed is important. One way to manage resources within the manufacturing system is to choose resources that are the most suitable for the task performed by adopting task allocation. Task allocation between human and technology therefore becomes central for design of workplaces with optimal performance. This becomes the challenge <b>of</b> <b>automation.</b> However, {{to make the right}} decisions on automation and the skills required for the handling of tools and technology is a complex process of decision making for managers. In the light of this, the objective of this thesis is to develop a methodology for analysing and choosing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> with the purpose to formulate automation strategy in manufacturing systems. The analysis is based on measurement <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> and alignment between <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> and the business and manufacturing strategies. The application area of the research is the manufacturing industry and in particular assembly lines or cells because of the mixture of human and technological resources. As indicated by the objective, the outcome of this thesis is a structured methodology that analyses possible alternatives <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> weighted against competitive priorities. The methodology consists of five stages: (1) preparation, (2) business and manufacturing strategy, (3) estimation <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> for critical subtasks, (4) analysis <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation,</b> and (5) completion. The methodology supports visibility of results. Depending on where the company has its greatest improvement potential, different starting points in the methodology can be applied. Validation of the methodology indicates that usefulness, use, and satisfaction with the methodology can be seen as good. The issue of considering both humans and technology is critical for the success of the system, as it builds the resources of the manufacturing function. Overcoming barriers in measuring LoA and in aligning resources with market needs is crucial for developing long term automation strategies. Certain criteria of the manufacturing system influence the choice of LoA. Those criteria are production volume and specific product characteristics. Proposed improvements for formulating manufacturing strategy involve a focus on communication and knowledge sharing, introducing measures for learning and knowledge, enhancing interactions between inside and outside partners, and closing knowledge gaps. Those improvements should be seen primarily as research opportunities in the area of manufacturing strategy processes...|$|R
