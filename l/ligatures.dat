5|$|Barthel (1971) {{claimed to}} have parsed the corpus of glyphs to 120, of which the other 480 in his {{inventory}} are allographs or <b>ligatures.</b> The evidence was never published, but similar counts have been obtained by other scholars, such as Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov (2007).|$|E

5|$|A major {{professional}} competitor to Bembo is Agmena, {{created by}} Jovica Veljović and released by Linotype in 2014.

5|$|Mouthpieces are {{generally}} made of hard rubber, although some inexpensive mouthpieces {{may be made}} of plastic. Other materials such as crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used. <b>Ligatures</b> are often made of metal and plated in nickel, silver, or gold. Other materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.|$|E
5|$|Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is {{also often}} highly stylized. Writers readily formed <b>ligatures</b> and {{abbreviations}} for nomina sacra, including diacritics called karagma, which resemble titla. Because writing {{materials such as}} vellum were scarce and therefore precious, abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the 11th century.|$|E
30|$|In the {{reported}} dyadic deaths, {{the pattern of}} postmortem lividity, {{as well as the}} appearance of <b>ligature</b> mark distinctly, varied between the deceased males and female. The post mortem lividity was distributed in ‘glove and stocking’ pattern over the extremities and was fixed in the female victim while the lividity on the male body was present {{over the back of the}} body and was not fixed. Though the <b>ligature</b> materials used in both the cases were cotton cloth material, the appearance of <b>ligature</b> mark around the neck was significantly different too. The appearance of <b>ligature</b> mark around the neck is influenced by many factors including the type of <b>ligature</b> material, weight of the body, duration of suspension, etc. Distinct grooved <b>ligature</b> mark in the female was suggestive of prolonged suspension while an inconspicuous and faint <b>ligature</b> mark in male indicated the contrary. It is highly likely that the knot of the <b>ligature</b> noose in the male victim loosened and opened up after some time of the suspension due to the weight of the body, as suggested by the relative position of the male victim on the floor and the cloth material freely hanging from the roof above it. The effects of body weight on <b>ligature</b> material and suspension can be deceptive (Kanchan et al. 2010).|$|R
5000|$|The qp <b>ligature,</b> ȹ, is a typographic <b>ligature</b> of Latin q and p (also interpretable as a <b>ligature</b> of c and p), {{and is used}} in some phonetic {{transcription}} systems, {{particularly for}} African languages, to represent a voiceless labiodental plosive , for example in the Zulu sequence [...]|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} several {{published}} versions of the alphabet. Most versions (including the versions used in The Deseret First Book, The Deseret Second Book, The Deseret News and The Book of Mormon) had only 38 letters, but some versions contained two <b>ligatures,</b> 𐐧 (ew) and 𐐦 (oi). In place of 𐐮𐐭 or 𐐷𐐭, 𐑏 was to be used; in place of 𐐱𐐮, 𐑎.|$|E
5|$|Textual {{critics and}} palaeographers like Johann Jakob Wettstein, Constantin von Tischendorf, Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener and Caspar René Gregory dated the {{manuscript}} to the 10th century. Henri Omont and Kirsopp Lake dated {{it to the}} 12th century, and Dean Burgon to the 12th or 13th century. It is dated by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research to the 12th century because the frequent occurrence of enlarged letters, rounded breathing marks, flourishes and <b>ligatures</b> seem to eliminate earlier dates.|$|E
5|$|The nomina sacra (or sacred names) {{are written}} in an {{abbreviated}} way: ΘΣ for θεος, ΙΣ for Ιησους, ΧΣ for χριστος, ΚΣ for κυριος, ΥΣ for υιος, ΣΗΡ for σωτηρ, ΣΡΑ for σωτηρια, ΣΡΙΟΣ for σωτηριος, ΟΥΝΟΣ for ουρανος, ΟΥΝΙΟΣ for ουρανιος, ΠΝΑ for πνευμα, ΠΗΡ for πατηρ, ΜΗΡ for μητηρ, ΑΝΟΣ for ανθρωπος, ΣΤΡΣ for σταυρος, ΔΑΔ for δαβιδ, ΙΗΛ for ισραηλ, ΙΛΗΜ for ιερουσαλημ, etc. The words {{at the end of}} lines are sometimes abbreviated too.

2500|$|In Welsh dictionaries, LL {{is treated}} as a {{separate}} letter from L (e.g. lwc sorts before llaw).

5|$|The {{work was}} written in scriptio {{continua}} with neither breathings nor polytonic accents. Occasional points and a few <b>ligatures</b> are used, though nomina sacra with overlines are employed throughout. Some words usually abbreviated in other manuscripts (such as πατηρ and δαυειδ), are in this codex written in both full and abbreviated forms. The following nomina sacra are written in abbreviated forms: ΘΣ ΚΣ ΙΣ ΧΣ ΠΝΑ ΠΝΙΚΟΣ ΥΣ ΑΝΟΣ ΟΥΟΣ ΔΑΔ ΙΛΗΜ ΙΣΡΛ ΜΗΡ ΠΗΡ ΣΩΡ.|$|E
5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using <b>ligatures,</b> applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as <b>ligatures,</b> small caps and italic swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} <b>ligature</b> is the {{ampersand}} &. This was originally a <b>ligature</b> of E and t, forming the Latin word [...] "et", meaning [...] "and". It has {{exactly the same}} use in French and in English. The ampersand comes in many different forms. Because of its ubiquity, it is generally no longer considered a <b>ligature,</b> but a logogram.|$|R
50|$|The {{code value}} A2 {{is used to}} encode the Armenian <b>ligature</b> ew (և). In some {{variants}} it encodes the section sign (§) instead. Some Armenian fonts display this <b>ligature</b> at {{the position of the}} ASCII ampersand symbol, but it is strongly suggested to encode the <b>ligature</b> using the two standard Armenian small letters that compose it.|$|R
50|$|The a-e <b>ligature</b> ash (Æ æ) {{was adopted}} as {{a letter in}} its own right, named after a futhorc rune æsc. In very early Old English the o-e <b>ligature</b> ethel (Œ œ) also {{appeared}} as a distinct letter, likewise named after a rune, œðel. Additionally, the v-v or u-u <b>ligature</b> double-u (W w) was in use.|$|R
5|$|These symbols {{describe}} {{the features of}} a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of {{the sounds of a}} language, as well as the rhythm and intonation of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various <b>ligatures</b> of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi fonts, commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very different to his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and <b>ligatures</b> to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for every word. Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs that are either a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his slanted Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is clearly not the work of a beginner. Earlier fonts that may have been cut by Garamond have been suggested but the attribution is less certain.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to <b>ligatures</b> and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E
50|$|To {{perform a}} {{suspension}} hanging, a rope or other <b>ligature</b> is tied into a noose which {{goes around the}} neck, a knot (often a running knot, which tightens easily) is formed, and {{the other end of}} the rope is tied to a <b>ligature</b> point; the body is then suspended, which tightens the <b>ligature</b> around the neck.|$|R
2500|$|There was thus, {{in early}} printing, no direct {{contrast}} between an ſʒ and an ſs <b>ligature</b> in any single typeface: blackletter fonts designed for printing German {{would have an}} ſʒ but no ſs <b>ligature</b> (German [...] being rendered as ſſ), while Antiqua fonts intended for printing Latin or Italian would have an [...] ſs but no ſʒ <b>ligature.</b> When German texts began to be printed in Antiqua (see Antiqua–Fraktur dispute), the Antiqua ſs (i.e. [...] ) <b>ligature</b> came {{to be used as}} an equivalent of the ſʒ (i.e. [...] ) <b>ligature</b> in blackletter fonts. Thus, the modern (Antiqua) German letter ß is in some fonts derived from ſs graphically although it represents the historical sz digraph continued from Middle High German and Early Modern High German orthography.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. 3 D space {{handwriting}} is a gesture-like character {{written in}} the air, {{and it is a}} promising input method for its portability. In this work, we propose a practical development of 3 D space handwriting recognition system by combining 2 D handwriting and the <b>ligature</b> of 3 D handwriting based on that the most different part between these handwritings is the shape of <b>ligature.</b> We designed a <b>ligature</b> model not to depend on each character shape but to depend only on incoming and outgoing vectors. Therefore with a few <b>ligature</b> models, various <b>ligature</b> shapes are modeled. By using 2 D space handwriting models and data, we can use existing models for various writing styles, and overcome the problem of the lack of data...|$|R
