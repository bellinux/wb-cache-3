The most likely candidates for these two waves are a beam-generated <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> and an oppositely propagating <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> produced by parametric decay. In the parametric decay process, nonlinear interactions cause the beam-driven <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> to decay into a <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> and a low-frequency ion sound wave.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that partial incoherence, {{in the form}} of {{stochastic}} phase noise, of a <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> in an unmagnetized plasma gives rise to a Landau-type damping. Starting from the Zakharov equations, which describe the nonlinear interaction between Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves, a kinetic equation is derived for the plasmons by introducing the Wigner-Moyal transform of the complex <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> field. This equation is then used to analyze the stability properties of small perturbations on a stationary solution consisting of a constant amplitude wave with stochastic phase noise. The concomitant dispersion relation exhibits the phenomenon of Landau-like damping. However, this damping differs from the classical Landau damping in which a <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave,</b> interacting with the plasma electrons, loses energy. In the present process, the damping is non-dissipative and is caused by the resonant interaction 1 between an instantaneously-produced disturbance, due to the parametric interactions, and a partially incoherent <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave,</b> which can be considered as a quasi-particle composed of an ensemble of partially incoherent plasmons.

40|$|The {{temporal}} evolution of Langmuir waves excited by high-power, high-frequency (HF) radio {{waves in the}} ionosphere is studied theoretically. This study is motivated by past observations made with the 450 MHz radar at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Two kinds of nonlinear damping to the parametric decay instability are considered in the derivation of the rate equation for the spectral intensity of enhanced Langmuir waves. They are <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> cascading caused by nonlinear Landau damping and cross-field electron diffusion. The first damping process leads to the saturation of individual unstable <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave.</b> The second process, which results from the incoherent scattering of electron orbits by the total excited Langmuir waves, yields anomalous damping that applies to each <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave.</b> Consequently, Langmuir waves with smaller growth rates will be suppressed by those with larger growth rates. Such a mode competition process may cause the overshoot of the HF-enhanced plasma line observed with the Arecibo 430 MHz radar.

For a nearly one-dimensional distribution, the degree of polarization and the frequency of observation should be related to the magnetic field.

40|$|Nonlinear {{interactions}} of tenuous electron beam, background, unmagnetized plasma, and self-consistently generated Langmuir and ion-sound waves are analyzed {{in the framework}} of plasma weak turbulence kinetic theory. Full numerical solutions of the complete weak turbulence equations are obtained for the first time, which show the familiar plateau formation in the electron beam distribution and concomitant quasi-saturation of primary Langmuir waves, followed by fully nonlinear processes which include three-wave decay and induced-scattering processes. A detailed analysis reveals that the scattering off ions is an important nonlinear process which leads to prominent backscattered and long-wavelength <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> components. However, it is found that the decay process is also important, and that the nonlinear development of weak Langmuir turbulence critically depends on the initial conditions. Special attention is paid to the electron-to-ion temperature ratio, Te /Ti, and the initial perturbation level. It is found that higher values of Te /Ti promote the generation of backscattered <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> component, and that a higher initial wave intensity suppresses the backscattered component while significantly enhancing the long-wavelength <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> component...|$|E

The Unified Radio and Plasma Wave (URAP) instrument of Ulysses has found that within such magnetic structures, electrostatic waves at kHz frequency and ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves are often excited and seen as short duration wave bursts. Most of these bursts occur near the ambient electron plasma frequency, {{which suggests that the}} <b>waves</b> are <b>Langmuir</b> <b>waves.</b> Such waves are usually excited by electron streams. Some evidence of the streaming of energetic electrons required for exciting <b>Langmuir</b> <b>waves</b> has been observed. These electrons may have originated at sources near the Sun, which would imply that the magnetic structures containing the waves would exist as long channels formed by field and plasma conditions near the Sun. On the other hand, the electrons could be suprathermal 'tails' from wave collapse processes occurring near the spacecraft. In either case, the <b>Langmuir</b> <b>waves</b> excited in the magnetic holes provide a measurement of the plasma density inside the holes.
