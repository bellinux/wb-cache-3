"Raining Blood", {{along with}} Reign in Bloods opening track [...] "Angel of Death", {{is an almost}} {{permanent}} addition to Slayer's live set-list, and was Hanneman and King's favorite track to play live. At {{the end of the}} Still Reigning DVD, there is a finale with the band covered in fake blood during the performance of [...] "Raining Blood". When asked which song holds best, both Slayer guitarists replied [...] "Raining Blood". Hanneman admitted that he [...] "still love playing that song live. You'd think we'd be tired of it – I mean, I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how many times we've played it live. That would be really interesting." [...] King said [...] "we could be playing in front of Alanis Morissette, and the crowd loves the part." ...|$|E
500|$|From the {{available}} fragments of music, both Virtanen and Andrew Mellor of Gramophone detect hints of Tapiola, {{particularly in the}} first of the three extracts. Kilpeläinen points to some of Sibelius's late minor works, in particular the [...] "Five Esquisses" [...] for piano Op. 114 (1929), as providing evidence that in his final compositional years Sibelius was [...] "progressing towards a more abstract idiom: clear, ethereal images little touched by the human passions". Further originality, Kilpeläinen says, is found in the [...] "Surusoitto" [...] music for organ, composed in 1931 for the funeral of Sibelius's friend Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a work that Aino Sibelius admitted might have been based on Eighth Symphony material: [...] "Did the new symphony", asks Kilpeläinen, [...] "thus also represent a modern sound unlike that of his previous style, with bleak, open tones and unresolved dissonances?" [...] After the recording of the fragments, Storgårds could recognise the composer's late style, adding that [...] "the harmonies are so wild and the music so exciting that I'd really <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how he went on with this." [...] Sibelius's only preserved comment on the music itself, as distinct from his occasional progress reports, is a remark to Schnéevoigt in December 1932: [...] "You have no idea how clever it is".|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russell’s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't let her in. Yet, she went back to find the door open and walked right in. Megan's intelligent enough to know that something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem like a bad idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E

A few days passed by and no lover came, but early on the Friday morning after the bazaar, Margaret, who at the moment was in her own room, was told that Sir John was below in the drawing-room with Mrs Mackenzie. He had already been there some little time, the servant said, and Mrs Mackenzie had sent up with her <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if Miss Mackenzie would come down. Would she go down?

60|$|Governing Persons, {{were they}} never so {{insignificant}} intrinsically, have for most part plenty of Memoir-writers; and the curious, in after-times, can learn minutely their goings out and comings in: which, as men always <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their fellow-men in singular situations, is a comfort, of its kind. Not so, with these Governing Persons, {{now in the}} Townhall! And yet what most original fellow-man, of the Governing sort, high-chancellor, king, kaiser, secretary of the home or the foreign department, ever shewed such a phasis as Clerk Tallien, Procureur Manuel, future Procureur Chaumette, here in this Sand-waltz of the Twenty-five millions, now do? O brother mortals,--thou Advocate Panis, friend of Danton, kinsman of Santerre; Engraver Sergent, since called Agate Sergent; thou Huguenin, with the tocsin in thy heart! But, as Horace says, they wanted the sacred memoir-writer (sacro vate); and we know them not. Men bragged of August and its doings, publishing them in high places; but of this September none now or afterwards would brag. The September world remains dark, fuliginous, as Lapland witch-midnight;--from which, indeed, very strange shapes will evolve themselves.|$|E

6000|$|Faint it grew, and fainter yet, and, as it disappeared, {{he thought}} of Angela, and a yearning sorrow fell upon him. When, he {{wondered}} sadly, should he again look into her eyes, and hold that proud beauty in his arms; what fate awaited {{them in the future}} that stretched before them, dim as the darkening ocean, and more uncertain. Alas! he could not tell, he only felt that it was very bitter to be parted thus from her to whom had been given his whole heart's <b>love,</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that every fleeting moment widened a breach already far too wide, and not to know if it would again be narrowed, or if this farewell would be the last. Then he thought, if it should be the last, if she should die or desert him, what would his life be worth to him? A consciousness within him answered, [...] "nothing." [...] And, in a degree, his conclusion was right; for, although it is, fortunately, not often in the power of any single passion to render life altogether worthless; it is certain that, when it strikes in youth, there is no sickness so sore as that of the heart; no sorrow more keen, and no evil more lasting than those connected with its disappointments and its griefs. For other sorrows, life has salves and consolations, but a noble and enduring passion is not all of this world, and to cure its sting we must look to something beyond this world's quackeries. Other griefs can find sympathy and expression, and become absorbed little by little in the variety of love's issues. But love, as it is, and should be understood--not the faint ghost that arrays itself in stolen robes, and says, [...] "I am love," [...] but love the strong and the immortal, the passkey to the happy skies, the angel cipher we read, but cannot understand--such love as this, and there is none other true, can find no full solace here, not even in its earthly satisfaction.|$|E
