It analyzes {{the impact on}} imports, consumption, and domestic production and the social costs {{under the assumption that}} all the relevant"industries"(production of the product in the domestic market, importing and distribution) are competitive, in the sense that there are a large number of firms involved and nothing deters new firms from entering the market. It focuses on the interaction of the <b>linking</b> <b>arrangement</b> with price controls, because the products in question also have been subject to this additional regulation. The overlapping regulations pose problems of timing in the liberalization process. The paper also investigates the operation of the linking arrangements when domestic production is monopolized. The conclusion is that the ranking of the policy instruments as a means of obtaining certain objectives may switch if the domestic industry is not competitive.

40|$|Abstract: Resource {{dependence}} theory (RDT) {{has long}} been a premier framework for understanding organization-environmental relations, but an empirical synthesis of its predictions is still lacking. Using meta-analysis, we consolidate 147 tests of RDT and corroborate its main predictions: organizations respond to resource dependencies by forming interorganizational arrangements like interlocks, alliances, joint ventures, in-sourcing arrangements, and mergers and acquisitions. In turn, these arrangements make them more autonomous and more legitimate. We also extend RDT in three ways. First, we ‘unpack’ the theory by showing that the mechanisms <b>linking</b> <b>arrangement</b> formation to organizational autonomy and legitimacy differ across arrangements. Second, we address the question whether RDT is also a theory of organizational performance. We find that whereas autonomy positively mediates the relationship between arrangement formation and performance, legitimacy does not. This suggests that RDT can also explain organizational actions which have societal acceptance rather than economic performance as an ulterior motive. Third, we assess whether competition law is a boundary condition to RDT’s prescriptions. Specifically, we show that the adoption of the horizontal merger guidelines in the U. S. has caused organizations to ‘flee’ from mergers to less regulated arrangements like alliances and joint ventures, and has hurt the profitability of the remaining mergers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{flowering}} {{plants and animals}} the most common ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) organisation is that in which 35 S (encoding 18 S- 5. 8 S- 26 S rRNA) and 5 S genes are physically separated occupying different chromosomal loci. However, recent observations established that both genes have been unified to a single 35 S- 5 S unit in the genus Artemisia (Asteraceae), a genomic arrangement typical of primitive eukaryotes such as yeast, among others. Here we aim to reveal the origin, distribution and mechanisms leading to the linked organisation of rDNA in the Asteraceae by analysing unit structure (PCR, Southern blot, sequencing), gene copy number (quantitative PCR) and chromosomal position (FISH) of 5 S and 35 S rRNA genes in ~ 200 species representing the family diversity and other closely related groups. Results Dominant linked rDNA genotype was found within three large groups in subfamily Asteroideae: tribe Anthemideae (93 % of the studied cases), tribe Gnaphalieae (100 %) and in the "Heliantheae alliance" (23 %). The remaining five tribes of the Asteroideae displayed canonical non <b>linked</b> <b>arrangement</b> of rDNA, as did the other groups in the Asteraceae. Nevertheless, low copy linked genes were identified among several species that amplified unlinked units. The conserved position of functional 5 S insertions downstream from the 26 S gene suggests a unique, perhaps retrotransposon-mediated integration event {{at the base of}} subfamily Asteroideae. Further evolution likely involved divergence of 26 S- 5 S intergenic spacers, amplification and homogenisation of units across the chromosomes and concomitant elimination of unlinked arrays. However, the opposite trend, from <b>linked</b> towards unlinked <b>arrangement</b> was also surmised in few species indicating possible reversibility of these processes. Conclusions Our results indicate that nearly 25 % of Asteraceae species may have evolved unusual <b>linked</b> <b>arrangement</b> of rRNA genes. Thus, in plants, fundamental changes in intrinsic structure of rDNA units, their copy number and chromosomal organisation may occur within relatively short evolutionary time. We hypothesize that the 5 S gene integration within the 35 S unit might have repeatedly occurred during plant evolution, and probably once in Asteraceae. </p...|$|R

It is shown that this manipulator has the important benefits of combining a large positional workspace {{in relation to}} its footprint with a sizable range of platform rotations. These features are obtained by combining a rotation-symmetric actuating arm system with links in an octahedral-like configuration. Thus the manipulator consists of a central cylindrical column with six actuated rotating upper arms that can rotate indefinitely around the central column. Each upper arm is connected to a manipulated platform by one 5 -DOF lower arm <b>link.</b> The <b>link</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the Octahedral Hexarot is inspired by the original Gough platform.

40|$|Commonwealth and State {{governments in}} Australia are {{attempting}} to increase the adoption of farm forestry to address pressing natural resource management and regional development issues. Farm forestry {{has the potential to}} provide substantial benefits to regions, principally by arresting land degradation, but also by diversifying farm incomes and contributing to industry development-particularly if timber processing occurs in a region. However, viable regional farm forestry industries are still to emerge. While some small-scale growers have developed farm forestry independently of industry or government assistance, most growers link with industry prior to harvest. These grower-industry partnerships have established 82, 900 ha of forests, representing approximately 8 % of Australia's plantation resource. Notwithstanding this success, market linkages between small-scale growers and industry has been identified as an important impediment to farm forestry. In this paper, the authors discuss their recent assessment of links between small-scale growers and industry in three important farm forestry regions in Australia. <b>Linking</b> <b>arrangements</b> are described and refinements suggested. The authors conclude that the extent farm forestry will deliver anticipated benefits to landholders and regional communities will largely be determined by the structure of markets...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of natural}} and sexual {{selection}} in wild populations of Drosophila have historically provided strong inference {{for the maintenance of}} inversion polymorphism. Analysis of geographical variation in the Drosophila robusta chro-mosomal data collected over more than 50 years from 133 natural populations across eastern North America has con-firmed several north–south and east–west clines in the frequencies of some gene <b>arrangements</b> and <b>linked</b> <b>arrangement</b> combinations. Patterns of geographical variation, including several north–south clines, revealed by regression and spatial autocorrelation analyses are concordant with palaeoclimatic shifts, Pleistocene glaciations and historical changes in the composition of North American forest communities. Because D. robusta is a sap-breeder, using the microbe-infested sap exudates of a number of deciduous tree species in which they carry out their life cycle, shifts in climate and palaeovegetation types since the formation of the eastern deciduous forests in the Miocene are hypothesized to be major factors influencing patterns of inversion polymorphisms across the range of this drosophilid species.

On the other hand, increasing the number of nodes while keeping the node density constant (by proportionally increasing terrain dimensions) results in rapid increase of non-coordinated interference while coordinated interference remains almost constant.

40|$|Preferential {{arrangements}} (bilateral {{and multilateral}} free trade areas and GSP systems (preferences for developing countries)) are emerging {{everywhere in the}} world trading system and are causing concern because they discriminate against non-members and add complexity, distortions and inconsistency to the global system. Rules of origin (ROOs) <b>linked</b> to these <b>arrangements</b> are {{a significant part of the}} problem. More and more they have become the source in their own right of distortions in trade patterns, complexity, non-transparency and inconsistency. This essay argues that WTO members should authorize negotiations seeking to harmonize preferential ROOs (rules of origin <b>linked</b> to preferential <b>arrangements)</b> around core principles consistent with WTO rules. The harmonized preferential ROOs should be aligned as much as possible with the harmonized regime for non-preferential ROOs (rules of origin <b>linked</b> to non-preferential <b>arrangements)</b> likely to emerge from the current hold-over WTO negotiations authorized by the Uruguay Round ROOs Agreement. They should be nonrestrictive, based essentially on the principle that substantial transformation confers origin, and - except where developing countries benefit - should not allow cumulation (treating product components from within the preferential region as locally produced). Existing preferential ROOs not consistent with these principles could be argued to violate Article XXIV, and in some cases Article III, of GATT 1994. In the case of developing country preferences, bilateral cumulation in GSP systems could be argued to violate the Enabling Clause...|$|R
