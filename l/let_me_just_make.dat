It's a neighborhood of friends and artists who come in to taste Pasquale Marino's southern Italian food. His mussels are incredible. Or sometimes he'll say, 'I'm inspired, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> this dish for you.' Pasquale is from Calabria, very spirited and truly the captain of his ship. Yet, sometimes someone will get on the guitar and just start singing." [...] It is also known for its restroom—Italian Renaissance-themed rooms filled with Italian design and art, which have been voted among the best restaurant restrooms in the United States. In addition, it is known for the live music of its piano bar.|$|E
40|$|Philipp Frank"s book Relativity â€“ {{a richer}} truth 1 shows {{something}} we do not find very often after World War 2 : a philosopher of science acting as a public intellectual. Taking part in the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion, Philipp Frank intervened in the public debate {{about the causes of}} Nazism and how to defend democracy and liberalism against totalitarian ideas and politics. Could philosophy of science contribute to such a struggle? Philipp Frank thought it could, he even thought that Philosophy of Science should {{play a crucial role in}} it. It"s obvious that this position should be of some interest for philosophers in Austria and Europe today. Of course, any serious analysis of Frank"s position would have to take the whole historical constellation into account. Between the beginning of the conference in 1940 and the publication of the book in 1951 the historical situation had dramatically changed. And therefore one has to distinguish several political dimensions in Frank"s arguments. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> a short remark on the plurality of political perspectives Frank"s discourse opened up. Philipp Frank defined the role science should play in democracy not only in contrast to the role of science as it was conceived by totalitarian governments. Of course he criticised the Nazis" and Soviets" â€?philosophies of scienceâ€? several times (see for instance p. 73, 98, 103 p.). But he also made very clear that in the 40 ies and 50 ies not even the majority of scholars and university teachers in the US supported the specific view of science which Frank thought was so important to the advancement of democracy (for instance 59 pp.). His rather critical comments on the teaching of science in the post war / cold war period show what he thought the really important political impact of science was. As far as I can see, these comments did not loose their significance...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} station system, {{based largely}} on federal (Hatch and McIntire-Stennis) formula funds plus state funds, and near autonomy of the director, was very productive. However, the paradigm has shifted for some SAES, is shifting for many others, and likely will shift for all by the year 2000. In my view these shifts are not inherently either good or bad. They simply are reality and our challenge is {{to deal effectively with}} them to identify the high priority problems and assist in obtaining funds to address them. With that hint of how I intend to approach my assignment, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> <b>just</b> three introductory points: 1) I don't pretend to have the formula for setting priorities in State Agricultural Experiment Stations (SAES). Even the ideas I will be sharing with you certainly are not mine alone, but a composite of where I'm at in my synthesis and thinking process. 2) I will talk about some key components of a priority setting process which seem to me to be important wherever we may be. 3) Priority setting, in terms of both parameters and process, has changed and likely will be dramatically different tomorrow than it is today. I suggest that our challenge is to be prepared "to do the best of things in the worst of times. "...|$|R

40|$|Thank you for {{the kind}} {{introduction}} and for the very clear summary of the arguments of Multicultural Citizenship. So I thought I’d just mention {{a couple of the}} ideas that I’ve been working with more recently. The first concerns this. There are two main types of groups that I’ve been thinking of - immigrant groups and national minorities. What kinds of rights are appropriate for these two different types of groups. I discuss this in the book. I’ve been thinking a little bit just about trying to be more precise about the types of institutions and policies that are appropriate for these two kinds of groups and I’ve changed the terminology a bit. I would now talk about these in terms of immigrant multiculturalism for immigrant groups and multi-nation federalism for national minorities. So <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> say that I hope it’s not dramatically different from what’s in the book but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> clarify what I mean by those terms, because I will use them...|$|R
