50|$|Katun {{started out}} with 15 {{employees}} and offered {{a limited number of}} parts. By 1980, Katun employed over 50 people and became the first choice for customers looking for OEM-equivalent performance products. The company soon began to develop parts for <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> copiers and Savin imaging equipment.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Benny Landa and a {{colleague}} co-founded Imtec, an international micrographics company. Landa invented the company’s core imaging technology. While researching <b>liquid</b> <b>toners,</b> he developed a method of high-speed image development which used charged pigmented particles in a liquid carrier.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, several {{attempts}} were made to develop electrophotographic proofing processes based on the electrofax principle, using paper coated with zinc oxide in a resistive binder as a photoconductor, along with toners consisting of ink pigments dispersed in liquid Isopar. The electrofax principle was introduced in the United States by RCA, and the use of <b>liquid</b> <b>toners</b> was developed in Australia by Ralph Metcalf and Robert Wright of the Australian government. Other groups worked on similar processes, but these never got to market.|$|R
50|$|Savin was {{incorporated}} in 1959 by Max M. and Robert K.Low (the company was named {{using the name}} of Max Low's son-in-law, Robert S. Savin) and was run by Low's son, Robert K. Low (Finance,management and marketing) and E. Paul Charlap (research and development). It was known primarily for its line of <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> photocopiers, which set it apart from other companies that manufactured dry toner equipment, like Xerox.|$|E
50|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>Toner</b> models use toner that is {{positively}} charged and thus becomes attracted to paper's negative charge. This occurs after the toner particles {{pass through a}} line of electrodes {{in the form of}} tiny wires, or nibs. The spacing of the wires controls the resolution of the plotter; for example, 100 or 400 wires to the inch. Dry Toner models use a process similar to xerography in photocopiers. Unlike a laser printer or photocopier, there is no transfer drum used in most electrostatic plotters; the imaging paper is directly exposed to the charging electrode array.|$|E
50|$|Copying {{machines}} using electrofax technology {{were common}} from the 1960s through the 1980s. They were {{less expensive to}} manufacture than xerographic copiers, although the paper was slightly more costly than the plain paper used by xerography. Electrofax fell out of favor when other copier technologies could produce markedly better quality copies at less expense. By comparison, electrofax suffered a number of drawbacks, including: weak blacks in the image (most machines could only produce a dark gray), dampness and odor of the copies, the need for special paper, and multiple-bottle <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> replacement. Similarly, the need for electrofax based printers & plotters faded, as laser printers became cheaper, followed by inkjet printers.|$|E
50|$|Landa's {{interest}} in printing {{goes back to}} the time he worked as a child in his father's photo shop. His father purchased a cigar store that had a small photo studio in the back which he developed, using his skills as a carpenter, into his own portrait studio. While a student in London, Landa got a job at Commercial Aid Printing Services (CAPS), a company offering printing services and microfilm solutions. Landa was instrumental in developing a solution that won the company a contract with Rolls Royce and was appointed as Head of R&D. However, CAPS lacked manufacturing capital and went into receivership in 1969. In 1971 he joined Gerald Frankel, the owner of CAPS, and founded a new company - Imaging Technology (Imtec). Landa led Imtec’s R&D activities and invented the company’s core imaging technology. While researching <b>liquid</b> <b>toners</b> at Imtec, he worked on a method of high-speed image development that would later lead to the invention of ElectroInk.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the generation of}} charged inverse micelles in nonpolar surfactant solutions relevant for applications such as electronic ink displays and <b>liquid</b> <b>toners.</b> When a voltage is applied across {{a thin layer of}} a nonpolar surfactant solution between planar electrodes, the generation of charged inverse micelles leads to a generation current. From current measurements it appears that such charged inverse micelles generated in the presence of an electric field behave differently compared to those present in equilibrium {{in the absence of a}} field. To examine the origin of this difference, transient current measurements in which the applied voltage is suddenly increased are used to measure the mobility and the amount of generated charged inverse micelles. The mobility and the corresponding hydrodynamic size are found to be similar to those of charged inverse micelles present in equilibrium, which indicates that other properties determine their different behavior. The amplitude and shape of the transient currents measured as a function of the surfactant concentration confirm that the charged inverse micelles are generated by bulk disproportionation. A theoretical model based on bulk disproportionation with simulations and analytical approximations is developed to analyze the experimental transient currents...|$|R
40|$|Non-polar {{electrical}} field flow fractionation (Np-EFFF) {{has been}} demonstrated to separate electrophotographic toner particles suspended in hydrocarbon medium according to the ratio of their diffusivities and their electrophoretic mobilities. While electrophoretic mobility has long been recognized as critical to the behavior of <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> particles in a development gap, the role of diffusivity has largely been ignored. Toner particles move in the development gap {{as a function of}} both parameters, and as toner particle size is reduced to achieve improvements in print quality, diffusivity becomes increasingly important. We present a method of quantifying and predicting the behavior of toner particles in the development gap of a print engine. Particles eluting from the Np-EFFF channel at the same retention volume would be expected to exhibit similar development characteristics in a printer. Consequently, Np-EFFF retention volume data can be used to predict image development performance of <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> particles. Using this instrument with the multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) detector permits simultaneous determination of particle size, and particle size distribution. Although it is theoretically possible to determine other fundamental particle parameters from Np-EFFF data, it is used here to separate particles for further analysis down steam. In practical application, these instrumental capabilities allow screening of very small toner test batches, thus conserving time, expense, and the amount of waste generated...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the electrodynamics of charged inverse {{micelles}} (CIMs) in nonpolar liquids and the generation mechanism and properties of newly generated CIMs have been studied extensively for the model system of polyisobutylene succinimide in dodecane. However, the newly generated CIMs, which accumulate at the electrodes when a continuous voltage is applied, behave differently compared to the regular CIMs present in equilibrium {{in the absence of}} a field. In this work, we use transient current measurements to investigate the behavior of the newly generated CIMs when the field is reduced to zero or reversed. We demonstrate that the newly generated CIMs do not participate in the diffuse double layer near the electrode formed by the regular CIMs but form an interface layer at the electrode surface. A fraction of the newly generated negative CIMs can be released from this interface layer when the field there becomes zero. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of fundamental processes in nonpolar liquids and are relevant for applications such as electronic ink displays and <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> printing...|$|E
40|$|While {{barcodes}} are {{a popular}} means for encoding information for printed matter, they add unsightly overt content. If an image is already {{part of the}} composition of a printed label or page, hiding information in that image is an attractive alternative to barcodes. This paper offers a new method for encoding information in the halftone of an image. We focus on the class of techniques that perform clustered-dot halftoning, as commonly used in both dry toner and <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> electrophotographic processes. The method takes as input any grayscale image and a payload of data to be encoded and produces a bitonal clustered-dot halftone of that image with selected halftone clusters shifted to carry varying numbers of bits from the payload. The resulting data-bearing steganographic halftone {{is referred to as}} a "Stegatone". Because of the small size and large number of clustered-dot cells in printed halftones the bit density is quite high- over 2000 bytes/square-inch. Scans of test printed stegatones from a number of printers support the robustness of the method with high recovery rates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the use of}} ultrasound to deink papers printed using Indigo’s <b>liquid</b> <b>toner,</b> Electroink. In recent years, concerns have been expressed over the difficulty of deinking waste paper produced using the Indigo printing process. Among other problems {{it was found that}} the ink particles were too large to be removed using conventional deinking methods. High-intensity ultrasound was applied to investigate the possibility of fragmenting the ink particles to a size where they could be removed by flotation methods. The effect of temperature and sonication power on the particle size distribution was also studied. Tests were performed on two substrates, a typical paper used with Indigo presses and Indigo’s Sapphire coated paper, treated to help the Electroink bond to the paper. Handsheets were formed from the sonicated pulp and analysed to obtain a particle distribution. The findings from this work revealed that Indigo inks are not as hard to remove as was previously thought, and the application of ultrasound improves the number of particles removed. Variations in power input and temperature were found to have a significant effect on the results, with most effective cleaning occurring at a higher power and lower temperature...|$|E
40|$|This paper details {{both the}} {{conventional}} processes used for effective ink removal during the recycling of printed papers and more novel treatments. Particular attention {{was paid to}} methods employed to deal with papers printed with ‘difficult to deink’ inks such as toners from photocopiers, UV-cured ink films and <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> suspensions or ElectroInks®. High intensity ultrasound was applied to pulps derived from papers printed with these newer inks in order to evaluate its effectiveness in detaching the inks from paper and establishing the resultant ink particle size distributions. In all cases, {{it was found that the}} application of ultrasound at a frequency of 20 kHz had a significant effect on the resulting ink particle size distributions. In the case of toners, it was found that particle disintegration was more effective at temperatures below the ink softening point. This was attributed to the increased brittleness of the toner at this temperature. ElectroInks® can be effectively de-inked by exposure to ultrasound coupled with washing under neutral conditions. For all the inks, the size distribution of the resultant detached ink particles was such that they could be removed using standard flotation and washing techniques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{accordance}} with environmental sustainability {{and in order}} to optimize the recycling process of prints from indirect electrophotography with <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> the results of investigating the effects of changes in printing conditions on the characteristics of recycled fibres is presented. Changing of printing machine conditions, respecting of voltage variations, comprises of the reverse rollers and intermediate cylinder. Based on the results it can be concluded that the change in the voltage of the reverse rollers more affect the recycling efficiency with respect to the voltage change of the intermediate cylinder. Brightness gain is higher when the print for recycling is made on uncoated paper compared to coated, and dependent on the voltage changes. Effective residual ink concentration decreases far more on handsheets obtained from recycled samples on uncoated paper in relation to both sides coated paper. Increasing the positive voltage of intermediate cylinder and increasing the negative charge of reverse rollers increases the 3 D gamut CIE L*a*b* color cubic units. Guidelines for the size of the voltage in order to obtain optimal print reproduction are provided. The further research will include the development in area of clean technologies, advanced materials, closed loop systems; therefore the significant terms in the area of environmental sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Two {{exhibitions}} {{resulted from}} {{investigations into the}} de-inking of digitally printed papers using high intensity ultrasound. The exhibitions consisted of photomicrographs taken using either an optical or electron microscope. In ‘Ink, Paper, Sound’ the fourteen micrographs illustrate the process of ink fragmentation during the de-inking process and {{as well as being}} of scientific value they are visually arresting. The exhibition was a visual exploration {{of the relationship between the}} paper, the ink and the effects produced by exposure to ultrasound. A variety of novel lighting conditions were employed in capturing the images and some images were enhanced using image analysis techniques. In ‘Paper Topographies’, the second exhibition, the images were from handsheets prepared from repulped paper that had been printed with solid black print using the Indigo <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> technology known as ElectroInk®. Images were also captured from virgin paper fibre and paper filler samples such as Ground and Precipitated Calcium Carbonate. Image capture was performed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) using either a secondary or backscattered electron detector. With several of the specimens it was necessary to sputter-coat them with gold prior to imaging. A range of working distances, accelerating voltages and magnifications were employed to achieve a complete set of images for analysis and display...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{directions}} {{of the ecological}} sustainability in printing reproduction are {{in the area of}} the application of the renewable and recycled raw materials, in the decrease of the energy consumption, the usage of the energy from the renewable sources and in the production without waste. This article presents the research results of voltage changes of the intermediate cylinder in indirect electrophotography with <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> on dirt count and area on handsheet made from fibers after prints pulping and flotation, brightness and effective residual ink concentration. Since on the indirect transfer of ElectroInk except the voltage of the intermediate cylinder also impacts temperature, its influence on the dirt count and area is showed. Uncoated and both side coated substrates were used for printing. The results show that changes in voltage of the intermediate cylinder in the printing affects the characteristics of pulped and floated fibers and dirt count and area on handsheets. Dominant factor of studied process is surface treatment of the printing substrate. Maximum efficiency of deinking flotation (87. 7 %) was observed on non coated paper print, at the voltage of the intermediate cylinder of 700 V. The efficiency of deinking flotation on both sides coated paper prints in dependence on the voltage of the intermediate cylinder in most cases is below 10 %. The results show that an increase in temperature of the intermediate cylinder increases dirt count and area on handsheetst after pulping prints under experimental conditions. Increased efficiency of flotation was found for print obtained at a lower temperature of the intermediate cylinder...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{describe}} and evaluate the traditional methods for effective ink removal during the recycling of printed papers. Additionally, novel techniques {{for dealing with the}} newer “difficult to deink” inks such as toners from photocopiers, UV-cured ink films and <b>liquid</b> <b>toner</b> suspensions or Electroinks® are to be evaluated. Design/methodology/approach – High intensity ultrasound was applied to pulps derived from papers printed with these newer inks in order to evaluate its effectiveness in detaching the inks from paper and establishing the resultant ink particle size distributions. Findings – When exposed to ultrasound at a frequency of 20 ?kHz, it was found that “difficult to deink” pulps did exhibit significant ink detachment. In the case of toners, temperature did have an effect on particle breakdown with larger numbers of particles produced at temperatures well below the softening point which was attributed to a greater brittleness of the toner at lower temperatures. Electroinks® can be effectively de-inked by exposure to ultrasound coupled with washing under neutral conditions. With all the inks investigated, exposure to ultrasound resulted in the detached ink having particle size distributions that can be removed by conventional flotation and washing techniques. Research limitations/implications – The exposure of the pulp to ultrasound was only carried out using a batch-wise process. A future development would be to use a continuous flow system incorporating an annular ultrasound horn. Practical implications – Introducing ultrasound exposure into a conventional deinking plant, all post-consumer printed waste paper could be deinked without the use of deinking chemicals. Originality/value – The findings are of interest to those in paper recycling...|$|E
