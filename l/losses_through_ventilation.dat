40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{possible}} measures {{for the conservation of}} energy in buildings are reviewed. The survey is made {{in the context of the}} American situation and covers energy use in space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, and domestic and other appliances. Topics discussed include 'total energy' systems, insulation, heat <b>losses</b> <b>through</b> <b>ventilation,</b> solar heat gain, heat of lights, life-cycle costing, heat pumps, standards of heating and cooling, lighting standards, appliance design, energy costs of building materials, and potential savings from energy conservation measures. Many of these areas are the subject of much detailed research in their own right; the purpose of the present broad review is to try to set the variety of separate possibilities for conservation in the context of a potentially systematic view of their overall interrelationship, and in the context of building design seen as a whole. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{building}} sector alone {{accounts for}} almost 40 % {{of the total}} energy demand and people spend more than 80 % of their time indoors. Reducing energy demand in buildings {{is essential to the}} achievement of a sustainable built environment. At the same time, it is important to not deteriorate people’s health, well-being and comfort in buildings. Thus, designing healthy and energy-efficient buildings {{is one of the most}} challenging tasks. Evaluation of buildings with a broad perspective can give further opportunities for energy savings and improvement of the indoor climate. The aim of this thesis is to understand the functionality, regarding indoor climate and energy performance, of a low-energy building. To achieve this, a multi-dimensional approach is used, which means that the building is investigated from several points of views and with different methods. A systems approach is applied where the definition of the system, its components and the border to its environment, is essential to the understanding of a phenomenon. Measurement of physical variables, simulations, and qualitative interviews are used to characterize the performance of the building. Both energy simulation and computational fluid dynamic simulations are used to analyse the energy performance at the building level as well as the indoor climate at room level. To reveal the environmental impact of the low-energy building studied in this thesis the CO 2 emissions and embodied energy have been investigated regarding different surrounding energy systems. The evaluated building is situated at the west coast of Sweden and uses about 50 % of energy compared to a comparable ordinary Swedish building. The building is well-insulated and an air-to-air heat exchanger is used to minimise the heat <b>losses</b> <b>through</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The houses are heated mainly by the emissions from the household appliances, occupants, and by solar irradiation. During cold days an integrated electrical heater of 900 W can be used to heat the air that is distributed through the ventilation system. According to measurements and simulations, the ventilation efficiency and thermal environment could be further improved but the occupants are mostly satisfied with the indoor climate. The control of the heating system and the possibility for efficient ventilation during summertime are other important issues. This was found through quantitative measurements, simulations and qualitative interviews. The low-energy building gives rise to lower CO 2 emissions than comparable buildings, but another energy carrier, such as district heating or biofuel, could be used to further improve the environmental performance of the building. The total energy demand, including the embodied energy, is lower than for a comparable building. To understand the functionality of a low-energy building both the technical systems and the occupants, who are essential for low-energy buildings, partly as heat sources but mainly as users of the technical systems, should be included in the analysis...|$|E
40|$|Residential {{architectural}} design should fulfill both the comfort {{and the social}} requirements of the occupants. Khartoum, {{the capital of the}} Sudan was chosen for this study because of two reasons; The first is its unusually hot-arid climate (thus cooling interior spaces becomes a crucial design consideration). and the second is its multi-dimensional urban identity. The city is a mixture of African, Arab, and European influences and resembles at the same time an oasis {{in the middle of the}} desert. The research follows two distinct but closely related paths. The first is the study and analysis of the passive and hybrid cooling systems and strategies under which the climatic conditions of Khartoum determines the type and size of each approach. The second stage of the research will focus on the architectural implications of these systems. Both directions lead to better understanding of the built environment and its interactions with man. Two moves were taken into account, when considering the cooling potentials in this climate. First, the solar control strategies which were found to be most appropriate in Khartoum climatic conditions. These include the use of eggcrate shading devices on all openings except for southern exposures which can be shaded effectively by vertical fins to reduce the solar transmission through glazed surfaces. The study showed also that reducing the glazed area reduces the total heat gain but this affects negatively both daylighting and the freedom of design to incorporate the exterior spaces. This can be solved by using the Low-E glass which has better thermal properties in terms of reducing both solar transmission and heat conduction. The results of the study showed that using single Light-Green Low-E glass allows one and half times larger glass area with the same amount of heat gain. For the same area, the Double Low-E glass can reduce heat gain form these surfaces by a factor of two. Economically, their use is hard to justify because of their projected high prices as compared to the DS single pane clear glass. Another effective way of controlling the heat gain through buildingskin is to use thermal insulation on the walls and roof. Roof insulation which Is commonly specified in Khartoum was found to be thermally satisfactory and additional insulation will not reduce heat gain appreciably since the roof share is already reduced with basic insulation. The wall insulation strategy proved to be economically feasible and does not require skilled labor to install or to maintain since it is protected from the weather. Landscaping is another move that will improve the environmental quality through shading and evaporatively cooling the surrounding spaces and at the same time add to the visual quality of the space, but it is not cost effective. The second move was to promote heat <b>losses</b> <b>through</b> <b>ventilation,</b> convection, radiation, and evaporation. Because of the environmental condition of Khartoum, the first three moves are restricted to certain parts of the day or the year. Nevertheless, combination of either one with evaporative cooling increases the thermal comfort. The desert-type evaporative coolers reduce the indoor temperature and increase the relative humidity which is required in the dry periods of the year. Two-stage coolers which combines both evaporative (adiabatic) and sensible cooling concepts increases the rate of heat removal and thus reduces obtained indoor temperature. The air scoops or wind catchers are convective and evaporative cooling systems that admit high winds at high elevations to be circulated inside living spaces for ventilation. This air can be further cooled be passing the air stream over wet Clay jars or through wetted pads. by Adil M. K. Sharag-Eldin. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|The {{performance}} of four approaches to demand controlled residential exhaust ventilation {{systems that are}} commercially available on the market were monitored in real life implementations. Their performance was assessed both {{on the level of}} heat <b>loss</b> <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> and on the level of indoor environmental quality. For the heat loss performance, the fan power was continuously measured to know the exhaust flow. For the indoor environmental quality, the carbon dioxide concentration, the temperature and the humidity level in each of the rooms in the houses were monitored. The systems and the houses they were integrated in were modeled in multi zone simulation software and the predicted performance was compared to the monitoring results. Information on the interactions of the occupants with the system was gathered by questionnaires about the occupants’ habits. The results also demonstrate that the {{performance of}} the monitored systems, as far as ventilation heat loss is considered relatively to that of a constant air volume exhaust system, is severely limited by adventitious ventilation and infiltration and is largely dependent on the occupancy and other specifics of the particular case. This indicates that the systems react appropriately to changes in pollution source strength, achieving a better exposure to heat loss trade off than constant volume flow systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to theoretically explore the potential for improved energy efficiency for heating and cooling of buildings when varying the ventilation rate during a day. In the highly insulated buildings of today, the heat <b>loss</b> <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> and solar and internal gains are of major importance for the energy demand. Previous investigations show that in some cases it is possible, periodically, to store surplus of heat or cool in a building structure thus reducing the energy demand of the building. However, the full potential of the heat capacity of the building materials is far from used. This paper answers the question of how important the choice of ventilation strategy is when combined with a lightweight, a medium weight or a heavy interior structure. This paper also investigates to what extent the building as a system can take benefit of the gains and reduce the demand for extra energy and mitigate power peaks. To find the potential for a better energy efficiency, the integrated performance of the whole building as a system has to be taken into account. This is achieved by analysing the building as an integrated system, using a Simulink-based modelling tool, obtained from the newly developed International Building Physics Toolbox, in a cases study. For a given location (climatic data), use of building (internal heat gain), thermal comfort interval, the choice of building material and ventilation strategies determine the energy demand for heating and cooling. Although this is a fairly limited case study, the result suggests that varying ventilation rate can be effective when harmonized with the internal heat gain. The demand to remove access heat <b>through</b> the <b>ventilation</b> system is decreased significantly in a building with a heavy interior structure. 1...|$|R
40|$|This review {{concerns}} {{the challenge of}} growing prevalence of exercise-induced asthma (EIA) in physically active children and adolescents. The article will encompass both mechanisms for developing exercise-induced asthma and bronchoconstriction in children and young athletes and how to manage these symptoms, {{as well as the}} epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment. EIA occurs in up to 70 - 80 % percent of asthmatics and 8, 6 % of Norwegian 10 -year-olds in the general population. The severity of the disease is thought to correspond to the exercise load and the level of ventilation during exercise, which in turn will cause increased heat and water <b>loss</b> <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> and add on to bronchial constriction. The daily increased ventilation rate in athletes is thought to lead in to increased epithelial damage of the airways and thus increased airway mucosal inflammation. Sports activity in areas with cold/dry air, chlorine compounds in swimming facilities or high particulate matter in ice-rinks, will all lead to higher incidence of bronchoconstriction and increase the asthmatic symptoms, because of the environmental exposure. Symptoms include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath, during and in the end of an exercise or few minutes after. The diagnosis is confirmed with positive standardized exercise tests. Thus, asthma management and control is important for children and adolescents to be able to participate in daily physical activities, to increase cardiovascular fitness and to enjoy the benefits of an active lifestyle. This has been shown to improve quality of life and personal wellbeing. Both nonpharmacologic therapy and pharmacologic therapy in combination is essential to achieve the goal of getting all children with EIA to participate on the same level in physical activities as others, as well as taking environmental exposures to consideration. The asthmatic youth should follow the same guidelines for medical treatment as ordinary asthmatic patients...|$|R

This report describes the predictive modeling procedure used to predict the moisture content of waste in the future, {{after it has been}} subjected to dryout caused by water vapor <b>loss</b> <b>through</b> passive <b>ventilation.</b> This report describes a simplified procedure for modeling the drying out of tank waste. Dryout occurs as moisture evaporates from the waste into the headspace and then exits the tank <b>through</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The water vapor concentration within the waste of the headspace is determined by the vapor-liquid equilibrium, which depends on the waste`s moisture content and temperature. This equilibrium has been measured experimentally for a variety of waste samples and is described by a curve called the water vapor partial pressure isotherm. This curve describes the lowering of the partial pressure of water vapor in equilibrium with the waste relative to pure water due to the waste`s chemical composition and hygroscopic nature. Saltcake and sludge are described by two distinct calculations that emphasize the particular physical behavior or each. A simple, steady-state model is devised for each type to obtain the approximate drying behavior. The report shows the application of the model to Tanks AX- 102, C- 104, and U- 105...|$|R
40|$|To be able {{to handle}} tomorrows need for limited energy {{consumption}} we need to reduce our use of energy. The building sector stands for around 40 % of all energy consumption in the society. The government has put up a goal to reduce the energy consumption in our buildings with 20 % by year 2020 and 50 % by year 2050 compared with year 1995. To {{be able to}} do reach that goal we need a more energy efficient building stock. The main part of the energy used in our buildings is used for space heating. By installing ventilation systems with heat recovery on the exhaust air it is possible to use the heat-energy in the exhaust air to warm up the incoming air. This can contribute to a reduction in energy use. A ventilation system with heat recovery on the exhaust air is space demanding and there can be problems with finding enough space to do the installation indoors. Therefore it can be an advantage to place the aggregate and the ducts {{on the outside of the}} buildings climate shell. A placement exterior of the buildings climate shell or in an unheated space leads to thermal heat losses. The aim with this essay is to investigate how significant the heat losses are on exterior placed ventilation systems. The investigation has been done with help of theoretical calculations and measurements of the temperature difference in the ventilation ducts. Analysis has been made on life cycle costs on how to reduce the heat losses in an economic manner. To buildings, Höstvägen 14 and 22 in Växjö, which have been equipped with exterior placed ventilation systems have been studied. The two buildings have two different types of installation of the ducts.

40|$|The BCE {{technology}} {{opens up}} a new method to reinforce Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) by separating the production into two stages, primarily a block production from a traditional plant and secondarily the combining of blocks with affusion of High Performing Concrete (HPC) into prestressed hybrid panels, vertical or horizontal. The first stage means a continuous output of {{a limited number of}} standardized format blocks, up to 300 mm height, the second stage a non-standard production of individual panels following a CAD/CAM managed procedure, giving full freedom to architectural variation. The second stage can be added to existing block producing facilities, even in cases when a genuine PFA recipe is applied. The BCE horizontal panels have a higher capacity of up to 9 m span, carrying a live load of up to 6 kN/ than those with unstressed reinforcement from a traditional AAC plant. Industrial wall panels as well as roof panels may be 12 m, the latter under limited snow loads as is the case on most locations. Vertical wall panels can be designed with reduced depth but with retained capacity. In comparison with existing concrete alternatives the BCE panels are carrying a lower embodied energy, generating lower emissions in production of carbon dioxide.   The BCE technology is based on experience with a complete building system of AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete), the Siporex alternative, with which I was involved in the 1970 s. The Swedish market for this material was declining at the time due to a rather formal attitude from the national authorities on heat <b>losses</b> <b>through</b> walls and structures towards sky and ground. It was only later that a full understanding of sources of <b>loss,</b> such as <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> and windows, was recognized. So, the value of AAC was underestimated at the time which is now compensated for by growing imports of the material from the continent. But there was something objectionable also about the reinforced products – they were rather complicated to produce, limited to 3 M-standard, and stored awaiting customer’s order. Only from Japan did we learn that no such storage was allowed, due to the cost of land. This seemed futuristic but was in fact a proof of sound economy. Was there a way to approach this attitude by reforming the production layout? The BCE technology was first tried in the 1980 s, then published at the 3 rd Int. Conference on AAC (Zürich, 1992) and again at the 5 th Conference (Bydgoszcz, 2011). Throughout this long period I have received a most stimulating support from my colleague and dear friend Bo R Schmidt, once marketing manager at Siporex. A helping hand over the last period belongs to Hamid Bagheri, whose licentiate thesis on BCE from 2006, available on Internet (Prestressed hybrids of AAC and HPC – The BCE building system), is attracting growing interest.
