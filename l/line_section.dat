5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each <b>line</b> <b>section.</b> This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, {{the advantage of a}} mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E

25|$|The Saltash to St Germans {{section was}} {{by-passed}} by a deviation somewhat inland, and this deviation was opened for goods trains on 23 March 1908 and for passenger trains on 19 May; the former route section was then closed and abandoned.

30|$|Generally, some {{factors have}} been {{identified}} as constraints to achievable capacity since they apparently limit capacity enhancement attempts in traffic management. These limitations include priority regulations, timetable structure, design rules, environmental, safety and technical constraints [1]. In Sweden, the infrastructure manager makes an annual evaluation of the infrastructure capacity situation and utilisation. This evaluation gives the track occupation time on all the <b>line</b> <b>sections</b> and also capacity limitation due to additional train path demands that cannot be met because of excessively high track occupation time [6]. For example, in 2012 about 7  % of all the <b>line</b> <b>sections</b> in the Swedish railway network had an average daily consumption greater than 80  %, 15  % <b>line</b> <b>sections</b> between 60  % and 80  %, and 77  % of the <b>line</b> <b>sections</b> with less than 60  % track occupation time [6]. Furthermore, capacity limitation is based on the level of capacity consumption in relation to additional request for traffic volume, weight per metre, axle load and train paths.|$|R

40|$|Sound {{propagation}} in a waveguide <b>lined</b> {{with one}} <b>section</b> of locally reactive material is studied by resonance scattering approach. The {{objective is to}} understand the effects of mode coupling in the <b>lined</b> <b>section</b> on the transmission. It is shown that a transmission zero {{is present in the}} vicinity of a resonance peak when a numerically real resonance frequency of the open <b>lined</b> <b>section</b> (opened to infinities through the rigid parts of the waveguide) is crossed. The transmission zero and immediate resonance peak form a Fano resonance, it has been explained as an interaction between a resonance and the non-resonant background. The real resonance frequency and its corresponding trapped mode are formed by the interferences (couplings) between two neighbor modes with complex resonance frequencies. It is also linked to the avoided crossing of eigenvalues and the exceptional point. The scattering matrix is expressed in terms of a matrix H_eff which describes approximately the complex resonances in the open <b>lined</b> <b>section.</b> With the aid of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of matrix H_eff, the traditional acoustic resonance scattering formula can be extended to describe the coupling effects between the open <b>lined</b> <b>section</b> and the rigid parts of the waveguide...|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time in 1890 a line known as the Outer Circle line opened, running from Oakleigh (on the Dandenong line) to Darling, {{continuing}} to Burnley (a further line of the Outer Circle junctioned north to Riversdale at Waverley Road, near to where East Malvern now is). The Outer Circle was closed in sections between 1893 and 1897 and the Burnley – Waverley Road <b>line</b> <b>section</b> was cut back to Darling in 1895. In 1929 when the Glen Waverley line construction began its first extension from Darling to Eastmalvern, it was on the track of the Outer Circle line up to a short distance nigh of the new Eastmalvern station. The Outer Circle line would have begun its curve south towards Waverley Road and Oakleigh. The Glen Waverley line was to continue straight east and curve towards Holmesglen.|$|E

Marylebone can see all train movements throughout the line but does not control the signals on the Metropolitan <b>line</b> <b>section.</b> These are operated by London Underground signal cabins at Harrow, Rickmansworth and Amersham. The Network Rail-controlled section of the line is fully equipped with ATP, one of three lines in Britain to have this (the others being the Chiltern Main Line and the Great Western Main Line). As a result, all Chiltern trains must be equipped with ATP equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} strike was limited in other ways as well. In Auto Parts Co., the {{employer}} had multiple work sites. The union struck one work site, and a union member from another work site refused to cross the picket <b>line.</b> <b>Section</b> 8(b)(4)(A) of the act appeared to protect an employee's right to refuse to cross a picket line. But the Farmer board said that Section 8(b)(4)(A) only meant that refusal to cross the picket line was not a union ULP. Section 8(b)(4)(A) did not bar an employer from lawfully terminating the worker. Then, in two cases, the Farmer board limited when a union could strike during its collective bargaining agreement. In several decisions by the NLRB in the late 1940s, the board had held that unions generally could not strike during {{the life of the}} collective bargaining agreement. However, as the contract came close to expiring, the union could strike after presenting its bargaining demands—so long as it observed a 60-day [...] "cooling off" [...] period between making the demand and striking. The Farmer board overturned these decisions in Wilson & Co., and Lion Oil Company. The majority said that, {{in the absence of a}} clause allowing the sides to re-open the contract during the life of the agreement, no strikes were permitted. [...] Although neither collective bargaining agreement contained a no-strike clause, the majority effectively imposed one on every single collective bargaining agreement in the United States. The board's ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Lion Oil Company.|$|E
