40|$|M. Ed. The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} essay was to uncover all the educational aims as an aspect of a teacher's educational foundation and to determine if those educational aims have any impact on and implications {{for the management of}} teacher competence. The central premise of this study was that the teachers at various levels have latent, innate abilities, which if fully developed and utilised by each teacher, each learner can reach outstanding heights of achievement to the benefit of the learner. A competent teacher, therefore, plays a major and decisive role in enabling the learner to give meaning to his/her existence in life. It is important therefore that all possible impediments and barriers on the way of teacher competence must be identified and be removed. The researcher was satisfied that the study was successful because of the following summary of findings and recommendations that are exposed below. Findings The researcher was able to reveal empirically, that the most effective teacher in terms of competence, is both educatively and collaboratively competent. It was shown that the two levels of competence are intertwined {{in such a way that}} none is noticeably effective without the other. Both are a synergistic product of factors such as: Positive experience in teaching; Good teacher qualifications; Existence of good educational facilities and equipment such as, classrooms, <b>furniture,</b> <b>laboratories,</b> libraries, etc.; Teaching and learning through ones mother tongue; Daily and timeous attendance of school by both teachers and learners; • Diligence and commitment by both teachers and learners in the process of teaching and learning. The research findings are all substantiated by empirical evidence and existing literature. Recommendations The research findings carried a lot of weight. These enabled the researcher make the following recommendations: Effort must be made to identify and select to teacher training institutions those who are teachers by calling; Induction and in-service courses must be conducted from time-to-time to keep teachers motivated and devoted to their work; Ensure that all schools have enough educational resources such as classrooms, <b>furniture,</b> <b>laboratories,</b> libraries, etc.; Language proficiency must be given high priority attention; Teachers must be encouraged to improve their qualifications by engaging in life-long study programmes; Plan of action Teacher training institutions must establish criteria for selecting student -teachers who are naturally gifted in teaching. The course-content at teacher training institutions must aim at inculcating a strong sense of devotion, responsibility and accountability among student-teachers; Language proficiency among student-teachers, must receive high priority at teacher training level; The Department of Education must provide each rural school with the same facilities and equipment as the urban school.

40|$|Laboratories {{should be}} aware of the carbon {{footprint}} resulting from their activities and take steps to mitigate it as part of their societal responsibilities. Once committed to a mitigation programme, they should announce an environmental policy, secure the support of senior management, initiate documentation, institute a staff training programme, schedule environmental audits and appoint an environmental manager. Laboratories may aspire to be accredited to one of the standards for environmental management, such as the ISO 14000. As environmental and quality issues are linked, the improvement in the environmental management of an organisation will ultimately lead to improved quality system performance. Indeed, environmental management could conceivably come under overall quality management. Although there will be initial costs, good environmental practices can bring savings. Environmental improvement should be based on the 3 R concept to reduce, reuse and recycle. Several policy initiatives may be introduced. These include a green purchasing policy for equipment, <b>laboratory</b> <b>furniture</b> and reagents as well as the management of packaging wastes. There are several ways to reduce energy, water usage and wastage. A reduction of test numbers and collection tubes should be attempted. Paper management involves all aspects of 3 R.

40|$|Abstract Background Enteric Redmouth (ERM) disease {{also known}} as Yersiniosis is a {{contagious}} disease affecting salmonids, mainly rainbow trout. The causative agent is the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia ruckeri. The disease can be diagnosed by isolation and identification of the causative agent, or detection of the Pathogen using fluorescent antibody tests, ELISA and PCR assays. These diagnostic methods are laborious, time consuming and need well trained personnel. Results A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for detection of Y. ruckeri the etiological agent of enteric red mouth (ERM) disease in salmonids. The assay was optimised to amplify the yruI/yruR gene, which encodes Y. ruckeri quorum sensing system, {{in the presence of}} a specific primer set and Bst DNA polymerase at an isothermal temperature of 63 °C for one hour. Amplification products were detected by visual inspection, agarose gel electrophoresis and by real-time monitoring of turbidity resulted by formation of LAMP amplicons. Digestion with Hph I restriction enzyme demonstrated that the amplified product was unique. The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplification products when tested against related bacteria. The assay had 10 -fold higher sensitivity compared with conventional PCR and successfully detected Y. ruckeri not only in pure bacterial culture but also in tissue homogenates of infected fish. Conclusion The ERM-LAMP assay represents a practical alternative to the microbiological approach for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of Y. ruckeri in fish farms. The assay is carried out in one hour and needs only a heating block or water bath as <b>laboratory</b> <b>furniture.</b> The advantages of the ERM-LAMP assay make it a promising tool for molecular detection of enteric red mouth disease in fish farms. </p...|$|E

Investment in education can help bring about economic growth, improve productivity, contribute to social and national development and lead to reduction in social inequality. This study was therefore to affirm the above sentiments by confirming whether physical resources in any way relate to internal efficiency in secondary schools of Tana River County. The study specifically sought to establish the relationship between physical resources and internal efficiency of public secondary schools in Tana River County in terms of number of classrooms, <b>laboratories,</b> textbooks, <b>furniture,</b> toilets/latrines, and electricity among others. The research particularly sought to determine the magnitude of inefficiency in form of dropout, repetition, and completion and aimed at providing possible solutions in relation to physical resources to minimize wastage in secondary schools and establish corrective measures that can minimize dropouts and repetition. The study was guided by the cost benefit analysis theory which aims at achieving optimal output. This theory stresses that the out-put of any investment should be correlated with the in-put {{in order to assess}} profitability. The objectives of the study were to assess the adequacy of physical resources in development and enhancing internal efficiency in public secondary schools, to find out the relationship between physical resources and dropout rate, {{to examine the relationship between}} physical resources and repetition rate of public secondary schools in Tana river County, to find the relationship between physical resources and completion rate and finally to develop complimentary policies and interventions related to physical resources that can reduce wastage in public secondary schools of Tana river County. The study was conducted using a descriptive survey and correlation research designs and the data was collected using questionnaires, interview guide and documentary analysis from 15 secondary schools which were visited by the researcher; 1 County Director of Education, 3 District Education officers, 15 Principals and 30 teachers were contacted with the Principals being purposively selected and teachers selected randomly from the accessible population. Data generated was analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative data from interview schedule and questionnaires was analyzed thematically based on research objectives. Data from documents analysis and numerical data generated from interview schedules with key informants was analyzed using mean, frequency counts and percentages. Chi-square test was used to establish relationships between physical resources, dropout, repetition, and completion rates. On the first objective, the study found out that school in Tana River County had inadequate physical resources and that those available were in poor condition. On objective two, the study found out that there was no relationship between dropout rates and condition of physical resources. On objective three and four the study found out that there was positive significant relationship between repetition, completion rates and condition of physical resources. The research also revealed that the secondary education system in Tana River County as at the period of study was inefficient with a mean dropout rate of 16. 0. On the basis of findings, the study concluded that physical resources are positively correlated with internal efficiency of public secondary schools in Tana river County. It was therefore recommended that for realization of internal efficiency, there was need to equip schools in Tana River County with the necessary physical resources, adequate mechanisms and procedures for ensuring retention and high completion rates in schools. Finally, the researcher suggested that schools should be given funds directly for them to have a chance of prioritizing and acquiring essential physical resources based on their specific needs...|$|R
40|$|The mobile phone, {{which is}} one kind of human {{communication}} tools, is stillenabling the progression of evolution. The next generation of the mobile phone systemwhich can support substantially communication with a high data speed (100 Mbps ormore) is investigated. When high-speed communication is utilized, for example the TV phone which hasthe reality with high quality becomes possible; the new human communication interfacecan be provided. In addition, the next generation communication services are alsoexpected. The MIMO technologies which use the multiple spatial channels at same frequencyhave a potential to substantially increase the data bit rate. Therefore, the compactMIMO antennas become necessary for the portable terminals whose miniaturization isimportant. Especially, the wearable equipment that will be inevitable for future humancommunications has to be light and thin. However, for portable terminals which have avery small space between antenna elements may cause degradation in the performance. In this research, the realistic compact MIMO antenna for portable terminals isstudied to improve performance and increase {{the capacity of the}} wirelesscommunication. The performance of the MIMO antenna configurations are evaluatedbased on experimental measurements and simulation including correlation, bandwidth,return loss, mutual coupling and channel capacity. According to the next generation wireless communication systems which willoperate over 2 GHz and the wireless LAN frequency is 2. 4 GHz band, the experimentalfrequency chosen for this study is 2. 4 GHz band. The mender line ceramic chip antenna was used as the basic antenna element formaking compact MIMO antenna due to its small size and mountable on circuit board. When antenna elements are located very closely, the correlation between thembecomes high, thus the MIMO efficiency and channel capacity decrease. To overcomethis degradation, the cross polarized configurations is also investigated to reducecorrelation as well as the co-polarized configurations. Both of the separated ground plane type MIMO antenna (SG) and the commonground plane MIMO antenna (CG) are studied to compare in term of their size andperformance. The MIMO technology is used under the multipath propagation environmentwhere reflection and the diffraction by the obstacles, such as building. The experimentswere carried out in the <b>laboratory</b> where <b>furniture</b> is fulfilled and the direct path betweentransmitter and receiver antenna was obstructed so as to simulate ideal fadingcircumstance. When the mobile phone is used for a talk, the antenna has approached near ahuman head and influence of the human body is supposed. The body effect is alsoevaluated using a phantom head which contains mixed salt and water. From the experimental results, it concluded that Even the antenna elements spacing is lower than 0. 1 wavelength, thecorrelation between them is kept low comparing the theoretical valuewhich was calculated at 2 dimensions. This is feasible characteristics. The cross polarized configurations give better performance in term of thecorrelation and mutual coupling. The co-polarized ground plane MIMO antenna has a compact size and lowcorrelation but its mutual coupling is very tight. The mutual coupling has large effect on radiation loss, thus channelcapacity decreases. In addition, relationship between antenna size and efficiency became clear. Withthe smallest size antenna configuration, dimension of the co-polarized common groundplane MIMO antenna with antenna spacing 0. 05 are 0. 06 × 0. 25 × 0. 46 and canbe obtained capacity about 70 % of the ideal.
