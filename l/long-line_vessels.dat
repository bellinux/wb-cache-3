40|$|A {{theoretical}} model with nonlinear discarding costs is constructed to describe highgrading in a fishery with an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) program. The model shows that ITQs provide incentives to discard fish when the hold {{capacity of the}} vessel is nonbinding. An empirical model is developed to test for highgrading and to predict the discarded quantities of different grades of fish. This model {{is applied to the}} Icelandic ITQ-regulated cod fishery. Net and <b>long-line</b> <b>vessels</b> are involved in highgrading and the quota price induces highgrading for net vessels. The predicted total discarded quantities are 4. 7 % and 2. 7 % of total landings for net and <b>long-line</b> <b>vessels,</b> respectively. Long-line and net vessels are predicted to discard 18 % and 76 % of their small cod catch, suggesting that resource managers should focus on net vessels. These discard rates correspond well with biometric estimates, suggesting that economic modeling is a useful alternative method. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|ENGLISH: This paper {{constitutes}} {{a study of}} the fishery by Japanese <b>long-line</b> <b>vessels</b> in the area to the eastward of longitude 130 °W, which was initiated at the western margin of this region in late 1956 and early 1957, and which has expanded fairly quickly eastward through 1962. The major part of the data was collected by the Nankai Regional Fisheries Research Laboratory (NRFRL) from fishing vessels landing at Tokyo and Yaizu and by the Kanagawa Perfectural Fisheries Experimental Station from fishing vessels landing at Misaki.

At present the Fiji ground is restricted roughly to the area extending from 170 °E. to 170 °W. and from 18 °S. to 30 °S. The hooked-rate obtained from operations of the <b>long-line</b> <b>vessels</b> has been used as the index of population density of tunas. Having tried to estimate are approximate confidence limit of the mean hooked-rate, the following results were obtained : as shown in Fig. 2, the equation for the relation between the number of fishes caught by unit fishing effort and fishing intensity will thus follow the general form N≒K・x (N, number of fishes; x, number of hooks expended). From the above supposition, the stock of albacore in the Fiji area in this period {{does not seem to be}} caused any influence by more fishing...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} in 1979 {{of the joint}} venture (Irish-Spanish) fishing fleet, Eiranova, introduced to the industry in Ireland a range of target species and fishing grounds on which the Irish demersal fishery has subsequently expanded. From {{the second quarter of}} 1985 the European Communities' Logbook has provided a format on which landings and details of fishing effort have been recorded. This leaflet reviews the catches of various species per effort expended by joint venture demersal trawl and <b>long-lining</b> <b>vessels</b> for the eight years documented by the Logsheets. The high value components of the trawl fishery are the prime fish (hake, monkfish and megrim) which are exported fresh to Spain. Hake is the principal target of long-liners. The fishery is concentrated in ICES statistical Divisions VIIb and VIIj. Since 1985, the CPUE of all species has declined by 39 % and the trend in prime fish landings runs in parallel with this, mainly because of the reduction in hake landings. CPUE indices for all other species which are consistently recorded are given. Some comparisons are made among CPUE indices in Divisions VIlb, j and adjoining areas. However, these indices depend much on the exploited size range of a target species and the area in which fishing effort is concentrated and the bulk of the data are presented without further comment.

40|$|Non-traditional {{maritime}} security concerns {{have become more}} important than ever in the post-Cold War era. Naval forces of most developed countries are more concerned about these threats than conventional war. One of the main {{maritime security}} issues for many countries in the world is illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the marine area. With these burgeoning issues comes the potential for a large number of disputes involving international law. In early 2002, a <b>long-line</b> fishing <b>vessel</b> under a Russian flag - the Volga, was detained by Australian authorities a few hundred meters outside the Exclusive Economic Zone of Australia’s Heard and McDonald Islands in the Southern Ocean. The vessel was reportedly engaged in illegal fishing. This incident gave birth to litigation in international and Australian courts. Apart from these cases, Russia also announced separate litigation against Australia for violation of Articles 111 and 87 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Considering the outcome of these cases, this article critically examines the characteristics of litigation as a strategy for pacific settlement of disputes over marine living resources. Using the Volga Case as an example, this article explores some issues related to the judicial settlement of disputes over marine living resources. This article demonstrates that the legal certainty of winning a case may not be the only factor influencing the strategy for settlement of an international dispute. 27 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Fishers in quota-regulated {{fisheries}} find it {{to their}} advantage to discard less valuable fish at sea to increase {{the value of their}} catch. A theoretical model describing the high-grading behavior of fishers is presented, and an empirical model is derived as well as a testing strategy to test for high-grading and to estimate the discarded amount of each grade. The model is applied to data for the Icelandic quota regulated cod fishery during the period September 1998 to June 2001. The results indicate that highgrading occurs in the Icelandic cod fishery for both <b>long-line</b> and net <b>vessels.</b> However, the discard rates are small, and the results clearly suggest that the ban on discards in Iceland has effectively dealt with high-grading. The estimated discard rates are consistent with existing estimates of high-grading for the same types of vessel in the same fishery. This suggests that the modeling of discarding decisions based purely on incentives is a useful alternative to classical biometric methods.

5000|$|Spearfishing with barbed {{harpoons}} {{along the}} sea coast was widespread by the Palaeolithic. Fish ponds surrounded Sumerian temples by 2&thinsp;500 BC and a Chinese classical text credited to the 5th-century BC businessman Fan Li is {{the earliest known}} work on fish farming. A surviving fragment of Isidore of Charax's 1st-century Parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the Persian Gulf, and Oppian's 2nd-century Halieutics relates the four main Greek and Roman fishing methods as hook-and-line, netting, passive traps, and trident. Traditional fishing boats operate in near-shore waters but, during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period, fishing on the open sea—particularly cod—became important to the economic and naval development of Northern Europe, New England, and Canada. Overfishing along the coasts of the North Sea spurred the development of deep-sea fishers such as the Brixham and otter trawlers, which might serve as motherships for longlining dories; in the 19th century, advances such as rail transport, canning, and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full-fledged industry. Improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and, during the 1950s, great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season. By the 1960s, the North Atlantic and North Pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation. After the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons (20 million tons) in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons ( [...] million tons) by the late 1980s, it has remained essentially constant since. Chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production, from 7% of the world total in 1961 to 35% by 2010. Scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions: {{the collapse of the}} Grand Banks cod fishery to less than 1% of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by Canada in 1992 and China has enforced a zero-growth policy in its wild catch since 2000, redirecting its industry towards aquaculture; its annual months-long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the South China Sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states.As of 2006, there were an estimated 43.5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood, 85.5% of whom lived in Asia. About [...] were fishers and the remainder fish farmers. In 2012, total global production of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons (174 million tons), of which 91.3 million metric tons (100 million tons) were caught in the wild. This is also a record if ignoring the Peruvian anchovy, whose population can vary dramatically with the El Niño cycle. The overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild. The exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the UNCLOS regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems over the most productive regions of the sea, accounting for around 87% of the annual harvest. The results are sometimes dramatic—the lull in fishing {{over the course of the}} First World War saw the North Sea's 1919 catch double 1913's—and sometimes much less so: two decades on, the levels of cod in the Grand Banks remain only 10% of their peak. At present, the species most frequently landed are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and salmon. A number of these, as well as large predatory fish, remain well below historical levels.Over 3 million vessels are employed in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, <b>long-line</b> factory <b>vessels,</b> and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.As well as the wild stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food products were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|R
