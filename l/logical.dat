5|$|A {{physical}} USB device may {{consist of}} several <b>logical</b> sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as device functions. A single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). This kind of device is called a composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each <b>logical</b> device a distinctive address and all <b>logical</b> devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.|$|E
5|$|Commutativity is a {{property}} of some <b>logical</b> connectives of truth functional propositional logic. The following <b>logical</b> equivalences demonstrate that commutativity is {{a property}} of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional tautologies.|$|E

5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense is a <b>logical</b> {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, {{and published in}} its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is a defense against the <b>logical</b> problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the <b>logical</b> problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.|$|E

5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the <b>logical</b> positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the <b>logical</b> positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a <b>logical</b> positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a <b>logical</b> positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, after which <b>logical</b> positivism defined the field for several decades. <b>Logical</b> positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded <b>logical</b> positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{platforms}} 11, 12, 13 and 10 were renumbered {{into the}} more <b>logical</b> sequence 10, 11, 12, 13.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and <b>logical,</b> arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a <b>logical,</b> deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E

5|$|When Peano {{formulated}} his axioms, {{the language}} of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of <b>logical</b> notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was {{the genesis of the}} modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and <b>logical</b> symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his <b>logical</b> apparatus {{based on the work of}} Boole and Schröder.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict {{might have been}} related {{to the fact that}} the {{periphery}} of the empire was now becoming central to its existence, and the granting of citizenship may have been simply a <b>logical</b> outcome of Rome's continued expansion of citizenship rights.|$|E

5|$|Critics of the <b>logical</b> {{approach}} noted, as Dreyfus had, {{that human}} beings rarely used logic when they solved problems. Experiments by psychologists like Peter Wason, Eleanor Rosch, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and others provided proof.|$|E
5|$|Early A320s {{used the}} Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010. In 1988, the flight {{management}} computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three <b>logical</b> pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.|$|E
5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the <b>logical</b> problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the <b>logical</b> problem of evil was unsound.|$|E
5|$|However, during Act V, {{there is}} no mention of Egeus, nor does he have a {{speaking}} role. It is <b>logical,</b> however, that he would have been in attendance since it is also his daughter Hermia's wedding that the group if there to celebrate.|$|E
5|$|Intended {{to be the}} <b>logical</b> {{continuation}} of the FreeBSD 4.x series, DragonFly's development has diverged significantly from FreeBSD's, including a new Light Weight Kernel Threads (LWKT) implementation, a lightweight ports/messaging system, and feature-rich HAMMER file system. Many concepts planned for DragonFly were inspired by the AmigaOS operating system.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>logical</b> flaws {{were found}} in COBOL 60, leading GE's Charles Katz to warn {{that it could not}} be {{interpreted}} unambiguously. A reluctant short-term committee enacted a total cleanup and, by March 1963, it was reported that COBOL's syntax was as definable as ALGOL's, although semantic ambiguities remained.|$|E

5|$|Subjects may be {{instructed}} not {{to judge}} {{whether or not the}} sentence is grammatically acceptable or <b>logical,</b> but whether the proposition expressed by the sentence is true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.|$|E
5|$|The Acurad system {{employed}} a bottom fill system {{that required a}} stable flow-front. <b>Logical</b> thought processes and trial and error were used because computerized analysis did not exist yet; however this modeling was the precursor to computerized flow and fill modeling.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{provided}} a unified {{account of the}} world, consisting of formal logic, monistic physics and naturalistic ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as {{the main focus of}} human knowledge, though their <b>logical</b> theories were of more interest for later philosophers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>logical</b> {{positivism}} movement {{originated in}} the Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the <b>logical</b> positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E

25|$|While {{many other}} vendors have {{continued}} to utilize a single-sector setup (<b>logical</b> sector 0 only) for the bootstrap loader, Microsoft's boot sector code has grown to span over <b>logical</b> sectors 0 and 2 since the introduction of FAT32, with <b>logical</b> sector 0 depending on sub-routines in <b>logical</b> sector 2. The Backup Boot Sector area consists of three <b>logical</b> sectors 6, 7, and 8 as well. In some cases, Microsoft also uses sector 12 of the reserved sectors area for an extended boot loader.|$|E

25|$|In general, a <b>logical</b> {{antecedent}} is {{a sufficient}} condition, and a <b>logical</b> consequent {{is a necessary}} condition(or the contingency) in a <b>logical</b> conditional. But <b>logical</b> conditionals accounting only for necessity and sufficiency do not always reflect every day if-then reasoning, {{and for this reason}} they are sometimes known as material conditionals. In contrast, indicative conditionals, sometimes known as non-material conditionals, attempt to describe if-then reasoning involving hypotheticals, fictions, or counterfactuals.|$|E
25|$|Several {{registers}} {{could be}} read onto the read bus simultaneously. When this occurred, data from each register was inclusive-ORed onto the bus. This inclusive-OR feature was used to implement the Mask instruction, which was a <b>logical</b> AND operation. Because the AGC had no native ability to do a <b>logical</b> AND, but could do a <b>logical</b> OR through the bus and could complement (invert) data through the C register, De Morgan's theorem was used to implement {{the equivalent of a}} <b>logical</b> AND. This was accomplished by inverting both operands, performing a <b>logical</b> OR through the bus, and then inverting the result.|$|E

25|$|The <b>logical</b> {{instructions}} {{consist of}} those for performing bitwise <b>logical</b> operations and conditional moves on the integer registers. The bitwise <b>logical</b> instructions perform AND, NAND, NOR, OR, XNOR, and XOR between two registers or a register and literal. The conditional move instructions test a register as a signed quadword to zero and move if the specified condition is true. The specified conditions are equality, inequality, {{less than or}} equal to, less than, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The shift instructions perform arithmetic right shift, and <b>logical</b> left and right shifts. The shift amount is given by a register or literal. <b>Logical</b> and shift instructions use the integer operate instruction formats.|$|E

For example, in every <b>logical</b> system capable of expressing the Peano axioms, the Gödel sentence holds for the natural numbers but cannot be proved.|$|E
