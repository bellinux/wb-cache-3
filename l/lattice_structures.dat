It has been assumed that the timber lattice arch truss design was based on American steel <b>lattice</b> <b>structures.</b> However, Emil Brizay, a French engineer refugee from Singapore {{in the office of}} MR Hornibrook is also credited with designing the construction system on which the igloo was modelled. The igloos at Eagle Farm were one of several designs for lightweight long span structures which utilised timber in small sectional sizes of chords to enable the lattice trusses to be hand nailed in jigs on site and speedily erected at low cost.|$|E

40|$|We {{extracted}} an R-form lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the phenol-water method from Klebsiella sp. strain LEN- 111 (O 3 -:KI-) {{and followed}} the changes in ultrastructure of the LPS during the extraction procedure. When the LPS {{was obtained from the}} water phase of an extract by addition of 2 volumes of 10 mM MgCI 2 -ethanol, it consisted of membrane pieces with a hexagonal <b>lattice</b> <b>structure</b> with a <b>lattice</b> constant of 14 to 15 nm. The <b>lattice</b> <b>structure</b> of the LPS was disrupted into short rods with sodium dodecyl sulfate, but the same hexagonal <b>lattice</b> <b>structure</b> was again formed by precipitation with 2 volumes of 10 mM MgCI 2 -ethanol. The LPS preparation after two cycles of treatment by the phenol-water method, which contained no detectable amounts of proteins, kept an unaltered ability to form the hexagonal <b>lattice</b> <b>structure.</b> Extensive treatment with pronase and extraction with chloroform did not impair the ability of the LPS preparation to form the <b>lattice</b> <b>structure.</b> When the other salts, NaCI, CaCI 2 or Zn(CH 3 COO) 2, were used for precipitation of the LPS with ethanol in place of MgCI 2, the LPS did not form the hexagonal <b>lattice</b> <b>structure.</b> However, if the LPS precipitated with NaCI-ethanol was converted to the magnesium salt form after it was electrodialyzed, it formed the same hexagonal <b>lattice</b> <b>structure</b> as the LPS precipitated with MgCI 2 -ethanol.
