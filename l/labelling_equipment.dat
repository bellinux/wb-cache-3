40|$|The {{object to}} be {{attained}} is increase of productivity {{and reliability of}} vacuum prepacking, packing and labellign machines. The analitical model of the vacuum drive operation, the graph-analytical model of the vacuum capture operation, the analytical and statistical models of the receiver operation, simulation models "Vacuum equipment - operators" have been developed. The formulas of productivity of vacuum packing machines, the formula of pumping-out duration, the equation of regression for optimization of the vacuum syrop meters have been obtained. The unit of vacuum prepacking, packing and labelling machnines has been created; the sorting device and device for ergotechnical measures have been manufactured. The documentation for modernization of the packing and labelling machines has been partially elaborated. The engineering procedures for calculation and adjustment of the systems of automation of the prepacking, packing and <b>labelling</b> <b>equipment</b> have been proposed. The prototypes and laboratory mock-ups have been introduced.

50|$|Introduction - Magnetic {{particle}} clutches {{are unique}} in their design, from other electro-mechanical clutches {{because of the}} wide operating torque range available. Like a standard, single face clutch, torque to voltage is almost linear. However, in a magnetic particle clutch torque can be controlled very accurately. This makes these units ideally suited for tension control applications, such as wire winding, foil, film, and tape tension control. Because of their fast response, {{they can also be}} used in high cycle application, such as card readers, sorting machines, and <b>labeling</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R

50|$|Sales grew in {{the years}} after the take over, {{reaching}} close to $75 million by 1978. That year Oxford Pendaflex, backed by parent company Esselte, took over the California company Dymo Industries, which was well known for its Dymotape <b>labeling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Dymo had revenues of close to $210 million, {{and more than half of}} its sales came from foreign operations. Esselte AB already distributed some of the Dymo line in Europe, and it paid out $43.5 million for the company. Although Dymo initially resisted the takeover, by July 1978 Oxford Pendaflex controlled 94 percent of Dymo's stock. Oxford took over the Dymo product lines, which included Ideal accounting books and the Sten-C-Labl addressing system in addition to Dymotape.|$|R
