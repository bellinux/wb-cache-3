500|$|Chronic {{poisoning}} usually presents {{with symptoms}} affecting multiple systems, but {{is associated with}} three main types of symptoms: gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neurological. Central nervous system and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods. Signs of chronic exposure include loss of short-term memory or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A [...] "lead hue" [...] of the skin with pallor and/or <b>lividity</b> is another feature. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children with chronic poisoning may refuse to play or may have hyperkinetic or aggressive behavior disorders. Visual disturbance may present with gradually progressing blurred vision {{as a result of}} central scotoma, caused by toxic optic neuritis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{end of life}} is at {{the origin}} of several {{modifications}} of the body which is associated {{to a series of}} modifications, including <b>lividities,</b> rigidity, dehydratation, cyanosis, swelling, discoloration, change of internal pH, olfactive productions, infectious incidents [...] .). Therefore, the human body constitutes a potential danger for hygiene and public health. Thanatopraxia or arterial embalming corresponds to techniques achieved to delay the degradation of the body and to ensure the processing and its conservation. This can be done specifically by the injection in the arterial system of a disinfectant and a preservative product containing both formol and methanol. It also ensures the evacuation of the liquids and gases contained in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Usually this operation is done after the autopsy, but if it takes place before, it is likely to create serious problems associated with toxicological investigations. Drugs in the body are subjected {{at the same time to}} the variations of pH which can produce hydrolysis. During thanathopraxia, formol will react with amino functions, and can introduce a dilution factor after injection. Methods and results: Within the framework of this study, we have reviewed the literature about the influence of thanatopraxia on a certain number of psychotropic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, S. S. R. I, growth regulators, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, narcotics). Typical cases from the authors achieved after arterial embalming are also presented. Conclusion: It results from this study that the diagnosis of poisoning remains possible even after arterial embalming using formolized solutions. Several therapeutic drugs can be detected in tissues despite that their concentrations have decreased during the post-embalming period by instability, transformation, degradation or dilution. However, the major problem remains the interpretation of the results and particular care should be maintained...|$|R

50|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{transient condition}} is livor mortis, the purplish pooling of blood {{within the body}} after the heart has stopped beating. Emergency responders are instructed to recognize {{it as a sign}} that CPR should not be attempted. Investigators may use it to determine if a body has been moved or repositioned after death. Livor mortis starts 20 minutes to 3 hours after death and is congealed in the capillaries in 4 to 5 hours. Maximum <b>lividity</b> occurs within 6-12 hours.|$|E
5000|$|It Dies Today (sometimes {{abbreviated}} [...] "IDT") is an American metalcore {{band that}} formed in Buffalo, New York during September 2001.

After frontman Nicholas Brooks departed in 2006, just after the release of the band's sophomore effort Sirens, It Dies Today released <b>Lividity</b> in 2009 before going on an indefinite hiatus in 2010. However, with Brooks' return in 2012, the band have re-formed and have begun recording new material again.|$|E
50|$|Livor mortis {{starts in}} 20-30 minutes, but {{is usually not}} {{observable}} by the human eye until two hours after death. The size of the patches increases {{in the next three}} to six hours, with maximum <b>lividity</b> occurring between eight and twelve hours after death. The blood pools into the interstitial tissues of the body. The intensity of the color depends upon the amount of reduced haemoglobin in the blood. The discoloration does not occur in the areas of the body that are in contact with the ground or another object, in which capillaries are compressed.|$|E
5000|$|Livor mortis (Latin: livor—"bluish color," [...] mortis—"of death"), postmortem <b>lividity</b> (Latin: postmortem—"after death", lividity—"black and blue"), {{hypostasis}} (Greek: hypo, meaning [...] "under, beneath"; stasis, meaning [...] "a standing") or suggillation, is {{the fourth}} stage {{and one of the}} signs of death. It is a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body post mortem, causing a purplish red discoloration of the skin. When the heart stops functioning and is no longer agitating the blood, heavy red blood cells sink through the serum by action of gravity.|$|E

[...] Shortly after death, within three to six hours, the muscular tissues become rigid and incapable of relaxing, during a stage called rigor mortis. Since blood is no longer being pumped through the body, gravity causes it to drain to the dependent portions of the body, creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed livor mortis or, more commonly, <b>lividity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Considered Dead is {{the debut}} {{full-length}} album by Canadian death metal band Gorguts.

50|$|The {{deceased}} {{is placed}} on the mortuary table in the supine anatomical position with the head elevated by a head block. The first step in embalming is to check that the individual is in fact deceased (to avoid premature burial), and then verify the identity of the body (normally via wrist or leg tags). At this point, embalmers commonly perform basic tests for signs of death, noting things such as clouded-over corneas, <b>lividity,</b> and rigor mortis, or by simply attempting to palpate a pulse in the carotid or radial artery. In modern times, people awakening on the preparation table is largely the province of horror fiction and urban legend.|$|E

This instruction included both physical elements and basic language and math skills. Zartan's unique biology gave him the ability to change his appearance and skin tone, a skill which Taggac attempted to keep secret from Cobra.

Speckmann then focused on several other projects, including the resurrected Abomination and eventually joined the Czech band Krabathor, for which Speckmann relocated to the Czech Republic. In 2002 the next album was released, titled Let's Start a War on System Shock, which also contracted Krabathor. In 2004 Spirit of the West followed. Master then switched labels again, to the German label Twilight Vertrieb and released Four More Years of Terror in 2005. The album Slaves to Society was released in May 2007.

40|$|Examination {{of sudden}} infant death {{syndrome}} (SIDS) deaths in South Australia over a 7 -year period from 2000 to 2006 was undertaken. There were 32 out of 35 cases where details of position when found were known. The data confirmed a marked decline in deaths in the prone position over the past decade, but showed no significant decline in cases reportedly found dead in the supine position. Posterior <b>lividity</b> was present in most cases (n = 30), 10 of whom also had anterior <b>lividity.</b> Posterior <b>lividity</b> was attributable either to the position of the body after death or to the effect of supine postmortem storage. In six cases, however, fixed anterior <b>lividity</b> indicated that death had occurred in the prone position despite statements that the infants had been found on the side (n = 1) and in the supine position (n = 5). This contradiction indicates that caregivers' descriptions of terminal sleeping positions may not be supported by autopsy findings. The numbers of SIDS deaths reported in the supine position in South Australia may not, therefore, represent a genuine tally, but instead may be a function of inaccurate reporting. This may act as a confounding factor in studies attempting to link sleeping position with other risk factors. Roger W. Byard and Lisbeth L. Jense...|$|E
40|$|Post-mortem {{hypostasis}} develops due to passive settling of {{the blood}} under the effect of gravity after death. Due to consumption of oxygen in the tissues by residual cellular activity after the circulation has stopped, <b>lividity</b> is composed of deoxygenated blood. It has been previously shown that cooling of a body causes <b>lividity</b> to oxygenate, changing from a dark red/blue to a pink/red color, due to hemoglobin’s increased affinity for oxygen at low temperature. This study has confirmed that this occurs by passive diffusion through the skin, but that this can only occur within a limited time frame. The reasons for this process and its potential forensic application require further investigation. Hannah Watchman, G. Stewart Walker, Lise L. Randeberg, Neil E. I. Langloi...|$|E
30|$|In the {{reported}} dyadic deaths, {{the pattern of}} postmortem <b>lividity,</b> {{as well as the}} appearance of ligature mark distinctly, varied between the deceased males and female. The post mortem <b>lividity</b> was distributed in ‘glove and stocking’ pattern over the extremities and was fixed in the female victim while the <b>lividity</b> on the male body was present {{over the back of the}} body and was not fixed. Though the ligature materials used in both the cases were cotton cloth material, the appearance of ligature mark around the neck was significantly different too. The appearance of ligature mark around the neck is influenced by many factors including the type of ligature material, weight of the body, duration of suspension, etc. Distinct grooved ligature mark in the female was suggestive of prolonged suspension while an inconspicuous and faint ligature mark in male indicated the contrary. It is highly likely that the knot of the ligature noose in the male victim loosened and opened up after some time of the suspension due to the weight of the body, as suggested by the relative position of the male victim on the floor and the cloth material freely hanging from the roof above it. The effects of body weight on ligature material and suspension can be deceptive (Kanchan et al. 2010).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{reviewed}} 17 intentional ingestions of cyanide {{that occurred}} in New York City over a ten-year interval. The toxicologic and postmortem findings were reviewed. Certain occupations and nationalities of the decedents predominated among this group of suicides. Scientists, jewelers, and metal workers were common occupations among the decedents. In addition, 8 of 17 fatalities were West Indian/Caribbean Island and South American decedents, including three decedents from Guyana. Fourteen of the 17 fatalities were male. Pink <b>lividity,</b> a “bitter-almond ” smell, and a hemorrhagic gastric mucosa were not prevailing findings in these decedents.

40|$|The {{number of}} deaths from carbon {{monoxide}} intoxication by burning barbecue charcoal has increased in recent years particularly in Asia and even in Germany {{the number of cases}} has risen. A total of nine deaths were documented at the institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg in the period from September 2009 to October 2010. It can be assumed that seven cases were suicide, one case might have been accidental and one case is unclear. Of the decedents seven were male. Cherry red <b>lividity</b> as an indication for carbon monoxide intoxication was not found in all cases. In this context the post-mortem examination as well as the scene investigation should be performed very carefully because principally it is possible for a suicide to be overlooked as well as simulated. The determination of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) should be performed regularly. Furthermore forensic autopsy can provide information as to possible third party involvement...|$|E
30|$|Results: Fatal carbon {{monoxide}} intoxication {{is the leading cause}} of toxic death in Sfax during the period of our study. We notice a decrease in the incidence of this type of intoxication. The average age of deaths was 36  years and 2  months with male predominance. The peak frequency of intoxication was in cold season. The most frequent form of intoxication was accidental. The source of {{carbon monoxide}} was mainly the defective water heater often placed in poorly ventilated areas. The classic carmine red-color of <b>lividity</b> was found in the majority of cases. Myocardial distress, favored by hypoxia, has been reported in two subjects with a pathological coronary artery. The mean HbCO level was 51.59 %. However, account must be taken of the survival time and the time elapsed between death and dosing of HbCO. The incidence of fatal {{carbon monoxide intoxication}} has decreased since 2011 and the victim profile has not changed too much.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{series of}} 51 fatal cases of {{accidental}} hypothermia in northern Sweden has been reviewed. The cases conform well to previous investigations {{with respect to}} {{the mean age of the}} victims (48 years) and a predominance of males. The cases occurred mainly during the winter months and on Saturdays. Most cases succumbed at temperatures below- 10 °C. The most fre-quent necropsy findings were areas of frostbite with purple discoloration of the skin, reddish <b>lividity</b> and superficial erosions of the gastric mucosa. Paradoxical undressing was present in more than half of the cases. About two thirds of the cases were under the influence of alcohol with a mean blood alcohol concentration of 1. 6 g/ 1. Furthermore, at least half of the cases could be con-sidered habitual drunkards. In conclusion, the present series shows two main groups of fatal hypothermia victims: one group of elderly persons, mostly chronic abusers and under the influence of alcohol (approximately two-thirds of the series), and another of younger and sober persons, performing recognised sporting activities (approximately one-fourth of the series) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Bruises on {{the upper}} arm in dead bodies are {{suspicious}} of being „grip marks“ {{as an indicator of}} violent crime. They are however found in non-forensic cases as well. Methods: 422 general forensic autopsy cases and 115 confirmed homicide cases were examined in regarding incidence, morphologic features and influential factors. Results: In general forensic autopsy cases findings were frequent (25, 8 %), pronounced in cases of physical care cases with shifting, shoring, supporting or erecting a patient from bed, pain stimulation and blood pressure measurement which 31 % had undergone. Physical care rate increased with age. A low-trauma subgroup (lethal intoxication, suicidal hanging) showed findings as well. Site and morphologic features allowed for only limited conclusions regarding the origin of findings. Cases of physical care often showed a mix of obviously fresh as well as aged bruises, with a more extended surface distribution. This might be due to prolonged, repeated trauma by various procedures, nursing or medical. A commonly observed preference for the middle third of the upper arm was accentuated in cases of physical care. Typical “grip marks” with a single bruise on the inner aspect (thumb) and multiple bruises on the lateral aspect (fingers) remained an exception. The general autopsy group contained only 14 children, with only 1 positive case (homicide). For homicide cases bruises {{on the upper}} arms were significantly more frequent (53 %) than in the general autopsy group, bruises were also found more frequently bilaterally. In initially survived assault the incidence was even higher, possibly due to medical treatment such as lifting and shifting for transportation, radiography and pain stimulation. In robbery cases bruises were also more frequent, with presumable escalation from threat to assault to killing. An elevated ratio of findings was found in lethal blunt force injury and force primarily directed against the head. Limited histological examinations can help to distinguish bruises from <b>lividity</b> or dermatological disorders, they failed to distinguish shortly survived bruises from post-mortem or “while dying” bruises. Conclusion: Therefore timely consultation of the forensic pathologist in survived assault is advised. The data at hand does not support bruises on the upper arm as defensive wounds, even though sometimes it should be considered (e. g. “infight”). Findings may potentially constitute an indicator for assault, however additional examinations are needed...|$|E
40|$|Death by {{hemorrhage}} {{can occur}} due to sharp or blunt force, {{but also as}} part of a pathological process. If arteries, veines or organs are injured, it can also lead to a lethal loss of blood. As well as the volume of blood lost, the bleeding localisation and the rapidity of the blood loss can also be relevant for a death by hemorrhage. In pathophysiological terms, the most important factor is the irreversible hypovolemic choc and the fast draining of the heart with the consequences that the brain is insufficiently oxygenated. The diagnostic death by hemorrhage is based on a localisation of the bleeding source, the volume of blood lost and the classical signs of a hemorrhage. The lethal internal blood loss volume can be measured only approximately during the autopsy. In research papers, the figures for a lethal internal blood loss volume level lie between 1. 2 l and 3 l. The aim {{of this study is to}} show how a death by hemorrhage is represented in different trauma groups with different patterns of injury and to demonstrate which factors are important in determining the volume of blood lost. The study consisted of 120 deceased people, among them 17 gunshot, 40 sharp injuries, 35 polytraumas and 28 cases with a single bleeding source. All of these cases could be put down to death by hemorraghe and showed relevant internal blood loss volumes. The autopsy records were evaluated and analysed in retrospect with reference to the following pieces of data: general data, data of blood volumes, bleeding sources, classical hemorrhage signs, pattern of injuries, possbile indications for competing causes of death, general status of health, survival time, external blood loss and any indications of resuscitation attempts. The internal blood loss volume without any competing cause of death averaged out at 1. 8 l. This implies an average blood loss of 39 % of the assumed whole corporal blood volume. In the presence of competing causes of death, the critical volume of blood loss was reduced up to 30 %. The gunshot injuries stand out in this study as the case with the highest levels of blood loss volumes. The lowest level of blood loss volumes were observed in polytrauma cases. The main bleeding source was major vessel injuries in all groups. In the most of the cases, the blood was measured as a liquid. The classical signs of hemorrhage were observed in descending order according to frequency: pallor with a low postmortem <b>lividity,</b> draining of the internal organs and a low filling of the vessels and heart cavities. Subendocardial hemorrhage wasnt a specific indication for death by hemorrhage. The most important factors with reference to the blood loss volume also formed part of the results of the study and were also listed in a descending order of importance: weight, resuscitation measures, age and circumstances of competing lethal causes. All factors could be validated as highly significant by regression analysis. This study analyses the different trauma groups and tries to identify the main factors for the internal blood loss volume. In order to reach more precise conclusions with respect to the trauma groups with different pattern of injuries, the main focus should be aimed at similar pattern of injuries in other studies with more cases. Although the formula for a coarse estimation of the internal blood loss volume has only been developed with several conditions, it would be interesting to prove the validity of such a formula...|$|E
