5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are {{not considered to be}} a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals {{that are part of the}} ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, she {{returned}} to her work on the report. She controversially published findings that held that the time period between two occupational levels, Level II (preceding Babylonian conquest by Nebuchadnezzar) and Level III (preceding Assyrian conquest by Sennacherib) was likely to be in the range of 100 years, rather than a decade, as Starkey had suggested. Although the majority held that Starkey's interpretation was more <b>likely,</b> <b>in</b> 1973 subsequent excavations vindicated her opinion.|$|E

5|$|Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the fragment appears to have been intentionally cut, most <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> modern times.

5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} both genetic and {{acquired}} causes, with interaction {{of these factors}} in many cases. Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours and problems in the brain {{as a result of}} a previous infection. In about 60% of cases the cause is unknown. Epilepsies caused by genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are more common among younger people, while brain tumors and strokes are more <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> older people.|$|E

5|$|In 25BC, an army under Aulus Terentius Varro Murena {{wiped out}} the Salassi in the Aosta Valley. At some time between 25 and 7BC – either {{following}} the Aosta campaign or, more <b>likely,</b> <b>in</b> {{the course of the}} conquest of Raetia in 15BC – a campaign also subjugated the Celtic tribes of the Valais and opened the Great St Bernard Pass.|$|E
5|$|In a small {{proportion}} of cases, the encephalopathy is caused directly by liver failure; this is more <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> acute liver failure. More commonly, especially in chronic liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy is triggered by an additional cause, and identifying these triggers can be important to treat the episode effectively.|$|E
5|$|In that year, he {{took the}} civil service exam, <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> Chang'an. He failed, to his {{surprise}} and that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style {{at the time was}} too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure, he went back to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.|$|E

5|$|Operation Tannenbaum, a {{military}} offensive intended to occupy all of Switzerland, most <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> co-operation with Italy (which itself desired the Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland), {{was in the}} planning stages during 1940-1941. Its implementation was seriously considered by the German military after the armistice with France, but it was definitively shelved after the start of Operation Barbarossa had directed the attention of the Wehrmacht elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{campus was}} devastated by {{a fire in}} 1912, which deepened the school's grave {{financial}} difficulties. In 1916, the state government took full control {{of the school and}} renamed it Maryland State College. Byrd became the assistant athletic director in 1918 and assisted in the consolidation with the professional colleges in Baltimore, which resulted {{in the creation of the}} University of Maryland. During this time, the team was referred as 'The Old Liners', most <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> reference to the state nickname.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{are most}} <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> the spring. Major tornado {{outbreaks}} affected parts of eastern North Carolina on March 28, 1984, and April 16, 2011. The month of May experiences the greatest rise in temperatures. During the spring, there are warm days and cool {{nights in the}} Piedmont. Temperatures are somewhat cooler {{in the mountains and}} warmer, particularly at night, near the coast. North Carolina's humidity is lowest in the spring.|$|E

5|$|When the Nationalists {{came into}} power in December 1928, Kent Hughes was {{appointed}} Cabinet Secretary and Government Whip but resigned his positions in July 1929, ostensibly in protest over a government subsidy to a freezing works company but more <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> {{reaction to the}} ongoing boneheadedness of his fellow parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|Winter storms {{limit the}} {{expansion}} of mockingbirds in its range.

5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and a shed was built in one corner. A slit trench was dug {{on the north side of}} the building, a rifle embrasure formed on the east side of the building, and a machine-gun position was dug out and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten years}} as the vicar, Wheelwright was {{suspended}} in 1633 following his attempt to sell his Bilsby ministry back to its patron to get funds to travel to New England. Instead of procuring the necessary funds, {{he was convicted of}} simony (selling church offices), and completely removed from his office. After his removal from Bilsby he was <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> Laceby in June 1633 where his daughter Elizabeth was baptized. He then preached for a short while at Belleau, Lincolnshire, but was soon silenced by the Anglican authorities for his Puritan opinions, and began making plans for his emigration from England. Wheelwright left England in 1636 with his second wife, her mother Susanna Hutchinson, and his five living children.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{cloudiness}} and rainshowers developed {{several hundred}} miles east-southeast of Bermuda on August 25, <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> association with a low-level disturbance that formed along a cold front. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while {{located on the}} southwestern end of an upper-level trough {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico, deep convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward, and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high. The system turned to a northwest drift, and began to slowly organize on August 30 while located a few hundred miles northeast of the Bahamas. A broad low-pressure area developed on August 31 though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25mph (32 to 40km/h) were reported in squalls. Conditions remained favorable for continued organization, and convection increased and persisted across the system. The system developed into Tropical Depression Five on September 1 after developing a low-level circulation while located about 140miles (225km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
