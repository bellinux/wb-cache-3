40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is {{a feature}} of dried wood that causes the wood to deform (cup) after re-sawing and {{equalising}} the moisture content. VTT has analysed <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> {{with the aid of}} the simulation model PEO and with experimental drying, conditioning and storage tests. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> cannot be predicted by the moisture content gradient alone. However, the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> gap after drying to a high final moisture content of 18 % is nearly identical to the calculated gap caused by cupping when the moisture gradients of the two halves of the test piece are equalised. 24 hours (proposed in ENV 14464) is too little time to show the total cupping when keeping the sliced specimens in a plastic bag. Thus the test according the standard doesn’t show the whole cupping tendency of, for example, panels when the moisture content is equalised after re-sawing the timber and planing the billets. Increasing the kiln drying rate increases the resulting <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> tendency. With effective conditioning at the drying temperature, or with steaming after cooling, it is possible to reduce or remove the <b>case</b> <b>hardening.</b> But at normal temperatures in end-use or storage of timber the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> diminishes very slowly, despite the equalising of the moisture content in the cross-sectio...|$|R

40|$|Dried {{plant food}} {{materials}} {{are one of}} the major contributors to the global food industry. Widening the fundamental understanding on different mechanisms of food material alterations during drying assists the development of novel dried food products and processing techniques. In this regard, <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> is an important phenomenon, commonly observed during the drying processes of plant food materials, which significantly influences the product quality and process performance. In this work, a recent meshfree-based numerical model of the authors is further improved and used to simulate the influence of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> on shrinkage characteristics of plant tissues during drying. In order to model fluid and wall mechanisms in each cell, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are used. The model is fundamentally more capable of simulating large deformation of multiphase materials, when compared with conventional grid-based modelling techniques such as Finite Element Methods (FEM) or Finite Difference Methods (FDM). <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is implemented by maintaining distinct moisture levels in the different cell layers of a given tissue. In order to compare and investigate different factors influencing tissue deformations under <b>case</b> <b>hardening,</b> four different plant tissue varieties (apple, potato, carrot and grape) are studied. The simulation results indicate that the inner cells of any given tissue undergo limited shrinkage and cell wall wrinkling compared to the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> outer cell layers of the tissues.

40|$|AbstractSteel alloys are the {{material}} that is most used in protective constructions today. The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. <b>Case</b> <b>hardened</b> products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by <b>case</b> <b>hardening.</b> Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> courses. A total of 11 <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple <b>hardening.</b> Before the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|R

Generally applied to near-finished components, the processes impart a high-hardness wear-resistant surface which, with sufficient depth, can also improve fatigue strength. Applications range from simple mild steel pressings to heavy-duty alloy-steel transmission components. The characteristics of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> are the surface hardness, effective case depth, and depth profile of the residual stress. The specified case depth varies for different applications. It is useful {{to be able to}} measure the case depth nondestructively to ensure the specification is met.;In the work outlined in this dissertation, the aim is to evaluate the properties of <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> parts nondestructively. The <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process produces a change in the electromagnetic properties of the steel components in the near surface region. Consequently, the electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability have different values near the surface compared with those of the substrate. It is assumed that the conductivity and permeability variation with depth is indicative of the hardness profile allowing the case depth to be estimated from electromagnetic measurements. A two-layer model is adopted to approximate the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> steel parts as a homogeneous substrate layer surrounded by a homogeneous surface layer with uniform thickness. Alternating current potential drop (ACPD) theoretical calculations have been performed and compared with experimental measurements for both <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> cylindrical rods and homogeneous metal plates.

40|$|The {{carburizing}} atmosphere {{during the}} <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process contains {{a large proportion}} of hydrogen. Due to the rapid diffusion of hydrogen a high amount of hydrogen can be absorbed by the carburizing component. The amount of absorbed hydrogen is dependent on some factors such as for example the carburizing time and component dimensions. Hydrogen diffused in material can then cause hydrogen embrittlement and in some cases cause cracking under a static load. This hydrogen must therefore be removed. High amounts of hydrogen diffuse out spontaneously at room temperature. Tempering accelerates the process. The aim {{of this study was to}} experimentally measure the amount of absorbed hydrogen after <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> and hydrogen content after storage at room temperature and also after tempering. The effect of the enriching gas in carburizing furnace on hydrogen absorption was investigated in this study. Three steel grades with different content of alloying elements were used in this investigation. Steel samples were <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> by gas carburizing and tempering. The hydrogen content analyses included the measurement of hydrogen content before <b>case</b> <b>hardening,</b> after <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> and after tempering using Leco-RHEN 602. Based on the results in this study it was concluded that all steel grades used in this investigation absorb hydrogen during <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> by gas carburizing. A major part of the absorbed hydrogen is then released by effusion after being stored at room temperature and during tempering. Around 50 % of the absorbed hydrogen content during gas carburizing is due to the presence of the enriching gas in the carburizing atmosphere. Around 50 % of hydrogen diffuses out of the steel specimens after one day.

However, variations in machinability are regularly observed when producing the same part out of different material batches. This leads to a non-robust production process with increased manufacturing costs as well as unforeseen stops and maintenance of machines. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying the effect of microstructure variations on machinability in <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steels. Different microstructures have been produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. The microstructure was altered {{as much as possible}} with respect to pearlite nodular size, pearlite morphology and amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite.

Therefore, the machinability ranking (with respect to tool wear) was performed with help of the Volvo Standard Machinability Test which is a short-term test. Additionally, chip breakability was evaluated and measurements of cutting forces and surface roughness were performed. The tests have shown that a <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel with larger pearlite nodular size (produced by a higher austenitizing temperature) provides better chip breakability but also an increased tool wear compared to a material with smaller pearlite nodular size. Hence, to achieve a more robust production process for <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steels, it might be necessary to include pearlite nodular size and/or amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite in the materials specification.

Traditionally, component samples are collected from the production line at specific intervals and destructively tested for case depth profile assessment.

This paper presents a novel nonlinear eddy current technique for assessing the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> profile {{based on the premise}} that the magnetic characteristic of the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> region is different from that of the host material. A custom electromagnetic excitation-sensor array is used to both apply sinusoidal excitations to the component and measure the nonlinear response at multiple excitation frequencies and spatial locations, taking advantage of the different penetration regions due to the skin depth phenomenon. Each response signal obtained from the component under test is compared with that from a reference component subjected to the same excitation.
