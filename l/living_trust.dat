25|$|For a <b>living</b> <b>trust,</b> the grantor may retain {{some level}} of control to the trust, such by {{appointment}} as protector under the trust instrument. Living trusts also, in practical terms, tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations. If a <b>living</b> <b>trust</b> fails, the property will usually be held for the grantor/settlor on resulting trusts, which in some notable cases, has had catastrophic tax consequences.|$|E
25|$|Trusts go by many {{different}} names, {{depending on the}} characteristics or {{the purpose of the}} trust. Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes, a single trust might accurately be described in several ways. For example, a <b>living</b> <b>trust</b> is often an express trust, which is also a revocable trust, and might include an incentive trust, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, {{there were}} tax {{advantages}} to living trusts in South Africa, {{although most of}} these advantages have been removed. Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage. With notable exceptions, assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries, the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust. Under the Insolvency Act (Act 24 of 1936), assets transferred into a <b>living</b> <b>trust</b> remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent {{at the time of}} transfer, or 24 months if he/she is insolvent at the time of transfer. After 24 months, creditors have no claim against assets in the trust, although they can attempt to attach the loan account, thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets. Assets can be transferred into the <b>living</b> <b>trust</b> by selling it to the trust (through a loan granted to the trust) or donating cash to it (any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax; 20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year).|$|E
50|$|Living trusts, {{as opposed}} to {{testamentary}} (will) trusts, may help a trustor avoid probate. Avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and <b>living</b> <b>trusts</b> have become very popular. Probate is potentially costly, and probate records are {{available to the public}} while distribution through a trust is private. Both <b>living</b> <b>trusts</b> and wills {{can also be used to}} plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability, by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will.|$|R

25|$|Under South African law <b>living</b> <b>trusts</b> are {{considered}} tax payers. Two types of tax apply to <b>living</b> <b>trusts,</b> namely income tax and {{capital gains tax}} (CGT). A trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 40% (individuals pay according to income scales, usually less than 20%). The trust's income can, however, be taxed {{in the hands of}} either the trust or the beneficiary. A trust pays CGT at the rate of 20% (individuals pay 10%). Trusts do not pay deceased estate tax (although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate, in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax).|$|R
25|$|Negative {{aspects of}} using a <b>living</b> <b>trust</b> {{as opposed to a}} will and probate include upfront legal expenses, the expense of trust administration, and a lack of certain safeguards. The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the {{one-time}} probate cost of 1 to 4% for probate, which applies {{whether or not there is}} a drafted will. Unlike trusts, wills must be signed by two to three witnesses, the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed. Legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedent's assets from mismanagement or embezzlement, such as requirements of bonding, insurance, and itemized accountings of probate assets.|$|E

2500|$|A {{trust is}} created by a settlor, who {{transfers}} title to {{some or all of}} his or her property to a trustee, who then holds title to that property in trust {{for the benefit of the}} beneficiaries.

It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role.

6000|$|At {{that point}} Abraham's trial finished. He had shewn the {{completeness}} of his faith by the completeness of his works, that is, by the completeness of his obedience. He had utterly given up all for God. He had submitted his will completely to God's will. He {{had said in}} heart, as our Blessed Lord said, [...] "Father, if it be possible, let this woe pass from me, nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt;" [...] and thus I say, he was justified by his works, by his actions; that is, by this faithful action he proved the faithfulness of his heart, as the Angel said to him, [...] "Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me:" [...] for as St. James says, [...] "Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou," [...] says he, [...] "how his faith wrought with his works;" [...] how his works were the tool or instrument which his faith used; and by his works his faith was brought to perfection, as a tree is brought to perfection when it bears fruit. [...] "And so," [...] St. James continues, [...] "the scripture was fulfilled, which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God. Ye see then," [...] he says, [...] "how that by works a man is justified," [...] or shewn to be righteous and faithful, [...] "and not by faith only;" [...] that is, not by the mere feeling of faith, for, as he says, [...] "as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." [...] For what is {{the sign of a}} being dead? It is its not being able to do anything, not being able to work; because there is no living and moving spirit in it. And what is the sign of a man's faith being dead? his faith not being able to WORK, because there is no living spirit in it, but it is a mere dead, empty shell and form of words,--a mere notion and thought about believing in a man's head, but not a <b>living</b> <b>trust</b> and loyalty to God in his heart. Therefore, says St. James, [...] "shew me thy faith without thy works," [...] if thou canst, [...] "and I will shew thee my faith by my works," [...] as Abraham did by offering up Isaac his son.|$|E
60|$|The Egyptian and Syrian Churches, therefore, {{were destined}} to labour not for themselves, but for us. The signs of disease and decrepitude were already but too {{manifest}} in them. That very peculiar turn of the Graeco-Eastern mind, which made them the great thinkers of the then world, {{had the effect of}} drawing them away from practice to speculation; and the races of Egypt and Syria were effeminate, over-civilised, exhausted by centuries during which no infusion of fresh blood had come to renew the stock. Morbid, self-conscious, physically indolent, incapable then, as now, of personal or political freedom, they afforded material out of which fanatics might easily be made, but not citizens of the kingdom of God. The very ideas of family and national life-those two divine roots of the Church, severed from which she is certain to wither away into that most godless and most cruel of spectres, a religious world-had perished in the East from the evil influence of the universal practice of slaveholding, {{as well as from the}} degradation of that Jewish nation whichhad been for ages the great witness for those ideas; and all classes, like their forefather Adam--like, indeed, 'the old Adam' in every man and in every age--were shifting the blame of sin from their own consciences to human relationships and duties--and therein, to the God who had appointed them; and saying as of old, 'The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.' The passionate Eastern character, like all weak ones, found total abstinence easier than temperance, religious thought more pleasant than godly action; and a monastic world grew up all over the East, of such vastness that in Egypt it was said to rival in numbers the lay population, producing, with an enormous decrease in the actual amount of moral evil, an equally great enervation and decrease of the population. Such a people could offer no resistance to the steadily-increasing tyranny of the Eastern Empire. In vain did such men as Chrysostom and Basil oppose their personal influence to the hideous intrigues and villainies of the Byzantine court; the ever-downward career of Eastern Christianity went on unchecked for two more miserable centuries, side by side with the upward development of the Western Church; and, while the successors of the great Saint Gregory were converting and civilising a new-born Europe, the Churches of the East were vanishing before Mohammedan invaders, strong by <b>living</b> <b>trust</b> in that living God, whom the Christians, while they hated and persecuted each other for arguments about Him, were denying and blaspheming in every action of their lives.|$|E
25|$|In South Africa, in {{addition}} to the traditional <b>living</b> <b>trusts</b> and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ (inherited from the Roman-Dutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber) in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust, although this is regarded by modern Dutch law as not actually a trust. Bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantages.|$|R

40|$|This paper compares pre-death {{charitable}} testamentary expectations with post-death distributions for deceased {{panel members}} in the 1995 - 2006 Health and Retirement Study. Most respondents who reported having a charitable estate plan in the survey wave immediately prior to their death ultimately generated no charitable estate gift after death. Cross-tabulations, linear probability models, and probit analysis all demonstrated that the likelihood of generating a charitable estate gift was significantly higher for respondents who had a funded inter vivos trust than for respondents who had only a will. This difference persisted even after controlling for wealth, income, and other demographic differences. Reasons for the differential effectiveness of these planning documents and implications for financial and gift planners are examined.

60|$|Filled {{with such}} fearful questionings, half-inarticulate and vague, like the {{thoughts}} of a child, the untutored youth went wandering on, till he reached {{the edge of the}} cliff below which lay his home. It lay pleasantly enough, that lonely Laura, or lane of rude Cyclopean cells, under the perpetual shadow of the southern wall of crags, amid its grove of ancient date-trees. A branching cavern in the cliff supplied the purposes of a chapel, a storehouse, and a hospital; while on the sunny slope across the glen lay the common gardens of the brotherhood, green with millet, maize, and beans, among which a tiny streamlet, husbanded and guided with the most thrifty care, wandered down from the cliff foot, and spread perpetual verdure over the little plot which voluntary and fraternal labour had painfully redeemed from the inroads of the all-devouring sand. For that garden, like everything else in the Laura, except each brother's seven feet of stone sleeping-hut, was the common property, and therefore the common care and joy of all. For the common good, as well as for his own, each man had toiled up the glen with his palm-leaf basket of black mud from the river Nile, over whose broad sheet of silver the glen's mouth yawned abrupt. For the common good, each man had swept the ledges clear of sand, and sown in the scanty artificial soil, the harvest of which all were to share alike. To buy clothes, books, and chapel furniture for the common necessities, education, and worship, each man sat, day after day, week after week, his mind full of high and heavenly thoughts, weaving the leaves of their little palm-copse into baskets, which an aged monk exchanged for goods with the more prosperous and frequented monasteries of the opposite bank. Thither Philammon rowed the old man over, week by week, in a light canoe of papyrus, and fished, as he sat waiting for him, for the common meal. A simple, happy, gentle life was that of the Laura, all portioned out by rules and methods, which were held hardly less sacred than those of the Scriptures, on which they were supposed (and not so wrongly either) to have been framed. Each man had food and raiment, shelter on earth, friends and counsellors, <b>living</b> <b>trust</b> in the continual care of Almighty God; and, blazing before his eyes, by day and night, the hope of everlasting glory beyond all poets' dreams.... And what more would man have had in those days? Thither they had fled out of cities, compared with which Paris is earnest and Gomorrha chaste,--out of a rotten, infernal, dying world of tyrants and slaves, hypocrites and wantons,--to ponder undisturbed on duty and on judgment, on death and eternity, heaven and hell; to find a common creed, a common interest, a common hope, common duties, pleasures, and sorrows.... True, they had many of them fled from the post where God had placed them, when they fled from man into the Thebaid waste.... What sort of post and what sort of an age they were, from which those old monks fled, we shall see, perhaps, before this tale is told out.|$|E

In this insightful work, Monopoli shows how an array of flaws in the system allows corrupt and unethical lawyers to take advantage of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s most vulnerable citizens. She delves into such subjects as the history and purpose of probate, procedural complexities, lack of regulatory oversight, inadequate judicial resources, and the growth of non-probate alternatives, concluding with a blueprint for reform that emphasizes deterrence, detection, and compensation for the victims.
