5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, <b>leeward</b> <b>side.</b> The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The {{windward}} {{side of a}} land mass experiences more moderation than the <b>leeward</b> <b>side.</b> In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels with mild climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically different from that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the <b>Leeward</b> <b>side</b> of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E

The leeward reef flat bas a greater fish biomass compared to the windward reef lat, the average total weight per one hour sampling with a cast net king 3839. 4 gm and 1179. 4 gm respectively. The difference in the surface morphology between the windward and <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> is found to influence the fish biomass. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of fluctuating wind pressure on a cylinder {{of square cross-section}} in a smoothstream were investigated by means of wind tunnel experiments. It {{was found that the}} vortex shed-ding from the cylinder had a marked influence on both mean and r. m. s. coefficients of pressure onthe lateral and <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> of the cylinder. The flow condition around the cylinder changed withangle of attack. As the separated flow reattaches to the corner of the cylinder at the angle of attack 120, the vortex shedding is prevented and the pressure on lateral and <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> are considerablyweakened...|$|R

5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her bow, raking {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her bow and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes <b>leeward</b> <b>side.</b> As Constellation crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E
5|$|During the Quasi-War American {{merchant}} ships often {{became the}} target of French privateers who seized them in large quantities. In an effort to stem these depredations against American shipping several United States Navy warships were dispatched to hunt down French privateers. One such vessel was , an American naval schooner {{under the command of}} Lieutenant John Shaw. Enterprise had been sent out to the Caribbean Sea in March 1800 with orders to cruise against French shipping in the region. Enterprise had already previously engaged and defeated several French privateers when on the night of 24 October she sighted the privateer Flambeau off the <b>leeward</b> <b>side</b> of Dominica.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, <b>leeward</b> <b>side</b> where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E

50|$|The turbine {{consists}} of three vertical airfoil blades, each having a helical twist of 120 degrees. This feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution, thus preventing the destructive pulsations of the straight-bladed giromill (Darrieus turbine). The wind pushes each blade around on both the windward and <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> of the turbine.|$|R
5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (<b>leeward)</b> <b>side</b> has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing {{play a significant role in}} shaping the landscape.|$|E
5|$|The {{major cause}} of rain {{production}} is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall {{along the sides of}} mountains. On the <b>leeward</b> <b>side</b> of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.|$|E
5|$|As the {{two ships}} closed Truxtun's ship held the weather gauge, the {{position}} upwind from his opponent which {{allowed him to}} close or break off. However the heavy winds caused Constellation to heel so much that her leeward gunports had to remain closed. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing past L'Insurgentes to reach her <b>leeward</b> <b>side.</b> From there Constellation could bring more of her guns to bear. With Constellation approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried {{to communicate with the}} Americans. The American frigate ignored the French hail, closing to within fifty yards of L'Insurgente before opening up with a broadside. Loaded with double shot, the opening American salvo struck the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadside that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her, but Constellation held the weather gage and had less damage to her rigging, enabling her to avoid Barreaut's attempt to draw alongside.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric and oceanographic {{patterns}} were mapped using satellite imagery and oceanographic models. These maps {{were used to}} describe the regional environment, and to develop models predicting deep-coral, cetacean, and seabird distributions. Seasons around the MHI are driven by changes in the North Pacific Subtropical High and the Aleutian Low. Winter (November to April) is cooler, rainier, and dominated by the North Pacific swell. Summer (May to October) is warmer, less rainy, and dominated by the northeasterly trade winds and swell. Mountains and submerged topography change the direction and speed of winds and currents. These interactions cause the <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> of the island to be warmer and drier, and create frequent convergence, mixing, upwelling, fronts and eddies in the channels between the islands (e. g., the Kaiwi, Pailolo and ʻAlenuihānā Channels), and on the <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> of the islands (e. g., Kona Coast, Hawaiʻi) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{continental}} climates {{occur in}} middle latitudes, between 35° or 40° and 55°. These climates are normally inland or on <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> of landmasses. They feature warm to hot summers and cold winters, {{with a large}} interseasonal temperature variation. Regions with this climate include northern temperate Asia, the northern United States, southern Canada, and parts of northeastern Europe.|$|R
2500|$|The {{climate of}} the Hawaiian Islands is {{tropical}} but it experiences many different climates, depending on altitude and weather. [...] The islands receive most rainfall from the trade winds on their north and east flanks (the windward side) {{as a result of}} orographic precipitation. Coastal areas in general and especially the south and west flanks or <b>leeward</b> <b>sides,</b> tend to be drier.|$|R
5|$|It {{was normal}} in fleet {{actions of the}} 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was {{counting}} on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with {{the advantage of the}} weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the <b>leeward</b> <b>side</b> of their opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat downwind, and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running {{over the surface of}} a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of the}} aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the <b>leeward</b> <b>side</b> of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E

30|$|Our {{findings}} in this study provide statistically robust evidence for variables that respond to Lewellen’s (2012) question regarding whether it is statistically possible to prove that topography might influence regional weather patterns. Along with topographic influence, this study also found that other physiographic features such as elevation, physiographic provincial sub regions, and most importantly the windward protection afforded to <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> of physiographic features are statistically significant EV in predicting severe weather patterns.|$|R
50|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} is 1081 mm, varying from 318 mm to 1698 mm year to year. Much {{of the variability}} in rainfall depends on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. There is generally a 4 - 5 month dry season during the warmer summer months. Rainfall is higher in the winter months, and varies with elevation and exposure; elevations above 500 m experience frequent rainfall, while the western, <b>leeward</b> <b>sides</b> of Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara are quite dry.|$|R

25|$|As moist winds {{from the}} Pacific (also called “Chinooks”) {{are forced to}} rise over the mountains, the {{moisture}} in the air is condensed and falls out as precipitation, while the air cools at the moist adiabatic rate of 5°C/1000m (3.5°F/1000ft). The dried air then descends on the <b>leeward</b> <b>side</b> of the mountains, warming at the dry adiabatic rate of 10°C/1000m (5.5°F/1000ft).|$|E
25|$|Quite often, {{when the}} Pacific Northwest coast is being drenched by rain, the {{windward}} {{side of the}} Rockies is being hammered by snow (as the air loses its moisture), and the <b>leeward</b> <b>side</b> of the Rockies in Alberta is basking in a föhn Chinook.

50|$|The {{blades of}} a Darrieus turbine can be canted into a helix, e.g. three blades and a helical twist of 60 degrees, similar to Gorlov's water turbines.

The traffic intensities {{were up to}} 25000 vehicles per day. Soil TPH concentrations were highest within 15 [*]m distance (665 and 3198 [*]mg kg− 1 at the windward and <b>leeward</b> <b>sides,</b> resp.), followed by a rapid drop to background values beyond (196 and 115 [*]mg kg− 1 in 60 [*]m distance at the windward and <b>leeward</b> <b>sides,</b> resp.). The data variability was lowest at distances of 1 [*]m and highest within tree plantations at distances of 15 [*]m from the road. The TPH concentrations decreased with depth but {{were significantly higher than}} the background at all depths investigated. A principal component analysis revealed a positive relation between the medium-to-heavy fraction ratio and soil depth. A fractional differentiation of hydrocarbons with distance from road was not observed.
