5|$|The {{financing}} plan involved {{public and private}} funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for the acquisition {{of the land and}} construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' <b>lease</b> <b>payment,</b> $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Sounds development, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} medical care in Hillcrest dates back to 1904, when {{patients}} from the Poor Farm in Mission Valley were transferred to the new three-story San Diego County Hospital there. In 1958, the UC Regents approved {{the creation of a}} medical school at the University of California San Diego, coinciding with the county's plan to create a $12.5 million, 600-bed medical center to replace the structurally deficient county hospital. The eleven-story, 623-bed Hillcrest hospital opened in 1963, and control was transferred to UCSD in 1966 for an initial <b>lease</b> <b>payment</b> of $350,000 a year.|$|E

The lease amount was further adjusted in 1973 to $3,676.50 and in 1974 to $4,085, based on revisions to the value of the U.S. gold dollar.

40|$|Subsidiary S (seller-lessee), a {{subsidiary}} of Company A, enters into a sale-leaseback transaction for a building with Company B (buyer-lessor). Company B requires Company A to provide an unsecured guarantee of the <b>lease</b> <b>payments.</b> The transaction otherwise meets all of the provisions under Statement 98 for Subsidiary S to use sale-leaseback accounting. The issue is whether Company A's unsecured guarantee of Subsidiary S's <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> {{is a form of}} continuing involvement that precludes the application of sale-leaseback accounting under Statement 98 in (1) Subsidiary S's separate financial statements and (2) Company A's consolidated financial statements. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force expressed the view that an entity's unsecured guarantee of its own <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> is not a form of continuing involvement that precludes sale-leaseback accounting under Statement 98 because such a guarantee does not provide the buyer-lessor with additional collateral that reduces the buyer-lessor's risk of loss, except in the event of the seller-lessee's bankruptcy.

50|$|The early {{promise of}} mineral {{extraction}} from Caradon had now peaked, and difficult mining conditions, {{and the availability}} of cheaper minerals from overseas, led to serious decline in the industry.
