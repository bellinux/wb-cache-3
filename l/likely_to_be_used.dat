5|$|Amyloid imaging is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in {{conjunction}} with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E
5|$|Celtic law made {{specific}} provision {{with regard to}} cabbages and leeks, stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle. The two green vegetables were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in their cooking. The leek went on to be so important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E

2500|$|The {{umbrella}} term {{additive manufacturing}} (AM) gained wide currency in the 2000s. [...] The term subtractive manufacturing {{appeared as a}} retronym for the large family of machining processes with metal removal as their common theme. The term 3D printing still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds, and the term AM <b>was</b> <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in metalworking and end use part production contexts than among polymer, inkjet, or stereolithography enthusiasts.|$|R
5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Middle Mongol had a {{slightly}} larger set of declarative finite verb suffix forms {{and a smaller}} number of participles, which were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as finite predicates. The linking converb -n became confined to stable verb combinations, while the number of converbs increased. The distinction between male, female and plural subjects exhibited by some finite verbal suffixes was lost.|$|E
5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E

We use a two-stage least squares estimator with geographical broadband availability as an instrument to address some potential endogeneity problems in a panel of Irish manufacturing firms. While more productive firms are on average more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> DSL broadband, we find no statistically signicant effect of broadband adoption on firms' productivity (growth). ...|$|R

5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track had dried by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position close behind. The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari proved more significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good pace for the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A major incident occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed the floor on Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence.|$|E

25|$|Contraception is not {{a common}} form of control, but is {{preferred}} by some wildlife managers. It also is expensive to operate - an estimated $6 million annually to drop bait laced with birth-control chemicals. Testing of other potential contraceptives would take about five to eight years and $10 million, with no guarantee of FDA approval. Also, an intensive environmental assessment {{would have to be}} completed to determine whether any nontarget organisms were affected by the contraceptive chemicals. Neither of these control methods is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the near future.|$|E

40|$|Permeability is an {{important}} parameter in the simulation of resin transfer moulding (RTM) process. This is particularly so {{in the case of}} 3 -D braided perform reinforced composites which have no distinct layers and consequently generally have higher levels of structural integrity than traditional laminated composites.

25|$|In {{criminal}} law, Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), reformulated {{the standard}} for determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Crawford gives enhanced protection to defendants when the hearsay offered against them is testimonial in nature. When a statement is deliberately accusatory, or when the declarant knows that the statement is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the prosecution of the defendant for a crime, the need for face-to-face confrontation is at its highest.
