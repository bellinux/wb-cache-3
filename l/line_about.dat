5|$|Mother and I agreed, when {{we talked}} about it, that Dad never meant his poem to apply to one {{particular}} tree, or to the trees of any special region.

5|$|Supporting {{the fort}} were {{numerous}} defenses. Batteries {{were placed on}} Jeffrey's Hook, which extended into the Hudson, on Cox's Hill looking over Spuyten Duyvil Creek, {{at the north end}} of Manhattan controlling the King's Bridge and Dyckman's Bridge over the Harlem River and along Laurel Hill which was to the east of the Fort and went along the Harlem River (see also Fort Tryon Park). To the south of the fort were three lines of defense. The lines went through the hills and were made of trenches and foxholes. The first line was supported by a second <b>line</b> <b>about</b> 0.33mi (0.5km) to the north, and a third line was planned to be built 0.25mi (0.4km) north of the second.|$|E

5|$|After July 1916, the Beaumont-Hamel front {{remained}} relatively quiet while the Battle of the Somme continued to the south. In the final {{act in the}} Somme Offensive, Beaumont-Hamel was assaulted by the 51st (Highland) Division on 13 November 1916 on {{the opening of the}} Battle of the Ancre. Within two days, all the 29th Division objectives of 1 July had been taken along with a great many German prisoners. The area of the memorial site then became a rear area with troops lodged in the former German dugouts and a camp was established {{in the vicinity of the}} present Y Ravine Cemetery. With the German withdrawal in March 1917 to the Hindenburg <b>Line,</b> <b>about</b> 30 kilometres from Beaumont-Hamel, the battlefield salvage parties moved in, many dugouts were closed off and initial efforts were probably made to restore some of the land to agriculture. However, in March 1918, the German Spring Offensive was here checked on exactly the same battle lines as before. Until the Battle of Amiens and the German withdrawal in late August 1918, the protagonists confronted each other over the same ground, although the only actions were those of routine front line trench raids, patrols and artillery harassment.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese often married Tanka women since Han Chinese {{women would}} not have {{relations}} with them. Some of the Tanka's descendants became Macanese people.

25|$|Southern Ontario, in {{particular}} Toronto, receives as much summer solar radiation {{as the city}} of Miami, Florida, indicating that Ontario has sufficient solar energy that can be harnessed to generate electricity or heat. Unlike solar energy, geothermal heat pumps (GHP) produce heat energy that is mainly used for space and hot water heating. GHPs operate like refrigerators to transfer absorbed heat energy from below the frost <b>line</b> (<b>about</b> 1.2m soil depth for Southern Ontario) to connected buildings.|$|E

25|$|A long tram <b>line,</b> <b>about</b> 17 versts (18 kilometres) long, {{was laid}} from the Poshtova Square in the Podil neighbourhood, over the Dnieper on the Nicholas Bridge, through the Peredmostna and Nikolska Slobodka neighbourhoods, {{and to the}} {{neighbouring}} town of Brovary.

The cost was 35 kopecks, {{a fair amount of}} money at the time. Nevertheless, the trams were always packed with passengers.|$|E
