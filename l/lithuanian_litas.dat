25|$|The <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> (ISO {{currency}} code LTL, symbolized as Lt; plural litai (nominative) or litų (genitive)) was {{the currency of}} Lithuania, until 1 January 2015, when it {{was replaced by the}} euro. It was divided into 100 centų (genitive case; singular centas, nominative plural centai). The litas was first introduced on 2 October 1922 after World War I, when Lithuania declared independence and was reintroduced on 25 June 1993, following a period of currency exchange from the ruble to the litas with the temporary talonas then in place. The name was modeled after the name of the country (similar to Latvia and its lats). From 1994 to 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1. The litas was pegged to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1 since 2002. The euro was expected to replace the litas by January 1, 2007, but persistent high inflation and the economic crisis delayed the switch. On 1 January 2015 the litas was switched to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1.|$|E
500|$|All banks (including all {{accounts}} holding over 1,000 litas), real estate holdings larger than , and private enterprises employing over 20 workers or grossing more than 150,000 litas were nationalized. This disruption in management and operations created {{a sharp drop}} in production. The <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> was artificially depreciated by three to four times less than its actual value and withdrawn by March 1941. The drop in production, combined with massive spending of appreciated rubles by Russian soldiers and officials, caused widespread shortages. All land was nationalized; the largest farms were reduced to , and extra land (some [...] ) was distributed to small farmers. To turn small peasants against large landowners, collectivization was not introduced in Lithuania. In preparation for eventual collectivization, farm taxes were increased by 50–200% and additional heavy in-kind conscriptions were enacted. Some farmers were unable to pay the exorbitant new taxes, and about 1,100 of the larger ones were put on trial.|$|E
2500|$|All {{members of}} the European Union, except Denmark and the UK, are {{required}} by treaty to join the euro once certain economic criteria have been met. The <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> participated in ERM II since 28 June 2004, and was pegged to the euro {{at a rate of}} 3.45280 litai = €1. Lithuania originally set 1 January 2007 as their target date for joining the euro, and in March 2006 requested that the European Commission and the European Central Bank conduct an assessment on their readiness to adopt the currency. The Commission's report found that while Lithuania met four of the five criteria, their average annual inflation was 2.7%, exceeding the limit of 2.6%. As a result, the Commission concluded that [...] "there should be no change at present to Lithuania's status as a Member State with a derogation." [...] Lithuania is the only country initially to have been denied approval to adopt the euro after requesting a convergence check.|$|E
5000|$|In Lithuanian {{the euro}} and cent are called euras (...) and centas (...) (in common {{language}} usually eurocentas, to distinguish from the cents {{of the former}} <b>Lithuanian</b> currency, <b>litas),</b> while plural forms are eurai and centai (eurocentai). The Lithuanian language routinely adapts foreign words by re-spelling them according to Lithuanian phonetic rules and adding standardised endings, resulting in words like kompiuteris or Tonis Bleiras.|$|R
50|$|The Bank of Lithuania (Lietuvos Bankas) is {{the central}} bank of the Republic of Lithuania. The Bank of Lithuania {{is a member of}} the European System of Central Banks. The {{chairman}} of the bank is Vitas Vasiliauskas. Until 2015, the Bank of Lithuania was responsible for issuing the former <b>Lithuanian</b> currency, the <b>litas.</b>|$|R
25|$|The litas was {{established}} at {{a value of}} 10 litų = 1US dollar and was subdivided into 100 centų. In the face of worldwide economic depression, the litas appeared {{to be quite a}} strong and stable currency, reflecting the negligible influence of the depression on the <b>Lithuanian</b> economy. One <b>litas</b> was covered by 0.150462grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. In March 1923, the circulation amounted to 39,412,984 litas, backed by 15,738,964 in actual gold and by 24,000,000 in high exchange securities. It was required that at least one third of the total circulation would be covered by gold and the rest by other assets. By 1938, 1 U.S. dollar was worth about 5.9 litai, falling to about 20 U.S. cents before its disappearance in 1941.|$|R
2500|$|The {{territory}} {{presented an}} economic challenge to Lithuania: unemployment was rampant, food was in short supply, valuables were stolen by Soviet army, war refugees were gathering from other former Polish territories. The Lithuanian army would provide up to 25,000 daily rations of hot soup and bread to residents of Vilnius. Lithuanian government exchanged the Polish złoty to <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> at a favorable rate, losing over 20 million litas. The Lithuanian government decided {{to implement a}} land reform similar to the land reform, executed in 1920s. Large estates would be nationalized and distributed to landless peasants in exchange for redemption dues payable in 36 years. Politicians hoped that such reform would weaken pro-Polish landowners and would win peasants' loyalty to the Lithuanian state. By March 1940, 90 estates and 23,000 hectares were distributed. Lithuanians proceeded to [...] "re-Lithuanize" [...] cultural life in Vilnius Region. They closed many Polish cultural and educational institutions, including Stephan Batory University with over 3,000 students. Lithuanians sought to introduce the Lithuanian language in public life and sponsored Lithuanian organizations and cultural activities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} Lithuanian {{monetary and}} exchange rate developments. Experiences {{of the other}} two Baltic states Estonia and Latvia have been analysed as well. New monetary and financial institutions introduced in all Baltic states facedseveral problems. One was how to maintain the credibility for new fixed exchange rates in order to preserve positive effect on the economy due to the sharp fall of the inflation. The currency board system has been proposed as a reasonable solution. Central Banks of Estonia and Lithuania are operating under the currency board arrangement. The main objective was to keep monetary expansion and inflation under control. Lithuania undertook several currency reforms. After two year experience of the floating exchange rate, the Lithuanian Government pegged Lithuanian currency to the US dollar in April 1994. From that moment the Lithuanian Central bank has been operating like strict currency board. As an outcome, inflation rates slightly went down and credibility of the <b>Lithuanian</b> currency, the <b>litas,</b> increased. The paper concludes that under an instability in the transitional economies the Currency Board can serve as an anti-inflationary tool creating convertibility and credibility effects. Moreover, the exchange rate pegging might prevent the government's inflationary policy. The period after the reforms in Lithuania and also in Estonia is too short for definitive conclusions. But, from historical point of view the currency board's arrangements in those countries helped to reach the currency credibility and economic stability to a certain extent. ...|$|R

5000|$|Vytautas Petrulis (born February 3, 1890 in Katelišės, near Vabalninkas; {{executed}} in 1942, near Uchta, RSFSR) was a Lithuanian politician, {{one of the}} main figures in the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, and an accountant. He is often nicknamed [...] "the father of the Litas" [...] as it was during his term as Minister of Finance that the <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> was introduced.|$|E
50|$|The LFMI {{immediately}} {{arranged for}} Hanke and Schuler {{to publish a}} book in Lithuanian. Their book contained a currency board blueprint for the country. This measure was adopted in April 1994, linking the <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> to the German mark at a fixed exchange rate. Following {{the introduction of the}} euro, the litas was linked to the euro, until January 1, 2015, when Lithuania officially adopted the euro as its currency.|$|E
50|$|Monetary {{reform was}} {{undertaken}} in early nineties {{to improve the}} stability of the economy. Lithuania chose a currency board system controlled by the Bank of Lithuania independent of any government institution. On 25 June 1993, the <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> was introduced as a freely convertible currency, but on 1 April 1994 it was pegged to the United States dollar at a rate of 4 to 1. The mechanism of the currency board system enabled Lithuania to stabilize inflation rates to single digits. The stable currency rate helped to establish foreign economic relations, therefore leading to a constant growth of foreign trade.|$|E

50|$|Between the World Wars {{industry}} prospered in Kaunas; it {{was then}} the largest city in Lithuania. Under direction of the mayor Jonas Vileišis (1921-1931) Kaunas grew rapidly and was extensively modernised. A water and waste water system, costing more than 15 million <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas,</b> was put in place, the city expanded from 18 to 40 km2, more than 2,500 buildings were built, plus three modern bridges over the Neris and Nemunas rivers. All the city's streets were paved, horse-drawn transportation was replaced with modern bus lines, new suburbs were planned and built (Žaliakalnis neighbourhood in particular), and new parks and squares were established. The foundations for a social security system were laid, three new schools were built, and new public libraries, including the Vincas Kudirka library, were established. J.

50|$|After {{a decade}} of loss-making operations, {{abortive}} plans to launch a trans-Atlantic service, and the widely criticized sale of landing slots at London Heathrow to cover some US$20 million in debt, Lithuanian Airlines was privatized in 2005. The airline was acquired by LAL Investicijų Valdymas (LAL Investment Management), a wholly owned subsidiary of the FlyLal Group, for 27 million <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas.</b> The airline was subsequently renamed FlyLal-Lithuanian Airlines. In February 2007, FlyLal was recognized as most punctual airline at Gatwick Airport in London. It had 542 employees as of March 2007. As of December 2007, the airline had three Boeing 737-300, five Boeing 737-500, and four SAAB 2000 airliners and had plans for further expansion. During 2007, the number of passengers grew by 14% to 526,000. In 2008, charter flight services were transferred to sister company FlyLal Charters, leaving only scheduled flights for FlyLal.|$|E

50|$|Previously {{a manager}} {{in a state}} dairy company, Šleževičius was {{appointed}} Prime Minister following the election of Algirdas Brazauskas as President in February 1993. At the time, Lithuania was faced with monthly inflation of 10-30% despite the demonitization of the ruble and introduction of the talonas (coupon money) on 1 October 1992. After initially promising large wage hikes to state workers, Šleževičius implemented a smaller increase and backed a {{tightening of monetary policy}} by the Bank of Lithuania. This brought monthly inflation down from 25% in May 1993 to 13% in May, 6% in June, and 3% in July. With this progress in stabilization, the Litas Committee (composed of Šleževičius, President Brazauskas, and Bank of Lithuania President Visokavičius) announced the reintroduction of the <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> as national currency, to take place on 25 June 1993. The exchange rate strengthened from the equivalent of over 5 litai to 3.5 litai by August 1993.|$|E

5000|$|Immediately {{following}} the occupation, Soviet authorities began rapid Sovietization of Lithuania. All land was nationalized. To gain {{support for the}} new regime among the poorer peasants, large farms were distributed to small landowners. However, in preparation for eventual collectivization, agricultural taxes were dramatically increased {{in an attempt to}} bankrupt all farmers. Nationalization of banks, larger enterprises, and real estate resulted in disruptions in production that caused massive shortages of goods. The <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas</b> was artificially undervalued and withdrawn by spring 1941. Standards of living plummeted. All religious, cultural, and political organizations were banned, leaving only the Communist Party of Lithuania and its youth branch. An estimated 12,000 [...] "enemies of the people" [...] were arrested. During the June deportation campaign of 1941, some 12,600 people (mostly former military officers, policemen, political figures, intelligentsia and their families) were deported to Gulags in Siberia under the policy of elimination of national elites. Many deportees perished due to inhumane conditions; 3,600 were imprisoned and over 1,000 were killed.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{economic}} transition to capitalism, Lithuania organized a privatization campaign to sell government-owned residential real estate and commercial enterprises. The government issued investment vouchers {{to be used in}} privatization instead of actual currency. People cooperated in groups to collect larger amounts of vouchers for the public auctions and the privatization campaign. Lithuania, unlike Russia, did not create a small group of very wealthy and powerful people. The privatization started with small organizations, and large enterprises (such as telecommunication companies or airlines) were sold several years later for hard currency in a bid to attract foreign investors. Lithuania's monetary system was {{to be based on the}} <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>litas,</b> the currency used during the interwar period. Due to high inflation and other delays, a temporary currency, the Lithuanian talonas, was introduced (it was commonly referred to as the Vagnorėlis or Vagnorkė after Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius). Eventually the litas was issued in June 1993, and the decision was made to set it up with a fixed exchange rate to the United States dollar in 1994 and to the Euro in 2002.|$|E
