5|$|Kevin Corrigan {{agreed to}} cameo so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had no {{speaking}} lines; his scene, {{which was not}} scripted, was entirely improvised by Graynor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the passage}} from Ceylon, at one o'clock every day, the ships signalled each other their {{longitude}} that they calculated using their chronometers. In this way, the ships were able to compare their respective instruments, and {{the master of the}} Arniston was able to learn his longitude too, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> remained in the convoy.|$|E

5|$|Following the war {{council of}} 20 June, Schuyler ordered St. Clair {{to hold out}} as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, and to avoid having his avenues of retreat cut off. Schuyler took command of a reserve force of 700 at Albany, and Washington ordered four regiments {{to be held in}} {{readiness}} at Peekskill, further down the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, {{tried to keep}} the ceasefire for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. This proved to be quite costly to the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|Superman persuades the {{government}} to let him act independently, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> does not turn against humanity. To allow access to dangerous situations without attracting attention, Clark takes {{a job as a}} freelance reporter for the Daily Planet.|$|E

5000|$|Anita sings of her {{anticipation}} for her boyfriend, Bernardo, {{the leader}} of the Sharks, to return after the rumble. She knows that he is usually riled up after a fight like this and she looks forward to having some intimate time together and [...] "getting her kicks." [...] In the 1961 film version of West Side Story, Anita sings [...] "He'll walk in hot and tired, poor dear / No matter if <b>he's</b> tired, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> here" [...] rather than [...] "He'll walk in hot and tired, so what / No matter if <b>he's</b> tired, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> hot." ...|$|R
5|$|The decree of the Congregation of the Index banned Copernicus's De Revolutionibus {{and other}} heliocentric works until correction. Bellarmine's {{instructions}} did not prohibit Galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did not advocate for its physical truth.|$|E
5|$|Colbert wrote The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter while {{teaching}} {{a seminar on}} self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. He had it self-published in March 2001 and hired a company {{to take care of}} accounting, marketing, promotion, and selling. Colbert has never met Rowling and the book has not been approved by her or Warner Brothers (the owner of the film rights to the Harry Potter novels). He was given permission to publish it as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> noted on the cover that it had not been approved by Rowling.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} weekend, Mercedes had already secured the Constructors' Championship, having done {{so at the}} {{previous}} race in Russia. Ferrari was in second place on 359 points, 139 points ahead of Williams. In the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton led with 302 points, 66 ahead of Sebastian Vettel and 73 ahead of his teammate, Nico Rosberg. This meant that Hamilton {{would be able to}} win the title with three races to spare, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gathered nine points more than Vettel and two more than Rosberg at the Grand Prix.|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> not a doctor! You can't {{think how}} they get on your nerves when they're, like that. I've bumped up against so many of them. They fired me at last!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "A pretty gang, too! Well, sir, the lad is safe, but {{it would}} be as well, perhaps, for one or other of us to stay in his room with him. For my own part, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> my charge I'm never very far away." ...|$|R
5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the wording of the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for <b>long,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E
5|$|Robert Eddison as the Grail Knight: The {{guardian}} of the Grail who drank from the cup of Christ during the Crusades and is immortal as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> stays within the temple. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing once before in film (a supporting role in Peter Ustinov's 1948 comedy Vice Versa). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his film debut, often asking if he had performed correctly. Laurence Olivier was originally considered to play the Grail Knight, {{but he was too}} ill and died the same year in which the film was released.|$|E

5|$|Solomon was {{succeeded by}} his nephew Sergius, who proved {{completely}} inadequate {{in dealing with}} the situation. The Moors launched a general revolt and inflicted a severe defeat on the Byzantines in Thacia in 545. Sergius was recalled, while the army mutinied again, this time under Guntharis, who captured Carthage and installed himself there as an independent ruler. His usurpation did not last <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was assassinated by Artabanes, {{but it was not until}} the arrival of John Troglita in late 546 and his subsequent campaigns that the province was to be pacified and brought again securely under Byzantine imperial control.|$|E
5|$|The {{change of}} {{government}} was welcome {{particularly to the}} senators, who had been harshly persecuted during Domitian's reign. As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters, Nerva publicly swore that no senators would {{be put to death}} as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> remained in office. He called an end to trials based on treason, released those who had been imprisoned under these charges, and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled.|$|E
5|$|This {{campaign}} {{focuses on}} {{the expansion of the}} Holy Roman Empire by integrating the squabbling German duchies under the rule of Frederick Barbarossa, the first Holy Roman Emperor. The first campaign missions sees the player establishing Barbarossa's dominance over the Central European powers of Austria, Saxony, Bavaria, Bohemia, Burgundy as well as Swabia by collecting relics. Although having established dominance, Barbarossa still finds rivals to challenge his Empire's power in the form of Poland, as well as Henry the Lion, a respected ally of Barbarossa. Henry is spared his life and titles as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> promises to fully declare allegiance to Barbarossa.|$|E
