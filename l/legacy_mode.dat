500|$|On 30 September 2010, {{the club}} {{formally}} submitted its {{bid for the}} Olympic Stadium with a presentation at 10 Downing Street, and on 8 October 2010 the world's largest live entertainment company, Live Nation, endorsed the club's Olympic Stadium plans. Three days after Live Nation's endorsement, UK Athletics confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid {{to take over the}} Olympic Stadium in <b>legacy</b> <b>mode.</b> In November 2010, West Ham commenced a search for potential developers for [...] "informal discussions" [...] about {{what would happen to the}} ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. According to the club, the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by the summer of 2014. On 11 February 2011, the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.|$|E
2500|$|Pressing the controller's [...] "Home" [...] button suspends {{the current}} game or app {{and opens the}} Home Menu: it shows basic {{information}} (such as the current time, controller battery levels, and notifications), and allows access to several [...] "multitasking" [...] functions, including the Nintendo eShop, Miiverse, download manager, a web browser, and the user's friends list. To play Wii games, the user must enter [...] "Wii Mode", a <b>legacy</b> <b>mode</b> that emulates the Wii's system software and Wii Menu interface. Initially, Wii Mode could only be used on the television screen, but the October 2013 firmware update enables Wii Mode to be used off-TV. Either way, Wii controllers must be used.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012 {{players were}} invited to beta-test a new combat system named [...] "Evolution of Combat", which {{included}} fundamental changes such as re-balancing the Combat Triangle to avoid favouring melee attacks, and replacing special weapon attacks with abilities that produce a range of effects when activated. The system was released on the live game on 20 November 2012. Various polls were also added for players to vote on in game that would determine the result of future content development, some of which would dictate {{the development of the}} improved combat system. A beta for a separate combat system dubbed [...] "Legacy Mode" [...] was officially opened to players on 16 June 2014, before being introduced to the live game on 14 July. <b>Legacy</b> <b>Mode</b> allows players to switch to the combat system and interface from prior to June 2012 instead of the Evolution of Combat system.|$|E

However, {{it is possible}} to connect to stream ID no. 1 of a SHOUTcast v2 server in <b>legacy</b> (v1) <b>mode.</b> As a temporary workaround, the SHOUTcast DSP 1.9.2 plugin for Winamp-compatible media players may be used to broadcast to alternate mount points (e.g. stream ID no. 2).|$|R
50|$|The BIOS, which {{functions}} as a bootloader and supports <b>legacy</b> real <b>mode</b> applications, is a crucial component of many IBM-compatible computers. The BIOS is always 16-bit, often has networking functions, and can be a security backdoor (sometimes deliberate, and the operating system has no control over this backdoor). The FSF promotes libreboot in its campaign for free BIOS firmware.|$|R

40|$|The article {{offers an}} {{explanation}} for variations in the effectiveness of trade unions to obtain legislative and policy concessions in peak-level tripartite negotiations in post-communist East Central Europe. It shows that standard interpretations for such variationsfocused on structural <b>legacies,</b> <b>modes</b> of transition, political cycles and institutional differencescannot account for the problem at hand. Instead, I argue that the sources of these variations are to be attributed to distinct paths of statelabour relations, which {{are the product of}} continuous strategic interactions that crucially depend on power dynamics between the main actors. To present a mechanism through which these paths evolve, the article sketches a model of governmentunion interactions that combines institutional and behavioural variables. I propose a set of hypotheses regarding the conditions that determine initial choice of strategies and factors that influence continuation or modification of these strategies later on. By analysing the cases of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, the article further illustrates how these interactions shape tripartite institutions {{in such a way that}} they start reflecting accentuated power disparities between the contending actors, thereby limiting future choice sets for weaker actors...|$|R
5000|$|... x86-64 {{processors}} can be run {{in one of}} two states: long mode provides larger {{physical address}} spaces and the ability to run 64-bit applications which can use larger virtual address spaces and more registers, and <b>legacy</b> <b>mode.</b> These processors' <b>legacy</b> <b>mode</b> allows these processors to act as if they were 16 or 32-bit x86 processors with all of the abilities and limitations of them in order to run legacy 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems, and to run programs requiring virtual 8086 mode to run in Windows.|$|E
50|$|In computing, <b>legacy</b> <b>mode</b> is a {{state in}} which a {{computer}} system, component, or software application behaves in a way different from its standard operation {{in order to support}} older software, data, or expected behavior. It differs from backward compatibility in that an item in <b>legacy</b> <b>mode</b> will often sacrifice newer features or performance, or be unable to access data or run programs it normally could, in order to provide continued access to older data or functionality. Sometimes it can allow newer technologies that replaced the old to emulate them when running older operating systems.|$|E

50|$|AMD extends {{this scheme}} to 40 address bits by {{interpreting}} bits 20..13 of a PDE as bit 39..32 {{of the page}} base address in their AMD64 processors when operated in <b>legacy</b> <b>mode,</b> so only bit 21 is reserved (must be zero). Note however that CR4.PSE is ignored in long mode and PSE-style 4 MB pages are not available in that mode. The total amount of physical memory addressable in AMD64 <b>legacy</b> <b>mode</b> using PSE 4-MB pages is, thus, 1024 GB. Tom Shanley has called this extension PSE-40, although such a designation {{does not appear in}} the official AMD documentation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Fuel cell {{manufacturers}} are making great strides in producing micro fuel cells with improved {{power and energy}} density. These have great promise in portable applications, including cell phones, laptops, and military equipment. Often missed in the discussion is the requirement for power converters appropriate to both the fuel cell source and the portable electronic load. This paper explores some of the special requirements for two target applications, cell phones with a <b>legacy</b> analog <b>mode</b> and laptops designed for maximum portability. It will be shown that power conversion architecture should be considered early in the system design to build the best product. I...|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, legacy {{applications}} {{that attempt to}} access hardware directly cannot do so in user <b>mode.</b> <b>Legacy</b> applications may also fail if system configuration files from the DOS and Windows 9x era are not present in Windows NT based kernels, hence the reason for zero-length versions of files like AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS having to be carried forward on operating systems that do not use them.|$|R
50|$|The Linux console {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{features}} of the kernel and was originally written by Linus Torvalds in 1991 (see history of Linux). There are two main implementations: framebuffer and text mode. The framebuffer implementation is the default in modern Linux distributions, and together with kernel mode setting, provides kernel-level support for display hardware and features such as showing graphics while the system is booting. The <b>legacy</b> text <b>mode</b> implementation was used in PC-compatible systems with CGA, EGA, MDA and VGA graphics cards. Non-x86 architectures used framebuffer mode because their graphics cards did not implement text mode. The Linux console uses fixed-size bitmap, monospace fonts, usually defaulting to 8x16 pixels per character.|$|R
