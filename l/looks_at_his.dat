Meanwhile, Bart and Todd find out about an upcoming children's miniature golf tournament, with the first prize of $50. They enter it, and although Todd {{is very good at}} miniature golf, Homer becomes confident that Bart will win.

Later, when Bart <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> meager collection of trophies in his room, Lisa offers to help him practice. Utilizing spiritual books that calm Bart's mind, they meditate. Meanwhile, Homer makes a bet with Ned on whose boy is a better golfer: the father of the boy who does not win the tournament will mow the other father's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.|$|E

25|$|Emmet {{finds himself}} in the human world as a Lego minifigure unable to move. The events of the story are being played out by a little boy named Finn on his father's {{expansive}} Lego set in their basement. His father—"the Man Upstairs"—comes {{home from work and}} chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together (causing Lord Business' forces to regain the upper hand as a result). Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his perfectionism. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that he is special and has the power to change everything. Finn reconciles with his father, which plays out as Business having a change of heart, capping the Kragle, and ungluing his victims with mineral spirits. Emmet is hailed as a hero, and begins a relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.|$|E

When he meets Squidward at the restaurant, SpongeBob acts as if this is his first time applying at the Krusty Krab and has never met Squidward before. Squidward decides to take advantage of this by training SpongeBob to act like him, a horrible employee, in hopes SpongeBob will later get fired. After a series of complaints from the customers, Mr. Krabs confronts SpongeBob for his lousy work, to which SpongeBob explains since he has new pants, he is no longer [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants". Mr. Krabs then convinces SpongeBob he should take his pants off then. SpongeBob, no longer wearing pants, then continues to be his normal self and go back to being a good employee.

500|$|Many of the 82 Fredman's Epistles remain {{popular in}} Sweden. Their diverse styles and themes may be {{illustrated}} {{with examples of}} some of the best-known songs. To begin with No. 23, Ach du min Moder! (Alas, thou my mother), which has been described as [...] "the to-be-or-not-to-be of Swedish literature", tells, in realist style, the story of a drunk who wakes in a Stockholm gutter outside the Crawl-In Tavern. He curses his parents for conceiving him [...] "perhaps upon a table" [...] as he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> torn clothes. Then the tavern door opens, and he goes in and has his first drink. The song ends with loud thanks to the drunk's mother and father. In contrast, the Rococo No. 28, I går såg jag ditt barn, min Fröja (Yesterday I saw thy child, my Freya), tells the tale of an attempt to arrest the [...] "nymph" [...] Ulla Winblad, based on a real event. Bellman here combines realism – Ulla wearing a black embroidered bodice, and losing her watch in a named street (Yxsmedsgränd) in Stockholm's Gamla stan – with images from classical mythology, such as a myrtle crown and an allusion to the goddess Aphrodite.|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University {{believed}} that The Broken Ear established a [...] "tintinian" [...] anthropology that would remain {{throughout the rest}} of the series. As part of this, Apostolidès argued, Hergé distances himself from western values and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own society as an outsider, accomplishing what Roger Caillois called [...] "sociological revolution". He felt that the comic was [...] "more contrived" [...] and [...] "more superficial" [...] than the previous Adventures, and that here Tintin loses his position as [...] "the sole point of identification" [...] for the reader, with the other characters becoming more identifiable. Opining that there was a constant theme of twos throughout the story (i.e. the real and the fake fetish, Alonso and Ramón), he thought that the character of Ridgewell was [...] "a kind of Tintin, grown old among the natives, solitary and ill humored", noting that Ridgewell's position among the Arumbayas was akin to Tintin's position among the Ba Baorom in Congo. Apostolidès also argued that in the comic, Alcazar was a religious figure, who attained a [...] "sacred" [...] quality through the spilling of blood in his revolt against General Tapioca's government. As part of this, he argued that the threats of assassination would make him a martyr, or a [...] "holy king." ...|$|E
500|$|Cukor {{himself was}} highly {{dissatisfied}} by the film. [...] "I suspect {{the story was}} basically fraudulent," [...] he told an interviewer. Like many critics, he felt that [...] "as a piece of storytelling, the unfolding of a mystery, {{the first half of}} Keeper of the Flame is a damn good show", {{but the rest of the}} film had substantial problems. He praised Spencer Tracy's work, saying: [...] "Tracy... was at his best in the picture. Subdued, cool, he conveyed the ruthlessness of the reporter sent to investigate Forrest's death without seeming to try. He was ideally cast in the role, grimly and skeptically exploring the secret of the dead boys' club hero who was in fact a rampant fascist." [...] Hepburn, he felt, was hindered by the role and her approach to it. [...] "It was Kate's last romantic glamour-girl part, and she acted with some of that artificiality she'd supposedly left behind at RKO. That first scene, floating into a room in yards and yards of draperies with these lillies—well, it was all far, far too much. I don't think I really believed in the story, it was pure hokeypokey, and her part was phony, highfalutin." [...] He particularly disliked Hepburn's entrance in the film, with the long dress and lillies. But he felt Hepburn did her best: [...] "That's awfully tricky isn't it? And doesn't she give long, piercing <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> portrait over the mantel? Well. I think she finally carried a slightly phony part because her humanity asserted itself, and her humor. They always did." [...] Overall, though, Cukor felt the film was leaden, and that it had [...] "a wax work quality". Even screenwriter Stewart eventually came to feel the film was [...] "tedious, wooden, and heavy-handed".|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E

As Vipsanius maintains his innocence, Cicero announces Caesar's successor, Antonius (Chris Cox). Listening from the crowd, Octavianus (Scott Menville), Caesar's nephew, refuses to believe Vipsanius is guilty. Meanwhile, in Germania, Agrippa receives word of Caesar's death, and orders him men to return to Rome.|$|E

[...] Side One is entitled [...] "Child" [...] and contains poems about his early childhood in southern Lincolnshire. [...] The first poem, [...] "The Greatest Discovery," [...] which <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> birth from the perspective of his older brother Tony, was also set to music by Elton John and included on Elton's eponymous second album, Elton John. [...] There are poems about Taupin's first two childhood homes, Flatters and Rowston Manor, and others about his relationship with his brother and grandfather. [...] Side Two includes a variety of poems of varying obscurity, from a marionette telling her own story to a rat catcher who falls victim to his prey. Taupin stated in interviews that he wasn't pleased with the album.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Project Reborn", Tommy {{learns that}} in order for him and Malina to stop the H.E.L.E., they need a third person to act as a conduit for their power, someone willing to {{sacrifice}} themselves to save the world. Tommy goes back in time two days and saves Noah's life, transporting him seven years into the past to when Angela tested the twins powers. Noah watches as Angela states that there was a third faceless person in her vision and seems to look right at Noah. Tommy explains to Noah that after failing to stop the H.E.L.E. [...] "a thousand times", he realized Noah was the key: if Noah acts as their conduit, they can stop it, but it will be fatal to him. Noah tells Tommy {{to take him to the}} present where he takes Malina's hand. Though Tommy protests, Noah tells him that this is his destiny and Tommy takes his hand. With the power boost from Tommy, Malina fires a blast of energy into the sky through Noah, causing him great pain but successfully shielding the planet from the H.E.L.E. and saving the world. After the future is changed, Tommy and Malina find Noah sitting on the ground, near death.
