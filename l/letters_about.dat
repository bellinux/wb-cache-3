5|$|On June 1, 1942, the US Supreme Court denied two of Waller's {{petitions}} for appeal, and {{the defense}} was soon left without further legal options. In a final attempt to win a pardon or commutation from the governor, activists staged events around the country, including a two-hour blackout of {{the lights in the}} primarily African-American neighborhood of Harlem in New York City. Governor Price's successor, Colgate Darden, received over seventeen thousand <b>letters</b> <b>about</b> the case.|$|E

5|$|Christian Georgia was {{repeatedly}} attacked starting in 1220, and in 1243 Queen Rusudan formally {{submitted to the}} Mongols, turning Georgia into a vassal state which then became a regular ally in the Mongol military conquests.

He sent his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in Karakorum, and Sempad's positive <b>letters</b> <b>about</b> the Mongols were influential in European circles.|$|E
5|$|Dilling {{was born}} Elizabeth Eloise Kirkpatrick in Chicago, Illinois. Her father, Lafayette Kirkpatrick, was a surgeon of Scotch-Irish ancestry; her mother, Elizabeth Harding, was of English and French ancestry. Her {{father died when}} she was six weeks old, after which her mother added to the family income by selling real estate. Dilling's brother, Lafayette Harding Kirkpatrick, who was seven years her senior, became wealthy by the age of 23 after {{developing}} properties in Hawaii. Dilling had an Episcopalian upbringing, and attended a Catholic girls' school. She was highly religious, and was known to send her friends 40-page <b>letters</b> <b>about</b> the Bible. Prone to bouts of depression, she went on vacations in the US, Canada, and Europe with her mother.|$|E

He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.|$|E

5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony <b>letters</b> <b>about</b> the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{expedition}} it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free Discovery from the ice. His insistence during {{the expedition}} on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command Albert Armitage, a merchant officer, was offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds, but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight, and refused. Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott's animosity rather than Shackleton's physical breakdown. Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, in public mutual civilities were preserved; Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the Nimrod Expedition, and the two were exchanging polite <b>letters</b> <b>about</b> their respective ambitions in 1909–10.|$|E
5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally <b>letters</b> <b>about</b> the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was {{still very much a}} rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept of what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E

5|$|On June 13, 1781, Nicola and the Invalid Corps {{was given}} the order by Congress to move to West Point, New York. This, however, was {{difficult}} to accomplish. On June 26, Nicola {{wrote a letter to}} George Washington that the Corps would not move until a replacement unit could take over for them. Another reason hindering the move was pay; the Corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months. A compromise was later reached between Nicola and the Board of War that six months pay would be given to the Invalid Corps. After their leave to Pennsylvania, John David Woelper, a captain of the Invalid Corps, sent a letter to Washington on July 20, 1781 claiming Nicola was treating the Corps badly. In the note, Woelper requested Nicola's arrest. Nicola sent <b>letters</b> <b>about</b> the situation to Washington, who wanted to have it settled as soon as the Corps arrived at West Point. Washington, who did not show any favoritism to either, sent both series of letters to General Alexander McDougall and asked the court in West Point to settle the matter.|$|E
