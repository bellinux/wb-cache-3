We had fun. And so, if nothing else, it was a good experience... and diva-ism, whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown {{refused to}} serve on the inaugural {{committee}} of his old political foe, Steve Beshear, when Beshear was elected governor in 2007. All of Kentucky's living former Democratic governors were invited to participate, and each accepted the invitation with the exception of Brown. Of his refusal, Brown stated [...] "I don't respect him. I don't {{want to be part of}} it. I'm not really interested in being politically correct." [...] Referring to the 1987 Democratic gubernatorial primary campaign, Brown continued, [...] "He said things that were not true, <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> raised taxes. I just never respected him after that." [...] When Beshear was reelected in 2011, Brown served as inauguration co-chair with the other former governors.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} a box office bomb in the US but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. [...] "It was just a coincidence. Nobody told me about it. I was surprised how close it was," [...] director Tim Burton continued, [...] "but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone – it was different in everything. It almost seemed <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day." [...] During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were {{way out in the}} desert and we drove around this corner of these hills and I felt <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings that looked like a bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect." [...] To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former US military personnel.|$|E
500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to put a photo on the cover, I {{wanted it to be}} more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "The Back of Love" [...] on 21 May 1982, the band spent the summer, first playing at the inaugural WOMAD festival, and then playing at various European music festivals. After the summer the band resumed {{recording}} the album at Rockfield Studios in South Wales– which had been used for the band's first two albums– and also at Amazon Studios in Liverpool. Recording the album was a slow process, de Freitas said, [...] "Porcupine {{was very hard to}} actually write and record [...] Heaven Up Here was pure confidence, we did it really quickly; {{we had a great time}} doing it– but this one was <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to drag it out of ourselves." [...] McCulloch later said that when recording the album, the mood between the band members was [...] "horrible".|$|E

500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I got a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> just talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives. Because for me, I genuinely missed his friendship, and same with Shaun [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues were {{laughing}} at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes. She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what I feel <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} officially {{canceled}} by ABC on May 13, 2010. In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{a lot of people}} watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is {{you spend a lot of}} money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, Matsoukas explained her response to Beyoncé's proposal: [...] "I was like, 'Let's get into the toxic world and what we really do that is so damaging to ourselves, {{and use it as}} a microcosm for our society'. Obviously, those ideas don't just live in the pageant world; they live in our world. And that's what the song is about. And it felt <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to take it there to make it have meaning, because otherwise it would be a superficial, preachy kind of song and visual." [...] A scene from the clip which depicts Beyoncé preparing plastic surgery, consuming diet pills and vomiting, was initially excluded from the video's final cut. However, Beyoncé decided to include the scene to fulfill her role in the clip's premise. Another scene featuring Beyoncé drowning in water while the beauty contest's host questions her life aspirations, was originally intended to depict her falling onstage. However, the scene failed to surface because of time constraints.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after hiring Kosinski, Bailey {{approached}} screenwriting duo Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, {{who accepted}} for being self-described [...] "obsessed about Tron". Horowitz later claimed {{the challenge was}} to [...] "homage the first movie, continue the story, expand it {{and take it to}} another place and open up space for new fans", and Kitsis claimed that the film would start a whole new mythology [...] "of which we're only scratching the surface". Horowitz and Kitsis first created a story outline, and developed and fine-tuned the plot with Bailey and Kosinski across a period of two days in La Quinta. The writers also consulted Lisberger, to view Trons creator input on the story. Lisberger gave his blessing, particularly as he has a son the same age as Sam, which Kitsis stated that [...] "was <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> tapped into something he was feeling without even realizing it." [...] The Pixar team contributed with rewrites for additional shooting after being shown a rough cut in March 2010, which helped in particular to the development of Sam's story line.|$|E
500|$|During {{his ninth}} season in 1966, Taylor did not sign a new one-year {{contract}} and instead played out his option; {{he made no}} secret that it was likely his last season with the Packers. He caught a career-high 41 passes that year but recorded the fewest rushing yards since his second season. The Packers finished atop the Western Division with a 12–2 record and defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the 1966 NFL Championship Game for their fourth NFL title in six years. In January 1967, Taylor and the Packers played in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, known retroactively as Super Bowl I, in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. They easily defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 35–10. Taylor was the top rusher of the game with 56 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} on a Packer Sweep play, with his score being the first rushing touchdown in Super Bowl history. [...] "It was just good blocking on a weak-side sweep play," [...] said Taylor of his touchdown run. [...] "It's a cakewalk when you get the blocking. It was just <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been doing the last five or six years." [...] The game was his final with the Packers.|$|E

500|$|Co-executive {{producers}} David H. Goodman and Andrew Kreisberg wrote [...] "Unearthed", while producer Frederick E. O. Toye {{worked as}} the episode director. [...] "Unearthed" [...] {{was the last}} episode filmed during the first season schedule. Although it was filmed during the first season, [...] "Unearthed" [...] aired during the following season on Monday, January 11, 2010, a departure from its normal timeslot on Thursdays. Actor Joshua Jackson explained the move in April 2009, [...] " [...] for boring reasons. They only had 22 airdates for our show this year, but they ordered 23 episodes, so we shot one for next year, which is just silly TV network stuff. It's not for any cool reason <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> something we needed in New York that we couldn't shoot elsewhere. It's just an accounting issue." [...] That same month, executive producer/showrunner Jeff Pinkner further commented on the episode chronology for the new season, [...] "It won't be the first episode, and it probably won't be the second, but it'll be somewhere in the first batch of episodes. It's a stand-alone, but it still honors the condition that we know it will fall into the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{backed the}} tenth austerity package which went before Parliament on 16 July. The package {{was the first}} in a series of prior actions necessary for negotiations to open up over bailout funding worth 86billion euros. The package came in two parts, with the first being approved on 16 July, and the second on 23 July. The legislation included a rise in VAT across several goods and services, the abolition of the VAT discount for Greek islands, a corporation tax rise from 26% to 29%, a luxury tax on cars, boats and swimming pools, an end to early retirement by 2022, and an increase in the retirement age to 67. Tsakalotos said on 16 July debate, [...] "I don't know if we did the right thing, however, I do know that we felt <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no other choice but do what we did." [...] The contentious vote was opposed by 109 out of 201 members of the Central Committee of Syriza, and 32 Syriza MPs voted against the proposals on 16 July. It also led to a cabinet reshuffle on 17 July, but Tsakalotos retained his role as Minister of Finance.|$|E
500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack of a better word, sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E

Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in my head with just the idea of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego.

[...] Manson suggested calling guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker {{to get together and}} write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in Los Angeles, where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and [...] "started fucking around." [...] "We were all pleased to notice on the first day there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one telling us what to do. We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms." [...] In that session, the group wrote the song [...] "Battle In Me".|$|E

The following month, they flew to Los Angeles, California and filmed a second version with Lionel C. Martin, the director whom they had previously worked with on most of their early videos. [...] "It didn't feel <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> evolved," [...] Thomas expressed. Reid and the trio decided to scrap both versions as they thought the two didn't show any of their growth as women, while the images being too [...] "grimy," [...] suffered from bad lighting problems, including the first one didn't even have enough footage to finish a song's verse. Martin long after released his version on Vimeo in early 2013. The [...] "blue-tinged" [...] clip shows the girls sneaking away from their unsuspecting boyfriends to cheat with others while other scenes show them performing in front of trucks and cars. Nevertheless, Fact magazine noticed the song's infidelity theme was loosely followed on the clip's narrative while Priya Elan from NME explained the clip overall might have been [...] "too urban" [...] for MTV. [...] "Not only is this 'Creep' more genre specific, it also feels more dated," [...] he added.|$|E
