5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat <b>lyssavirus</b> and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat <b>lyssavirus</b> is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (<b>Lyssavirus)</b> after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Bat {{caregivers}} are {{not only}} specially trained in techniques to rescue and rehabilitate bats, {{but they are also}} vaccinated against rabies. Although the chance of contracting the rabies-like Australian bat <b>lyssavirus</b> is extremely small, bat caregivers are inoculated for their own protection.|$|E
25|$|Rhabdoviruses are {{a diverse}} family of single stranded, {{negative}} sense RNA viruses that infect {{a wide range}} of hosts, from plants and insects, to fish and mammals. The Rhaboviridae family consists of six genera, two of which, cytorhabdoviruses and nucleorhabdoviruses, only infect plants. Novirhabdoviruses infect fish, and vesiculovirus, <b>lyssavirus</b> and ephemerovirus infect mammals, fish and invertebrates. The family includes pathogens such as rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and potato yellow dwarf virus that are of public health, veterinary, and agricultural significance.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lyssaviruses</b> cause acute, {{progressive}} encephalitis in mammals. Current rabies vaccines offer {{protection against}} the <b>lyssaviruses,</b> with the notable exceptions of Mokola virus (MOKV), Lagos bat virus (LBV) and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV). Here we describe the cross-protective and cross-reactive immune responses induced by experimental recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding the glycoprotein genes of rabies virus (RABV), MOKV and WCBV, either singly or in dual combinations. Constructs expressing a single glycoprotein gene protected mice against lethal intracranial challenge with homologous virus. Similarly, recombinants expressing glycoprotein genes from two different <b>lyssaviruses</b> offered mice protection against both homologous viruses. VNAb induced by vaccines that included a MOKV glycoprotein gene cross-neutralized LBV, but not WCBV. We concluded that a single recombinant poxvirus-vectored vaccine including MOKV and RABV glycoprotein genes, should be a major addition to available rabies biologics and should offer broad protection against all of the <b>lyssaviruses,</b> except WCBV...|$|R
50|$|The {{mammalian}} disease rabies {{is caused}} by <b>lyssaviruses,</b> of which several have been identified.|$|R
50|$|Classic rabies virus, is {{prevalent}} {{throughout most}} of the world and can be carried by any warm blooded mammal. The other <b>lyssaviruses</b> have much less diversity in carriers. Only select hosts can carry each of these viral species. Also, these other species are particular only to a specific geographic area. Bats are known to be an animal vector for all identified <b>lyssaviruses</b> except the Mokola virus.|$|R
25|$|Rabies {{is caused}} by lyssaviruses, {{including}} the rabies virus and Australian bat <b>lyssavirus.</b> Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human. Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes {{into contact with the}} eyes, mouth, or nose. Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved. More than 99% of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites. In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs. Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies. The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Other viral {{diseases}} {{which can}} be carried by fruit bats include Australian bat <b>lyssavirus</b> and henipavirus (notably Hendra virus and Nipah virus), both of which can prove fatal to humans. [...] These bats {{have been shown to}} infect other species (specifically horses) with Hendra virus in Australian regions. Later, humans became infected with Hendra virus after being exposed to horse bodily fluids and excretions. The discovery of this Australian bat <b>lyssavirus</b> was in 1996, before this all bats on all continents, except Australia, had been recorded to carry this rabies-like disease.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} phylogeographic groups of lyssaviruses: 1 -3. Rabies belongs to group 1, along with Aravan <b>lyssavirus,</b> Australian bat <b>lyssavirus,</b> Bokeloh bat <b>lyssavirus,</b> Duvenhage virus, European bat <b>lyssavirus</b> 1 and 2, Gannoruwa bat <b>lyssavirus,</b> Irkut <b>lyssavirus</b> and Khujand <b>lyssavirus.</b> Members of group 2 include Lagos bat virus, Mokola virus and Shimoni bat virus. Members of group 3 include Ikoma <b>lyssavirus</b> and Lleida bat <b>lyssavirus.</b> Phyogenetic {{studies suggest that}} the {{original}} hosts of these viruses were bats. The greater antigenic diversity of lyssaviruses from Africa has led to the assumption that Africa was the origin of these viruses. An examination of 153 viruses collected between 1956 and 2015 from various geographic locations has instead suggested a Palearctic origin (85% likelihood) for these viruses. Date estimates (95% likelihood) for the most recent common ancestor were very broad - between 3,995 and 166,820 years before present - which suggests there is further work to be done in this area. Although bats evolved in the Palearctic, their origins antedate that of the lyassaviruses by millions of years, which argues against their co-speciation.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other <b>lyssaviruses,</b> MOKV {{is able to}} {{replicate}} inside mosquito cells in vitro, suggesting that insects may be implicated in MOKV transmission.|$|R
40|$|Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines {{produced}} by host cells {{in response to}} the infection with pathogens. By binding to the corre-sponding receptors, IFNs trigger different pathways to block intracellular replication and growth of pathogens and to impede the infection of surrounding cells. Due to their key role in host defense against viral infections, as well as for clinical therapies, the IFN responses and regulationmechanisms are well studied. However, studies of type I IFNs have mainly focused on alpha interferon (IFN-) and IFN- subtypes. Knowledge of IFN- and IFN- is limited. Moreover, most studies are performed in humans or mouse models but not in the original host of zoonotic pathogens. Bats are important reservoirs and transmitters of zoonotic viruses such as <b>lyssaviruses.</b> A few studies have shown an antiviral activity of IFNs in fruit bats. However, the function of type I IFNs against <b>lyssaviruses</b> in bats has not been studied yet. Here, IFN- and IFN- genes from the European serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, were cloned and functionally characterized. E. serotinus IFN- and IFN- genes are intronless and well conserved betweenmicrochiropteran species. The promoter regions of both genes contain essential regulatory elements for tran-scription factors. In vitro studies indicated a strong activation of IFN signaling by recombinant IFN-, whereas IFN- displayed weaker activation. Noticeably, both IFNs inhibit to different extents the replication of different <b>lyssaviruses</b> in susceptible bat cell lines. The present study provides functional data on the innate host defense against <b>lyssaviruses</b> in endangered European bats...|$|R
40|$|The {{continued}} {{detection of}} zoonotic viral infections in bats {{has led to}} the microbial fauna of these mammals being studied at a greater level than ever before. Whilst numerous pathogens have been discovered in bat species, infection with <b>lyssaviruses</b> is of particular significance from a zoonotic perspective as, where human infection has been reported, it is invariably fatal. Here we review the detection of <b>lyssaviruses</b> within different bat species and overview what is understood regarding their maintenance and transmission following both experimental and natural infection. We discuss the relevance of these pathogens as zoonotic agents and the threat of newly discovered viruses to human populations...|$|R
50|$|A rabies-like <b>lyssavirus,</b> called European bat <b>lyssavirus</b> 2, was {{identified}} in bats in 2003. In 2002, {{there was a}} fatal case in a bat handler involving infection with European bat <b>lyssavirus</b> 2; infection was probably acquired from a bite from a bat in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|Australian bat <b>lyssavirus</b> (ABLV) (initially named pteropid <b>lyssavirus</b> PLV) is a {{zoonotic}} virus {{closely related}} to rabies virus. It was first identified in a 5-month-old juvenile black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) collected near Ballina in northern New South Wales, Australia in January 1995 during a national surveillance program for the recently identified Hendra virus. ABLV is the seventh member of the <b>lyssavirus</b> genus (which includes rabies virus) and the only <b>lyssavirus</b> family member present in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Bokeloh bat <b>lyssavirus</b> (BBLV) is negative-sense, {{single-stranded}} RNA virus of {{the genus}} <b>Lyssavirus</b> first isolated from a Natterer's Bat (Myotis nattereri) found in Bokeloh, Lower Saxony, Germany in 2010.|$|E
50|$|A bat-borne {{virus is}} any virus whose primary {{reservoir}} is any species of bat. The viruses species include coronaviruses, hantaviruses, <b>lyssaviruses,</b> lassa virus, Henipavirus, Ebola virus and Marburg virus. Bat-borne viruses {{are among the}} most important of the emerging viruses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lyssaviruses</b> have helical symmetry, {{so their}} {{infectious}} particles are approximately cylindrical in shape. They {{are characterized by}} an extremely broad host spectrum ranging from plants to insects and mammals; human-infecting viruses more commonly have icosahedral symmetry and take shapes approximating regular polyhedra.|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnlike {{any other}} human infection, {{encephalitis}} caused by dog rabies virus is always fatal. Rabies and other <b>lyssaviruses</b> {{have been found}} in unexpected places, and human disease, especially paralytic rabies, has gone unrecognized. Evidence is emerging that rabies-related bat <b>lyssaviruses</b> are enzootic across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, but none has been detected in the Americas. The epidemiology and origins of African <b>lyssaviruses</b> are discussed. Ideal rabies prophylaxis (pre-exposure immunization followed by post-exposure booster vaccination) has proved 100 % effective; hence all human deaths result from failure of prevention. Rabies vaccines of known quality are unaffordable for the majority in Africa. Although intradermal regimens requiring < 40 % of the usual vaccine dose are economical and are recommended by the World Health Organization, several problems have inhibited their use. A new, simplified, economical post-exposure vaccine regimen that uses an initial dose of intradermal injections at four sites overcomes many of the difficulties of the previous methods: it is at least as immunogenic as the standard intramuscular course of tissue-culture vaccine; is safer in inexperienced hands; requires fewer than two ampoules of vaccine and only three instead of five clinic visits. Recent data should increase the confidence of physicians to use the World Health Organization-accredited rabies vaccines more efficiently and at lower cost...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lyssavirus</b> is a genus of RNA viruses in {{the family}} Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales. Humans, mammals, and {{vertebrates}} serve as natural hosts. The genus <b>Lyssavirus</b> (from Lyssa, the Greek goddess of madness, rage, and frenzy) includes the rabies virus traditionally associated with that disease.|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{biological}} {{properties of the}} viruses, these species are further subdivided into phylogroups 1 and 2. Phylogroup 1 includes genotypes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7, while phylogroup 2 includes genotypes 2 and 3. The nucleocapsid region of <b>lyssavirus</b> is fairly highly conserved from genotype to genotype across both phylogroups; experimental data {{have shown that the}} only <b>lyssavirus</b> strains used in vaccinations are those from the first species (i.e. classic rabies) leaving their efficacy for some non-rabies <b>Lyssavirus</b> diseases (e.g. Mokola virus) in question.|$|E
50|$|Shimoni bat {{virus is}} a <b>lyssavirus</b> which was {{discovered}} in Kenya in 2009.It is bears significant similarities to the <b>lyssavirus</b> Lagos bat virus.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{generate}} complete genome sequences of Aravan (ARAV), Khujand (KHUV), Irkut (IRKV) and West Caucasian bat (WCBV) viruses, and to compare them with genomes of other <b>lyssaviruses.</b> We focused on RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (L) and non-coding regions, because other genes of these viruses have been described previously. The L protein is organized into six conserved blocks (I-VI), previously detected in all Mononegavirales. Furthermore, <b>lyssaviruses</b> have two additional conserved regions, L 1 and L 2, located in the COOH part of the L. L 1 may be responsible for methylation of viral mRNA cap structures, whereas the significance of L 2 is unclear. Phylogenetic patterns based on the L are similar to those described for the nucleoprotein. The WCBV is the most divergent member of the genus. Besides phylogeny, it has a short trailer region (57 nucleotides versus 69 - 70 nucleotides in other <b>lyssaviruses)</b> and different intergenic region lengths, including an exceptionally long non-coding region of the glycoprotein (697 nucleotides) containing a potential open reading frame of 180 nucleotides. The absence of a flanking transcription initiation signal, as well as Northern and Western blot data, suggests that this region is not independently transcribed but is a part of G mRNA...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{retroviral}} pseudotypes as a vector for {{gene therapy}} is well documented. Recently, {{we have developed}} pseudotypes to determine neutralising antibody titres for highly pathogenic viruses. This removes the need for high containment facilities and allows small volumes of serum to be used. G-protein sequences from the rabies isolate CVS- 11 and European bat <b>lyssaviruses</b> were cloned and co-expressed with lentiviral gag-pol and GFP or luciferase reporter genes. The pseudotypes infected a number of target cell lines and produced titres almost equivalent to VSV-G protein pseudotypes. Neutralisation assays using blinded sera and pseudotyped CVS- 11 detected positive and negative samples with 100 % specificity and sensitivity and correlated with the OIE FAVN (R 2 = 0. 89). It is possible to detect cross-neutralising antibodies to bat <b>lyssaviruses</b> pseudotypes...|$|R

40|$|All <b>lyssaviruses</b> cause fatal {{encephalitis}} in mammals. There {{is sufficient}} antigenic variation within the genus to cause variable vaccine efficacy, but this variation {{is difficult to}} characterize quantitatively: sequence analysis cannot yet provide detailed antigenic information, and antigenic neutralization data have been refractory to high-resolution robust interpretation. Here, we address these issues by using state-of-the-art antigenic anal-yses to generate a high-resolution antigenic map of a global panel of 25 <b>lyssaviruses.</b> We compared the calculated antigenic distances with viral glycoprotein ectodomain sequence data. Although 67 % of antigenic variation was predictable from the glycoprotein amino acid sequence, there are in some cases substantial differences between genetic and antigenic distances, thus highlighting the risk of inferring antigenic relation-ships solely from sequence data at this time. These differences included epidemiologically important antigenic differences between vaccine strains and wild-type rabies viruses. Further, we quantitatively assessed the antigenic relationships measured by using rabbit, mouse, and human sera, validating the use of nonhuma...|$|R

40|$|A novel, linear B-cell epitope {{has been}} {{identified}} at the N terminus of the rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein. Screening of a phage-display library demonstrated that two glycoprotein-specific mAbs recognized a conserved sequence, WxxxDI, which aligned between aa 14 and 19 of the mature glycoprotein. Screening of truncated glycoprotein fragments with both mAbs confirmed {{the location of the}} epitope in the N-terminal region. Alignment of amino acid sequences from a range of RABV isolates indicated that the site was conserved in most viruses. Alignment with representatives of other <b>lyssaviruses</b> suggested that it is conserved within phylogroup I, which includes the European bat <b>lyssaviruses,</b> but not phylogroup II. A 12 aa synthetic peptide of this epitope was recognized by both mAbs and sera from a subset of rabies-vaccinated dogs. In a multimeric form, the peptide could induce an epitope-specific response following immunization in rabbits and mice. The rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein is one of five proteins that are encoded by the virus’s single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome and is the only surface-exposed protein.

Diffraction data have been recorded from crystals of native and selenomethionine-labelled LAG M to 2. 75 and 3. 0 A resolution, respectively.
