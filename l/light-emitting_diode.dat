5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED).|$|E
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E

5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti tank gun sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E
5|$|When {{the shuffle}} format was introduced, the Hot Seats and {{corresponding}} monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium, and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.|$|E

40|$|Organic <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> {{have been}} {{recently}} focused for flexible display and solid-state lighting applications {{and so much}} effort {{has been devoted to}} achieve highly efficient organic <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes.</b> Here, we improve the efficiency of inverted polymer <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> by introducing a spontaneously formed ripple-shaped nanostructure of &# 8203;ZnO and applying an amine-based polar solvent treatment to the nanostructure of &# 8203;ZnO. The nanostructure of the &# 8203;ZnO layer improves the extraction of the waveguide modes inside the device structure, and a &# 8203; 2 -ME+&# 8203;EA interlayer enhances the electron injection and hole blocking in addition to reducing exciton quenching between the polar-solvent-treated &# 8203;ZnO and the emissive layer. Therefore, our optimized inverted polymer <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> have a luminous efficiency of 61. 6 &# 8201;cd&# 8201;A&# 8722; 1 and an external quantum efficiency of 17. 8 %, which are the highest efficiency values among polymer-based fluorescent <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> that contain a single emissive layer. close...|$|R
