Some animals use it to mark their territories. Human urine and human feces are collectively referred to as human waste; as sewage, they require sewage treatment in places where population density is high. Livestock urine and feces similarly require proper management if the <b>livestock</b> <b>population</b> density is high. Such management is part of ecological sanitation.|$|E

Cattle, water buffalo, horses, mules, and donkeys are also raised in China, and dairy has recently been encouraged by the government, even though approximately 92.3% of the adult population is affected by some level of lactose intolerance.|$|E

30|$|Kgalagadi South is {{characterized}} by frequent normal to mild droughts and infrequent moderate droughts as indicated by a high rainfall coefficient of variation and low SPI indexes. The impact of recurring droughts tends to lead to decline in <b>livestock</b> <b>populations,</b> particularly goats. The weak association between <b>livestock</b> <b>populations,</b> especially cattle and rainfall variability, suggests that management practices are buffering the impacts of climate shocks. Current pastoral farmers’ adaptation strategies include destocking, feed supplementation and mobility. The sustainability of mobility as an adaptation practice is questionable due to continued promotion of the Tribal Grazing Land Policy, which will result in most communal grazing land being managed as private ranches. Hence, {{there is a need}} for an improved drought management policy that would complement pastoral farmers’ adaptation practices and improve resilience to drought.|$|R

40|$|The {{extent and}} pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between closely spaced markers contain {{information}} about population history, including past population size and selection history. Selection signatures {{can be identified}} by comparing the LD surrounding a putative selected allele at a locus to the putative non-selected allele. In <b>livestock</b> <b>populations,</b> locations of selection signatures identified in this way should be correlated with QTL affecting production traits, as the populations have been under strong artificial selection for these traits. We used a dense SNP map of bovine chromosome 6 to characterize the pattern of LD on this chromosome in Norwegian Red cattle, a breed which has been strongly selected for milk production. The pattern of LD was generally consistent with strong selection in regions containing QTL affecting milk production traits, including a strong selection signature in a region containing a mutation known to affect milk production. The results demonstrate that in <b>livestock</b> <b>populations,</b> the origin of selection signatures will often be QTL for livestock production traits, and illustrate the value of selection signatures in uncovering new mutations with potential effects on quantitative traits...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} modelling the spatio-temporal spread of {{foot and mouth disease}} through feral animal and unfenced <b>livestock</b> <b>populations.</b> We used a susceptible-infected-recovered model, implemented in a cellular automata framework, to assess the spread of FMD across two regions of Queensland, Australia. Following a sensitivity analysis on the infectious states, scenario analyses were conducted using feral pigs only as the susceptible population, and then with the addition of livestock, and initiated in the wet season and in the dry season. The results indicate that, depending on the season the outbreak is initiated, and without the implementation of control measures, an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease around Winton could continue unchecked, while an outbreak around Cape York may die out naturally. The approach explicitly incorporates the spatial relationships between the populations through which the disease spreads and provides a framework by which the spread of disease outbreaks can be explored through varying the model parameters. It highlights the emergence and importance of spatio-temporal patterns, something that previous modelling of FMD in feral animal and unfenced <b>livestock</b> <b>populations</b> has lacked...|$|R
