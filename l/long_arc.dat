It can be caused by excessively high current, a <b>long</b> <b>arc,</b> or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E

500|$|As {{moved into}} the Australian region, Rewa began to move in a <b>long</b> <b>arc</b> to the {{northwest}} {{and then to the}} north, and on 13January, both the JTWC and the Papua New Guinea National Weather Service reported that the system had re-intensified into a tropical cyclone around Papua New Guinea's southern islands. Later that day, Rewa executed a sharp clockwise turn near Tagula Island and started to move towards the southeast and the BoM's area of responsibility while gradually intensifying further. During 15January, the BoM reported that the system had re-intensified into a category 3severe tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1hurricane again. Later that day, the system started to rapidly intensify as an upper level trough approached the system. During the next day the JTWC reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 230km/h (145mph). The BoM then reported later that day, that Rewa had peaked with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 205km/h (125mph), which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After it had peaked in intensity the system recurved towards the south-southwest, and started to gradually weaken. By 18January the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a tropical storm, while throughout that day the BoM assessed Rewa as a category 3severe tropical cyclone. During the next day, the BoM reported that Rewa had weakened into a category 2tropical cyclone as it recurved and started to move towards the south-east about 265km (165mi) to the east of Mackay, Queensland. Over {{the next couple of days}} the system moved towards the south-southeast along the Queensland coast while maintaining its intensity. During 21January, the BoM and the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened below cyclone strength, as the system moved back into the South Pacific basin for the third and final time. Rewa's remnants were last noted late on 23January, by New Zealand's Metservice, bringing heavy rain to New Zealand, while dissipating over water about [...] to the east of Wellington, New Zealand.|$|E

From here, the highway and heads east, curving through the hilly terrain of southeastern Seminole County. The highway passes through the town of Sasakwa [...] east of US-377. At Sasakwa, the road turns north, crossing the Little River northeast of town and generally paralleling the Seminole–Hughes County county line. The highway then bisects the town of Wewoka, intersecting US-270 and concurring with its business loop. SH-56 also serves as the eastern terminus of SH-59 in Wewoka. North of the town, SH-56 intersects with SH-9. The highway continues north, intersecting SH-99A in Cromwell and interchanging with I-40 near the unincorporated community of |Schoolton.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a sample of}} numerical models for clusters of galaxies and employ these to investigate their capability of imaging background sources into <b>long</b> <b>arcs.</b> Emphasis is laid on the statistics of these arcs. We study cross sections for arc length and length-to-width ratio and optical depths for these arc properties, we examine the distribution of arc widths and curvature radii among <b>long</b> <b>arcs,</b> and we compare these results to predictions based on simplified (radially symmetric) cluster models. We find that the capability of the numerically modeled clusters to produce <b>long</b> <b>arcs</b> is larger by about two orders of magnitude than that of spherically symmetric cluster models with the same observable parameters (core radii and velocity dispersions), {{and that they are}} similarly efficient as singular isothermal spheres with the same velocity-dispersion distribution. The influence of source ellipticity is also investigated; we find that the optical depth for arcs with a length-to-width ratio >or#approx# 10 is significantly larger for elliptical than for circular sources. Given these results, we conclude that spherically symmetric lens models for galaxy clusters, adapted to the observable parameters of these clusters, grossly underestimate the frequency of <b>long</b> <b>arcs.</b> We attribute this difference between numerically constructed and simplified analytical lens models to the abundance and the extent of intrinsic asymmetry and to substructure in galaxy clusters.

60|$|It {{seemed that}} the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon {{speaking}} a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised {{of the existence of}} Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a <b>long</b> <b>arc</b> in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{reconstruction}} {{of the image of}} a high redshift source galaxy responsible for multiple <b>long</b> <b>arcs</b> in the z = 0. 4 cluster 0024 + 1654 is obtained by inverse lensing. Deep B and I imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, under NASA contract NAS 5 - 26555) enables high resolution of the arcs due to strong gravitational lensing of the background source. The gravitational lens in the foreground cluster is thus used to obtain a magnified view of the distant source. Four strongly lensed images of the source lead to a unique reconstruction. Each of the <b>long</b> <b>arcs,</b> when unlensed, leads to the same reconstructed source image exhibiting a beaded ring-like morphology. The U luminosity of the ring alone is equivalent to a normal galaxy. This is likely a galaxy in formation. Comment: 16 pages (aaspp. sty), full text & figures available at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{complexity}} of two Inverse Shortest Paths (ISP) problems with integer arc lengths and the requirement for uniquely determined shortest paths. Given a collection of paths in a directed graph, the task is to find positive integer arc lengths such that the given paths are uniquely determined shortest paths between their respective terminals. The first problem seeks for arc lengths that minimize {{the length of the}} longest of the prescribed paths. In the second problem, the length of the <b>longest</b> <b>arc</b> is to be minimized. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimal longest path length within a factor less than 8 / 7 or the minimal <b>longest</b> <b>arc</b> length within a factor less than 9 / 8. This answers the (previously) open question whether these problems are NP-hard or not. We also present a simple algorithm that achieves an O(|V |) -approximation guarantee for both variants.

Our results imply that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given path set can be realized with a real shortest path routing protocol such as OSPF, IS-IS, or RIP...|$|R
