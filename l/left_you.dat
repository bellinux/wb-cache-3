5|$|Since I <b>Left</b> <b>You</b> is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or <b>left.</b> <b>You</b> know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That <b>left</b> <b>you</b> with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

5|$|To promote Since I <b>Left</b> <b>You</b> the Avalanches {{organised}} {{their first}} Australian head-lining tour in October 2000 planning {{to head to}} all the capital cities. All dates on the tour were sold out. In their Brisbane show, Seltmann broke his leg in an on-stage collision with bass guitarist and singer, Tony Di Blasi. In Januaryâ€“February 2001, the Avalanches toured with the Big Day Out festival in Australia, visiting four capital cities. While on tour in Europe, Seltmann broke his other leg, thereafter {{the rest of the}} tour's shows were DJ sets. The British dance music magazine Muzik awarded the Avalanches as best live act.|$|E

It was first released for streaming on Apple Music on 1 July 2016, and saw a full release a week later on 8 July. It was issued through Modular Recordings, Astralwerks, XL Recordings, and EMI.

500|$|As Since I <b>Left</b> <b>You</b> {{was being}} recorded, the Avalanches had trouble {{choosing}} songs {{to be released}} as singles, finding them not sounding as good outside {{the context of the}} album. On 13 September 1999 they issued [...] "Electricity" [...] as a four-track 12" [...] vinyl single in Australia (on Modular Recordings) and as a two-track 7" [...] vinyl single in the United Kingdom (on Rex Records). â€“ The Avalanches}} â€“ The Avalanches}} Chater felt that Modular was very patient with the group releasing the record.

The initial release date for Since I <b>Left</b> <b>You</b> was going to be 11 September; however, it was delayed due to issues with sample clearance. On 27 November the album was issued in Australia with plans to have a world release in early 2001.

What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct: You either trust your writer or you don't." ...|$|E
