25|$|In June 2011, a {{clinical}} trial of ipilimumab plus dacarbazine combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful that perhaps 10–20% of patients could <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. Some serious side-effects of revving up the immune system were seen in some patients. A course of treatment costs $120,000. The drug's brandname is Yervoy.|$|E

2500|$|There is, however, {{one major}} {{advantage}} that red dwarfs have over other stars as abodes for life: they <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time.

Red dwarfs, by contrast, could live for trillions of years because their nuclear reactions are far slower than those of larger stars, meaning that life would have longer to evolve and survive.|$|E

For example, he publicly declared that children were not to be kidnapped or mistreated and allegedly arranged the assassination of at least one kidnapper. Perhaps the most potent ideological weapon was the cult of violence, which sometimes bordered on a kind of death wish, as Cutolo once wrote: [...] "the value of a life doesn’t consist of its length but in the use made of it; often people <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time without living very much. Consider this, my friends, as long as you are on this earth everything depends on your will-power, not on the number of years you have lived." ...|$|E

And it’s not just oil, too—it’s water, it’s land, it’s everything. It’s greed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The area of land {{along the}} West Branch and Larrys Creek was {{previously}} known as [...] "Level Corner". Many {{of the early}} settlers were attracted to this area of fertile farmland. Isaac Smith migrated to Piatt Township, from Chester County. Smith was a millwright and farmer. Robert Covenhoven was another prominent early settler. He was {{a veteran of the}} American Revolution having fought at the Battles of Trenton and Princeton. Covenhoven had returned to the West Branch Valley just before the Big Runaway. Upon hearing of the approaching raiding Indians and Loyalist, Covenhoven rode west along the ridge of Bald Eagle Mountain to warn settlers at Fort Antes (opposite what is now Jersey Shore) and {{the western part of the}} valley. Covenhoven is listed as a Fair Play Man and one of the signers of the Tiadaghton Declaration of Independence. Following the Great Runaway Covenhoven continued to serve as a scout for the Patriot forces on the Pennsylvania Frontier. At the conclusion of the war he settled with his wife at Level Corner.

In the series finale Elena is awoken and she ends up choosing Damon in the series finale and they <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and happy life together. Earning her happy ending.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that, the Saas {{was once a}} living tree. The narrative {{went on to say}} that, women who wanted to give birth went to it because it was considered to be a lucky tree in the wider Serer mythology and legend. Newborns were also presented to the Saas in order to bring good luck, long life, good health and prosperity to the child’s life. In similarity, if an animal went near Saas it was destined to <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> life. According to the myth, the Saas loved human beings and perhaps too much. It would sometimes lower its thorny ends so people can give it a hug. Anyone who saw that immediately knew the Saas wanted their company. It did not move until sunset. It healed the wounded by its barks being rubbed on the bleeding wound. The Saas eventually became [...] exhausting for people when it started to abuse its supernatural powers. It is generally viewed as the tree that fell in disgrace. The ancients [...] called it by the name Nyas, a name which has two meanings: scar or clot. The Myth of Saas still retains a certain degree of importance especially when it concerns the need for vital energy such as: [...] during [...] growth, at the time of marriage, in sickness and after death. It is also viewed by many as the fertility tree. In the Serer representation of the Universe, the Myth of Saas forms part of the geometric diagram.|$|E
