40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> is {{a method}} of {{improving}} evaporator performance by supplying the evaporator with more liquid than is evaporated. The excess liquid, which is generally provided {{by means of an}} externally driven, mechanical pump, eliminates dryout and increases overall heat transfer coefficient in the evaporator. <b>Liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> is common in large-scale industrial refrigeration systems, where the additional cost and complexity of the pump is justified by the large size of the system. However, <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> has yet to gain widespread application in small-scale systems, such as residential or automotive air conditioning. The use of an ejector to provide the recirculation effect rather than a mechanical pump can help <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> systems gain consideration for small-scale systems. However, the performance of <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> cycles with and without ejectors for small-scale systems has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical study of the effect of <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> on the performance of air condition cycles.

Perlite and glass beads were utilized as media in eight and two biofilters, respectively. Continuous <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> flow rates ranged from 2. 7 - 5. 4, 5. 4 - 13, or 13 - 26 L/h. Two perlite biofilters were operated with the liquid recirculated at 13 L/h intermittently for 10 min/hr. The empty bed residence time was 30 s in each reactor. Gas flow rate was 7 L/min for each bioreactor, {{and the full}} media depth was 50 cm. ^ The experimental results showed that ethylene removal efficiencies increased with microbial adaptation and growth as time elapsed, but the characteristics of ethylene removal over time was varied with reactor types. One of the two perlite biotrickling filters with low <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> flow increased ethylene removal to 90 % due to low mass transfer limitations. However, other filters with medium, high, or intermittent <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> flow or with glass beads media reached only about 30 - 70 % probably due to relatively high mass transfer limitation, poor distribution of nutrition supplies, and low specific surface areas of media, respectively. On the other hand, ammonia was almost completely removed by each reactor. No significant effect of ammonia loading rates or removal efficiency on ethylene removal efficiencies was observed. Mathematical simulation was utilized to predict ethylene degradation and understand the relevant biofiltration mechanisms. The logistic model was used to fit the S-shape increase of ethylene removal efficiencies over time, and the numerical model was to analyze physic-chemical and biological mechanisms related to ethylene removal in each reactor. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of twin-screw pumps {{for moving}} fluids {{is not new}} {{technology}} but its application to wet gas compression (high gas volume fraction [GVF]) is still considered relatively new. There are many advantages for using twin-screw pumps for oil field applications; three of the immediate improvements include reducing hardware costs, reducing well bore pressure, and producing a pressure boost to move the product to a central collection facility. While there are many advantages to using twin-screw pumps in wet gas applications, there are some problems that have been encountered while operating at high GVFs. When operating at high GVF, over 95 percent twin-screw pumps experience a severe loss of efficiency and an increase of operating temperature. A common way {{to increase the efficiency}} while operating in the high GVF range includes adding a <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system where a portion of liquid is stored downstream of the pump and is injected into the pump inlet. These systems lower the effective GVF of the multiphase fluid below 95 percent in order to increase the pump efficiency. The first objective is to characterize the performance of a twin-screw pump fitted with a <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system while operating under high GVF conditions. The second objective is to investigate the transient heat rise associated with high GVF operation. While traditional twin-screw pumps can be fitted with a <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system to allow them to operate under high GVF conditions the pumps themselves are not optimized for wet gas compression and still suffer performance penalties. The results of this investigation show that the <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system can allow the pump to operate under high GVF but the heat added to the system reduces the systems efficiency. Without a method of removing the heat generated in the pumping process the pump will not run at its optimal efficiency.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is used {{to convert}} unusable waste such as livestock manure, wastewater, solid waste and food waste into valuable end products such as biogas. Wastewater treatment plants are required to intensify wastewater digestion process using existing digester capacity by processing concentrated sludge, which affects digester mixing performance. There have been many studies on digester hydrodynamics, but digester mixing is still carried out based on empirical evidence rather than fluid mechanical studies. The main objective of this work {{is to determine the}} optimum mixing method/s for digesters using a hydrodynamic study. This involved a model liquid to represent sludge. Flow visualisation and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) are employed in this work. Also, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are developed and validated using flow visualisation experimental data. All experiments were conducted in a 0. 19 m diameter cylindrical tank. Three mixing systems, namely mechanical mixing, <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> and gas sparging, were implemented. Xanthan gum Keltrol-T (XGKT) solution was selected as the model liquid because its rheological characteristics are similar to digester sludge. Specific power inputs ranging from 3. 5 to 10. 5 W/m 3 were employed. Dye tracer and brine solution were used as tracers in flow visualisation and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) techniques respectively. Inactive mixing volume was determined by measuring the volume of the coloured and low conductivity regions in flow visualisation and ERT experiments, respectively. Experimental results show that the total inactive volume in the model digester decreases with increasing mixing time and reaches a plateau. Larger inactive volume was found in solutions with higher apparent viscosity regardless of the mixing mode used. Increasing power input beyond a certain value was found to have no influence in the reduction of inactive volume in <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> and gas sparging. In case of mechanical mixing, a threshold power input is required to achieve an acceptable value of the active volume. Experiments with <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> and gas sparging systems were conducted with different nozzle orientations to study their effect on inactive volume reduction. Downward jet in <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system produces the largest inactive volume, and upward and angled jets lead to smaller inactive volumes. In gas sparging system, the downward sparger with a low tank bottom clearance leads to the smallest inactive volume. Therefore, the position and orientation of fluid inlet nozzles are very important in the design and operation of digesters processing thicker sludge. ERT can be used to estimate the shape and size of the active mixing region. It provides information on the inactive volume reduction rate and the final dead volume up to a certain level of accuracy depending on the mixing system. However, the estimations require further investigations and improvements. Overall, ERT has the potential of being used in the study of inactive volume in real sludge. CFD models are developed only for mechanical mixing and <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> systems. The models estimate the flow patterns and the inactive volume fairly well.

The model predictions were validated against the gas holdup profiles obtained under ambient conditions by Yu and Kim (1988) and by Chen et al. (1999) and against overall gas holdup data obtained under typical F-T process conditions in our pilot-scale SBCR (0. 3 -m ID, 3 -m height). These validations showed that {{the inclusion of the}} RNG k-Îµ turbulence model, coupled with the gas-liquid drag model by Wen-Yu (1966), the liquid-solid drag model by Schiller-Naumann (1935) and the lift coefficient by Tomiyama et al.

The CFD model was first used to predict the effects of internals and spargers design on the local hydrodynamics in our pilot-scale SBCR and the effects of internals on the local hydrodynamics in a conceptual SBCR (1 -m ID, 10 -m height). The simulations showed that the internals increased the gas holdup and turbulence intensities and led to even gas holdup radial distribution in the pilot-scale reactor. Also, the <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculations</b> were stronger when using 1 -bundled or 3 -bundled internals than those when using a 4 - or 5 - bundled internals in the conceptual SBCR. Furthermore, F-T and WGS kinetics for iron catalyst provided by NICE, China were incorporated into the model. The CFD model was then used to predict the local hydrodynamics and performance of our pilot-scale SBCR and the commercial-scale SBCR (5. 8 -m, 30 -m height) by NICE. The gas holdup profiles in the pilot-scale SBCR with F-T reactions were different from those without reactions; and this reactor can produce a maximum yield of 1. 87 tons/day of C 5 + products using a H 2 /CO ratio of 2 / 1 and a catalyst concentration of 15 vol...|$|R

Trace gases, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and final gases, methane and carbon dioxide, were monitored on-line. The effects of <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> on the rate of gas transfer from the generation site to the headspace of the reactor were evaluated. It was found that <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> rates do not affect mass transport rates significantly. Gas transport was primarily taking place by rising bubbles. Methane and carbon dioxide were transported from the bubbles to the surrounding liquid, whereas hydrogen was transported from the liquid to the bubbles.

Initially the effect of recirculation velocity was investigated employing velocities of 5, 7 and 10 m/h and influent concentration of 500 mg COD/L. At these velocities, filtered sample organic matter removal efficiencies were 83, 85 and 84 %, respectively.

The countdown had proceeded smoothly until T- 20 min when the Magellan radio receiver "locked-on" the MIL 71 Unified S-Band (USB) transmission as the transmitter power was increased fro 2 kw to 10 kw in support of the orbiter launch. During the planned hold at T- 9 min, the USB was confirmed as the source of the receiver "lock" and Magellan's launch readiness was reaffirmed. In addition a five-minute extension of the T- 9 hold occurred when a range safety computer went off-line, creating a loss of redundancy in the range safety computer network. Following resumption of the countdown, both the orbiter and Magellan flows proceeded smoothly until the launch was scrubbed at T- 31 sec...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the many}} key {{technologies}} required to make single-stage to orbit an actuality, the technology of sub-cooling cryogenic propellants below their normal saturation temperatures and thereby making them more dense, is unquestionably on its way towards full and practical realization. The technology of Propellant Densification {{has been the subject}} of an extensive research and development program overseen by Lockheed Martin Michoud Space Systems and NASA Glenn Research Center over the past several years. This paper presents a status report of this research and development. Specifically examined within this paper is the status of the current and continuing efforts on the mathematical simulation of the in-tank propellant densification process currently baselined for the Lockheed Martin VentureStar Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). Keys to this modeling effort are an understanding and quantification of the effects of thermal stratification and the ability to capture the complex and unique multiple section tank geometries being proposed for future launch vehicles. A simulation that properly captures these phenomena has been developed by Lockheed Martin. Also discussed is the significant test program that has been undertaken in coordination with NASA Glenn Research Center. In this testing, the <b>liquid</b> hydrogen <b>recirculation</b> and densification process was simulated and the thermal stratification of the densified propellant was recorded throughout the tank. This testing marks the first time that such a process has been carried out within a multiple-lobe, flight-similar tank. The results from this testing have gone a long way towards grounding the mathematical models and towards demonstrating the readiness of the technology for near-term use. A further and even more ambitious test program examining the production and utilization of densified propellants is being planned for late-autumn 1999. An overview of these plans is presented...|$|R
40|$|The plasma lift reactor (PLR) is a {{new type}} of reactor used to degrade organic {{materials}} in an aqueous medium. This work focuses on improving the understanding of how this PLR works. Important contributions to science were made including: the first laboratory validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the PLR, new experimental data for gas holdup, bubble velocity, and temperature, and improvments to the conductive probe measurement technique. A literature review was performed to better understand relevant technologies for both the experimental and numerical work. Conductive needle probes were selected from the literature review as a potential candidate for flow measurements in the PLR. However, in preliminary tests it became evident that improvements were possible to this technique. Four probes of different design were built and tested to determine which was the most effective at measuring gas holdup and bubble velocity. The largest of the probes exhibited the best signal to noise ratio and was effective in measuring bubble velocity. This style of probe was chosen for further experimental measurements in the PLR. Additionally a new technique was devised to process the probe signals which improves over existing technology. Software was written to demonstrate the new capabilities. The importance of the signal to noise ratio in conductive needle probe measurements and the new data processing algorithm were new and unique advances in the technology. As such, they have been published in the Review of Scientific Instruments. Computational fluid dynamics modeling was also performed. Results from these models will be the first ever to appear in a peer reviewed journal. A 2 D axis-symmetric model was used to limit computational expense while providing reasonable accuracy. A customized drag model which accounts for bubble-bubble interactions was also implemented. Predictions for the <b>liquid</b> phase <b>recirculation</b> in the reactor agreed well with available laboratory measurements. Predictions for the gas holdup and velocity were better for lower flow rates than higher gas flow rates. Improved modeling techniques to be implemented in the future will undoubtedly bring numeric predictions closer to laboratory measurements...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanistic}} model describing the mass and momentum exchange in bubble columns is proposed {{that is based}} on the observations that the gas distribution in a bubble column is not uniform across the column and that as a consequence large <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> cells are formed in such columns. The model provides insight into the mechanism of mass and momentum exchange in bubble columns and predicts turbulent viscosities in bubble columns that are similar to those reported in the literature. It also predicts axial and radial dispersion coefficients that are of the same order of magnitude as the reported data. Whereas the model is based on a description of the underlying physical phenomena, its validity and extrapolation is expected to be more reliable than that of empirical correlations. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of the vibromixer principles, in particular FUNDAMIXÂ® technology produced bythe Swiss company Dr. Mueller AG, {{is the focus of}} this study. Tests varying the vibrationâ€™s frequencies andamplitudes, as well as the mixing plate geometry, in terms of number of holes and their diameter, are done. Interesting results regarding these parameters are obtained, proving problem complexity and previousexperience. Higher amplitudes and frequencies result in a better fluid dynamic performance of thevibromixer, i. e. flow rate formed due to pumping capacity of the plate and creating the <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation.</b> The available total area of the holes should be limited too. Different fluid viscosities (up to 1212 mPa/s) aretested and possible carbon fiber improvements in the shaft production briefly discussed.

40|$|A {{two-phase}} anaerobic {{system is}} generally considered as advantageous over a single-phase system as phase separation of the acidogenic and methanogenic processes in the two-phase system can be capitalized for high OLR operation and process efficiency. This can be particularly true for wastes with a large rapidly biodegradable fraction, such as fruit and vegetable waste (FVW). This {{study was conducted to}} assess and compare the reactor stability and process performance of a single-phase system with two-phase system for fruit and vegetable waste. A conventional single-phase reactor was used and compared with a two-phase reactor system, which consisted of an acidification reactor and a methanogenic reactor, with solids and <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation.</b> The operation of acidification reactor was based on decoupling of the solids retention time from the hydraulic retention time and the digestate from acidification reactor was centrifuged, followed by recirculation of solids back to the reactor. The separated liquid was fed to the methanogenic reactor for methane production and the methanogenic effluent was recirculated back to the acidification reactor. This strategy of solids recirculation was to increase the solids retention time and thereby enhance the degradation of organic matter. Recirculation of methanogenic effluent was to provide alkalinity, maintain a constant solids concentration in the reactor and for possible enhancement of solids hydrolysis. The initial inoculation conditions of the single phase and the two-phase acidification reactor were similar. The single-phase reactor was operated at low loading rates of 2 then 3. 5 kg/m 3 d and the acidification reactor was operated with step-wise increase in the loading rate up to 10 kg/m 3 d. A new strategy was developed to convert methanogenic sludge to acidification sludge in a short time at this high OLR and with total recirculation of solids, followed by operation under acidification conditions. The acidification reactor achieved stable performance at 7. 0 kg VS/m 3 d and an optimum pH of 5. 5 - 6. 2 with very high substrate solubilization rate. Overall methane yield and VS removal were 0. 30 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS fed and 98 % in the two-phase system and 0. 47 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS fed 83 % in the in the single-phase reactor. Material balance and energy yield calculations for the two processes showed that the two-phase system was inferior in terms of volumetric methane production and energy yield by 33 %. Loss of energy during hydrolysis in the acidification reactor and lower methane production in the methanogenic reactor contributed to the lower energy yield. The study showed that the two-phase process with solids and <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> was a feasible option where high OLR operation and solids removal is desired. However, considering the complicated operation procedure (centrifugation process with solids and <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation)</b> plus the economics makes the process unviable. Single-phase process on the other hand is a simple and straightforward operation and hence could be the preferred system for the digestion of FVW...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{modelling}} of the heating and evaporation of several gasoline surrogate droplets are reported. Five fuel mixtures are considered {{with the following}} initial liquid molar fractions: FACE (Fuel for Advanced Combustion Engines) A: 7 % n-butane, 15 % iso-pentane, 11 % 2 -methylhexane, 7 % n-heptane, and 60 % iso-octane; FACE C: 17 % n-butane, 8 % iso-pentane, 5 % 2 -methylhexane, 11 % n-heptane, 3 % toluene, and 56 % iso-octane; PRF (Primary Reference Fuel) 84 : 17. 6 % n-heptane and 82. 4 % iso-octane; PRF 100 : 100 % iso-octane and PRF 0 : 100 % n-heptane. The analysis {{is based on the}} Effective Thermal Conductivity/Effective Diffusivity (ETC/ED) and Infinite Thermal Conductivity/Infinite Diffusivity (ITC/ID) models. The ETC/ED model takes into account the effect of finite thermal conductivity, finite <b>liquid</b> diffusivity and <b>recirculation</b> inside droplets. Also, this model takes into account the effect of internal circulation in the moving droplets. The ITC/ID model ignores these effects. It is pointed out that the evaporation time of n-heptane droplets is the longest. Droplet temperatures predicted by the ETC/ED model differ significantly from those predicted by the ITC/ID model. The predicted temperature and mass fraction distributions highlight the practical importance of the ETC/ED model when studying the heating and evaporation of multi-component droplets...|$|R
40|$|The US Department of Energy has {{formulated}} different gasoline fuels called ''Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines (FACE) '' {{to standardize}} their compositions. FACE I {{is a low}} octane number gasoline fuel with research octane number (RON) of approximately 70. The detailed hydrocarbon analysis (DHA) of FACE I shows that it contains 33 components. This large number of components cannot be handled in fuel spray simulation where thousands of droplets are directly injected in combustion chamber. These droplets are to be heated, broken-up, collided and evaporated simultaneously. Heating and evaporation of single droplet FACE I fuel was investigated. The heating and evaporation model accounts {{for the effects of}} finite thermal conductivity, finite <b>liquid</b> diffusivity and <b>recirculation</b> inside the droplet, referred to as the effective thermal conductivity/effective diffusivity (ETC/ED) model. The temporal variations of the liquid mass fractions of the droplet components were used to characterize the evaporation process. Components with similar evaporation characteristics were merged together. A representative component was initially chosen based on the highest initial mass fraction. Three 6 components surrogates, Surrogate 1 - 3, that match evaporation characteristics of FACE I have been formulated without keeping same mass fractions of different hydrocarbon types. Another two surrogates (Surrogate 4 and 5) were considered keeping same hydrocarbon type concentrations. A distillation based surrogate that matches measured distillation profile was proposed. The calculated molar mass, hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio and RON of Surrogate 4 and distillation based one are close to those of FACE I...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{removal of}} odorous {{volatile}} fatty acids (VFAs) in the gas stream of a trickling biofilter was studied. The column reactor was packed with spirally wound fibrous sheet material on which a consortium of microorganisms selected from activated sludge was immobilized. The bioreactor was operated under counter-current flow of gas and liquid streams. Odorous VFA, butyric and valeric acids were introduced into the bioreactor at various inlet concentrations and flow rates. The effects of inlet VFA concentration and gas empty bed retention time (EBRT) on bioreactor performance were investigated. The effect of inlet concentration was studied by increasing the gaseous VFA concentrations at fixed EBRTs of 90, 60, 45 and 30 s. While the effect of EBRT was investigated by increasing the gas superficial velocity or shortening EBRT, at different inlet VFA concentrations of 0. 08, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 7 g/m 3. The bioreactor was effective in treating odorous VFA at mass loadings up to 32 g/m 3 /h, at which VFA started to accumulate in the <b>recirculation</b> <b>liquid</b> indicating the biofilm was unable to degrade all the VFA introduced: Although VFA accumulated in the liquid phase, the removal efficiency remained above 99 %, it implies the biochemical reaction rate rather than gas-to-liquid mass transfer rate was the rate limiting step of this process. The bioreactor was stable for long-term operation; relatively low and steady pressure drop, no clogging and degeneration of the packing medium occurred during the 4 -month period studied.
