40|$|Closed Loop {{manufacturing}} {{describes the}} use of feed-back from a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) to the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to help in business operations. Although conceptually simple, many obstacles make CNC-ERP connectivity difficult- incompatibilities of various generations of systems supplied by multiple ven-dors, differing personnel mindsets and objectives, and out-right complexity of ERP. A long journey starts with a single step, and this paper describes a successful pilot project that detected scrap on a CNC during production of the Boeing 737 Leading Edge panels and then automatically entered a scrap reorder into the ERP Supply Chain Management (SCM) Reorder System. The pilot leveraged three major technologies, including open-architecture CNC, OLE for Process Control (OPC) integration technology, and sup-ply chain Web Services. Overall, the pilot project success-fully established that integration of CNC into SCM can be straightforward as we automated 90 % of one manual step within the scrap Supply Chain Reorder process to impart a <b>leaner</b> <b>manufacturing</b> operation...|$|R
25|$|From {{this point}} on a curious {{development}} took place: while in the United States the possibility of applying the computer to business operations {{led to the development}} of management software architecture such as MRP and successive modifications, and ever more sophisticated optimization techniques and manufacturing simulation software, in post-war Japan a series of events at Toyota Motor {{led to the development of}} the Toyota Production System (TPS) and <b>Lean</b> <b>Manufacturing.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Lean</b> <b>manufacturing</b> is an {{approach}} to production which arose in Toyota {{between the end of}} World War II and the seventies. It comes mainly from the ideas of Taiichi Ohno and Toyoda Sakichi which are centered on the complementary notions of just in time and autonomation (jidoka), all aimed at reducing waste (usually applied in PDCA style). Some additional elements are also fundamental: production smoothing (Heijunka), capacity buffers, setup reduction, cross-training and plant layout.|$|E
25|$|Flourishing in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, {{scientific}} management built on earlier pursuits of economic efficiency. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of , it favored empirical methods to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus {{it was followed by}} a profusion of successors in applied science, including time and motion study, the Efficiency Movement (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), Fordism, operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, management science, manufacturing engineering, logistics, business process management, business process reengineering, <b>lean</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} <b>lean</b> and green <b>manufacturing</b> using a printing company in South Africa {{as a case study}} focusing on their printing division. The reason for addressing the printing division of the company was to develop a <b>lean</b> and green <b>manufacturing</b> plan to address the concerns of resource utilisation and waste disposal in the printing division. The research looked at the concept of lean and green individually as well as together and by analysing {{the relationship between the two}} concepts. The outcome was that environmental “green” waste is embedded in the seven types of lean waste which is overproduction, waiting, transport, inappropriate processing, unnecessary inventory, unnecessary motion and waste due to defects (Moreira, Alves and Sousa, 2010 cited in Pampanelli, Found and Bernardes, 2014). It was found that the company under consideration had not been familiar with these concepts but learnt and understood the value it could bring to the company.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to identify investment strategies to achieve maximum manufacturing productivity with the ultimate goal of increasing the market share of the US textile industry. Summary: US textile firms face challenging decisions; investment decisions are particularly critical since today’s investment determines tomorrow’s production. Facing competitive pressure from abroad, a firm must often choose between competing investment options. For example, investment in high tech machinery may be desired to minimize payroll expenses but this allocation may reduce the availability of funds for R&D that, if directed at new product development, might open new markets. Furthermore, these investments compete with the investment in information technology (IT) necessary for <b>leaner</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and a long-term reduction in costs due to better supply chain management. In the case of R&D and IT, the pay-off to an investment is unknown, further complicating the decision. We analyze the impact of such investments on productivity to mitigate this uncertainty. Summary of Regression Results: At the industry level, we determine the sources of productivity growth by regressing total factor productivity on capital-labor ratio, R&D employment, import penetration and IT capital as a share of tota...|$|R
25|$|Other thinkers soon {{offered more}} {{ideas on the}} roles that workers play in mature {{industrial}} systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just {{the needs of the}} whole. James Hartness published The Human Factor in Works Management in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as <b>lean</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.|$|E

2500|$|Lean {{systems is}} a {{systemic}} method {{for the elimination}} of waste ("Muda") within a manufacturing or service process.

2500|$|Japanese {{companies}} {{are known for}} management methods such as [...] "The Toyota Way". Kaizen ( [...] , Japanese for [...] "improvement") is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers. By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see <b>Lean</b> <b>manufacturing).</b> Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world. Within certain value systems, {{it is ironic that}} Japanese workers labor amongst the most hours per day, even though kaizen is supposed to improve all aspects of life.|$|E
2500|$|Scientific {{management}} {{was one of}} the first attempts to systematically treat management and process improvement as a scientific problem. It may have been the first to do so in a [...] "bottom-up" [...] way and found a lineage of successors that have many elements in common. With the advancement of statistical methods, quality assurance and quality control began in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the body of knowledge for doing scientific management evolved into operations management, operations research, and management cybernetics. In the 1980s total quality management became widely popular, and in the 1990s [...] "re-engineering" [...] went from a simple word to a mystique. Today's Six Sigma and <b>lean</b> <b>manufacturing</b> could be seen as new kinds of scientific management, although their evolutionary distance from the original is so great that the comparison might be misleading. In particular, Shigeo Shingo, one of the originators of the Toyota Production System, believed that this system and Japanese management culture in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management.|$|E

40|$|Optimisation {{of fluid}} flow through a filter and minimising {{turbulence}} and pressure drop {{can lead to}} a more efficient filtration system. Traditionally, metal filters have been manufactured using perforated plate, mesh and wedge wire. Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology can be used to produce filters whose geometries cannot be manufactured using more conventional manufacturing technologies. Three novel filter geometries were designed for fabrication using AM to reflect three traditional filter types. A filter design, with holes in-line to the direction of fluid flow, which can be directly compared to perforated plate, was produced using AM technology with 316 L Stainless Steel (SS 316 L) as the build material. When compared to conventional filters of similar aperture size, the pressure drop across the AM filter with increasing flow rates was significantly less compared to the conventionally manufactured filter. Thus, less pumping energy is required for the in-line hole AM filter. The AM filter designed to be representative of a mesh-based filter, was created as a single part with an integrated support and filter section. This filter has a significantly increased open area and increased flow rate compared to its comparable mesh filter. The AM filter representing that fabricated from wedge wire, overcomes conventional fabrication issues and is an advance towards <b>leaner</b> <b>manufacturing.</b> AM technology has enabled the production of innovative, geometrically complex, 3 D filter designs that have significant increases in filtration efficiency. Industrial application of these filters will have a positive impact in reducing the carbon footprint of end users...|$|R
