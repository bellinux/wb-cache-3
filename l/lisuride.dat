The use of <b>lisuride</b> as initial anti-Parkinsonian treatment has been advocated, delaying the need for levodopa until <b>lisuride</b> becomes insufficient for controlling the parkinsonian disability. Preliminary trials suggest the dermal application of <b>lisuride</b> {{may be useful in}} the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

5000|$|<b>Lisuride</b> is a {{dopamine}} and {{a partial}} agonist for several serotonin receptors. It is an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor. It {{has a high}} affinity for the dopamine D2, D3 and D4 receptors, as well as serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C receptors. [...] While <b>lisuride</b> has a similar receptor binding profile to the more well-known and chemically similar ergoloid N,N-diethyl-lysergamide (LSD) and inhibits dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons {{in a similar fashion}} to LSD, a trait which indicates both drugs in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, it lacks the psychedelic effects of its sister compound.Newer findings suggest the lack of psychedelic action arises from the phenomenon of biased agonism. Stimulation of the 5-HT2A protomer within the 5-HT2A-mGlu2 receptor complex evokes psychedelic effects, while these effects do not occur during sole stimulation of monomeric 5-HT2A receptors. Accordingly, different G-proteins are involved. <b>Lisuride</b> behaves as an agonist at the 5-HT2AR monomer. Since it competitively antagonises the effects of LSD, it may be regarded as a protomer antagonist of the 5-HT2A-mGluR heteromer. GPCR oligomers are discrete entities and usually possess properties distinct from their parent monomeric receptors.|$|E

5000|$|One notable {{example of}} {{functional}} selectivity occurs with the 5-HT2A receptor, {{as well as}} the 5-HT2C receptor. Serotonin, the main endogenous ligand of 5-HT receptors, is a functionally selective agonist at this receptor, activating phospholipase C (which leads to inositol triphosphate accumulation), but does not activate phospholipase A2, which would result in arachidonic acid signalling. However, the other endogenous compound Dimethyltryptamine activates arachidonic acid signalling at the 5-HT2A receptor, as do many exogenous hallucinogens such as DOB and LSD. Notably, LSD does not activate IP3 signalling through this receptor to any significant extent. Oligomers; specifically 5HT2A/mGlu2 heteromers mediate this effect. This may explain why some direct 5-HT2 agonists have psychedelic effects, whereas compounds that indirectly increase serotonin signalling at the 5-HT2 receptors, such as SSRIs, generally do not; nor do 5HT2A agonists without constitutive active at the mGlu dimer, such as <b>lisuride.</b>|$|E
50|$|The drug is in {{decreasing}} use, as it {{was reported}} in 2003 to be associated with a form of heart disease called cardiac fibrosis. In 2007, The United States Food and Drug Administration announced a voluntary withdrawal of the drug by manufacturers due to the possibility of heart valve damage. Pergolide is not currently available in the United States for human use. This problem is thought to be due to pergolide's action at the 5-HT2B serotonin receptors of cardiac myocytes, causing proliferative valve disease by the same mechanism as ergotamine, methysergide, fenfluramine, and other serotonin 5-HT2B agonists, including serotonin itself when elevated in the blood in carcinoid syndrome. Pergolide can rarely cause Raynaud's phenomenon. Among similar antiparkinsonian drugs, cabergoline but not <b>lisuride</b> exhibit this same type of serotonin receptor binding. In January, 2007, cabergoline (Dostinex) was reported also to be associated with valvular proliferation heart damage. In March 2007, pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use, due to serious valvular damage that was shown in two independent studies.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Bromo-LSD, {{also known}} as BOL-148, is a {{derivative}} of lysergic acid invented by Albert Hofmann, {{as part of the}} original research from which the closely related compound LSD was also derived. 2-bromo-LSD was found to be inactive as a psychedelic and so was comparatively little researched for many years, although its similar behavior in the body made it useful for radiolabelling studies. It was found to bind to many of the same receptor targets as LSD, but acting as a neutral antagonist rather than an agonist. However its generally similar behavior to LSD in some respects has shown to be very useful in one specific area, the treatment of cluster headaches. These debilitating attacks have been known for some time to be amenable to treatment with certain hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin, but because of the illegal status of these drugs and the kind of mental changes they induce, research into their medical use has been slow and therapeutic application limited to very specific circumstances under strict supervision. It had been thought that this specific therapeutic action against cluster headaches was limited to hallucinogenic drugs of this type, and would always present a major barrier to their clinical use. However a serendipitous discovery found that 2-bromo-LSD is also able to produce this therapeutic effect, despite lacking the other effects of LSD. This has led to a resurgence of interest and research into 2-bromo-LSD and its possible medical uses. Some isolated incidents of hallucinogenic responses have been reported, but as with other non-hallucinogenic LSD analogues such as <b>lisuride,</b> this appears to be a rare side effect occurring only in individuals with an as yet unexplained susceptibility to this reaction.|$|E

40|$|Compounds that {{activate}} the 5 -HT 2 A receptor, such as {{lysergic acid diethylamide}} (LSD), act as hallucinogens in humans. One notable exception is the LSD congener <b>lisuride,</b> which does not have hallucinogenic effects in humans {{even though it is}} a potent 5 -HT 2 A agonist. LSD and other hallucinogens have been shown to disrupt prepulse inhibition (PPI), an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, by activating 5 -HT 2 A receptors in rats. We tested whether <b>lisuride</b> disrupts PPI in male Sprague–Dawley rats. Experiments were also conducted to identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the effect of <b>lisuride</b> on PPI and to compare the effects of <b>lisuride</b> to those of LSD. Confirming a previous report, LSD (0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 2  mg/kg, s. c.) reduced PPI, and the effect of LSD was blocked by pretreatment with the selective 5 -HT 2 A antagonist MDL 11, 939. Administration of <b>lisuride</b> (0. 0375, 0. 075, and 0. 15  mg/kg, s. c.) also reduced PPI.

The effect of LSD on PPI is mediated by the 5 -HT 2 A receptor, whereas activation of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor does not appear to contribute to the effect of <b>lisuride</b> on PPI.

The lC for displacement of [3 H]spiroperidol by <b>lisuride</b> in frontal cortex was increased by the GTP analog, 5 ’-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, indicating an agonist-like interaction.
