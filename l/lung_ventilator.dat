40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{intensive care}} resources, support, and personnel available in Mongolia's 3 largest cities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was performed as a questionnaire-based survey evaluating intensive care units (ICUs) in Mongolia's 3 main cities. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 31 ICUs {{participated in the}} survey. The median number of beds per ICU was 7 (interquartile ranges, 6 - 10) with 0. 7 (0. 6 - 0. 9) physicians and 1. 5 (0. 6 - 1. 8) nurses per bed. A 24 -hour physician service was available in 61. 9 % of the participating ICUs. A median number of 359 patients (250 - 500) {{with an average age}} of 39 (30 - 49) years were treated annually. Oxygen was available in all ICUs, but only for 60 % (17 - 75) of beds. Pressurized air was available in 33 % of the ICUs for 24 % (0 - 15) of beds.

40|$|Rationale: Acute lung injury (ALI) {{remains an}} {{important}} cause of mortality {{in intensive care}} units. Inflammation is controlled by cytokines and eicosanoids derived from the n- 6 fatty acid (FA) arachidonic acid (AA). The n- 3 FA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and mediators derived from EPA and DHA possess reduced inflammatory potency. Objectives: To determine whether the ability of fat- 1 mice to endogenously convert n- 6 to n- 3 FA, and thus generate an increased ratio of n- 3 to n- 6 FA, impacts experimental ALI. Methods: We investigated ALI induced by intratracheal instillation of endotoxin in fat- 1 and wild-type (WT) mice, assessing leukocyte numbers, protein concentration, and prostaglandin and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as free FA in plasma, and <b>lung</b> <b>ventilator</b> compliance. Body temperature and motor activity of mice—markers of sickness behavior—were also recorded. Measurements and Main Results: In ALI, fat- 1 mice exhibited significantly reduced leukocyte invasion, protein leakage, and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 and thromboxane B 2 levels in lavage fluid compared with WT mice. Free AA levels were increased in the plasma of WT mice in response to endotoxin, whereas EPA and DHA were increased in the fat- 1 group. Ventilator compliance was significantly improved in fat- 1 mice. Body temperature and motor activity were decreased in ALI. fat- 1 Mice recovered body temperature and motor activity faster. Conclusions: fat- 1 Mice exhibited reduced features of ALI and sickness behavior. Increasing the availability of n- 3 FA may thus be beneficial in critically ill patients with ALI...|$|E

40|$|Background: With {{adaptive}} support ventilation, respiratory {{rate and}} tidal volume (V(T)) are {{a function of}} the Otis least work of breathing formula. We hypothesized that adaptive support ventilation in an open <b>lung</b> <b>ventilator</b> strategy would deliver higher V(T) s to patients with acute lung injury. Methods: Patients with acute lung injury were ventilated according to a local guideline advising the use of lower V(T) (6 - 8 ml/kg predicted body weight), high concentrations of positive end-expiratory pressure, and recruitment maneuvers. Ventilation parameters were recorded when the ventilator was switched to adaptive support ventilation, and after recruitment maneuvers. If V(T) increased more than 8 ml/kg predicted body weight, airway pressure was limited to correct for the rise of V(T). Results: Ten patients with a mean (+/- SD) PaO(2) /FIO(2) of 171 +/- 86 mmHg were included. After a switch from pressure-controlled ventilation to adaptive support ventilation, respiratory rate declined (from 31 +/- 5 to 21 +/- 6 breaths/min; difference = 10 breaths/min, 95 % CI 3 - 17 breaths/min, P = 0. 008) and V(T) increased (from 6. 5 +/- 0. 8 to 9. 0 +/- 1. 6 ml/kg predicted body weight; difference = 2. 5 ml, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 4. 6 ml/kg predicted body weight, P = 0. 02). Pressure limitation corrected for the rise of V(T), but minute ventilation declined, forcing the user to switch back to pressure-controlled ventilation. Conclusions: Adaptive support ventilation, compared with pressure-controlled ventilation in an open lung strategy setting, delivers a lower respiratory rate-higher V(T) combination.

30|$|We {{chose to}} {{ventilate}} our mice with low or high tidal volume MV as both strategies may reveal relevant information for clinical practice. Low tidal volume MV is widely practiced since the ARDS network group convincingly demonstrated that this reduces {{morbidity and mortality}} in ARDS [2]. However, ARDS is a very heterogeneous disease: some lung regions are poorly aerated placing other healthier lung regions at risk for overinflation [42]. It {{has been shown that}} even with the use of <b>lung</b> protective <b>ventilator</b> settings one third of the ARDS patients still experience regional tidal hyperinflation [42]. We therefore believe it is still an important translational effort to ventilate animals with higher tidal volumes. In addition, a pulmonary pro-inflammatory state makes the lung more vulnerable to a second hit such as MV [25],[26]. Therefore, to mimic ventilation in the presence of pulmonary co-morbidities, we added an additional injurious stimulus to our MV model. Nonetheless, our 1 -hit VILI model is still important to give insights into RAGE signaling in ventilated healthy lungs.|$|R

Clinical application requires that the individual’s model parameter values must be identified with information available at the bedside. Multiple linear regression or gradient-based parameter identification methods are highly sensitive to noise and initial parameter estimates. Thus, they are difficult to apply at the bedside to support therapeutic decisions. Methods An iterative integral parameter identification method is applied to a second order {{respiratory mechanics}} model. The method is compared to the commonly used regression methods and error-mapping approaches using simulated and clinical data. The clinical potential of the method was evaluated on data from 13 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients.
