The snails were observed to be living {{on a variety of}} endemic and introduced plant species; these snails appear to be able to eat an unusually wide range of different food sources.

500|$|The corn crake is omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feeds on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. In the breeding areas, it is a predator of Sitona weevils, which infest <b>legume</b> <b>crops.</b> {{and in the}} past consumed large amounts of the former grassland pests, leatherjackets and wireworms. This crake will also eat small frogs and mammals, and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain. Its diet on the wintering grounds is generally similar, but includes locally available items such as termites, cockroaches and dung beetles. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. Hunting is normally in cover, but, particularly in the wintering areas, it will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Indigestible material is regurgitated as [...] pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food, and when fully grown they may fly with the parents up to [...] to visit supplementary feeding areas. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E

40|$|Nitrifying {{microorganisms}} play {{an important}} role in nitrogen (N) cycling in agricultural soils as nitrification leads to accumulation of nitrate (NO 3 -) that is readily lost through leaching and denitrification, particularly in high rainfall regions. <b>Legume</b> <b>crop</b> rotation in sugarcane farming systems can suppress soil pathogens and improve soil health, but its effects on soil nitrifying microorganisms are not well understood. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the impact of two <b>legume</b> break <b>crops,</b> peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and soybean (Glycine max), on the nitrifying communities in a sugarcane cropping soil. <b>Cropping</b> with either <b>legume</b> substantially increased abundances of soil bacteria and archaea and altered the microbial community composition, but did not significantly alter species richness and evenness relative to a bare fallow treatment. The ammonia oxidisers were mostly archaeal rather than bacterial, and were 24 - 44 % less abundant in the <b>legume</b> <b>cropping</b> soils compared to the bare fallow. Furthermore, abundances of the archaeal amoA gene encoding ammonia monooxygenase in the soybean and peanut cropping soils were only 30 - 35 % of that in the bare fallow. These results warrant further investigation into the mechanisms driving responses of ammonia oxidising communities and their nitrification capacity in soil during <b>legume</b> <b>cropping...</b>|$|R

Gross margin calculations showed that soybean has the potential as a new grain <b>legume</b> <b>crop</b> in Eastern Germany.

5000|$|When {{compared}} to the Ekwendeni village of the Soils, Food and Healthy Communities (SFHC), the Millennium Villages obtain only similar achievements at far greater expense. This {{is a result of}} the Millennium Villages' use of artificial fertilizers and hybrids seeds (often of plants such as corn, which are not indigenous to the area). SFHC, on the other hand, uses diverse <b>legume</b> <b>crops</b> to improve soil health: [...] "The SFHC research project attempts to improve child nutritional status, household food security and soil fertility through use of different legume options which can improve the quality and quantity of food available within the household as well as provide organic inputs to improve soil fertility." [...] According to Rachel Bezner Kerr, use of fertilizers and genetically modified seeds leads to dependence of the farmers on expensive products being marketed by large industrial companies. By contrast, the use of crop diversity to improve soil health is a low cost, and thus far more sustainable, solution.
