40|$|Reach truck masts are {{subjected}} to oscillations, which have signiﬁcant impacts on {{the dynamics of the}} entire vehicle. Mast oscillations can cause undesirable outcomes in extreme situations and therefore it is desirable to be able to predict these outcomes before they occur. A forklift manufacturer in Mjölby initiated a thesis with the intention to obtain a model that can simulate mast sway for situations where oscillations occur. The objective of the thesis was to create a model of Triplex masts and ﬁnd dependencies between model parameters and variables such as <b>fork</b> height and <b>load.</b> The thesis was conducted modelling the mast with a rigid multibody approach where torsion springs and dampers were used between mast parts to simulate mast elasticity. Clearance at the connections were considered and included in the model. The obtained model constitutes of 8 parameters that could be tuned to attain diﬀerent oscillation characteristics. Parametric optimisation was carried out to ﬁnd optimal sets of parameters for compliance with sway measurement tests with diﬀerent <b>load</b> and <b>fork</b> height cases.   The thesis has resulted in a model that is able to simulate mast sway with diﬀerent oscillation characteristics depending on model parameters. Performed parametric optimisation resulted in parameters that reveal useful information about how model parameters depend on <b>load</b> and <b>fork</b> height. The method used for obtaining optimal parameters can likewise be applied to other mast models in order to gain insight into model parameters as functions of <b>load</b> and <b>fork</b> height...|$|R

40|$|Replication of {{the genome}} is crucial for the {{accurate}} transmission of genetic information. It has become clear {{over the last decade}} that the orderly progression of replication forks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is disrupted with high frequency by encounters with various obstacles either on or in the template strands. Survival of the organism then becomes dependent on both removal of the obstruction and resumption of replication. This latter point is particularly important in bacteria, where the number of replication forks per genome is nominally only two. Replication restart in Escherichia coli is accomplished by the action of the restart primosomal proteins, which use both recombination intermediates and stalled replication forks as substrates for <b>loading</b> new replication <b>forks.</b> These reactions have been reconstituted with purified recombination and replication proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} conserved PIF 1 DNA helicase family {{appears to}} have largely nonoverlapping cellular functions. To better understand the functions of human PIF 1, we investigated biochemical properties of this protein. Analysis of single-stranded (ss) DNA-dependent ATPase activity revealed nonstructural ssDNA to greatly stimulate ATPase activity due to a high affinity for PIF 1, even though PIF 1 preferentially unwinds forked substrates. This suggests that PIF 1 needs a ssDNA region for <b>loading</b> and a <b>forked</b> structure for translocation entrance into a double strand region. Deletion analysis demonstrated novel functions of a unique N-terminal portion, named the PIF 1 N-terminal (PINT) domain. When the PINT domain was truncated, apparent affinity for ssDNA and unwinding activity were much reduced, even though the maximum velocity of ATPase activity and Km value for ATP were not affected. We suggest that the PINT domain contributes to enhancing the interaction with ssDNA through intrinsic binding activity. In addition, we found DNA strand-annealing activity, also residing in the PINT domain. Notably, the unwinding and annealing activities were inhibited by replication protein A. These {{results suggest that the}} functions of PIF 1 might be restricted with particular situations and DNA structures...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Suspended {{sediment}} and in situ turbidity {{data from}} two western Oregon streams, Oak Creek and South Fork Hinkle Creek, {{were used to}} estimate annual sediment loads for the 2006 water year (October 1, 2005 to September 30, 2006). Water samples and in situ turbidity observations were taken following the Turbidity Threshold Sampling (TTS) protocol. The annual hydrographs for Oak Creek and South Fork Hinkle Creek were divided into storms. This stratification resulted in storm-specific relationships between in situ turbidity and Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC). The annual hydrograph for Oak Creek was separated into 15 storms. The annual hydrograph for South Fork Hinkle Creek was separated into 8 storms. In the relationship between SSC and in situ turbidity, especially for Oak Creek, there are counterintuitive values. Before statistical relationships between suspended sediment concentration and in situ turbidity could be developed, these counterintuitive and erroneous values had to be vetted. This was carried out with values of laboratory turbidity, hydrograph characteristics, and hysteresis loops. Observations of in situ turbidity considered erroneous were adjusted manually with the TTS-adjuster program. The estimates of sediment load determined with the TTS approach were defined as the true sediment load in the stream. The observations of in situ turbidity that were considered erroneous were also adjusted with a Turbidity-Threshold Macro (TTM), which automatically adjusted the turbidity record. The estimates of sediment load determined with the TTM approach are compared with the estimates of sediment load determined with the TTS approach to determine {{the efficacy of the}} TTM method. The objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of an automated turbidity adjustment program compared with a manual turbidity adjuster, and to determine the efficacy of two in situ turbidity and SSC relationships to predict annual sediment loads. Relationships between SSC and in situ turbidity were made to estimate annual sediment load for Oak and South Fork Hinkle Creeks. The SSC vs. in situ turbidity relationships were made for storm-specific time periods and for the whole water year. Estimates of annual sediment load for Oak Creek were approximately 10 tonnes (2 percent) higher when the TTM-adjustment was made for annual and storm-specific relationships. Estimates of total annual sediment load for Oak Creek were approximately 100 tonnes (17 percent) higher when separate-storm relationships between SSC and in situ turbidity were used compared to an annual relationship. The estimates of annual sediment <b>load</b> at South <b>Fork</b> Hinkle Creek were much lower when the TTM-adjustment was compared to the TTS-adjusted record. When the annual relationship between in situ turbidity and SSC was used the estimate of annual sediment <b>load</b> for South <b>Fork</b> Hinkle Creek was 1, 336 tonnes for TTM-adjusted turbidity data, compared to 1, 526 tonnes for TTS-adjusted turbidity data. Estimates of total annual sediment <b>load</b> for South <b>Fork</b> Hinkle Creek were approximately 700 - 800 tonnes lower when the separate-storm relationships between SSC and in situ turbidity were used, compared to an annual relationship. The TTM method for adjusting in situ turbidity records was useful to remove spikes of in situ turbidity. In the case of Oak Creek, the TTM-adjuster worked satisfactorily. However, in the case of South Fork Hinkle Creek, the TTM-adjuster did not work as well. For neither stream was the TTM-adjuster able to recreate the record that resulted from the TTS-adjuster. A TTM-adjuster appears {{to be able to work}} well but it would be best used in conjunction with a final adjustment using the TTS-adjuster. Thus, a hybrid approach that uses the strengths of both approaches might be the best approach. The TTM-adjuster as presented in this thesis is not a finished product. No method was developed to calibrate a data set to a TTM threshold value. Thus, while a bottom-up, TTM-adjuster program to edit and adjust records of in situ turbidity appears to be viable, the details of the method are not perfected and it remains a work in progress. Both annual and storm specific relationships between in situ turbidity and SSC can be used to estimate sediment loads in streams. The record of success for these two methods depended on the stream. Oak Creek had a lot of samples (294) and the data was well-behaved. For that stream both approaches seemed to work well. However, South Fork Hinkle Creek had fewer samples (138) and the data was not as well behaved. It is probably best to use annual relationships when data is sparse or poorly behaved. Also, annual data alleviates the problem, to a degree, of extrapolating beyond the range of data that could be a problem for storm-specific relationships...|$|R
40|$|Investigated in {{this thesis}} are the {{possibilities}} and effects of reducing CAN data collected from forklifts. The purpose of reducing the data was to create the possibility of exporting and managing data for multiple forklifts and a relatively long period of time. For doing that was an autoregressive filter implemented for filtering and decimating data. Connected to the decimation was also the aim of generating a data set {{that could be used}} for analyzing lift sequences and in particular the usage of fork adjustment functions during lift sequences. The findings in the report are that an AR (18) model works well for filtering and decimating the data. Information losses are unavoidable but kept at a relatively low level, and the size of data becomes manageable. Each row in the decimated data is labeled as belonging to a lift sequence or as not belonging to a lift sequence given a manually specified definition of the lift sequence event. From the lift sequences is information about the lift like number of usages of each <b>fork</b> adjustment function, <b>load</b> weight and <b>fork</b> height gathered. The analysis of the lift sequences gave that the lift/lower function on average is used 4. 75 times per lift sequence and the reach function 3. 23 times on average. For the side shift the mean is 0. 35 per lift sequence and for the tilt the mean is 0. 10. Moreover, it was also found that the struggling time on average is about 17 % of the total lift sequence time. The proportion of the lift that is struggling time was also shown to differ between drivers, with the lowest mean proportion being 7 % and the highest 30 %. ...|$|R
