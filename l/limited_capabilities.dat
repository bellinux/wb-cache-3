5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the <b>limited</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|Most Shogunate troops used Büchse (Gewehr) smoothbore guns, {{which had}} been {{imported}} in Japan since around 1840, initially from the Netherlands by Takashima Akiho. These guns were rather ancient and had <b>limited</b> <b>capabilities,</b> with an effective lethal range of about 50 meters, and a firing rate of about 2 rounds per minute. The daimyō of Nagaoka however, an ally of the Shogun, possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles. The Shogunate {{is known to have}} placed an order for 30,000 modern Dreyse needle guns in 1866. Napoleon III provided Tokugawa Yoshinobu with 2,000 state-of-the-art Chassepot rifles, which he used to equip his personal guard.

25|$|Operation Mongoose {{consisted}} of a program of covert action, including sabotage, psychological warfare, intelligence collection, {{and the creation of}} an internal revolution against the communist government. The U.S. still lacked the capability of effectively getting information to the majority of the Cuban people. They had a trade embargo, denial of bunkering facilities, increased port security, and control procedure on transshipment, technical data, and customs inspection. The U.S. also used diplomatic means to frustrate Cuban trade negotiations in Israel, Jordan, Iran, Greece, and possibly Japan. From the outset, Lansdale and fellow members of the SG-A identified internal support for an anti-Castro movement {{to be the most important}} aspect of the operation. American organization and support for anti-Castro forces in Cuba was seen as key, which expanded American involvement from what had mostly been economic and military assistance of rebel forces. Therefore, Lansdale hoped to organize an effort within the operation, led by the CIA, to covertly build support for a popular movement within Cuba. This was a major challenge. It was difficult to identify anti-Castro forces within Cuba and there lacked a groundswell of popular support that Cuban insurgents could tap into. Within the first few months, an internal review of Operation Mongoose cited the CIA's <b>limited</b> <b>capabilities</b> to gather hard intelligence and conduct covert operations in Cuba. By January 1962, the CIA had failed to recruit suitable Cuban operatives that could infiltrate the Castro regime. The CIA and Lansdale estimated that they required 30 Cuban operatives. Lansdale criticized the CIA effort to ramp up their activities to meet Operation Mongoose's expedient timelines. Robert McCone of the CIA complained that Lansdale's timeline was too accelerated and that it would be difficult to achieve the tasks demanded in such a short timeframe.|$|E

The series' creators were Kouji Okada (credited as Cozy Okada in English), Ginichiro Suzuki, and Ginichiro's son Kazunari. The first book in the Digital Devil Story series, , provided the title for the original game, while the game's story was based on both the first book and the third book [...] The game was developed at Atlus and published by Bandai Namco (then Namco). Although they wanted to incorporate {{as much of the}} original story as possible, the <b>limited</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the Famicom made this goal nearly impossible. The game proved popular in Japan, and effectively launched the Megami Tensei franchise, with its more ambitious direct sequel following in 1990. During the development of Shin Megami Tensei, which was driven by the concept of a Super Famicom game with the company's brand on it, the team slowly decided that they wanted to break the then-current gaming status quo using its aesthetic and content. Despite this attitude, the staff considered Shin Megami Tensei to be a remake of Megami Tensei II. In many of these earlier games, staff members at Atlus had cameos.|$|E

ZX Spectrum magazines Crash and ZX Computing awarded Cauldron II their top accolades: [...] "Crash Smash" [...] and [...] "Monster Hit", respectively.

Computer and Video Games reviewer Paul Boughton praised {{the size of the}} game world, but criticized the audio quality of the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions, citing the <b>limited</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the two systems. In concluding his review, Boughton felt any version of the game would be worth purchasing. Phil South of Your Sinclair praised the game's presentation and design, calling the graphics [...] "lovely" [...] and the platform gameplay [...] "original". ZX Computing reviewer praised the audio-visuals, and recommended the title for fans of the previous game. A Crash magazine reviewer lauded the audio-visuals of the ZX Spectrum version and commented that the gameplay offered more than its predecessor's. The reviewer described Cauldron II as difficult, but felt that the sense of accomplishment gained from successful completion outweighed the negative aspect. Computer Gamers reviewer criticized the bouncing gameplay, citing unpredictable reactions and difficulty in navigating around tough enemies. Rich Pelley and Jon Pillar of Your Sinclair echoed similar comments. Retro Gamer writer Craig Grannell described the game's difficulty as the [...] "only real criticism". The ZX Computing reviewer also criticized the bouncing aspect, but praised the overall game design as enjoyable. Phil King, another Crash reviewer, praised the Silverbird re-release.

This version was not sold as a standalone commercial product but {{as a part of}} certain GeForce3 graphic card package deals. MacPlay announced on November 1, 2000, it was publishing the [...] version of the game. The Omni Group was responsible for the porting of the game; they rewrote the game's software {{to take advantage of the}} symmetric multi-processing capability of Mac OSX. Eleven months later, MacPlay {{released the}} port. Multiplayer mode was initially disabled in the retail release but was re-inserted in a later patch. Giants was also ported to the [...] (PS2), a process overseen by Interplay's division, Digital Mayhem, who posted updates of their progress on IGN. Their greatest challenge for the PS2 port was converting and storing the special effects of the Windows version onto the lesser storage space of the PS2. LightWave 3D was used by the team to convert the graphic resources. Although they had to reduce the image resolution, Digital Mayhem increased the number of polygons that composed the player character models, making them smoother and more detailed in shape. Due to the <b>limited</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the PS2 as compared to the Windows platform and the addition of a save feature, the team focused on enhancing the action gameplay, streamlining the interfaces, and tweaking the Reaper ski races, level designs, and game balance. They redesigned the controls for the PS2's controller, and after finding the analog sticks less easy to aim with than a mouse, implemented a feature to help the player's aim. Digital Mayhem originally intended to retain the multiplayer mode, but discarded it, believing the PS2 environment could not generate the same multiplayer atmosphere as the Windows platform. Interplay released the PS2 port on December 21, 2001. They also announced plans for an Xbox port but nothing resulted from this.|$|E

2500|$|Thus, the {{establishment}} of the principate marked the ascendancy of the dynastic aristocracy in Iberia, and was a compromise solution amid the Byzantine-Sassanid rivalry for the control of the Caucasus.

They are variously entitled in Georgian sources, erist'avt'-mt'avari, eris-mt'avari, erist'avt'-erist'avi, or simply erist'avi (normally translated in English as [...] "prince", [...] "arch-duke", or [...] "duke"). Most of them were additionally invested with various Roman/Byzantine titles.
