5|$|<b>Lefkada,</b> {{part of the}} Despotate of Epirus {{since the}} latter's {{foundation}} in 1205, was incorporated by Leonardo I Tocco into the County of Cephalonia in 1362. The Despotate of Epirus {{was one of the}} three Byzantine Empires in exile created after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Following the fate of the other central Ionian Islands, it was captured by the Turks in 1479 and then by the Venetians in 1502. However, Venetian rule did not last, as <b>Lefkada</b> was given back to the Ottoman Empire one year later. Turkish rule over <b>Lefkada</b> lasted for over 200 years, from 1479 to 1684, when Francesco Morosini attacked and subdued the island during the Morean War. <b>Lefkada,</b> however, did not become officially Venetian until 1718, with the signature of the Treaty of Passarowitz.|$|E
5|$|In the Ionian Islands, P.fluviatile {{is known}} to occur at only one site on Corfu, {{as well as on}} Kefalonia, <b>Lefkada</b> and Zakynthos. In the Aegean Islands, it is found on Skiathos and Skopelos (Sporades), on Euboea and Skyros, and at a single site on Andros in the Cyclades.|$|E
5|$|Around 376BC, Timanoridas of Corinth and Eukrates of <b>Lefkada</b> paid thirty minae to {{purchase}} Neaira from Nikarete, {{at the high}} end of prices for hetaerae. When the men married, they agreed to let Neaira buy her freedom for twenty minae, which, with the aid of gifts and loans from her former customers, she did. As part of this deal, Neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in Corinth, and so left the city for Athens with Phrynion, who had helped her buy her freedom.|$|E

5|$|In 1658, Ottoman {{power was}} {{redirected}} north {{in a campaign}} against George II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania, which evolved into a long conflict with the Habsburgs. For the next few years, the Venetian fleet, again {{under the command of}} Morosini, unsuccessfully attempted to maintain the blockade of the Straits of the Dardanelles. Morosini also resumed his tactic of attacking Ottoman strongholds: a siege of the island of Santa Maura (<b>Lefkada)</b> in August 1658 failed, but in 1659, the Venetians, aided by the Maniots, sacked Kalamata in the Peloponnese, followed by Torone in the Chalcidice, Karystos in Euboea, and Çeşme. However, since Venice could not spare forces to occupy these places, these raids gained the Republic nothing of substance. On the Ottoman side, Köprülü Mehmed ordered the construction of two new forts, Sedd el Bahr ("Rampart of the Sea") and Kilid Bahr ("Key of the Sea"), at the European shore of the entrance of the Dardanelles, to prohibit the Venetians from entering the Straits again.|$|E
25|$|In May 1502 Kemal Reis {{set sail}} from Istanbul with {{a fleet of}} 50 ships and headed towards Euboea. In June 1502 he {{captured}} the Island of Kos along with the Castle of San Pietro which belonged to the Knights of St. John. From there he sailed to Nafplion and bombarded its port until being called for assisting the defense of Mytilene which was sieged by a joint Venetian-French fleet. In July 1502 he landed his forces on Lesbos and fought against the French soldiers in Mytilene which the Ottomans had earlier taken from the Genoese in 1462. In August 1502 Kemal Reis made the Island of <b>Lefkada</b> his new base for operations in the Ionian and Adriatic Seas, where he raided the coastal settlements belonging to the Republic of Venice and the Republic of Ragusa, capturing several of them {{on behalf of the}} Ottoman Empire. However, the strategic importance of the Island of Santa Maura (as the Venetians called <b>Lefkada)</b> prompted the Repubblica Serenissima to organize a huge fleet under the command of Benedetto Pesaro, which consisted of 50 galleys and numerous other smaller ships. The Venetians were joined by 13 Papal galleys under the command of Giacomo Pesaro, the brother of Benedetto who was the Bishop of Paphos, as well as 3 galleys belonging to the Knights of St. John in Rhodes and 4 French galleys under the command of the Prégent de Bidoux. Overwhelmed {{by the size of the}} enemy fleet, Kemal Reis was forced to abandon <b>Lefkada</b> and sailed back first to Gallipoli and later to Constantinople, where, in October 1502, he ordered the construction of new ships at the Imperial Naval Arsenal of the Golden Horn.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandolin}} has a {{long tradition}} in the Ionian islands (the Heptanese) and Crete. It has long been played in the Aegean islands outside the control of the Ottoman Empire. It is common to see choirs accompanied by mandolin players (the mandolinátes) in the Ionian islands and especially in the cities of Corfu, Zakynthos, <b>Lefkada</b> and Kefalonia. The evolution of the repertoire for choir and mandolins (kantádes) occurred during Venetian rule over the islands.|$|E

25|$|The Ioannis Kapodistrias International Airport, {{named after}} Ioannis Kapodistrias, a {{distinguished}} Corfiot and European diplomat, {{and the first}} governor of the independent Greek state, is located around three kilometres south of Kerkyra, just half a kilometre north of Pontikonisi. The approach and landing, in a northeasterly direction, afford passengers spectacular aerial views of Pontikonisi and Vlaheraina Monastery, also taking {{in the hills of}} Kanoni, as the runway employed for landing lies a few hundred metres from these spectacular local landmarks. The airport offers domestic flights from Olympic Airlines (OA 600, 602 and 606), and Aegean Airlines (A3 402, 404 and 406). Seaplanes, Air Sea Lines, a Greek seaplane operator, offers scheduled flights from Corfu to Paxoi, <b>Lefkada,</b> Ithaki, Kefalonia, Ioannina, Patras and Brindisi in Italy.|$|E
25|$|The first {{target of}} the Venetian fleet was the island of <b>Lefkada</b> (Santa Maura). Morosini's {{political}} rival, Girolamo Corner, tried to preempt him and seize the Santa Maura fortress (which he believed to be lightly defended) {{before the arrival of}} the fleet from Venice. With a small force he sailed from Corfu to the island, but finding the fortress strongly garrisoned, he turned back. As a result of this misadventure, Corner was sidelined for {{the first year of the}} war, during which he served as provveditore generale of the Ionian Islands, before he was appointed to command in Dalmatia in late 1685. On 18 July 1684, Morosini left Corfu, and arrived at Santa Maura two days later. After a siege of 16 days, the fortress capitulated on 6 August 1684.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, the Peloponnese {{peninsula}} was divided between three powers: the Latin Principality of Achaea {{in the north}} and west, the Byzantine Greek Despotate of the Morea in the south and east, and Argos and Nauplia, Coron and Modon and some attendant forts, held by the Republic of Venice. The Byzantines were actively trying to conquer the ailing principality, all the while the menace of the ever-expanding Ottoman Empire threatened all of them. Carlo I Tocco, the ruler of the County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, of <b>Lefkada</b> and of the Despotate of Epirus, took advantage of the Byzantine-Achaean struggles to extend his domains into the Peloponnese: in 1407–1408 his brother Leonardo seized and plundered the fortress of Glarentza, in the northwestern Peloponnese, and in 1421 Carlo bought permanent possession of it from Oliverio Franco, who had seized it from the Achaean prince Centurione II Zaccaria three years earlier.|$|E

25|$|In 1684, {{following}} the Ottoman defeat {{at the second}} Siege of Vienna, Venice joined the Holy League and declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Under the leadership of Francesco Morosini, who had led the defence of Candia, the capital of Crete, the Venetians {{took advantage of the}} Ottoman weakness and rapidly took over the island of <b>Lefkada</b> (Santa Maura) in 1684. In the next year, Morosini landed on the Peloponnese, and within two years, aided by the local Greek population, took control of the peninsula and its fortresses. A subsequent Venetian campaign into eastern Continental Greece succeeded in capturing Athens, but failed before the walls of Chalkis (Negroponte). Thereafter the conflict degenerated into a stalemate, with raids and counter-raids on both sides, until the signature of the Treaty of Karlowitz between the Ottomans and the Holy League, which in Greece left the Morea, Leucas and the island of Aegina in Venetian hands.|$|E
25|$|After {{their success}} in the Morea, the Ottomans moved against the Venetian-held Ionian Islands. They {{occupied}} the island of <b>Lefkada</b> (Santa Maura), which the Venetians had taken in 1684, and the fort of Butrinto opposite the city of Corfu. On 8 July 1716, an Ottoman army of 33,000 men landed on Corfu, {{the most important of}} the Ionian islands. Despite an indecisive naval battle on the same day, the Ottoman land army continued its disembarkment and advanced towards the city of Corfu. On 19 July, after capturing the outlying forts of Mantouki, Garitsa, Avrami and of the Saviour, the siege began. The defence was led by Count Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, who had roughly 8,000 men at his command. The extensive fortifications and the determination of the defenders withstood several assaults. After a great storm on 9 August—which the defenders attributed to the intervention of Corfu's patron saint, Saint Spyridon—caused significant casualties among the besiegers, the siege was broken off on 11 August and the last Ottoman forces withdrew on 20 August.|$|E

500|$|The Ionian economy {{during the}} Venetian period was {{largely based on}} {{exporting}} local products. The most important of the agricultural products of Corfu was olive oil. On the islands of Cephalonia and Zante the main exports were raisins, olive oil and wine. One {{of the most significant}} exports was [...] olive oil. Groves of olive trees were planted throughout the islands during the Venetian period as olive oil was important to Venice's economy. Although the production of it was successful, the Republic only allowed exportation to Venice. Statistics for the years 1766–70 indicate 1,905,917 olive trees on Corfu, 113,161 on Zante, 38,516 on Cephalonia, 44,146 on <b>Lefkada</b> and 31,884 on Cythera.|$|E
500|$|During the Roman Empire, the Ionian Islands were {{variously}} part of {{the provinces}} of Achaea and Epirus vetus. These would form, {{with the exception of}} Cythera, the Byzantine theme of Cephallenia in the late 8th century. From the late 11th century, the Ionian Islands became a battleground in the Byzantine–Norman Wars. The island of Corfu was held by the Normans in 1081–1085 and 1147–1149, while the Venetians unsuccessfully besieged it in 1122–1123. The island of Cephalonia was also unsuccessfully besieged in 1085, but was plundered in 1099 by the Pisans and in 1126 by the Venetians. [...] Finally, Corfu {{and the rest of the}} theme, except for <b>Lefkada,</b> were captured by the Normans under William II of Sicily in 1185. Although Corfu was recovered by the Byzantines by 1191, the other islands henceforth remained lost to Byzantium, and formed a County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos under William's Greek admiral Margaritus of Brindisi.|$|E
