The concept of controllability, which is stronger than topological transitivity, {{and the concept of}} <b>limit</b> <b>dimension,</b> which is analogous to topological entropy, are discussed at length. Particular attention is dedicated to the abelian case, for which duality results are also established...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the possibility of}} using a simple functionalization procedure, based on an initial vapour-phase silanization, to control the size and functionality of solid state nanopores. The presented results show that, by varying the silanization time, it is possible to modify the efficiency of probe molecule attachment, thus shrinking the pore to the chosen size, while introducing a specific sensing selectivity. The proposed method allows us to tune the nanopore biosensor adapting it to the specific final application, and it can be efficiently applied when the pore initial diameter does not exceed a <b>limit</b> <b>dimension</b> related to the mean free path of the silane molecules at the working pressure...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study is to create an Islamic Ethical Identity Scorecard with <b>limited</b> <b>dimensions,</b> inculcating Shari’ah screening, Ethical Identity Index (EII) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria required by Islamic investors. The Islamic Ethical Identity Scorecard also fills the gap in the current inconsistency problem of Shari’ah screening by adopting the strategies proposed by (Derigs & Marzban, 2009) for arriving at a harmonized screening requirement. This study employed analytical processual analysis and developed eight dimensions important to Islamic investors. The creation of <b>limited</b> <b>dimensions</b> is expected to ease the process companies go through in fulfilling the expectations of investors interested in Islamic assets; thereby increasing the percentage of Shari’ah compliant companies and the growth of Islamic investments. Furthermore, the study tests the level of companies’ compliance to the new model. Using a sample of 200 companies approved by SAC as at May 29, 2015, the study found that only 19 % of SAC approved companies comply with the requirements of the scorecard. The main reason for non-compliance was high debt ratio especially from capital intensive industries...|$|R

30|$|Sorg and Cimiano (2010) formalized the {{limitation}} and proposed four dimension limitation functions: absolute, absolute threshold, relative threshold, and sliding window. All functions {{work in the}} concept space. The absolute function <b>limits</b> the <b>dimension</b> to d dimensions with the highest value. The absolute threshold function <b>limits</b> the <b>dimensions</b> based on their values toward a threshold. The relative threshold function uses a partial fraction of the highest-valued dimension. The sliding window function selects the first i dimensions {{from the results of}} the relative threshold function. All the above dimension projection functions are performed according to the ordered vector concept. As noted in Section ‘ESA/GVSM overview’, this process occurs after the interpretation process.|$|R
