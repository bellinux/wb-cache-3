5000|$|Zeng {{was born}} on 6 September 1888 in Weiyuan County, Sichuan, China; his birth name was Chenxun (...) [...] He also had an art name, Zhengran. His {{grandfather}} was Zeng Huailun (曾怀伦), a coal factory and dye-house owner. Chenxun's father Zeng Bencan (曾本灿) took over the business from the eldest Zeng. He began working in salt harvesting {{at the age of}} 9, and became a salt merchant around 1905, forging connections with other traders and local authorities. Concurrently, he worked at the Luzhou-based Rong Ji Provisions Store (荣记粮店) with his wife and uncle. Owing to local unrest, food prices were high and Zeng profited from the situation. He used these earnings to open a tavern named [...] "Big Diner" [...] (大餐楼) in 1914; it was, at that time, the biggest food establishment in Luzhou. In 1928, Zeng partnered with a fellow salt merchant to establish a Hubei-based trading firm named Yu Marketing (渝运销湖北). At the peak of its operations, their business handled three hundred-odd [...] "loads" [...] (载) of salt daily, with one <b>load</b> <b>weighing</b> around 93600 catties (approximately 46,000 kilograms); this made them one of the largest salt carriers in the country.

30|$|There {{are three}} {{remaining}} assumptions in the modelling {{that are not}} yet detailed. The safety distance for the moving block signalling system {{was assumed to be}} 150  m, identical to the safety overlaps in the existing fixed block signalling. Train mass is assumed constant, based on a typical passenger load. The Metrocars have <b>load</b> <b>weighing</b> in traction and braking, so the effect on journey times (and hence capacity) of variation in mass is minimal. Finally, the power rating of the overhead line equipment and substations is assumed to be sufficient to support additional trains.

40|$|During {{a one-year}} {{supervision}} phase the function {{and operation of}} dynamic axle <b>load</b> <b>weighing</b> equipment was to be investigated at five measuring points on motorways in Hesse according to the bending plate principle {{in conjunction with a}} traffic computer centre, and during this period any longterm data and sporadic data collected on individual vehicles was to be analysed. An evaluation system was to be developed for the long-term data, and this was to be programmed {{in the form of a}} database. Furthermore, correlations between axle load distributions and the vehicle mix, depending on the traffic characteristics of a section, were to be investigated. During the test operation the accuracy of the dynamic axle load equipment was to be checked with the aid of static weighing equipment (wheel load measuring equipment), and the experience gained during the practical operation of the equipment systems was to be documented. The documentation of all breakdowns and malfunctions showed limited breakdown times of a total of one to three weeks for each of the five measuring points during a stipulated eight-month analysis period. In the initial phase there were a few breakdowns and malfunctions in the equipment due to hardware and software errors, which were immediately remedied through exchanging the respective defect electronic components and improving the software - in particular to adapt it to the TLS requirements. With regard to the accuracy of the axle load measurements compared to the static measuring results, relatively limited deviations were determined, and the long-term stability of the calibration setting was proved over a period of six months. After initial difficulties, the equipment system with bending plates which was used for these measurements was hence able to prove its suitability, above all with regard to the further expansion of the network.
