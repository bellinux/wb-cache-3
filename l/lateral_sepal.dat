50|$|In 2001 {{the genus}} Pterostylis was split such that two new genera, Plumatichilos and Oligochaetochilus, were {{established}} based on morphological characters. These divisions effectively separated species with a thread-like, feathery labellum (Plumatichilos), {{and those with}} downward-curved <b>lateral</b> <b>sepals</b> (Oligochaetochilus) from the remaining Pterostylis species. The following year, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed further separating Pterostylis into sixteen genera based {{on a combination of}} molecular and morphological characters: the genera Bunochilus, Crangonorchis, Diplodium, Eremorchis, Hymenochilus, Linguella, Oligochaetochilus, Petrorchis, Pharochilum, Plumatichilos, Ranorchis, Speculantha, Stamnorchis, Taurantha and Urochilus. These changes were not adopted widely by Australian herbaria as the data appeared to support a monophyletic group. In 2010, further molecular work reinstated Pterostylis as a monophyletic group with two subgenera distinguishing species with <b>lateral</b> <b>sepals</b> that are bent sharply downwards ("deflexed") from those with the <b>lateral</b> <b>sepals</b> bent backwards ("recurved").|$|R

Stolzia grandiflora P. J.

The morphological affinity of S. grandiflora subsp. lejolyana appears to lie with the varieties of S. repens (Rolfe) Summerh. However, the new species differs by having inflorescences with two flowers and a longer and thinner peduncle. Stolzia cupuligera (Kraenzl.) Summerh. and S. peperomioides (Kraenzl.) Summerh. are neotypified. The position of S. thomensis Stévart & P. J. Cribb is reconsidered and proposed as S. peperomioides (Kraenzl.) Summerh. subsp. thomensis (Stévart & P. J.

40|$|Regeneration {{in vitro}} {{has never been}} {{achieved}} from flower parts {{from members of the}} Orchidaceae and no report exists for Phalaenopsis. Studies that do exist all used immature (unopened) flower buds. In a bid to overcome this hurdle, in vitro organogenesis was attempted with various parts (dorsal sepal (base + center + tip); petal (base + center + tip); <b>lateral</b> <b>sepal</b> (base + center + tip); labellum (base + center + tip); pedicel (outer + inner tissue); column; anther cap; stigmatic surface) of immature and fully opened Phalaenopsis Gallant Beau ‘George Vazquez’ flowers. Despite the use of an extremely wide selection of plant growth regulators in Vacin and Went basal medium, and their concentrations, in both darkness and light conditions, no organogenesis could be achieved from any of the flower parts tested. Some callus was obtained on the column in response to 2 or 4 mg/l TDZ in the light, or to 1 mg/l 2, 4 -D and 1 mg/l dicamba in the dark, but the callus was hard and could not be further proliferated or induced to form organs. Although negative, these trials provide encouraging signs that organogenesis may be possible from flower parts with a little more insistence. To be able to achieve such regeneration would potential allow for the generation of haploid or polyploidy plants which may have practical use in orchid breeding and biotechnology if such plants (or plant parts) can be clonally propagated...|$|E
30|$|Fine-scale mapping {{narrowed the}} {{candidate}} region for dep into a 22 -kb stretch covering 4 annotated genes that encode ORFs for a retrotransposon protein (LOC_ 05 g 02710), a hypothetical protein (LOC_ 05 g 02720), a WUSCHEL-related homoebox 3 B (LOC_ 05 g 02730, dep) and an expressed protein (LOC_ 05 g 02740). In silico {{analysis showed that}} LOC_ 05 g 02710 contains a transposase DDE domain {{that has not been}} previously associated with any regulatory pathways for trichome formation. Blastp searches showed that LOC_ 05 g 02720 has a MYB/SANT-like DNA binding domain that has been reported to play regulatory roles in defense response and developmental processes in plants (Barg et al.[2005]; Yanhui et al.[2006]). In Arabidopsis, small MYB proteins including TRIPTYCHON (TRY), CAPRICE (CPC), TRICHOMELESS 1 and ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC 1, 2 and 3 have been identified as negative regulators of trichome initiation and patterning in the shoots (Wada et al.[1997]; Kirik et al.[2004]; Wang et al.[2008]). However, such regulatory proteins have been associated with trichome formation in species only within the Rosid division ([Serna and Martin 2006]; Moose et al.[2004]). LOC_ 05 g 02740 is a single-copy gene with a predicted protein length of 56 amino acids. Blastp searches indicate that orthologues of this gene in maize and sorghum have not been characterized as well. Another gene located within the candidate region is LOC_ 05 g 02730, which encodes a WUSCHEL-related homeobox 3 B. WUSCHEL homeobox genes belong to a family of plant-specific transcription factors that have been shown to carry out specialized functions in key developmental processes in plants, including stem cell fate regulation, embryonic patterning and organ formation (Van der Graaf et al.[2009]; Haecker et al.[2004]). Expression and functional analysis of WOX 3 in Arabidopsis (PRS) and maize (NS 1 and NS 2) demonstrated that WOX 3 is required in the recruitment of founder cells from the lateral compartment of shoot meristems that will later form the lateral and marginal regions of leaves and leaf orthologues. Null mutations in PRS of Arabidopsis resulted in defects in <b>lateral</b> <b>sepal</b> development and the elimination of the knife-edge cells in the marginal regions of the abaxial and adaxial sepal. Overexpression of the gene, on the other hand, resulted in the formation of multicellular bulges with trichomes on the stem and peduncle of the plant. Such structures were shown to be outgrowths of the epidermal cells ([Matsumoto and Okada 2001]). In maize, ns 1 and ns 2 mutations resulted in narrow leaves, with complete deletion of tooth hairs on the margins, as well as stem curvature and shortened internodes (Scanlon et al.[1996]).|$|E
40|$|The distribution, niche-partitioning, {{taxonomy}} and population-level {{genetic variation}} of Tasmanian {{representatives of the}} subtribe Pterostylidinae were investigated. General ecological data were collected over a two year period to assess changes in the known distribution of Pterostylis species within Tasmania and identify previously unknown populations. Ecological characteristics relating to habitat were used to perform a series of canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) to effectively delimit each species’ ecological tolerances and niche hyperspace. A series of Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted using DNA sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA to elucidate generic and infrageneric relationships within the Pterostylidinae. Following from these results, the genetic variation within the Tasmanian members of the “longifolia” species complex was investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and polymerase chain reaction {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (PCR-RFLP). Ecological survey data indicated that the distribution and abundance of Pterostylis species within Tasmania had changed significantly within the past 10 years, with different species apparently more or less common than previously thought. In addition to the number of populations located, the number of individuals within each population provided insight into the overall level of conservation status applicable to particular species and several recommendations for the management of these species were made. Niche partitioning based on habitat characteristics revealed differences in the ecological tolerances of Pterostylis species and effectively delimited many species along ecological gradients. Significant overlap in the fundamental niches of several morphologically similar species was identified, which suggested that some taxa within Pterostylidinae complexes had been incorrectly assigned to the level of species. This hypothesis was later confirmed through a phylogenetic and population genetic study. Phylogenetic work using ITS sequence data confirmed that Pterostylidinae is embedded within the tribe Cranichideae. Furthermore, the reconstructions strongly supported a monotypic subtribe (Pterostylidinae) comprising the single genus Pterostylis R. Br sensu lato. The analysis found two strongly supported clades that correlated with the morphology of the <b>lateral</b> <b>sepal</b> position within the subtribe and, are herein, delimited as subgenera of Pterostylis. Several closely related species from within species complexes had identical ITS sequences; together with the CCA data the results indicate the presence of over-splitting of the Pterostylidinae. PCR-RFLP analysis of the chloroplast genome in the “longifolia” species complex revealed extremely low variation among species and no marker was found that could distinguish between the Tasmanian representatives of this complex. Further work at the population level using AFLP markers indicated high levels of polymorphism within the complex but, again, could not delimit the four “longifolia” species. Instead, population structure analysis revealed geographic separation of “longifolia” populations irrespective of species. The information from these investigations is essential for taxonomic resolution within the subtribe Pterostylidinae and has clear implications for Pterostylis conservation and managemen...|$|E
