She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wainwright became {{addicted}} to crystal meth {{in the early}} 2000s and temporarily lost his vision. His addiction reached its peak in 2002, during {{what he described as}} [...] "the most surreal week of my life." [...] During that week, he played a cameo role in the UK comedy television program Absolutely Fabulous, spent several nights partying with George W. Bush's daughter Barbara, enjoyed a [...] "debauched evening" [...] with his mother and Marianne Faithfull, sang with Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons for Zaldy's spring 2003 collection, and experienced recurring hallucinations of his father throughout. He decided after that he [...] "was either going to rehab or I was going to <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> father. I knew I needed an asshole to yell at me, and I felt he fit the bill." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Lori was {{six years}} old, her mother took her to an agent who {{specialized}} in child actors. She thought that acting might be a healthy outlet for Lori. When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, [...] "The best {{time in my life}} was when I was about four. Doree and I had to go <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> aunt in Ponca City, Oklahoma. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. That was when I decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately and my little brother was signed by the same agent, but he lacked my interest in acting. I just loved it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, it was {{reported}} that Lisa would return for a single episode later in the year in a bid to retrieve Louise from Phil, who gained custody of her earlier in the year. Benjamin said of her return: [...] "I'm really looking forward to returning to EastEnders for this episode. It will be great to see some familiar faces and work alongside old friends again." [...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood commented [...] "Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in EastEnders, so it's a real treat to have her back on screen," [...] while a spokesperson for the show added [...] "Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life– she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline {{is going to be an}} explosive episode in the Mitchells' history." [...] The episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, [...] "What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the little girl is old enough to make her own decisions and say, 'I want to <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> dad now'. So she had to let her go. I liked that I was able to come back and defend myself because Lisa was kind of being slaughtered in the Square for being a rubbish mum!" ...|$|E
