5|$|The Uranian {{satellite}} {{system is the}} least massive among those of the giant planets. Indeed, the combined mass of the five major satellites is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> that <b>of</b> Triton (the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System) alone. The largest of the satellites, Titania, has a radius <b>of</b> 788.9km, or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> that <b>of</b> the Moon, but slightly more than that of Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System.

5|$|The battle {{exhausted}} the JNA {{and proved}} {{a turning point}} in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia.

Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity.|$|E
5|$|De Laurentiis {{felt the}} only way to save the {{production}} was to find a new director and have the script rewritten. The other production companies were not content with De Laurentiis stopping production, which led Les Films Marceau-Cocinor to terminate its contract with Italy Film. A.S. Film Produccion confiscated the footage and took cameras, costumes, and weapons that had been rented by Italy Film, which nearly bankrupted the company. De Laurentiis restarted production with financial backing from distributor Paramount Pictures, and hired Mario Bava as director. The budget was also cut to 200 million lire, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the original budget.|$|E

5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the railway in only seven years, its opening {{did not bring}} the financial success that had been expected. In the Piccadilly Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 26million passengers, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 60million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR – in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E
5|$|Despite the improvements, the {{in-service}} {{rates for}} the F-84E remained poor with <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft operational at any given time. This was primarily due to a severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es would fly 25 hours per month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The actual flight hours for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E

For the second successive year, the Flyers failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs. Early the following season, Hextall received the third significant suspension of his career, missing six games for slashing Detroit forward Jim Cummins during a pre-season game. Suspension, further injuries, and a lack of form meant Hextall appeared 45times for the Flyers. He recorded 16wins during the season, resulting in his lowest win percentage in the NHL, 35.56%.|$|E
