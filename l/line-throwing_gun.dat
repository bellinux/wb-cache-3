50|$|A <b>line-throwing</b> <b>gun</b> is a short-barreled cannon {{designed}} {{to fire a}} projectile attached to a rope to a boat or victim in distress. Experiments in shooting tethered projectiles dates back to around 1800. A mortar device, the Manby Mortar, was credited with saving lives as early as 1808.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball, the only {{superintendent}} of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, {{was to find a}} better line-throwing device. Kimball realized he needed the best artillery expertise available, so he engaged the help of the Army Board of Ordnance and in 1877 they assigned David A. Lyle, First Lieutenant, U.S.A (1845-1937), a West Point and MIT graduate who began research and testing that resulted in reliable efficient designs. Lyle developed 3 bronze, smooth-bore guns of different sizes and the 2+1/2 in gun became the USLSS standard <b>line-throwing</b> <b>gun.</b> Projectiles for the gun were made of cast iron with a wrought iron eye bolt screwed into the base as an attachment point for the shot line. The projectile for the 2+1/2 in gun was 15+3/4 in long and weighed [...] It was placed into the 24 in gun barrel so the eye bolt with the line attached was sticking out. After firing, the projectile rotated so that the eye bolt and line were trailing. The gun had a large recoil from firing. A standard charge of 1.5 oz of gunpowder would knock the gun back 6 ft. The maximum rescue charge of 8 oz would send the gun flying back even further.|$|E
50|$|<b>Line-throwing</b> <b>guns</b> {{are most}} often {{referred}} to as Lyle Guns, after their inventor David A. Lyle. They were used from the late 19th century to 1952, when they were replaced by rockets for throwing lines.|$|R
50|$|Modern rocket-based {{systems are}} a common choice for vessels that require a line-throwing {{apparatus}} to meet SOLAS requirements, but in the late 1980s, pneumatic line throwers were invented and are preferred in many instances. Shoulder-fired <b>line-throwing</b> <b>guns</b> are available, {{and there are also}} slingshot-based systems.|$|R
50|$|There {{were about}} 30 {{companies}} who made <b>line-throwing</b> <b>guns</b> {{from the late}} 19th century to 1952. Famous names included American Manufacturing, Galbraith, General Ordnance, Naval Company, Sculler and Steward. Production of Lyle Guns ceased in 1952 in favor of line-throwing rockets or pneumatic launchers.|$|R
