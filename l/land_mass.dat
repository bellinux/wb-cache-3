5|$|It is {{possible}} that Taylor overshot Castaway Cay and instead reached another <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> in southern Abaco Island. He then proceeded northwest as planned. He fully expected to find the Grand Bahama Island lying {{in front of him}} as expected. Instead, he eventually saw a <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> to his right side, the northern part of Abaco Island. Believing that this landmass to his right was the Grand Bahama Island and his compass was malfunctioning, he set a course to what he thought was southwest to head straight back to Fort Lauderdale. However, in reality this changed his course farther northwest, toward open ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} presence of Rome lasted for {{little more than}} 40 years for most of Scotland and {{only as much as}} 80 years in total anywhere. It's now generally considered that at no time was even half of Scotland's <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> under Roman control.|$|E
5|$|Superman pursues Luthor, who {{has made}} his way to the growing <b>land</b> <b>mass.</b> The kryptonite shell {{surrounding}} the crystal has caused the new rock formations to be infused with kryptonite, making the land itself toxic to Superman. Luthor's thugs beat Superman into submission as he is unable to fight back. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite shard and allows him to fall into the ocean, presumably to die.|$|E

5|$|The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal, {{announced}} on September 2, 2002, and {{scheduled for a}} PC-only release, went gold on November 1 and was released, with little fanfare, on November 6. Tribunal puts the player in the self-contained, walled city of Mournhold, {{the capital of the}} province of Morrowind; the new city is not connected to Morrowinds <b>land</b> <b>mass,</b> Vvardenfell, and the player must teleport to it. The storyline continues the story of the Tribunal deities.|$|E
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Few dinosaur remains {{have been}} found in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, {{have been found}} in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was part of the same <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the only place in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.|$|E
40|$|This {{activity}} {{will enable}} students to view {{the breakup of the}} super-continent Pangaea over the past 190 million years and chart the subsequent movement of <b>land</b> <b>masses,</b> and to better understand plate tectonics. Students are provided with copies of map sheets with frames which are reconstructed maps of the <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> that existed on Earth at a specific time. Beginning with frame 20 and working backwards students identify the <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> listed in an available table. By assigning different <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> to different groups, the students will be able to share their results when the flipbooks are completed and several different continental movements and tectonic interactions will be illustrated on the different flipbooks. All required maps and tables are provided at this site. Educational levels: High school, Middle school...|$|R

5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E
5|$|Janszoon did {{not detect}} the {{existence}} of Torres Strait, which separates Australia and New Guinea. Unknown to the Dutch, the Spanish or Portuguese explorer Luis Váez de Torres, working for the Spanish Crown, sailed through the strait only four months later. However, Torres did not report seeing the coast of a major <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> to his south and is therefore presumed not to have seen Australia. Because the two separate observations of Janzoon and Torres were not matched, Dutch maps {{did not include the}} strait until after James Cook's 1770 passage through the Torres Strait, while early Spanish maps showed the coast of New Guinea correctly, but omitted Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E

Moreover, the <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> are {{characterized}} by high mountains, and the seas are among the warmest on the earth. This produces a widespread area of diurnal thunderstorms which pump huge quantities of moisture and heat high up into the atmosphere which in turn feeds the upper level winds which circle the globe.|$|R
5|$|The World of Continent {{is a large}} <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> {{ruled by}} three kings in {{constant}} war for control of their world. They each carry an object needed to open the tower's entrance. The World of Ocean consists of various small islands surrounded by water, each connected by small caves. Pirates roam the sea of this world, forbidding travel by ship. The World of Sky contains large land masses suspended in clouds, and is ruled by a powerful dictator from his flying castle. The World of Ruins is a technologically advanced cityscape, reduced to a post-apocalyptic wasteland by constant monster attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{trackage}} for cargo was increased, {{with a wide}} section of <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> being filled into the sea to create a larger rail and port facility at Brattøra, though the filling of {{a large part of}} the seabed to create artificial land. The railways allowed the transshipment of cargo from ships from Northern Norway to rail, as well as from rail from Central Sweden to ships to the British Isles. The port was supplemented by a new line to Ilsvika would allow the loading of ore there. The suggestion to build double track to Leangen was dropped.|$|E
5|$|The high {{concentration}} and more sedentary nature of shepherding in the UK allowed sheep especially adapted to their particular purpose and region to be raised, thereby {{giving rise to}} an exceptional variety of breeds {{in relation to the}} <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> of the country. This greater variety of breeds also produced a valuable variety of products to compete with the superfine wool of Spanish sheep. By the time of Elizabeth I's rule, sheep and wool trade was the primary source of tax revenue to the Crown of England and the country was a major influence in the development and spread of sheep husbandry.|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} in global mean temperatures between a fully glacial Earth and an ice free Earth {{is estimated at}} approximately 10 °C, though far larger changes would be observed at high latitudes and smaller ones at low latitudes. One requirement {{for the development of}} large scale ice sheets seems to be the arrangement of continental <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> at or near the poles. The constant rearrangement of continents by plate tectonics can also shape long-term climate evolution. However, {{the presence or absence of}} <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> at the poles is not sufficient to guarantee glaciations or exclude polar ice caps. Evidence exists of past warm periods in Earth's climate when polar <b>land</b> <b>masses</b> similar to Antarctica were home to deciduous forests rather than ice sheets.|$|R
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The {{windward}} {{side of a}} <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels with mild climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriforms are {{currently}} {{thought to have}} evolved in Africa, and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are azibiids from the early Eocene, which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> in the Paleocene (66 to 55mya). Stem lemuriforms, including Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri, {{have been found in}} Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, Plesiopithecus, a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt, is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, Djebelemur, ‘Anchomomys’ milleri, and Plesiopithecus are considered to be sister taxa (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the 13th {{century the}} Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire that {{encompassed}} much of Southeast Europe, West Asia and North Africa. The Ottoman Empire reached its peak <b>land</b> <b>mass</b> and became a world power during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent in the early modern period. It remained powerful and influential for two more centuries, until important setbacks in the 17th and 18th century forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe, which signaled the loss of its former military strength and wealth. After the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état, which effectively put the country {{under the control of the}} Three Pashas, the Ottoman Empire decided to join the Central Powers during World War I. The Central Powers were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers, despite Turkish victories over them during the war. During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens. Following the war, the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was partitioned into several new states. The Turkish War of Independence, initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues against occupying Allies, resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president. Atatürk enacted numerous reforms, many of which incorporated various aspects of western thought, philosophy, and customs into the new form of Turkish government.|$|E
