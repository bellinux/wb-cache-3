25|$|Others take a {{systemic}} viewpoint {{that does not}} necessarily depend on molecular chemistry. One systemic definition of <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> living things are self-organizing and autopoietic (self-producing). Variations of this definition include Stuart Kauffman's definition as an autonomous agent or a multi-agent system capable of reproducing itself or themselves, and of completing at least one thermodynamic work cycle. This definition is extended by the apparition of novel functions over time.|$|E

The only exception I have to have an abortion is in that case {{of the life of the}} mother. I just struggled with it myself for a long time but I came to realize: <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.|$|E

[...] A similar story is recounted in a detailed French-language account written by Alain de Fivas and published in 1864. [...] Moustache is mentioned in at least eleven English, French and German publications. [...] The story presented here is drawn largely from the Cano and de Fivas accounts and notes any disagreement with the other accounts.|$|E
500|$|Rogan {{writes in}} the book's introduction: [...] "an {{important}} caveat to any serious, well-researched biography or study of Morrison's <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the reader {{should be aware that}} a number of allegations against the subject cannot be featured in print for legal reasons. The author may feel that the final portrayal is far too flattering in certain places, while the reader who neglects to read between the lines may think the biographer could have been a little more sympathetic at times. Death alone will open this Pandora's box." [...] Morrison himself is quoted on the first page of the book, saying: [...] "Rogan's got something to hide. What's he hiding? I'd like to do a book on him." ...|$|E

[...] The Washington Post said: [...] "So great were her dynamism and force that it was almost impossible to resist her... Not only her own people, but all America has been enriched and ennobled by her courageous, ebullient spirit." [...] Her hometown newspaper, the Daytona Beach Evening News printed, [...] "To some she seemed unreal, something that could not be.... What right had she to greatness?...

500|$|Whitehead {{makes the}} startling {{observation}} that [...] "life is comparatively deficient in survival value." [...] If humans can only exist {{for about a}} hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, [...] "they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them." [...] He then observes that the mark of higher forms of <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better. [...] In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction. [...] Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.|$|E

2500|$|Panspermia {{hypothesis}} {{does not}} attempt to explain how life first originated, but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet. The advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> life {{is not required to}} have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact. Evidence to support the hypothesis is scant, but it finds support in studies of Martian meteorites found in Antarctica and in studies of extremophile microbes' survival in outer space tests.

[...] During an interview, she commented: [...] "I guess the girl that released Little Earthquakes was not a mother, {{and she was in}} her 20's, {{and there were a lot}} of things that she really did discover.

2500|$|He {{was most}} likely from {{the small town of}} Cadéac, in the {{southern}} part of Gascony near the Pyrenees, as suggested by his name. [...] All that is known about his <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was choirmaster in Auch, the historical capital of the region, in 1556, as mentioned on the title page of Du Chemin's publication of his Missa Alma Redemptoris Mater. [...] A poem by Bernard du Poey, published in 1551, also mentions him as being resident in Auch, but does not give his employment or any other details. In 1538 Jacques Moderne published some of his chansons in Lyons; this is the earliest date of activity known for Cadéac, but his location or employment at that time are not known.|$|E
2500|$|A {{point of}} {{controversy}} was {{the existence of}} [...] "courts of love", first mentioned by Andreas Capellanus. These were supposed courts made up of tribunals staffed by 10 to 70 women who would hear a case of love and rule on it based on the rules of love. In the 19th century, historians took {{the existence of these}} courts as fact, but later historians such as Benton noted [...] "none of the abundant letters, chronicles, songs and pious dedications" [...] suggest they ever existed outside of the poetic literature. According to Diane Bornstein, one way to reconcile the differences between the references to courts of love in the literature, and the lack of documentary evidence in real <b>life,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were like literary salons or social gatherings, where people read poems, debated questions of love, and played word games of flirtation.|$|E
2500|$|Jones's {{performance}} as Edward R. Rooney in the 1986 film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, {{made him a}} cultural icon. Rooney, self-important and obsessed with catching the chronically truant Ferris Bueller, {{became a symbol of}} pomposity and authoritarian hatefulness. In a movie review, the New York Times characterized Jones' performance [...] "fine cartoon like ferocity", wherein his character [...] "gets scratched, bitten, attacked by ferocious dogs and covered with mud while pursuing his weaker, but craftier, prey, and emerges each time bruised but undaunted, thinking up some new (and futile) plan." [...] The review likened Jones' role as akin to that of Wile E. Coyote as a character who is fated to be unable to catch The Road Runner (Ferris Bueller). Jones expressed concern about being remembered more for this role than his Emperor Joseph II in 1984's Amadeus. He said of the movie's premise, [...] "What's amazing about Ferris Bueller, is that we're asked to, and do, sympathise with a kid whose only complaint in <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his sister got a car for her birthday and he got a computer." ...|$|E

2500|$|The supercouple title {{has been}} {{similarly}} prolific with modern celebrity pairings. In 1997, rapper/actor Will Smith married actress Jada Pinkett. The couple were titled a supercouple {{due to their}} combined film star allure and perceived physical attractiveness. [...] In 2003 and 2008, People magazine categorized them as a supercouple due to their long marriage and widespread celebrity status. Smith spoke {{of the power of}} love as a connective force to Essence magazine. [...] "The truth about <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we're all alone," [...] he said. [...] "But when somebody loves you, that experience is shared. Love is the only real connective tissue that allows you to not live and die by yourself." [...] Additionally, in 1997, Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche began dating and were described as [...] "the world's first gay supercouple". Their relationship lasted three years. In 1998, Brad Pitt met Friends actress Jennifer Aniston, and married her in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu on July 29, 2000. They were titled a supercouple, {{regarded as one of the}} film industry’s most powerful, and their marriage was considered a rare Hollywood success. In January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced they decided to formally separate after seven years together. Two months later, Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. In 2000, Michael Douglas married Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones on November 18, 2000, and the pairing, born twenty-five years apart, were considered a supercouple.|$|E
2500|$|The apostles {{claimed that}} Jesus' {{death was a}} {{sacrifice}} of an innocent man {{for the sins of}} the guilty. But [...] "...Jesus had done away with the concept of 'guilt' itself [...] he had denied any chasm between God and man, he lived this unity of God and man as his 'glad tidings'...." [...] In order to claim that there is life after death, the apostles ignored Jesus' example of blessed living. Paul made immortality the main point in 1 Corinthians 15:17 when he said [...] "...if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain." [...] "Paul himself even taught personal immortality as a reward." [...] Paul used the promise of life after death as a way to seize tyrannical power over the masses of lower-class people. This changed Christianity from a peace movement that achieves actual happiness into a religion whose final judgment offers possible resurrection and eternal life. Paul falsified the history of Christianity, the history of Israel, and the history of mankind by making them all seem to be a preparation for the crucifixion. [...] "The great lie of personal immortality destroys all rationality, all natural in the instincts—all that is healthy, all that is life—promoting, all that guarantees a future now arouses mistrust." [...] The meaning of <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is no meaning to present life. One lives for life in the beyond. By offering immortal life after death to everyone, Christianity appealed to everyone's egoism. The laws of nature would be broken for the salvation of everyone. [...] "...t is to this pitiable flattery of personal vanity that Christianity owes its victory [...] it is with this that it has persuaded over to its side everything illconstituted, rebelliousminded, underprivileged, all the scum and refuse of mankind." [...] This influenced politics and led to revolutions against aristocracies. Nietzsche claimed that Paul's pretense of holiness and his use of priestly concepts were typically Jewish. Christianity separated itself from Judaism as though it was the chosen religion, [...] "...as if only the 'Christian' were the meaning, the salt, the measure and also the Last Judgment of all the rest." [...] Christianity then divided itself from the world by appropriating [...] "...the concepts 'God,' 'truth,' 'light,' 'spirit,' 'love,' 'wisdom,' 'life' as if these were synonyms of themselves..." [...] According to Nietzsche, [...] "In Christianity, as the art of holy lying, the whole of Judaism...attains its ultimate perfection." [...] "The Christian is only a Jew of a 'more liberal' persuasion." ...|$|E
