5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

However, when the optimal solution is reached, the summation of bandwidth or rate allocation approaches the bandwidth or backhaul limit.

30|$|As the {{adoption}} of congestion pricing policy, each cell will change its price according to the load at each iteration, thus MUs select the best serving BSs to associate with. When most MUs associate with the same cell, price will go up even more dramatically when cells are in highly congested state. Due to the lower price, MUs who originally reside in highly load cells are attracted to associate with other <b>lightly</b> <b>load</b> cells.

After iterations following the above steps, the algorithm can be converged to a sub-optimal solution. In fact, λ _i^bw and λ _i^rate can be interpreted as the shadow price in economics. If the demand ∑ _j∈Ψ _BS(i)w_ij(k) and ∑ _j∈Ψ _BS(i)se_ijw_ij(k) for BS i exceeds the maximum value, the shadow price will go up. Otherwise, the shadow price will decrease. Thus, when BS i is the congested state, its price will increase and fewer MUs will associate with it, while other <b>lightly</b> <b>load</b> BSs attract more MUs to associate with due to the lower price. In addition, the complexity is reduced to O(M+N). In comparison to the complexity O(M*N) of the centralized method, the distributed method guarantees the convergence fast and effective, especially for a large-scale network.|$|R

40|$|Free-piston Stirling power {{conversion}} {{has been considered}} a candidate for radioisotope power systems for space {{for more than a}} decade. Prior to the free-piston Stirling architecture, systems were designed with kinematic Stirling engines that used linkages and rotary alternators to convert heat to electricity. These systems were able to achieve long life by <b>lightly</b> <b>loading</b> the linkages; however, the live was nonetheless limited. When the free-piston configuration was initially proposed, it was thought to be attractive due to the relatively high conversion efficiency, acceptable mass, and the potential for long life and high reliability based on wear-free operation. These features have consistently been recognized by teams that have studied technology options for radioisotope space power systems. Since free-piston Stirling {{power conversion}} was first considered for space power applications, there have been major advances in three general areas of development: hardware that has demonstrated long-life and reliability, the success achieved by Stirling cryocoolers in space, and the overall developmental maturity of the technology for both space and terrestrial applications. Based on these advances, free-piston Stirling convertors are currently being developed for space power, and for a number of terrestrial applications. They commonly operate with the power, efficiency, life, and reliability as intended, and much of the development now centers on system integration. This paper will summarize the accomplishments of free-piston Stirling power conversion technology over the past decade, review the status of development with regard to space power, and discuss the challenges that remain...|$|R

40|$|Major {{part of this}} master thesis {{deals with}} impact of plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEVs) on the power system. First {{a brief review of}} the technical challenges in the power system due to mass introduction of the PHEVs in the transmission sector is given. Then the Master thesis shows on an analysis of the overloading effects of PHEVs on the distribution system with normal charging and quick charging of PHEVs for an IEEE 13 -node distribution test system using power flow analysis. The results of the study on the IEEE 13 -node distribution test system show that introduction of PHEVs in the transportation sector will lead to overloading of distribution system and cause voltage problems at the end-users. Then the impact of PHEVs is tested on a real distribution network in Gothenburg. Two areas have been selected one commercial and one residential area. In the 400 V network, there is a few numbers of overloaded line due to PHEVs charging while the under voltage effect on the end users is negligible providing that voltage of main busbar set higher than 1 pu which is the real case. In the real sample 10 kV network in the Gothenburg, where, there are number of 10 to 0. 4 kV substations that are supplying vehicles with required charging power besides their regular daily load, over loading of line is observed at peak load. Then maximum possible vehicles that can be charged without any violations in a reliable manner is calculated both for residential and commercial areas. The Master thesis also analyzes the effects of PHEVs in the transmission system, using one test transmission network (10 -Bus transmission system) and the Nordic 32 -bus test system. The study results show that the overloading problem is not prominent. Introduction specific penetration of vehicles leads to under voltage in the 10 -Bus transmission test system, while one interesting and important result happens in the Nordic 32 -bus test system and that is PHEVs may lead to over voltages in some buses in the transmission system which requires the voltage control measures. PHEVs would also lead to increased number of network violations in the contingency analysis. The Master thesis also analyzes maximization of the DGs penetration in the existing distribution networks. First a brief review of voltage rise effect in the networks equipped with DGs is given. Then this effect is simulated on the modified IEEE 13 -Nodes test system and finally one nonlinear programming with GAMS is presented to maximize DGs penetration in the <b>lightly</b> <b>load</b> distribution network with Power curtailment as a solution to mitigate over voltage...|$|R

2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage.

In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare.

40|$|An {{essential}} {{issue in}} designing, operating and managing a modern network is to assure end-to-end Quality-ofService (QoS) from users perspective, {{and in the}} meantime to optimize a certain average performance objective from the system s perspective. In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the average cross-network packet delay in virtual circuit networks subject to an end-to-end delay constraint for each origin-destination user pair. The problem is formulated as a multicommodity network flow problem with integer routing decision variables, where additional end-to-end delay constraints are considered. The difficulties of this problem result from the integrality nature and particularly the nonconvexity associated with the end-to-end delay constraints. The basic approach to the algorithm development is Lagrangean relaxation in conjunction with a number of optimization-based heuristics. In the computational experiments, it is shown that the proposed algorithm calculates solutions which are within 1 % and 3 % of optimal solutions under <b>lightly</b> and heavily <b>loaded</b> conditions, respectively, in minutes of CPU time for networks with up to 26 nodes.

40|$|Idele Wheel whining is a {{phenomenon}} which is predominantly familiar to motor vehicle gear boxes. Usually all the gear wheels are in constant tooth engagement. For this reason one gear wheel from each gear must be supplied with a bearing in order to permit the differences in rotational speeds across the shafts. These wheels, most of which rotate on roller bearings, are described as idle wheels. At very low temperatures in the start up phase a whine like noise is produced by the loose wheel. The noise emission {{does not come from}} the tooth engagements but from the idle wheel bearing. Extensive measurements of idle wheels were carried out at a test stand. A simulation program for <b>lightly</b> respectively not <b>loaded</b> roller bearings has been developped in order to clarify the mechanism of origin of the noise.

In this study, we analysed {{the effect of}} a phospholipid (DG) or protein (BSA) inclusion in porous cationic polysaccharide (NP(+)) on their physico-chemical structure and the effect on complement activation. METHODS: NP(+) s were characterised in terms of size, zeta potential (zeta) and static light scattering (SLS). Complement consumption was assessed in normal human serum (NHS) by measuring the residual haemolytic capacity of the complement system. RESULTS: DG loading did not change their size or zeta, whereas progressive BSA <b>loading</b> <b>lightly</b> decreased their zeta. An electrophoretic mobility analysis study showed the presence of two differently-charged sublayers at the NP(+) surface which are not affected by DG loading. Complement system activation, studied via a CH 50 test, was suppressed by DG or BSA loading.
