[...] "Fugitive dyes and colorants used in paints will eventually discolor under exposure to ultraviolet light. The fading of pigments and dyes in paintings will affect the color balance of the image." [...] Damage from natural and artificial light exposure can be mitigated by displaying paintings out of direct sunlight, use of blinds, shades, curtains, or shudders, filters on nearby windows, installing dimmers and appropriate <b>wattage</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulbs,</b> and displaying paintings a safe distance from a light source to limit heat exposure ...|$|R
50|$|To {{conserve}} {{energy consumption}} energy efficient and <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> <b>lights</b> were used. Feature lighting was also minimised to reduce both power requirements {{and the impact}} of the bridge on the surrounding area. Cut-off timers and remote operation features were also incorporated {{to reduce the amount of}} unnecessary lighting while still maintaining a safe environment for users. The energy requirement of the bridge is generated by a high profile solar roof, containing 108 x 175W panels. The solar roof feeds electricity back into the supply authority grid thereby offsetting the mains power electricity used by the bridge at night.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{destruction}} of aqueous 2, 4 -dichorophenol in ZnO suspension irradiated by <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> UV <b>light</b> at 299 K. The operating variables studied include initial 2, 4 -dichlorophenol concentration, photocatalyst doses and pH. At 1. 5 g l- 1 feed concentration of ZnO and 50 mg l- 1 initial 2, 4 -dichlorophenol level, a complete degradation was achieved in 180 min. The decomposition kinetics with respect to 2, 4 -dichlorophenol approximates pseudo zero-order with rate constant peaking at 0. 38 mg l- 1 min- 1. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detected benzoquinone, 2 -chlorohydroquinone, 4 -chlorophenol, 3, 5 -dichlorocatechol, hydroquinone, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde and phenol during the ZnO-assisted photodegradation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol among which some pathway products are disclosed for the first time. The reaction mechanism accounting for the degradation pathway intermediates is proposed. Inorganic anion additives such as S 2 O 8 2 -, SO 4 2 -, Cland HPO 4 2 - manifested inhibition against 2, 4 -dichlorophenol removal. </p...|$|R

5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The <b>wattage</b> of the <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed.

Non-incandescent light sources such as neon <b>light</b> <b>bulbs,</b> fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs,</b> and <b>light</b> emitting diodes are therefore much more energy efficient than normal incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs.</b> Green neon bulbs can produce up to 65 lumens per watt of power input, while white neon bulbs have an efficacy of around 50 lumens per watt.

40|$|Since September 2009, Regulation 244 / 2009 of the European Commission enforces {{the gradual}} {{phase-out}} of incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs.</b> As of September 2012, only energyefficient lighting sources {{will be allowed}} for sale. Among these are halogen <b>light</b> <b>bulbs,</b> light-emitting diodes (LED), or compact fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs?</b> {{often referred to as}} energy-saving <b>light</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The Commission’s justification for the phase-out of conventional <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> maintains that a reduction in the electricity consumed will not only lead to lower energy cost for private households and industrial consumers, {{but at the same time}} lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This article discusses possible reasons for the slow market diffusion of energy-saving <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> and shows that the investment in energy-efficient <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> does not necessarily lead to significant cost reductions. Drawing on some illustrative examples, we demonstrate that the use of cheaper incandescent bulbs instead of energy-saving <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> can be economically rational in cases of rather low usage times, in which the higher initial purchasing price might only pay off after very long time spans. Furthermore, due to the coexistence with the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), this regulation attains no additional emission reductions beyond those achieved by the ETS alone. We thus conclude that the general ban of incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> is inappropriate and should be abolished by the Commission. Energy efficiency; rebound effect...|$|R
