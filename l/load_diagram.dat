40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} for accelerated life benchmark tests of tractor friction clutches, imitating real mode <b>loading.</b> A <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> of a tractor unit, constructed by this technique, {{is common for}} all friction clutches of a given class and purpose. However, specific clutch loading is determined not only by a <b>loading</b> <b>diagram,</b> but by the design parameters of a friction unit as well (geometric dimensions, a value of the reserve coefficient  and a moment of inertia Je of the engine shaft, terms of heat sink, the number of friction pairs, an irregularity of their loading, etc.). Therefore, when assessing a durability of friction pairs of clutch, a <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> of tractor is reconstructed into the <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> of a particular friction clutch. At life benchmark tests a loading mode {{is close to the}} operating mode, and a convenience of the experiment is provided by logging load levels and by using the minimum number of bench changeovers. Thus, each specific clutch, in a common <b>diagram</b> of operating <b>loads</b> of the tractor, will meet an individual <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> that determines its durability. The paper presents the model <b>loading</b> <b>diagrams</b> for three types of tractors and clutches, used in their transmissions. Conclusions: The proposed technique for accelerated life benchmark tests of clutches is based on the principle of simulating a mode of loading to be equivalent to that of the operating mode. Thus, benchmark test acceleration is achieved by increasing the cyclic of clutching in comparison with an operating mode. Using the proposed technique allows 6 [...] . 10 times benchmark test acceleration as compared to the operating one, depending on the design, code of friction material and loading conditions under operation. Good convergence (error of 11 % at most) of the results at bench and field tests allows us to recommend the proposed technique to evaluate a resource of tractor clutches. </p...|$|R

In order to analyze transient heating of cables a daily <b>load</b> <b>diagram</b> with three levels, which can be described by two parameters is used. These parameters are duration of high level loading and load factor. In order to analyze daily temperature variation of the cable the ratio of high level current loading to rated current of the cable is also required.

Because of this the steam-turbine condensation units which are the traditional capacity regulators for the energy systems with heat power plants dominance are being pushed out of operation. In consequence of this complex of changes the issue of <b>load</b> <b>diagram</b> provision gains momentum which in evidence is relevant to the Consolidated Energy System of Belarus. One of the ways to alleviate acuteness of the problem could be the specific electric energy production cut on the CHP heat consumption with preserving the heat loads and without their handover to the heat generating capacities of direct combustion i. e. without fuel over-burning. The solution lies in integrating the absorption bromous-lithium heat pump units into the CHP thermal scheme. Through their agency low-temperature heat streams of the generator cooling, the lubrication and condensation heat-extraction of steam minimal passing to the condenser systems are utilized. As a case study the authors choose one of the CHPs in the conditions of which the corresponding employment of the said pumps leads to diminution of the fuel-equivalent specific flow-rate by 20 − 25 g for 1 kW⋅h production and conjoined electric energy generation capacity lowering.

40|$|Standard {{methods for}} {{determining}} the elastic modulus of polymer materials are based on tension, compression and bending tests of specially prepared specimens. Contrary to steel, the linear elastic area of deformation of polymer materials in standard experiments is rather small. This {{is the reason for}} a noticeable measurement error in the results obtained by such methods. The method of determination of the elastic modulus described in this study is based on the solution of the problem of compression of a thin-walled circular cylindrical shell by two parallel planes with regard to the geometrical and physical nonlinearity. The account of nonlinear effects in determination of elastic modulus makes it possible to use a considerably greater range of the loading curve in the elastic region of deformation compared with that in standard methods of testing specimens for tension, compression, and bending. The contact problem is solved by the finite-element method (ANSYS). To solve the nonlinear problem by the finite-element method, a macros-program was elaborated, which specifies the geometry, physical law, and properties of the material, boundary conditions, loading, division into finite elements, and the step scheme of the solution. The deformation of a thin polymer shell is characterized by great displacements and relatively low elastic deformations in a large range of movement of parallel planes. The solution obtained by finite element method allows making the universal <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> in dimensionless coordinates in the given range of thicknesses and elastic module.

In both cases, the widely used standard ACSR 31. 5 mm is taken as the base conductor. Increasing the number of conductors {{with respect to the}} commonly used 3 B improves the transport capacity, which can be properly represented in terms of loadability, i. e. the maximum allowable power that can be transmitted for an assigned value of the line length. The consequent higher power limit can be very useful in reducing transmission congestions and, thus, wind-generated energy curtailment that currently is not negligible in Southern Italy, promoting the integration of renewable energy. Moreover, reducing congestions has positive effect in relieving the differences in terms of zonal prices of the electric energy, bringing a further economic benefit for the system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} is to elaborate a method for determining the flexural modulus of a polymer material based on the solution of compression and tension problems by using the finite-element method in the finite element program ANSYS. To solve the nonlinear problem by the finite-element method, a macros-program was elaborated, which specifies the geometry, physical law, and properties of the material, boundary conditions, loading, division into finite elements, and the step scheme of the solution. The deformation of a thin polymer shell is characterized by great displacements and relatively low elastic deformations in a large range of movement of parallel planes. The solution obtained by finite element method allows making the universal <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> in dimensionless coordinates in the given range of thicknesses and elastic module. Equation of the universal <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> allows us to solve the inverse problem of determination of the elastic modulus according to experimental points on the <b>loading</b> <b>diagram.</b> The method of determination of the flexural modulus of thin polymer shells discussed above was successfully approved on a series of various kinds of thin PVC specimens by tension test.
