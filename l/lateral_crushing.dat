40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>lateral</b> <b>crushing</b> behaviour of short sandwich tubes, which consist of two concentric aluminium tubes of different diameters filled with aluminium foam. Experimental results and corresponding analytical models are presented. Aluminium sandwich tubes 50 mm long and of different values of diameter to thickness ratios were laterally crushed using an MTS machine at a displacement rate of 2 mm/min. Two bonding cases between the foam and monolithic component tubes, i. e. fully bonded and bonding free, were employed for all the configurations. Load-displacement curves were obtained. Deformation mechanisms were observed and three different crushing patterns have been identified. The experiments reveal that the bonding between the tubes and core for sandwich tubes played a different role in the three crushing patterns. Analytical models using rigid, perfectly plastic theory have been developed, which agree well with the corresponding experimental results...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to find SEA (Specific Energy Absorber) for <b>lateral</b> <b>crushing</b> (statically) {{behavior}} for Aluminum (2024 -T 351) alloy with difference lengths (10, 20, and 30 mm). An experimental, finite element simulation, and theoretical models present to find force-deformation curves {{and then find}} SEA for difference lengths. Experimental results more agreements with finite elements simulation and theoretical when length of tubes is increase for load deformation curve, because when the length increases the plastic region increase with initial plastic collapse load (Pc). The experimental, ANSYS simulation and theoretical results have plotted and it has seen that the theory also underestimates the ANSYS results because in theoretical model, is customary {{to assume that the}} material is perfectly plastic, therefore, the finite element simulation might predict the experimental results better than the theoretical one. The results show that light density Aluminum alloy is suitable for SEA. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective 　To explore {{diagnostic}} method and surgical outcome of <b>lateral</b> patellofemoral <b>crush</b> syndrome caused by military training. Methods 　Fifteen patients with <b>lateral</b> patellofemoral <b>crush</b> syndrome caused by military training from May 2006 to May 2008 {{were enrolled in}} this study, including 12 men (14 knees) and 3 women (3 knees), aged from 22 to 43 years old {{with an average of}} 27. 3 years. Randomly selected 18 healthy volunteers with similar age and gender but no knee pain symptom were selected to serve as a control group. Anteroposterior and lateral X-ray photographs of knee joint and axial photographs of the patella were taken in both groups for observing the bone architecture of the knee joint and measuring the femoral trochlear angle, patellofemoral congruence angle and patellofemoral index, and the data were compared. The 17 knee joints in patient group were treated with lateral patellar retinaculum release. Then the preoperative and postoperative pain severity was evaluated with visual analogue scale (VAS). Results 　Patellofemoral congruence angle was 7. 67 °± 5. 81 ° and patellofemoral index was 2. 49 ± 1. 40 in patient group, while they were － 2. 2 °±－ 2. 71 ° and 1. 25 ± 0. 15 in control group. The difference between two groups showed statistical significance (P < 0. 05). The change in bone architecture was obvious in patient group. The preoperative pain score was 7. 06 ± 0. 85, and postoperative pain score was 3. 87 ± 0. 24 after 6 months and 3. 01 + 0. 17 after 1 year in patient group. The difference between preoperative pain score and postoperative pain score showed statistical significance (P < 0. 05). Conclusions 　Diagnosis of patellofemoral crush syndrome caused by military training requires a combination of case history, typical symptoms, objective sign and X-ray examination. Among these, X-ray examination is the fundamental auxiliary diagnostic tool for <b>lateral</b> patellofemoral <b>crush</b> syndrome, and the patellofemoral index is convenient for diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Compression {{testing of}} large, thin, {{stiffened}} composite panels is complex {{due to the}} susceptibility of such panels to premature buckling and failure. Such failures are due to the artifacts of testing, such as, offset at load introduction edges, non-uniform distribution of loads, nature of <b>lateral</b> supports, <b>crushing</b> of panel edges etc. In this paper, a novel approach for compression loading of thin stiffened composite panels is proposed and validated from finite element analysis supported by tests. Compression loading of such panels (less than 2 mm thick) is challenging since the edges are susceptible to local crushing. To avoid this, loading edges of the panel were encased in mild steel casing blocks filled with finely grounded aluminium powder mixed with epoxy resin. Coupon level tests were conducted to measure mechanical properties of the interface between composite and casting mixture. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was used in these tests to measure the full field strains and to validate numerical simulations. Further, finite element analysis of the actual composite test panel with end casting mixture was performed which indicated that interface shear stresses and compression stresses at maximum expected load are much lower than allowables obtained from specimen tests. Hence, the Aluminium-Epoxy cast mixture proposed in this study can be used safely to cast edges of large stiffened panels for axial compression tests...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{examining}} the uniaxial behaviour of concrete materials incorporating rubber particles, obtained from recycled end-of-life tyres, {{as a replacement}} for mineral aggregates. A detailed account of a set of material tests on rubberised concrete cylindrical samples, in which fine and coarse mineral aggregates are replaced in equal volumes by rubber particles with various sizes, is presented. The experimental results carried out in this investigation, combined with detailed examination of data available from previous tests on rubberised concrete materials, show that the rubber particles influence the mechanical properties {{as a function of the}} quantity and type of the mineral aggregates replaced. Experimental evaluation of the complete stress-strain response depicts reductions in compressive strength, elastic modulus, and crushing strain, with the change in rubber content. Enhancement is also observed in the energy released during crushing as well as in the <b>lateral</b> strain at <b>crushing,</b> primarily due to the intrinsic deformability of the interfacial clamping of rubber particles which leads to higher lateral dilation of the material. The test results and observations enable the definition of a series of expressions to estimate the mechanical properties of rubberised concrete materials. An analytical model is also proposed for the detailed assessment of the complete stress-strain response as a function of the volumetric rubber ratio. Validations performed against the material tests carried out in this study, as well as those from previous investigations on rubberised concrete materials, show that the proposed models offer reliable predictions of the mechanical properties including the full axial and lateral stress-strain response of concrete materials incorporating rubber particles...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic <b>lateral</b> <b>crushing</b> of {{mild steel}} (DIN 2393) nested tube systems was {{conducted}} using a ZWICK ROELL impact tester. The tests were performed with impact velocities ranging between 3 and 5 m/s, achieved using a fixed mass impinging onto the specimens {{under the influence}} of gravity. The various nested tube systems consisted of one standard and one optimised design. Their crushing behaviour and energy absorption capabilities were obtained and analysed. In addition to the experimental work, numerical simulations using the explicit code LS-DYNA were conducted; boundary conditions matching those observed in experiments were applied to the models. Results from the numerical method were compared against those obtained from experiments. An over-prediction in force-deflection responses was obtained from the numerical code. An attempt was made to explain this inconsistency {{on the basis of the}} formation of plastic hinges and the validity of strain rate parameters used in the Cowper Symonds relation. It was found that the optimised energy absorbers exhibited a more desirable force-deflection response than their standard counterparts due to a simple design modification which was incorporated in the optimised design. ...|$|E

40|$|In decerebrate rats, {{recurrent}} inhibition between lateral gastrocnemius-soleus (LG-S) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) motor pools {{was assessed}} by conditioning monosynaptic reflexes elicited from the cut dorsal roots and recorded either from the LG-S and MG nerves by antidromic volleys delivered to the synergist muscle nerve. The results show that following sciatic nerve crush in both experimental groups {{there is a significant}} sustained depression in the level of recurrent inhibition. The reduction in recurrent inhibition observed is less in adult animals when comparisons are made with the results from rats given the nerve injury early in postnatal life. However, following <b>lateral</b> gastrocnemius-soleus nerve <b>crush</b> instead of sciatic nerve crush, which shortened the dennervation time respectively, the reduction of recurrent inhibition was not observed in adult rat group and was much less in 5 -day-old rat group. In addition, the different contributions of the recurrent inhibition between LG-S and MG motor pools are dedifferentiated as a result of nerve injury. It is proposed that this reduction of recurrent inhibition occurs due to degeneration of motor axon collaterals following the nerve injury. Such degeneration has been observed in the cat following axotomy (Havton & Kellerth, 1984, 1990 a). The maintained reduction of recurrent inhibition may therefore be a consequence of a failure of regenerating axon collaterals to re-establish contact with Renshaw cells and/or alterations in the membrane properties of the injured motoneurones. However, this kind of degeneration may not occur if dennervation is short enough. In conclusion, this observed reduction of recurrent inhibition may contribute to the hyperreflexia reported in young animals following nerve crush (Navarrete et al., 1990) and that the results in this study support the view that peripheral nerve injury induces plastic changes in the behaviour of spinal circuitry...|$|R
40|$|A {{technological}} {{basis for}} efficient ceramic machining requires a fundamental {{understanding of the}} prevailing grinding mechanisms. Most past research on grinding mechanisms for ceramics has followed either the 2 ̆ 2 indentation fracture mechanics 2 ̆ 2 approach or the 2 ̆ 2 machining 2 ̆ 2 approach. The indentation fracture mechanics approach likens abrasive workpiece interactions to idealized small-scale indentations. The machining approach typically involves measurement of cutting forces together with microscopic observations of grinding debris and surfaces produced. Both approaches provide important insights into the grinding mechanisms for ceramic materials. However, up to now, no physical model has been presented which can quantitatively account for the energy associated with grinding of ceramics. ^ The present research was undertaken to investigate grinding mechanisms for ceramics and {{to account for the}} energy expended. SEM observations of grinding debris for various ceramics and a glass over a wide range of conditions indicate material removal mainly by brittle fracture associated with <b>lateral</b> cracking and <b>crushing.</b> However, the ground surfaces reveal extensive ductile flow with characteristic scratches along the grinding direction and smearing. Ductile flow typically extends to a depth of 1 - 5 μm below the ground surface. For silicon nitride, etching with hydrofluoric acid removed the smeared layer, which would indicate that it consists of a glassy phase probably formed by oxidation at elevated grinding temperatures. ^ Although material removal appears to occur mainly by brittle fracture, most of the grinding energy is apparently associated with ductile flow. An order of magnitude analysis indicates that the energy expended by brittle fracture constitutes a negligible portion of the total grinding energy. An upper bound plowing analysis is presented which can account the specific energy in terms of the geometry of the plowed groove. A new model has been developed which relates the grinding power to the rate of plowed surface area generated by the diamond cutting points on the wheel surface interacting with the workpiece. Over a wide range of grinding conditions, the power increases approximately proportionally with the rate of surface area generated, which suggests a nearly constant energy per unit area of plowed surface. Values obtained for energy per area for plowing are much bigger than the corresponding fracture surface energies, which further indicates that most of the grinding energy is associated with ductile flow. ...|$|R

40|$|Short {{tubes are}} common {{structural}} components for energy absorption. Sandwich tubes {{are expected to}} enhance the energy absorption capacity. To this end, experiments were conducted to investigate the <b>lateral</b> <b>crushing</b> of short sandwich tubes in this paper. Twenty eight sandwich tubes and twenty four monolithic aluminium tubes with a length of 50 mm and different diameter to thickness ratios were laterally crushed by an MTS machine with a fixed displacement rate of 2 mm/min. Their deformation histories and load-displacement curves were obtained. The deformation characteristics of short sandwich tubes {{were found to be}} bending dominated with plastic hinges, accompanied with crushing of the core. Three major collapse patterns were observed and summarized in terms of geometric features. They were simultaneous collapse, tear facture collapse and sequential collapse. Four major factors that influenced the collapse load in plastic collapse stage were investigated, namely glue effect, average radius of curvature, thickness ratio of inner and outer tubes and thickness of core. It was observed that the following factors increased the total energy absorption capacity of sandwich tubes: applying bonding, decreasing of average radius of curvature, significantly increasing of core thickness. Increase of thickness ratio of inner and outer tubes changed the deformation patterns which resulted in a decrease of collapse force at the earlier stage and enhanced collapse force later on...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic <b>lateral</b> <b>crushing</b> {{behaviour}} {{of short}} empty and sandwich circular tubes is {{examined in this}} paper. Unlike the conventional impact method, the specimens {{were placed on the}} bottom platen of an Instron machine with a constant upwards velocity and then the tube collided with the fixed upper rigid platen. Load-deflection curves of empty tubes were first obtained and analysed. From the viewpoint of deformation modes and plastic strain energy absorbed by the tube quadrants around the proximal surface and distal surface, a critical velocity of impact is determined which corresponds to a mode change. A relationship is found to exist between the critical velocity and thickness-to-diameter ratio as well as the yield stress and density of the material. To understand the dynamic crushing behaviour of short aluminium foam-filled sandwich tubes by two rigid platens, further tests and corresponding finite element analysis were performed, respectively. Similar to the observations in the quasi-static tests, the mode of dynamic collapse is bending, with the formation of plastic bending zones accompanied with core crushing. Corresponding FE models for ABAQUS/Explicit were developed and validated against the experimental observations. Detailed deformation features and energy absorption characteristics during the crushing process were identified. It was found that increasing the compression velocity leads to an increase in the total internal plastic energy dissipation for both empty and sandwich tube. The propagation of plastic bending in the form of double-moving-hinges is the main mechanism of energy dissipation, as opposed to the low velocity impact which involves stationary plastic deformation zones...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBalsa wood is {{a natural}} {{cellular}} material with excellent stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios as well as superior energy absorption characteristics. These properties are derived from the microstructure, which consists of long slender cells (tracheids) with approximately hexagonal crosssections that are arranged axially. Parenchyma are a second type of cells that are radially arranged in groups that periodically penetrate the tracheids (rays). Under compression in the axial direction the material exhibits a linearly elastic regime that terminates by the initiation of failure {{in the form of}} localized kinking. Subsequently, under displacement-controlled compression, a stress plateau is traced associated with the gradual spreading of crushing of the cells through the material. The material is less stiff and weaker in the tangential and radial directions. Compression in these directions crushes the tracheids laterally but results in a monotonically increasing response typical of <b>lateral</b> <b>crushing</b> of elastic honeycombs. The elastic and inelastic properties in the three directions have been established experimentally {{as a function of the}} wood density. The microstructure and its deformation modes under compression have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy. In the axial direction it was observed that in the majority of the tests, failure initiated by kinking in the axial–tangential plane. The local misalignment of tracheids in zones penetrated by rays ranged from 4 ° to 10 ° and axial compression results in shear in these zones. Measurement of the shear response and the shear strength in the planes of interest enabled estimation of the kinking stress using the Argon–Budiansky kinking model. The material strength predicted in this manner has been found to provide a bounding estimate of the axial strength for a broad range of wood densities. The energy absorption characteristics of the wood have also been measured and the specific energy absorption was found to be comparable to that of metallic honeycombs of the same relative density...|$|E
40|$|Interest in timber-concrete {{composite}} (TCC) floors {{has increased}} over the last 30 years. TCC technology relies on timber and concrete members acting compositely together. Both timber and concrete exhibit a quite brittle behaviour in bending/tension and compression respectively whilst the shear connection is identified as the only contributor of ductile behaviour. Therefore, the strength, stiffness and arrangement of the shear connection {{play a crucial role}} in the structural design of TCC. There are only few investigations on analytical closed-form equation to predict the stiffness and strength of TCC joints as input values to design a partially composite floor. For example, Johansen’s yield theory was adopted as European yield model in Eurocode 5. However, the equations are limited to vertically inserted dowels or screws and Eurocode 5 recommends that the strength and stiffness of unconventional joints should be determined by push-out tests. Previous investigations reported that the inclined shear connector significantly increase the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of the TCC joints and consequently composite floor. This paper presents a model for the strength ofTCC joint using crossed (± 45 °) proprietary screws (SFS Intec). The Johansen yield theory is extended to derive the strenght model of TCC joint with crossed (± 45 °) screws which are loaded in tension and compression. The model is an upper bound plastic collapse model that assumes the behaviour of timber and screw perfectly plastic with undamaged concrete. The failure modes considers of yield of screw, in tension or shear, and some combined modes assuming screw withdrawal, <b>lateral</b> <b>crushing</b> of the timber and the development of plastic hinges in the screw. The experimental aspect of the research consists of push-out tests and aims to verify the strength model of TCC joints with inclined screws. The failure modes are also investigated. The model seems to be reasonably accurate in predicting both the characteristic strength and failure mode. This research suggests the model to facilitate the design of inclined screw shear connections for TCC construction...|$|E
40|$|Metallic {{sandwich}} panels with {{a cellular}} core, such as honeycomb or metal foam, can dissipate considerable energy through large plastic deformation under quasi-static or dynamic loading. The curved panels are generally substantially stronger and stiffer than other structural forms and perform better under various loadings. This {{is due to}} effectively supporting external loads {{by virtue of their}} spatial curvature. A better combination to leverage the advantages of shells and sandwich structures was expected and of great importance for its applications. Furthermore, recent research proved that the flat sandwich panels outperformed monolithic panels of an identical mass per area under blast and impact loadings. It is of great interests with a potential application to study the behaviour of curved sandwich structures under blast and impact loadings. To this end, the blast and impact response and energy absorbing performance of two types of cylindrical shells were investigated experimentally, numerically and analytically. Four different case studies to determine the energy absorption and blast and impact resistance performance of sandwich shells were conducted: (I) the <b>lateral</b> <b>crushing</b> of sandwich tubes compressed by two rigid plates; (II) radial crushing of sandwich tubes under inner blast loading, (III) indentation/penetration resistance of singly curved sandwich panels subjected to foam impact; and finally, (IV) mechanical response of singly curved sandwich panels subjected to blast loads. The deformation and failure patterns of sandwich shells were clarified under various loading conditions as well as the energy absorption mechanisms. Finite element models were developed and validated by these experiments, which provided more detailed deformation and failure information during the loading process. Importantly, these investigations found that: (I) the core crushing is an inherent deformation pattern for sandwich shells under various blast and impact loadings; (II) sandwich shell structures outperform their corresponding monolithic structures only in a certain range, determined by the intensity of blast and impact and the initial geometry features of the sandwich shells; (III) the glue effect between the core and face sheet {{plays an important role in}} curved sandwich structures and it is more important for curved sandwich structures with a thin face sheet than that with a thick face sheet; (IV) the strain rate or loading rate effect of the aluminium foam core is relatively small compared with other effects. Besides those findings, two analytical solutions were provided for sandwich tubes under lateral compression and inner blast loadings. Those solutions will enable designer to optimise the sandwich shell structures under blast and impact loadings, which will greatly enhance the blast and impact resistance of curved sandwich structures in various applications...|$|E
