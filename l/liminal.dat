5|$|In many cultures, {{including}} in Europe, bats {{are associated with}} darkness, death, witchcraft, and malevolence. Because bats are mammals, yet can fly, they are <b>liminal</b> beings in many traditions. Among Native Americans such as the Creek, Cherokee and Apache, the bat is a trickster spirit. In Tanzania, a winged bat cryptid known as Popobawa, {{is believed to be}} a shapeshifting evil spirit that assaults and sodomises its victims. In Aztec mythology, bats symbolized the land of the dead, destruction, and decay. An East Nigerian tale tells that the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner, the bush-rat, and now hides by day to avoid arrest.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir John Macdonald, {{made plans}} to create a 200-strong mounted police force to {{maintain}} order along the border; such a force, he thought, would enable the colonisation {{of the region and}} be much cheaper than deploying regular military units for the task. The implementation of this proposal was delayed, however, first by the rebellion of the Métis, and then by the threat of a Fenian invasion. Meanwhile, a survey conducted in 1871 by Lieutenant William Butler recommended establishing a mounted force of up to 150 men under a magistrate or commissioner, based along the northern trade routes, leaving the border area as a <b>liminal,</b> ungarrisoned zone. Colonel Patrick Robertson-Ross conducted another survey in 1872, and recommended an alternate strategy of recruiting a larger force of 550 men who would be tasked to push south into the border region itself and establish law and order there.|$|E
5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way that}} the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses <b>liminal</b> name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E

25|$|In Hellenistic and Roman times Tiresias' sex-change was {{embroidered}} {{upon and}} expanded into seven episodes, with appropriate amours in each, probably {{written by the}} Alexandrian Ptolemaeus Chennus, but attributed by Eustathius to Sostratus of Phanagoria's lost elegiac Tiresias.

25|$|Her most {{important}} sanctuary was Lagina, a theocratic city-state {{in which the}} goddess was served by eunuchs. Lagina, where the famous temple of Hecate drew great festal assemblies every year, lay close to the originally Macedonian colony of Stratonikeia, where she was the city's patroness. In Thrace she played a role {{similar to that of}} lesser-Hermes, namely a governess of <b>liminal</b> regions (particularly gates) and the wilderness.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{noteworthy}} curiosity {{that the}} opening of the Janus was perhaps the last act connected to the ancient religion in Rome: Procopius writes that in 536 CE, during the Gothic War, while general Belisarius was under siege in Rome, at night somebody opened the Janus Geminus stealthily, which had long stayed closed since 390, year on which Theodosius I's edict banned the ancient cults. Janus was faithful to his <b>liminal</b> role also in the marking of this last act.|$|E
25|$|Caves {{are often}} {{described}} as entries into the watery Maya underworld. For Mesoamerican groups, including the Maya, life and death occur at <b>liminal</b> zones between this world and the otherworld. Caves then are both associated with life and death; when something emerges from the underworld, that something lives, and when something descends into the underworld, that something dies. Caves are seen as birthplaces where humans and group ancestors were born (and live) and the Maya of the Yucatán even thought that the sun and moon were born out of the underworld.|$|E

The Twins themselves, however, are usually absent from Classic ballgame scenes, with the Vucub Caquix of the Copán ball court babe, holding the severed arm of Hunahpu, as an important exception.|$|E
25|$|Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry {{himself in}} De Stijl, {{although}} under a pseudonym, I.K.Bonset, {{which was only}} revealed {{after his death in}} 1931. 'Together' with I.K.Bonset, he also published a short-lived Dutch Dada magazine called Mécano (1922–3). Another Dutchman identified by K. Schippers in his study of the movement in the Netherlands was the Groningen typographer H. N. Werkman, who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine, The Next Call (1923–6). Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German-born and eventually settled in the Netherlands. These were Otto van Rees, who had taken part in the <b>liminal</b> exhibitions at the Café Voltaire in Zürich, and Paul Citroen.|$|E
25|$|Illustrations of {{theatrical}} masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes {{for the eyes}} and a small aperture for the mouth, {{as well as an}} integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that <b>liminal</b> space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality. This demonstrates {{the way in which the}} mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role. Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.|$|E
25|$|Geminus is {{the first}} epithet in Macrobius's list. Although the {{etymology}} of the word is unclear, it is certainly related to his most typical character, that of having two faces or heads. The proof are the numerous equivalent expressions. The origin of this epithet might be either concrete, referring directly {{to the image of}} the god reproduced on coins and supposed to have been introduced by king Numa in the sanctuary at the lowest point of the Argiletum, or to a feature of the Ianus of the Porta Belli, the double gate ritually opened at the beginning of wars, or abstract, deriving metaphorically from the <b>liminal,</b> intermediary functions of the god themselves: both in time and space passages connected two different spheres, realms or worlds. The Janus quadrifrons or quadriformis, brought according to tradition from Falerii in 241 BC and installed by Domitian in the Forum Transitorium, although having a different meaning, seems to be connected to the same theological complex, as its image purports an ability to rule over every direction, element and time of the year. It did not give rise to a new epithet though.|$|E
500|$|The {{major themes}} of Spirited Away {{center on the}} protagonist Chihiro and her <b>liminal</b> journey through the realm of spirits. The archetypal {{entrance}} into another world demarcates Chihiro's status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The {{use of the word}} kamikakushi (literally [...] "hidden by gods") within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this <b>liminal</b> passage: [...] "Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'" ...|$|E

Yet despite its global or cosmic dimensions, the Battle of Issus still looks like Altdorfer's earlier, contemplative <b>liminal</b> landscapes of retreat, complete with craggy peaks, bodies of water, and distant castles." ...|$|E
500|$|In an August 2009 {{piece for}} The Wire, {{journalist}} David Keenan coined [...] "hypnagogic pop" [...] while {{inspired by a}} comment made by James Ferraro. Keenan referred to a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists began to engage with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outdated recording technology. Around that time, a wave of retro-inspired home-recording artists had begun dominating underground indie scenes. Among the artists discussed in Keenan's article were Ferraro, Spencer Clark, Ariel Pink, Zola Jesus, Ducktails, Emeralds, and Pocahaunted. He employed the term [...] "hypnagogic" [...] as referring to the psychological state [...] "between waking and sleeping, <b>liminal</b> zones where mis-hearings and hallucinations feed into the formation of dreams." [...] According to Keenan, these artists began to draw on cultural sources subconsciously remembered from their 1980s and early 1990s adolescence while freeing them from their historical contexts and [...] "hom in on the futuristic signifiers" [...] of the period. He alternately summarized hypnagogic pop as [...] "pop music refracted through {{the memory of a}} memory" [...] and as [...] "1980's-inspired psychedelia" [...] which engages with capitalist detritus of the past in an attempt to [...] "dream of the future." ...|$|E
500|$|Tokuma Shoten {{merged with}} Studio Ghibli in June 1997. Miyazaki's next film was {{conceived}} while on vacation at a mountain cabin {{with his family}} and five young girls who were family friends. Miyazaki realised that he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls, and set out to do so. He read shōjo manga magazines like Nakayoshi and Ribon for inspiration, but felt they only offered subjects on [...] "crushes and romance", which is not what the girls [...] "held dear in their hearts". He decided to produce the film about a female heroine whom they could look up to. Production of the film, titled Spirited Away, commenced in 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion (US$15 million). As with Princess Mononoke, the staff experimented with computer animation, but kept the technology at a level to enhance the story, not to [...] "steal the show". Spirited Away deals with symbols of human greed, and a <b>liminal</b> journey through the realm of spirits. The film was released on July 20, 2001; it received critical acclaim, and is considered among the greatest films of the 2000s. It won the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The film was also commercially successful, earning ¥30.4 billion (US$289.1 million) at the box office. It is the highest-grossing film in Japan.|$|E
500|$|The Marble Index was {{produced}} during a little-studied period of Nico's life. For The Quietuss Matthew Lindsay, [...] "the <b>liminal</b> drift {{of these years}} only emphasizes the music's amorphous moorings and lack of precedent." [...] Nico approached Danny Fields around the summer of 1968 {{with the desire to}} make an album and prove herself artistically. Resentful of her beauty, she radically changed her image – dyeing her hair red and wearing black clothes in an effort to distance herself from what had made her a popular fashion model. John Cale said, [...] "She hated the idea of being blonde and beautiful, and in some ways she hated being a woman, because she figured all her beauty had brought her was grief... So The Marble Index was an opportunity for her to prove she was a serious artist, not just this kind of blonde bombshell." [...] Nico already had the title for the album in mind from The Prelude, William Wordsworth's magnum opus; in it, he contemplates a statue of Isaac Newton [...] "with his prism and silent face / The marble index of a mind for ever / Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone." [...] Asked about the significance of this Wordsworth quote, Nico replied: [...] "I sometimes find a little of my own poetry in other poets, yes. Incidentally, or accidentally." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{reports of}} Gello's {{behavior}} are consistent, her nature is less determinate. She {{is regarded as}} a demon in exorcisms and commanded as an [...] "unclean spirit" [...] (akatharton [...] pneuma). But her aition as a human being would make a ghost of her, as did her gendered nature, since demons, like angels, were officially sexless in the theology of the Church. Johnston prefers to use the Greek word aôrôs, [...] "untimely dead," [...] for this form of transgressive or <b>liminal</b> soul or entity, finding the usual phrase [...] "child-killing demon" [...] to be misleading.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attribution}} of animal-like qualities to demons continues from the Jewish tradition; like demons, animals may {{be classified as}} [...] "unclean."

The association of unclean spirits with <b>liminal</b> areas such as ruins, cemeteries, and deserts also continues from Judaic belief; [...] speaks of the future ruin of Babylon as [...] "a dwelling place of every unclean spirit and a haunt of every unclean and hateful bird." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{her work}} is {{characterized}} by its <b>liminal</b> nature: tensions between tradition and assimilation, and between literature and politics. These tensions are expressed particularly in her autobiographical works. In [...] her well-known American Indian Stories, for example, she both expresses a literary account {{of her life and}} delivers a political message. The narrative expresses her tension between wanting to follow the traditions of the Yankton Dakota while being excited about learning to read and write, and being tempted by assimilation. [...] This tension has been described as generating much of the dynamism {{of her work}}.|$|E
2500|$|That {{there is}} more than mere homosociality in the {{dealings}} of David and Jonathan is asserted by two recent studies: the biblical scholar Susan Ackerman, and the Orientalist Jean-Fabrice Nardelli. Ackerman and Nardelli argue that the narrators of the books of Samuel encrypted same-sex allusions in the texts where David and Jonathan interact so as to insinuate that the two heroes were lovers. Ackerman explains this as a case of <b>liminal,</b> viz. transitory, homosexuality, deployed by the redactors as a textual means to assert David's rights against Jonathan's: the latter willingly alienated his princely status by bowing down (...) , sexually speaking, to the former. Nardelli disagrees and argues that the various covenants Jonathan engaged David into as the superior partner gradually elevated David's status and may be seen as marriage-like.|$|E
2500|$|... a) The {{calendar}} of Numa {{and the role}} of Janus. Contradictions of the ancient Roman calendar on the beginning of the new year: originally March was the first month and February the last one. January, the month of Janus, became the first afterwards and through several manipulations. The <b>liminal</b> character of Janus is though present in the association to the Saturnalia of December, reflecting the strict relationship between the two gods Janus and Saturn and the rather blurred distinction of their stories and symbols. The initial role of Janus in the political-religious operations of January: the nuncupatio votorum spanning the year, the imperial symbol of the boat in the opening rite of the sailing season, the vota felicia: Janus and his myths allow for an ancient interpretation of the vota felicia, different from the Isiadic one.|$|E
2500|$|For these people, the bogs held {{some sort}} of <b>liminal</b> significance, and indeed, they placed into them votive offerings {{intended}} for the Other world, often of neck-rings, wristlets or ankle-rings made of bronze or more rarely gold. The archaeologist P.V. Glob believed that these were [...] "offerings to the gods of fertility and good fortune." [...] It is therefore widely speculated that the Iron Age bog bodies were thrown into the bog for similar reasons, {{and that they were}} therefore examples of human sacrifice to the gods. Explicit reference to the practice of drowning slaves who had washed the cult image of Nerthus and were subsequently ritually drowned in Tacitus' Germania XC, suggesting that the bog bodies were sacrificial victims may be contrasted with a separate account (Germania XII), in which victims of punitive execution were pinned in bogs using hurdles.|$|E
2500|$|The Liminals [...] "stand at {{the border}} between life and death, {{humanity}} and monstrosity". They are created when someone attempts to bring another person back from death; resurrection is explicitly impossible in Exalted, but some will still try. [...] Most of the time, it fails, but on occasion it draws the attention of some other power that raises the corpse to life again. [...] The new <b>Liminal</b> possesses {{the memories of the}} body that she wears, but does not possess the same soul, and thus does not have the same personality. [...] In their initial introduction at the end of Second Edition, it was mentioned that they possess an interest in severed limbs and body parts, but the full explanation for this has yet to be given. Like the Dragon-Blooded, they are divided among five aspects—Breath, Blood, Flesh, Marrow, and Soil—depending on the motives of the person who created them.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} decade two more books were dedicated to confirming Brummell as a cult figure. In England there was Captain Jesse's two volume Life of George Brummell (1844), the first biography devoted to him. In France {{there was the}} influential essay of Barbey d’Aurevilly, On Dandyism and George Brummell (1845), which seeks to define the essence of dandyism through a study of his career and opinions. [...] In {{the course of his}} essay, Barbey d’Aurevilly deprecates English attempts to portray Brummell in fiction. [...] "Within Brummell's lifetime two well-known authors took up their pen – sharpened to exquisite points and dipped in musk-scented Chinese ink – to cast on blue-tinted paper with silver borders a few facile lines where one catches a glimpse of Brummell." [...] He was referring to two <b>liminal</b> examples of the fashionable or silver fork novel of which more than a thousand were to be written over the next two decades.|$|E
2500|$|It may {{otherwise}} have originated in a Celtic festival, held on 31 October–1 November, {{to mark the}} beginning of winter. It was Samhain in Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man, and Calan Gaeaf in Wales, Cornwall and Brittany. The festival is believed to have pre-Christian roots. In the 9th century, the Catholic Church made 1 November All Saints' Day. Among Celtic-speaking peoples, it was seen as a <b>liminal</b> time, when the spirits or fairies (the Aos Sí), and the souls of the dead, came into our world and were appeased with offerings of food and drink. Similar beliefs and customs were found in other parts of Europe. It is suggested that trick-or-treating evolved from a tradition whereby people impersonated the spirits, or the souls of the dead, and received offerings on their behalf. S. V. Peddle suggests they [...] "personify the old spirits of the winter, who demanded reward in exchange for good fortune". Impersonating these spirits or souls was also believed to protect oneself from them.|$|E
2500|$|Quirinus is a debated epithet. According to some scholars, mostly Francophone, {{it looks}} to be {{strictly}} related to {{the ideas of the}} passage of the Roman people from war back to peace, from the condition of miles, soldier, to that of quiris, citizen occupied in peaceful business, as the rites of the Porta Belli imply. This is in fact the usual sense of the word quirites in Latin. Other scholars, mainly Germanophone, think it is related on the contrary to the martial character of the god Quirinus, an interpretation supported by numerous ancient sources: Lydus, Cedrenus, Macrobius, Ovid, Plutarch and Paul the Daecon. Schilling and Capdeville counter that it is his function of presiding over the return to peace that gave Janus this epithet, as confirmed by his association on 30 March with Pax, Concordia [...] and Salus, even though it is true that Janus as god of all beginnings presides also over that of war and is thus often called belliger, bringer of war as well as pacificus. This use is also discussed by Dumézil in various works concerning the armed nature of the Mars qui praeest paci, the armed quality of the gods of the third function and the arms of the third function. C. Koch on the other hand sees the epithet Janus Quirinus as a reflection of the god's patronage over the two months beginning and ending the year, after their addition by king Numa in his reform of the calendar. This interpretation too would befit the <b>liminal</b> nature of Janus.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a dispute}} over the {{scenario}} of the play as it is cited at first by Theseus that [...] "four happy days bring in another moon." [...] The wood episode then takes place at a night of no moon, but Lysander asserts {{that there will be}} so much light in the very night they will escape that dew on the grass will be shining like liquid pearls. Also, in the next scene, Quince states that they will rehearse in moonlight, which creates a real confusion. It is possible that the Moon set during the night allowing Lysander to escape in the moonlight and for the actors to rehearse, then for the wood episode to occur without moonlight. Theseus's statement can also be interpreted to mean [...] "four days until the next month." [...] Another possibility is that, since each month there are roughly four consecutive nights that the moon is not seen due to its closeness to the sun in the sky (the two nights before the moment of new moon, followed by the two following it), it may in this fashion indicate a <b>liminal</b> [...] "dark of the moon" [...] period full of magical possibilities. This is further supported by Hippolyta's opening lines exclaiming [...] "And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities."; the thin crescent-shaped moon being the hallmark of the new moon's return to the skies each month. The play also intertwines the Midsummer Eve of the title with May Day, furthering the idea of a confusion of time and the seasons. This is evidenced by Theseus commenting on some slumbering youths, that they [...] "observe The rite of May." ...|$|E
2500|$|Samhain is {{believed}} to have Celtic pagan origins and there is evidence it has been an important date since ancient times. Some Neolithic passage tombs in Ireland are aligned with the sunrise around the time of Samhain. It is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and many important events in Irish mythology happen or begin on Samhain. It was the time when cattle were brought back down from the summer pastures and when livestock were slaughtered for the winter. As at Bealtaine, special bonfires were lit. These were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers and there were rituals involving them. Like Bealtaine, Samhain was seen as a <b>liminal</b> time, when the boundary between this world and the Otherworld could more easily be crossed. This meant the Aos Sí, the 'spirits' or 'fairies', could more easily come into our world. Most scholars see the Aos Sí as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits. At Samhain, it was believed that the Aos Sí needed to be propitiated to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter. Offerings of food and drink were left outside for them. The souls of the dead were also thought to revisit their homes seeking hospitality. Feasts were had, at which the souls of dead kin were beckoned to attend and a place set at the table for them. Mumming and guising were part of the festival, and involved people going door-to-door in costume (or in disguise), often reciting verses in exchange for food. The costumes may have been a way of imitating, and disguising oneself from, the Aos Sí. Divination rituals and games were also {{a big part of the}} festival and often involved nuts and apples. In the late 19th century, Sir John Rhys and Sir James Frazer suggested that it was the [...] "Celtic New Year", and this view has been repeated by some other scholars.|$|E
2500|$|As noted earlier, Samhain {{was seen}} as a <b>liminal</b> time, when the {{boundary}} between this world and the Otherworld could more easily be crossed. This meant the aos sí, the 'spirits' or 'fairies', could more easily come into our world. Many scholars see the aos sí as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits. At Samhain, it was believed that the aos sí needed to be propitiated to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter. As such, offerings of food and drink would be left outside for the aos sí. Portions of the crops might also be left in the ground for them. One custom—described a [...] "blatant example" [...] of a [...] "pagan rite surviving into the Christian epoch"—was observed in the Outer Hebrides until the early 19th century. On 31 October, the locals would go down to the shore. One man would wade into the water up to his waist, where he would pour out a cup of ale and ask 'Seonaidh' ('Shoney'), whom he called [...] "god of the sea", to bestow blessings on them. People also took special care not to offend the aos sí and sought to ward-off any who were out to cause mischief. They stayed near to home or, if forced to walk in the darkness, turned their clothing inside-out or carried iron or salt to keep them at bay. The dead were also honored at Samhain. The beginning of winter may have been seen as the most fitting time to do so, as {{it was a time of}} 'dying' in nature. The souls of the dead were thought to revisit their homes seeking hospitality. Places were set at the dinner table and by the fire to welcome them. The belief that the souls of the dead return home on one night of the year and must be appeased seems to have ancient origins and is found in many cultures throughout the world. James Frazer suggests [...] "It was perhaps a natural thought that the approach of winter should drive the poor, shivering, hungry ghosts from the bare fields and the leafless woodlands to the shelter of the cottage". However, the souls of thankful kin could return to bestow blessings just as easily as that of a wronged person could return to wreak revenge.|$|E
