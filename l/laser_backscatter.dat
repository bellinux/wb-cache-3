A number of chemical and physical factors influence the rheology of freshly mixed concrete, and the flocculation of cement particles is thought to cause thixotropy and shear thinning. This study proposes a rheometer coupled with a <b>laser</b> <b>backscattering</b> device, which allows us to simultaneously measure the viscosity and the size distribution of cement clusters in cement paste suspension. The <b>laser</b> <b>backscattering</b> instrument measures the cluster size distribution and monitors its growth or breakdown, while the parallel-plate rheometer measures its rheological properties.

40|$|We {{show that}} single Higgs {{production}} in γγ collisions through <b>laser</b> <b>backscattering</b> {{provides the best}} way to look for New Physics (NP) effects inducing anomalous Higgs couplings. Our analysis is based on the four dim = 6 operators OUB, OUW, OUB and OUW which describe New Physics effects in this sector. Using the Higgs production rate we establish observability limits for the couplings of the aforementioned operators at a level of 10 − 3, which means establishing lower bounds on the scale of NP of the order 30 to 200 TeV. Higgs branching ratios, especially the ratio Γ(H → γγ) /Γ(H → γZ), are shown to provide powerful ways to disentangle the effects of the various operators. 1 Future high energy linear e + e − colliders should allow the realization of γγ collisions with intense high energy photon beams through the <b>laser</b> <b>backscattering</b> method [1]. Provided the Higgs particle will be accessible at the future colliders, the γγ fusion into a single Higgs boson has been recognized as being a powerful tool to study the anomalous Higgs coupling...|$|R

The time-resolved backscatter measured at both 330 -m and 1291 -m altitudes showed little pulse broadening due to the submeter laser spot size.

40|$|Analysis {{and design}} of indirect-drive National Ignition Facility double-shell targets with hohlraum {{temperatures}} of 200 eV and 250 eV are presented. The analysis of these targets includes the assessment of two-dimensional radiation asymmetry and nonlinear mix. Two-dimensional integrated hohlraum simulations indicate that the x-ray illumination can be adjusted to provide adequate symmetry control in hohlraums specially designed to have high laser-coupling efficiency [Suter et al., Phys. Plasmas 7, 2092 (2000) ].

The absolute calibration of this backscatter in terms of an effective Lambertian reflectance is less precise, but the data support values near nadir of approximately 0. 20 for low wind speeds. It is noted that these values are 1 order of magnitude larger than the Fresnel reflectance for an air/water discontinuity in the refractive index. Whereas the normalized standard deviation (modulation factor) of backscatter is less well understood analytically, it is defined by these measurements to range from a few percent to over 50 percent at nadir and to increase off nadir as the tangent of theta or faster. The data are uncertain beyond 15 deg off nadir owing to a dynamic range limitation...|$|E

The case of an infinite density of such spots with an infinite density of wave-front sensor subapertures (each infinitely small) is analyzed assuming that performance is limited only {{by the fact that}} turbulence is distributed along the propagation path rather than being contained in a single plane. It is found that even in this case focus anisoplanatism limits performance. Relative to what can be achieved with a single AGS spot, it is found that at most approximately a factor-of- 2. 5 increase in the useful aperture diameter can be obtained by use of infinitely many AGS spots and that this increase is available only for a <b>laser</b> <b>backscatter</b> altitude as high as the 90 -km mesospheric sodium layer...|$|E

40|$|It is {{experimentally}} {{shown here}} for the first time that the normalized <b>laser</b> <b>backscatter</b> cross-section of the sea surface is a function of elevation or height position on teh ocean wave. All data were taken off-nadir, resulting in incidence angles of about 6. 5 deg measured relative to the normal to mean sea level (MSL). In the limited data sets analyzed to date, the normalized backscatter cross-section was found to be higher in wave crest regions and lower in wave troughs for a swell-dominated sea over which the wind speed was 5 m/s. The reverse was found to be the case for a sea that was driven by a 14 m/s wind. These isolated results show that the MSL, as measured by an off-nadir and/or multibeam type satellite laser altimeter, will be found above, at, or below the true MSL, depending on the local sea conditions existing in the footprint of the altimeter.

The HOE diffracts 532 nm <b>laser</b> <b>backscatter</b> making a 43 deg angle with a normal to its surface to a focus located 130 cm along the normal.

The spectral bandpass of our HOE is 50 nm (FWHM). Light within that bandpass is spectrally dispersed at 0. 6 nm/mm in the focal plane. An aperture stop reduces the bandpass of light reaching the detector from one direction to 1 nm while simultaneously reducing the field of view to 1 mrad.

40|$|River {{discharge}} {{and changes}} in lake, reservoir and wetland water storage are critical terms in the global surface water balance, yet they are poorly observed globally and the prospects for adequate observations from in-situ networks are poor (Alsdorf et al., 2003). The NASA-sponsored Surface Water Working Group has established a framework for advancing satellite observations of river discharge and water storage changes which focuses on obtaining measurements of water surface height (stage), slope, and extent. Satellite laser altimetry, which can achieve centimeter-level elevation precision for single, small laser footprints, provides a method to obtain these inland water parameters and contribute to global water balance monitoring. Since its launch in January, 2003 the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), a NASA Earth Observing System mission, has achieved over 540 million laser pulse observations of ice sheet, ocean surface, land topography, and inland water elevations and cloud and aerosol height distributions. By recording the <b>laser</b> <b>backscatter</b> from 80 m diameter footprints spaced 175 m along track, ICESat acquires globally-distributed elevation profiles, using a 1064 nm laser altimeter channel, and cloud and aerosol profiles, using a 532 nm atmospheric lidar channel. The ICESat mission has demonstrated the following laser altimeter capabilities relevant to observations of inland water: (1) elevation measurements with a precision of 2 to 3 cm for flat surfaces, suitable for detecting river surface slopes along long river reaches or between multiple crossings of a meandering river channel, (2) from the <b>laser</b> <b>backscatter</b> waveform, detection of water surface elevations beneath vegetation canopies, suitable for measuring water stage in flooded forests, (3) single pulse absolute elevation accuracy of about 50 cm (1 sigma) for 1 degree sloped surfaces, with calibration work in progress indicating that a final accuracy of about 12 cm (1 sigma) will be achieved for clear atmosphere conditions, suitable for detection of stage changes through time, (4) ability to precisely point the spacecraft so as to position the laser profile on the Earth the surface with a cross-track accuracy of 50 m (1 sigma), enabling small water bodies and specific locations to be targeted and re-observed through time, (5) adequate signal levels from specular water surfaces up to 5 degrees off-nadir, enabling complete global access to any location on the Earth's surface from the ICESat repeat orbit by off-nadir pointing, and (6) day and night operation with successful laser ranging to the Earth's surface through thin to moderate cloud cover, enabling more frequent measurements than {{can be achieved by}} passive optical sensors.
