40|$|Lackovic This paper {{presents}} {{research that}} applied a social semiotic framework {{to the analysis}} of images relating to national identity. The framework builds on Pierce’s sign triad and takes a multimodality approach. Data were collected from two sources: 1) a selection of images and <b>literature</b> <b>excerpts</b> from two Serbian language and literature textbooks (5 th grade, Primary School) and 2) the audience’s interpretation of the selected textbooks ’ images. The textbooks originated from explicitly different times of national history. Although language and multimodal characteristics are constituent of the analytical framework, this paper focuses on image analysis. The participants were 46 children from two different schools in Serbia’s provincial town of Loznica and 15 adults of Serbian origin. The strategy of ‘photo elicitation ’ was used for recording participants ' responses. The outcomes of the research revealed that images and multimodal representations in textbooks allow the construction of national identity in accordance with the state-proposed curriculum, its prevailing politics, philosophy and/or ideology. The multi-faceted analysis exemplified one possible way of image meaning-making analysis for future use. Furthermore, it encouraged the introduction of a social semiotic-based curriculum and clearly pointed to the educational and ethical benefits of reading visual materials...|$|E

40|$|Discussion in this {{dissertation}} {{is directed}} toward the lute, vihuela and guitar's notational systems and practices: chapters two, three, four, and five {{are concerned with the}} stylistic changes in the notations. The history of the tablatures is presented in a paralled fashion with that of the four-course and five-course guitars. An attempt is made to eliminate the guitarist's lack of knowledge about most practices and about subtle differences in performance. This is accomplished by presenting the development of these notations from the Renaissance to the present day. This study is concerned with the mastery and understanding of notation. After an introduction, the second chapter discusses three main tablatures for the lute and vihuela. It is important to confine oneself to the tablatures, in order that they be throughly understood. Thusthe third chapter deals with ornamentations, the fourth chapter with four-course, five course, six-course and six-string guitar notations, and the fifth chapter encompasses progressive notationfor the modern guitar. Systems for folk and commercial music are not addressed in this paper. The author hopes that with the use of this dissertation, tablatures can be handled with less difficulty and put into proper perspective. Careful thought has been given in selecting representative examples and notational <b>literature</b> <b>excerpts</b> as illustrations for the reader and/or performer. These examples need not only be studied but can be used as preparation for any other related composition.

40|$|Throughout Leopold Godowsky's {{teaching}} career he emphasized to students that the technic of piano playing is not {{synonymous with the}} mechanics of piano playing. ' Mechanics encompass specific problems such as 1) octaves, 2) pedalling, 3) articulation, 4) velocity, and 5) weight and relaxation. Technic involves not only the practical execution, but basic understanding {{in the application of}} such problemmatical areas. This study will deal with the mastery and understanding of five specific areas that form a basis for one's individual technical approach to performance. It is important pedagogically to confine oneself to a single problem while discussing such areas in order that each item be thoroughly understood. 2 For example, the first chapter involves preparation needed to encounter confidently octave passages found in the actual piano repertory. The second chapter deals with application of the damper pedal in selected piano excerpts, while the chapter on articulation is limited to the ambiguities of printed staccato markings. The final two chapters encompass progressive steps toward controlled velocity in passage work and a study of two terms, weight and relaxation. The author hopes that with use of this manual these items can be handled with less difficulty and put into proper perspective. Careful thought has been given by the writer in selecting representative exercises and piano <b>literature</b> <b>excerpts</b> as illustrations for the reader and/or performer.

40|$|Background: Publically-available {{databases}} {{were established}} {{with the purpose}} of making a large amount of patient information readily accessible to researchers and clinicians who would otherwise not be able to obtain it. Some of these databases number in the tens or even hundreds of thousands of datapoints, and are formatted in order to be easily analyzed using programs like R, SPSS and Excel. Through these methods, sub-analysis can be conducted on existing information, adding to the overall knowledge base, and providing new insights {{on a wide range of}} indications, from genetic conditions to many different forms of cancer. As a researcher, both academically and professionally, I have utilized both public and privately held databases. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Electronic medical records have in-depth, very individualized information, essential for high-quality manuscripts, rated at Level II in terms of evidence. However, these records are limited by the number of patients within a single practice or hospital system, and can be lacking in terms of specific information of interest to the investigator. These measures can include subjective outcomes, and specialty-specific scoring tools. Alternatively, I used the Chemical Effects on Biological Systems (CEBS) for a group research paper in a previous semester. Initially, after deciding our population of interest, our plan was to perform a statistical analysis on basic patient demographic data. These include the most straightforward information, including gender, age and ethnicity. We found to our surprise, that the database of nearly 86, 000 patient was severely lacking in this regard. Ultimately, only ethnicity was considered to be useable, as we were able to demonstrate that the locations that we chose tended to be culturally homogenous. I found this to be a considerable issue, especially given my professional experience will study protocol and manuscript preparation. While I’m fully aware of the requirements and regulations set in place by HIPPA (Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act), and the importance of protecting the confidentiality of sensitive patient information, the datapoints I was concerned with fell well outside the realm of these parameters. I chose this topic for my capstone as it coincides well with new challenges with clinical research information systems, and as well as future professional and scholarly projects. Purpose: The purpose of this project is to closely analyze the number and quality of manuscripts published from select publically-available databases. Methods: Using the following databases (Chemical Effects in Biological Systems (CEBS), National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness (NDCT), Clinicaltrials. gov and The National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCRD). I selected a random sample of 20 publications which used data from these publically-available databases for four specialties (this was reduced to three groups due to a low response rate). Experienced raters were selected and given abstracts and <b>literature</b> <b>excerpts</b> at two intervals in February and March of 2016. A total of 20 sets were given to each subject. In all cases, sets were randomized to avoid bias. Results: Using SPSS (v 20), a Cohen’s Kappa coefficient analysis was conducted to test interrater reliability. Cardiovascular (clinical research) subset consisted of poor reliability in terms of my testing parameters. K values for rounds 1 and 2 were 0. 274 and 0. 178. Sociobehavioral (K = 0. 379 and 0. 437) and basic research (K = 0. 555 and 0. 531) fared somewhat better, with fair to good reliability results. However, the questionnaire system needs to be modified to make the comparisons that I hoped to make. Conclusion: I learned quite a bit more about the complexities of publishing from publically-available data. Many of the studies I used in my examples laid the groundwork for more important prospective work. It is difficult to create a scale to cover this many broad topics. I hope to modify the scales, and retest in a larger population over a longer period of time to help address the shortfalls of this preliminary project...|$|E
40|$|This article examines, {{through a}} {{synthesis}} of the <b>literature</b> and <b>excerpts</b> from a qualitative case study, the concept of exit strategy, specifically its relation to vulnerable populations (e. g., overweight adolescent boys) and potential impact on the researcher-participant relationship.

40|$|The {{concept of}} belongingness has {{intuitive}} appeal. Human beings are social creatures; {{the need to}} belong and be accepted is fundamental, and social exclusion can be devastating. This paper reports on the selected findings from the qualitative phase of mixed-methods study that explored nursing students’ experience of belongingness while on clinical placements. The 18 interview {{participants in this study}} were from Australia and the United Kingdom. They provided a range of perspectives on belongingness and how it influenced their placement experience. Central to this discussion was their strong belief that belonging is a prerequisite for clinical learning. This theme dominated all of the interviews. Given that the primary purpose of clinical placements is for students to learn to nurse, there needs to be a clear understanding of the relationship between belongingness and learning. With reference to the published <b>literature</b> and <b>excerpts</b> from interview transcripts, this paper proposes that reconceptualising nursing students’ clinical learning experiences through a ‘lens of belongingness’ provides a new perspective and reveals yet unexplored insight...|$|R

That is also true of me; so five of the first seven scholars in the Acquired Wisdom series were poor students. I did not explicitly mention my studying difficulties in this chapter because they had already been described in my memoir about how my family found safe haven from the Holocaust in Shanghai, China, during World War II (Tobias, 2009). It may be useful to examine my difficulties and how they relate to educational practice and concepts in the contemporary educational psychology <b>literature.</b> Essay <b>Excerpt</b> The late Dick Snow, a friend and colleague at Stanford, once commented that research on instructional innovations seemed to him like a random walk through the panacea garden. I have become sceptical of any instructional development, theory, or instructional method that is expected to improve learning for all students in all subjects. I have lived through prior panaceas like programmed and computer assisted instruction, multimedia education, computer games, and educational movements such as progressive, competency based, open corridor, and inquiry education, and the current panacea - constructivist instruction - from all of which I learned something. There are no panaceas that will easily improve learning for everyone, because good instruction is hard work and difficult to do.  [Download the PDF...|$|R
