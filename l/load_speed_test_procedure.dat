One {{of the purposes of}} the CRADA is to improve the numerical stability of the model without changing the fundamental characteristics of the EXTRAN solution or sacrificing the efficiency of its performance.

This chapter presents the computational speed comparison between SWMM 4 (Huber & Dickinson, 1988) and SWMM 5 (Rossman et al., 2003).

Hence, the present work aims to explore {{the possibility of using}} this natural fibre to reinforce polyester and thus opens a new way to implement locally available inexpensive fibres and produce a new candidate tribo-material for bearing applications. Sugarcane fibre/polyester (SCRP) and glass fibre/polyester (GRP) composites (with chopped fibres of 1, 5, 10 mm length randomly distributed and unidirectional mat fibres) were prepared using compression mould and hand-lay-up techniques. Friction coefficients and wear rates of SCRP and GRP composites were determined under dry sliding contact conditions in parallel and anti-parallel orientations and subjected to different operating parameters such as <b>load,</b> <b>speed</b> and <b>test</b> duration. Results of friction and wear proved that SCRP composite is a promising composite which can be a competitive to GRP composite. In the case of chopped sugarcane/polyester (C-SCRP) composite, very smooth patches of polymer film (protective layer) due to plastic deformation shielded the surface of C-SCRP composite pin from damage by the metallic asperities and thereby contributed to the higher wear resistance. Furthermore, this layer provided enhancement to the bonding of SCFs fibre with matrix. In contrast C-GRP composite produced broken hard particles of GF at the interface which acted as a third body and restrained the formation of such protective layer.

This thesis explores the feasibility of incorporating spherical fluid bearing elements in the UFF process as a replacement for roller bearings. Self-acting (or wedge film) and externally pressurized hydrostatic spherical fluid-film bearings were investigated for the UFF process. The self-acting bearing was modeled and analyzed using a previously developed hydrodynamic finite element computer program. The hydrostatic bearing was modeled using an analytical formulation of the Reynolds equation coupled with empirical data to account for entrance flow effects at the feed hole and to account for pressure drops in the bearing fluid supply system. Both bearing configurations predicted adequate fluid film thickness under steady <b>load</b> and <b>speed.</b> Performance <b>tests</b> on the UFF were completed with both bearing configurations under steady <b>load</b> and <b>speed.</b> Ball to cup seizure was observed with the self-acting configuration nearly immediately after initial <b>load</b> and <b>speed</b> application, with seizure presumably due to inadequate squeeze film resistance during the transient startup period.

Unidirectional sliding experiments were carried out on a pin-on~disc wear machine where frictional force, wear rate, temperature and contact resistance were continuously monitored during each test. Physical methods of analysis (x-ray, scanning electron microscopy etc.) were used to examine the wear debris and worn samples. The wear rate versus load curves revealed mild wear transitions, which under long duration of running, categorized mild wear into four distinct regions. α-Fe 20 s. Fe 304, FeO and an oxide mixture were the predominant oxides in four regions of oxidational wear which were identified above the Welsh T 2 transition. The wear curves were strongly effected by the <b>speed</b> and <b>test</b> duration. A surface model was used to calculate the surface parameters, and the results were found to be comparable with the experimentally observed parameters. Oxidation was responsible for the transition from severe to mild wear at a load corresponding to the Welsh T 2 transition. In the running-in period sufficient energy input and surface hardness enabled oxide growth rate to increase and eventually exceeded the rate of removal, where mild wear ensued. A model was developed to predict the wear volume up to the transition. Remarkable agreement was found between the theoretical prediction and the experimentally-measured values.
