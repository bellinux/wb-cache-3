However, the spatial and temporal variability of crack orientations across different <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gilgai features is not well-documented and addressed in hydrology models. Thus; {{there is a need}} to quantify crack orientations for different <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> to incorporate their spatial and temporal dynamics into hydrological models. Our objectives were to document the spatial variability of cracks orientations across two <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> to demonstrate the potential importance of crack orientation related to the hydrology of Vertisols. The exploratory field measurements of the spatial distribution of crack orientations across two Vertisol catenae of two <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gilgai features are presented.

40|$|Due to the focused {{pursuit of}} {{economic}} growth in the process of the large-scale urban development of China, the phenomena of low <b>land</b> <b>use</b> efficiency <b>and</b> discordance of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> induce unwanted economic, social, and environmental costs.

The findings of this study suggest a gradually increasing proportion of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> efficiency from eastern to central and western regions of China, coinciding with China’s pattern of socioeconomic development. No correlation was found between high levels of urban <b>land</b> <b>use</b> efficiency <b>and</b> the degree of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> coordination; however, a significant correlation was found between low <b>land</b> <b>use</b> efficiency <b>and</b> low degrees of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> coordination.

40|$|Urban {{planning}} theories {{state that}} changes in <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> affect the provision of road infrastructure and vice versa. Invariably, this interaction between <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> road infrastructure, represented by road density, is a dynamic one. Many studies abroad have attempted to quantify this dynamic interaction. Using a two-steps approach, an empirical model that describes the interaction between <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> road density has been developed for selected West Malaysian cities. The two steps require that, first, a regression model is developed that functionally linked road density <b>and</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> <b>and</b> second, simulating <b>land</b> <b>use</b> developments to predict changes in road density. In this paper, the evidence for the interaction is shown for two West Malaysian Cities â€“ Johor Bahru and Kuantan. The calibration of the interaction models for these two cities shows promising result. The main advantage of such interaction models is that the model provides transport planners a planning (and, budgeting) tool to plan for future provision of road infrastructure...|$|R
