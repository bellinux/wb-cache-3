5|$|As the British {{government}} has no <b>legal</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> it requires the local residents to form a representative committee according {{to the laws of}} the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them.

He forms the governing body which includes the local policeman, Spiller, and the manager of the bank branch, Mr. Wix; the neighbourhood shop keeper, Arthur Pemberton, is appointed as Burgundy's Prime Minister. The council begin discussions with the government, particularly about the Burgundian treasure.|$|E
