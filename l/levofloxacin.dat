5|$|An {{increasing}} number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a bismuth colloid, such as bismuth subsalicylate. For the treatment of clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori, the use of <b>levofloxacin</b> {{as part of the}} therapy has been suggested.|$|E
25|$|When <b>levofloxacin</b> {{is taken}} with anti-acids {{containing}} magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide, the two combine to form insoluble salts {{that are difficult}} to absorb from the intestines. Peak serum concentrations of <b>levofloxacin</b> may be reduced by 90% or more, which can prevent the <b>levofloxacin</b> from working. Similar results have been reported when <b>levofloxacin</b> is taken with iron supplements and multi-vitamins containing zinc.|$|E
25|$|Package inserts {{mention that}} <b>levofloxacin</b> {{is to be}} avoided in {{patients}} with a known hypersensitivity to <b>levofloxacin</b> or other quinolone drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> is the levo isomer of the {{racemate}} ofloxacin, another quinolone antimicrobial agent. <b>Levofloxacin,</b> a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is {{the pure}} (−)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic ofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} if <b>levofloxacin</b> is {{released}} in mother's milk, but other fluoroquinolones are. Due to potential risks to the baby, <b>levofloxacin</b> is not recommended in nursing mothers.|$|E
25|$|In a study {{comparing}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of <b>levofloxacin</b> to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with <b>levofloxacin</b> and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these adverse events {{were thought to be}} unrelated or doubtfully related to the <b>levofloxacin.</b> Two deaths were observed in the <b>levofloxacin</b> group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System {{at the time of the}} 20 September 2011 FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee include musculoskeletal events (39, including 5 cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including 5 cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for <b>levofloxacin</b> were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> is {{also used}} as {{antibiotic}} eye drops to prevent bacterial infection. Usage of <b>levofloxacin</b> eye drops, along with an antibiotic injection of cefuroxime or penicillin during cataract surgery, {{has been found to}} lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or injections alone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> may {{prolong the}} QT {{interval}} in some people, especially older ones, and <b>levofloxacin</b> {{should not be}} used for people with a family history of Long QT syndrome, or who have long QT, chronic low potassium, it should not be prescribed with other drugs that prolong the QT interval.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> is {{available}} in tablet form, injection, and oral solution.|$|E
25|$|Unlike ciprofloxacin, <b>levofloxacin</b> {{does not}} appear to {{deactivate}} the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with <b>levofloxacin.</b> It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in more action of drugs like warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> {{had reached}} {{blockbuster}} status by this time; worldwide sales for J alone were US$1.6 billion in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In the United States <b>levofloxacin</b> is {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of anthrax and plague in children over six months of age.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} is rarely used. Frequently prescribed drugs are Avelox (moxifloxacin), Cipro (ciprofloxacin), Levaquin (<b>levofloxacin),</b> and, to some extent, their generic equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Ofloxacin is a racemic mixture, which {{consists}} of 50% <b>levofloxacin</b> (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or enantiomer dextrofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|The FDA {{estimated}} that in 2011 over 23 million outpatient prescriptions for fluoroquinolones, of which <b>levofloxacin</b> made up 28%, were {{filled in the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|Like all fluoroquinolines, <b>levofloxacin</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with epilepsy or other seizure disorders, and in patients who {{have a history of}} quinolone-associated tendon rupture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} that {{is active}} against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all quinolones, it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV {{is necessary to}} separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for supercoiling the DNA, {{so that it will}} fit in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. <b>Levofloxacin</b> acts as a bactericide.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, fluoroquinolones are {{approved}} {{for use in}} children only under narrowly-defined circumstances, owing {{in part to the}} observation of high rates of musculoskeletal adverse events in fluoroquinolone treated juvenile animals. In the UK, the prescribing indications for fluoroquinolones for children are severely restricted. Only inhalant anthrax and pseudomonal infections in cystic fibrosis infections are licensed indications in the UK due to ongoing safety concerns. In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of <b>levofloxacin</b> to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, serious adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with <b>levofloxacin</b> and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these were considered by the treating physician to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the study drug. Two deaths were observed in the <b>levofloxacin</b> group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the U.S. FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System {{at the time of the}} 20 September 2011 U.S. FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee included musculoskeletal events (39, including 5 cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including 5 cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for <b>levofloxacin</b> were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{disagreement}} in {{the medical}} literature regarding whether {{and to what extent}} <b>levofloxacin</b> and other fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse effects more frequently than other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} {{is used as}} the hemihydrate, which has the empirical formula C18H20FN3O4 · ½ H2O and a molecular mass of 370.38g/mol. <b>Levofloxacin</b> is a light-yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of an acute overdosage, {{authorities}} recommend unspecific standard procedures such as emptying the stomach, observing the patient and maintaining appropriate hydration. <b>Levofloxacin</b> is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> is used {{to treat}} infections including: {{respiratory}} tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, endocarditis, meningitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, traveler's diarrhea, tuberculosis, and plague and is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones have varying {{specificity}} for cytochrome P450, and so {{may have}} interactions with drugs cleared by those enzymes; the order from most P450-inhibitory to least, is enoxacin > ciprofloxacin > norfloxacin > ofloxacin, <b>levofloxacin,</b> trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. Serious side effects may include tendon rupture, tendon inflammation, seizures, psychosis, and {{potentially}} permanent peripheral nerve damage. Tendon damage may appear months after treatment is completed. People may also sunburn more easily. In people with myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness and breathing problems may worsen. While use during pregnancy {{is not recommended}} risk appears to be low. The use of other medications in the class appear okay in breastfeeding; however, the safety of <b>levofloxacin</b> is unclear. <b>Levofloxacin</b> is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class. It usually results in death of the bacteria. It is the left sided isomer of the medication ofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> is not {{approved}} {{in most countries}} {{for the treatment of}} children except in unique and life-threatening infections because it is associated with an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injury in this population, a property it shares with other fluoroquinolones.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> is {{recommended}} by the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first-line treatment for pediatric pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and as a second-line agent {{for the treatment of}} penicillin-sensitive cases.|$|E
25|$|Administration of <b>levofloxacin</b> {{or other}} broad {{spectrum}} antibiotics {{is associated with}} Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea which may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Fluoroquinoline administration {{may be associated with}} the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain.|$|E
25|$|Hospitalized {{patients}} {{without risk}} for pseudomonas: This group requires intravenous antibiotics, with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as <b>levofloxacin),</b> a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam or high-dose ampicillin plus a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin) for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|A {{standardized}} {{management plane}} of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (quinolones: i.e., ciprofloxacin, <b>levofloxacin,</b> a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., cefepime, ceftazidime, or an aminoglycoside: i.e. gentamicin, amikacin).|$|E
25|$|FQs {{prolong the}} QT {{interval}} by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval {{can lead to}} torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice this appears relatively uncommon {{in part because the}} most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and <b>levofloxacin)</b> only minimally prolong the QT interval.|$|E
25|$|Daiichi and J also cannibalized its own {{market by}} {{introducing}} <b>levofloxacin,</b> the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin, in 1996; Johnson and Johnson's {{annual sales of}} Floxin in 2003 was approximately $30 million, whereas their combined sales of Levaquin/Floxin exceeded $1.15 billion in the same year. Johnson & Johnson withdrew the marketing application in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Therapy {{for older}} {{children}} and adults generally includes treatment for atypical bacteria: typically a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin) or a quinolone, such as <b>levofloxacin.</b> Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice in the UK for atypical bacteria, due to increased clostridium difficile colitis in hospital patients linked to {{the increased use of}} clarithromycin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin,</b> {{sold under}} the trade names Levaquin among others, is an antibiotic. It {{is used to}} treat a number of {{bacterial}} infections including acute bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, chronic prostatitis, and some types of gastroenteritis. Along with other antibiotics it {{may be used to}} treat tuberculosis, meningitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.|$|E
25|$|Intensive-care {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as <b>levofloxacin.</b> Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or tobramycin, plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|Outpatients with {{underlying}} {{illness or}} risk factors: Although this group {{does not require}} hospitalization, patients have underlying health problems (such as emphysema or heart failure) or {{are at risk for}} DRSP or enteric gram-negative bacteria. They are treated with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as <b>levofloxacin)</b> or a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levofloxacin</b> {{and other}} fluoroquinolones {{have also been}} widely used for the {{treatment}} of uncomplicated community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections, indications for which major medical societies generally recommend the use of older, narrower spectrum drugs to avoid fluoroquinolone resistance development. Due to its widespread use, common pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have developed resistance. In many countries as of 2013, resistance rates among healthcare-associated infections with these pathogens exceeded 20%.|$|E
