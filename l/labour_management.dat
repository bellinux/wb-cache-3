25|$|Pittoni {{was elected}} {{municipal}} councillor of Trieste in 1909, and promoted <b>labour</b> <b>management</b> initiatives. Chief {{editor of the}} party organ, Il Lavoratore, and {{a key figure in}} the Social Studies Circle, Pittoni also founded the Workers Cooperative of Trieste, Istria and Friulia. His participation in such causes increased the cultural and educational prestige of socialism, solving many of the movement's teething problems, and helping to spread the cooperative ideals among the Slovene population. He conditioned affiliation to these cooperatives on the desegregation and inter-ethnic solidarity of candidate unions. He also campaigned for the establishment of Workers Club and an Italian university in Trieste.|$|E
25|$|Various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} improve environmental conditions and to safeguard the environment, the Federal Emission Control Law established the basis for taking of legal action against those responsible for excessive noise and air pollution, the Works’ Constitution Act and Personnel Representation Act strengthened the position of individual employees in offices and factories, and the Works’ Safety Law required firms to employ safety specialists and doctors. An amendment to the <b>Labour</b> <b>Management</b> Act (1971) granted workers co-determination {{on the shop floor}} while the new Factory Management Law (1972) extended co-determination at the factory level. This Act acknowledged {{for the first time the}} presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils. A law was passed in 1974 allowing for worker representation on the boards of large firms, although this change was not enacted until 1976, after alterations were made. In 1974, redundancy allowances in cases of bankruptcies were introduced. The Federal Law on Personnel Representation, which came into force in April 1974, gave increased co-management rights to those employed in factories and offices in the public sector. The staff councils were given an increased say in social and personal matters, together with a wider operational basis for their activities in connection with day release and training opportunities. The arrangements governing cooperation between the staff councils and the trade union were also improved. Young workers were given increased rights of representation, while foreign workers received voting rights and thus achieved equality in this respect with German employees.|$|E
500|$|Considered {{a radical}} troublemaker by the GLC's <b>Labour</b> <b>management,</b> Livingstone was {{allocated}} the relatively unimportant position of Vice Chairman of the Film Viewing Board, monitoring {{the release of}} soft pornography. Like most Board members, Livingstone opposed cinematic censorship, a view he changed with the increasing availability of violent pornography. With growing support from Labour leftists, in March 1974 he was elected onto the executive of the Greater London Labour Party (GLLP), responsible for drawing up the manifesto for the GLC Labour group and the lists of candidates for council and parliamentary seats. Turning his attention once more to housing, he became Vice Chairman of the GLC's Housing Management Committee, however was sacked in April 1975 for his vocal opposition to the Goodwin administration's decision to cut £50,000,000 from the GLC's house-building budget. Coming up to the 1977 GLC elections, Livingstone recognised the difficulty of retaining his Norwood seat, instead being selected for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, a Labour safe seat, following the retirement of David Pitt. Accused of being a [...] "carpetbagger", it ensured {{he was one of}} the few leftist Labour councillors to remain on the GLC, which fell into Conservative hands under Horace Cutler.|$|E

40|$|This article {{draws from}} the fields of {{political}} science and of organisational studies to explore the short-term and longterm impact of New <b>Labour’s</b> party <b>management</b> {{on the quality of}} party processes as well as on party reputation.

The article starts by identifying the distinctive features of New <b>Labour’s</b> party <b>management.</b> It then examines the “unintended consequences” of this brand of party management, showing this model to be mainly self-defeating. The final section provides a general assessment of the impact of New <b>Labour’s</b> party <b>management</b> from the perspective of organisational learning and innovation. Overall the article stresses the long-term poisonous effects of this brand of leadership and management on political organisations and on politics in general. (author's abstract...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{industrial}} relations management {{has been a}} long-neglected aspect of the Australian scene. Recent changes {{in the balance of}} power on the shop floor in the aftermath of prolonged recession in the metal and engineering industry, however, make such neglect an expensive luxury. This article looks at four aspects of management t strategy: the <b>labour</b> relations <b>management</b> function, relations with the unions at the workplace, attitudes to employee involvement, and attitudes to the employment relationship. The suggestion, in the light of secondary evidence and a series of fourteen case studies in the Victorian and New South Wales metal industry, is that three variables are important in helping to explain the direction that <b>labour</b> relations <b>management</b> has taken in recent years. These are the ’labour threat: the reorganization of production methods, and changes to the legal and institutional framework. It was found that management in those plants in which exposure to these three environmental pressures was similar responded with fairly similar <b>labour</b> relations <b>management</b> practices, suggesting that there may indeed be a link between the key variables. As is the case overseas, industrial relations research in Australia has onl...|$|R

40|$|The work {{is about}} {{improving}} the working {{relationship between the}} management which represents the employer and the workers that represent the employees in the local government service system. The main objective {{of the work is}} how to address the high level of suspicion on the organization which had characterized the relationship between the <b>labour</b> (workers) and <b>management</b> in the local government service at present in Nigeria. This has been responsible for low output performance at this third tier level of government in Nigeria. The study adopted a theoretical framework of analysis which helped, in explaining the causes of the constant struggle, mutual suspicion, antagonism and hatred which had existed between <b>labour</b> and <b>management</b> in organizations, especially as it applied to the local government service in Nigeria today. The theoretical framework adopted was the scientific management theory as propounded by Frederick Taylor in 1911. This theory apart from explaining the basis of conflict between <b>labour</b> and <b>management</b> in organization; also proffered some possible solutions on how such conflicts can be amicably and mutually resolved to the benefit of both parties. The major findings of the work showed there are so much antagonism and inefficiency within the local government service in Nigeria today. This had been attributed to the fact that <b>labour</b> and <b>management</b> are permanent enemies, and both struggle to undermine each other’s efforts. The solution to the problem as identified in the work lies in the promotion of good employer-employee relationship in the local government service through th...|$|R
