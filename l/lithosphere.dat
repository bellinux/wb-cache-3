5|$|The <b>lithosphere,</b> which rides {{atop the}} asthenosphere, {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic <b>lithosphere.</b> Consumption or destruction of the oceanic <b>lithosphere</b> occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as subduction. Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic <b>lithosphere</b> has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older oceanic <b>lithosphere,</b> so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E

It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E
40|$|Seismic and {{rheological}} {{properties of the}} upper mantle {{in the vicinity of}} the low-velocity zone are expressed in terms of relaxation by dislocation glide. Dislocation bowing in the glide plane explains seismic velocities and attenuation. Climbing at higher stresses for longer periods of time give the observed viscosity, and explain the low velocity and high temperature attenuation found at seismic frequencies. Due to differing parameters, separate terms for thermal, seismic and rheological <b>lithospheres</b> are proposed. All three <b>lithospheres,</b> however, are related and are functions of temperature, and must be specified by parameters such as period, stress, and stress duration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrogenic belts {{involving}} initially hot <b>lithospheres,</b> {{as exemplified}} by accretionary-type orogens, commonly show distributed deformation and retrograde PT paths with a concomitant decrease in pressure and temperature. Paths may track geotherms, indicating thermal equilibrium, consistent with slow strain and exhumation rates, limited strain localization, and consequently limited topographical gradients and distributed erosion. Such patterns are more common in Precambrian times than in younger periods of the Earth history. In contrast, orogens involving initially stiff <b>lithospheres</b> show exhumation PT paths that track isothermal decompression reflecting high strain rates along major shear zones, a feature typical of Phanerozoic collision belts. Field evidence, analogue and numerical models emphasize that strain localization has first-order consequences for the tectonic evolution of orogenic zones including structure, metamorphism, exhumation processes, topography, erosion and sedimentation modes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} the exhumation history of Palaeoproterozoic high-grade units from the Lapland Granulite Belt (northern Finland) through a reappraisal of previous structural and metamorphic data {{and a new}} structural analysis. The Lapland Granulite Belt is located between two cratons (Inari Craton and South Lapland Craton). It {{is marked by a}} major thrusting event associated with the development of an inverse metamorphic gradient within the underlying Tanaelv and Karasjok Belts. The review of published metamorphic data combined with our new structural analysis suggests that the exhumation history of the Lapland Granulite Belt was accommodated by the development of coeval basal thrusting and early normal-sense shear-zones, and later by distributed erosion. We propose also that the early exhumation stages of the Lapland granulite unit were associated with heating of both the overlying Inari Craton and the underlying South Lapland Craton. The occurrence of coeval thrusts and normal-sense shear-zones combined with the important role of distributed erosion during the final exhumation stages suggest that this Palaeoproterozoic collisional belt may represent an intermediate stage between ultra-hot accretionary orogens involving weak <b>lithospheres</b> and modern orogens involving stiff <b>lithospheres</b> (mixed-hot orogen of Chardon et al., 2009). Our analysis emphasizes that the transition between ancient-type orogens and modern-type ones was gradual in space and time, being firstly dependent on the thermal and rheological state of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle of the <b>lithospheres</b> involved in compression...|$|R
5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and icy <b>lithosphere</b> that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be as thick as 250300km. Failing an ocean, the icy <b>lithosphere</b> may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{extensive}} volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, {{and are not}} produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form {{as the result of}} compressive stresses on the base of the <b>lithosphere,</b> which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through thrust faulting. The compressive stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial of volcanic materials. The global distribution of mountains appears to be opposite that of volcanic structures; mountains dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io's <b>lithosphere</b> where compression (supportive of mountain formation) and extension (supportive of patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, mountains and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.|$|E
5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice <b>lithosphere</b> necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the <b>lithosphere,</b> leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the <b>lithosphere.</b> Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E

40|$|A Lagrangian {{computer}} program {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} large impacts on planetary surfaces. More specifically, the global seismic effects for cratering energies of 10 to the 24 th and 10 to the 25 th J between the Copernicus and Imbrium lunar events are investigated. The phenomenologies for assumed solid and molten planetary interiors are compared. The main results of this investigation are: (1) far-field effects are found to be largely independent of cratering mechanisms, (2) antipodal seismic effects, which are of substantial magnitude, are greatly enhanced by focusing, (3) the most violent activity takes place at significant depth, (4) seismic effects are more pronounced for a molten planet than for a solid one, and (5) tensile failure may occur at depths of tens of kilometers beneath the antipode, or over the entire surface at shallower depths. These results suggest that the unusual terrains antipodal to large planetary basins may have been greatly modified by seismicity generated by the basin-forming impacts, and that the impacts may have brecciated the entire <b>lithospheres</b> of the terrestrial planets as the <b>lithospheres</b> formed and thickene...|$|R
5|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively-cycled carbon {{in the world}} and are second only to the <b>lithosphere</b> in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere.

Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the <b>lithosphere.</b> The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E
5|$|Bathymetry is {{the mapping}} and {{study of the}} {{topography}} of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring {{the depth of the}} sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, and a hard rigid outer shell (or <b>lithosphere),</b> which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called oceanic. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin <b>lithosphere</b> floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes. Heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. Near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.|$|E
40|$|Radially {{fractured}} domes are large, tectonic and topographic features {{discovered on}} the surface of Venus by the Magellan spacecraft. They are thought to be due to uplift over mantle diapirism, and to date are known to occur only on Venus. Since Venus and the Earth are grossly similar in size, composition and structure, we seek to understand why these features have not been seen on the Earth. We model the uplift and fracturing over a mantle diapir as functions of lithospheric thickness and diapir size and depth. We find that <b>lithospheres</b> of the same thickness on the Earth and Venus should respond similarly to the same sized diapir, and that radially fractured domes should form most readily in thin oceanic <b>lithospheres</b> on Earth if diapiric activity is similar on the two planets. However, our current knowledge of the Earth's oceanic floors is insufficient to confirm or deny the presence of radially fractured domes. We compute the expected dimensions for these features on the Earth and suggest a search for them to determine whether mantle diapirism operates similarly on the Earth and Venus...|$|R

5|$|Earth's <b>lithosphere</b> {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many {{millions}} of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water {{that contribute to the}} hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the eruption, {{scientists}} {{established a}} grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change {{in the shape of the}} island. In the 20years following {{the end of the}} eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the <b>lithosphere</b> due to the weight of the volcano.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower <b>lithosphere.</b> However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral compressional contexts, such {{as those}} {{involving}} juvenile or thickened crust, {{are expected to be}} associated with rather hot <b>lithospheres</b> whose mechanical behaviour remains poorly documented. In this paper, we present a series of analogue models dedicated to compression of <b>lithospheres</b> characterized by a thin upper brittle crust overlying a weak ductile crust and a ductile sub-Moho mantle. The models show that (1) deformation is controlled by the ductile layers that undergo distributed thickening, (2) thrust systems are limited to the upper brittle crust, (3) thrusting induces burial and stacking of upper crust pop-downs. The overall deformation patterns can be basically interpreted in terms of pop-down thrusting of the brittle crust and pure-shear type ductile flow of crust and mantle. Moreover, the models show that the sinking of supracrustal units does not require inverse density profiles but can be simply driven by compression. Model deformation patterns are consistent with those shared by many ancient belts, including not only Archaean granite–greenstone belts, but also more generally Paleoproterozoic ones. They provide also insights on deformation modes that may characterize modern thickened and abnormally hot domains like High Plateaus...|$|R

5|$|The {{most stable}} {{chlorine}} radioisotope is 36Cl. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 35Cl is electron capture to isotopes of sulfur; that of isotopes heavier than 37Cl is beta decay to isotopes of argon; and 36Cl may decay by either mode to stable 36S or 36Ar. 36Cl occurs in trace quantities in {{nature as a}} cosmogenic nuclide in a ratio of about (7–10)×10−13 to 1 with stable chlorine isotopes: it is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of 36Ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons. In the top meter of the <b>lithosphere,</b> 36Cl is generated primarily by thermal neutron activation of 35Cl and spallation of 39K and 40Ca.

The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and {{is used in the}} manufacture of white pigments.

5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky <b>lithosphere.</b> The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E
5|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has {{its origins}} in {{continental}} rifting—a long rupture in the Earth's crust where the <b>lithosphere</b> is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed {{as a result of}} the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions. The rift zone has existed for at least 14.9million years, and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having erupted in the last few hundred years. Tseax Cone, which last erupted in the 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.|$|E
5|$|More {{recent studies}} by volcanologists {{associated}} with the Geological Survey of Canada have indicated that the subducted extension of the Nookta Fault may be {{the primary cause of}} the alkalic structure of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The volcanism might have been mostly generated by asthenospheric upwelling possibly by displacement along the transform fault. If the transform fault had a section of vertical tearing to contain potentially different dip angles between the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates, the subducted plate asthenosphere may possibly flow upward into the mantle wedge. Similarly, if the displacement had a section of extension, a horizontal slab window-like gap would have developed, again allowing a pathway for upwelling magma. In either case, the unsettled asthenosphere might have experienced low degrees of decompressional melting and interacted with North American <b>lithosphere</b> to yield within plate compositions.|$|E
40|$|Solid state creep being {{exponentially}} {{dependent on}} temperature must dominate the mechanical {{behavior of the}} mantles of terrestrial planets beneath their <b>lithospheres.</b> General arguments suggest that the <b>lithospheres</b> of the Moon and Mars are about 200 km thick; the Earth, Venus and Mercury much less. Short wavelength gravity anomalies are explained by the finite strength of the lithosphere: the lunar mascons being an example. The good correlation of the Venus and Mars gravity anomalies with topography up to spherical harmonics of degrees 10 - 15 is in striking contrast {{to the lack of}} correlation between the long wavelength components of the geoid and the continent-ocean distribution or even the plates. Attempts have been made to explain the former correlations by isostatic models but the depths of compensation seem implausible. Low degree harmonics of the gravity fields of the terrestrial planets as is certainly the case in the Earth must arise from the density variations driving solid state convection. In the case of Venus the less dense differentiated materials of the highlands seems to be positioned over the singular points of the convection pattern. Thus the correlated gravity field does not arise from the highlands but from the density difference in the convecting interior. In the Earth lack of correlation seems to arise {{from the fact that the}} plates have moved relative to the convection pattern the last 100 M yr...|$|R

It is demonstrated that this strength is everywhere greater than that required to initiate frictional sliding on pre-existing fractures and faults. Because the tensile strength of intact ice increases markedly with confining pressure, it actually exceeds the frictional strength at all depths. Thus, icy <b>lithospheres</b> will fail by frictional slip along pre-existing fractures at yeild stresses greater than previously assumed rather than opening tensile cracks in intact ice...|$|R
30|$|At this stage, it is {{important}} to note the difference between spontaneous and forced subduction initiation in a geodynamic context that bears magmatic sources in mind. Indeed, most petrologists (Stern and Bloomer 1992; Shervais and Choi 2011; Stern et al. 2012; Ishizuka et al. 2014) consider that the asthenospheric mantle invades the gap between “sinking old” and “young buoyant” <b>lithospheres,</b> inducing during fore-arc spreading (FABs and boninites), but since spontaneous subduction is unlikely and “compression is the rule” (Hall et al. 2003), there is no available space for the mantle to reach the fore-arc region. Consequently, the first lavas erupted at a significant distance from the incipient trench.|$|R
