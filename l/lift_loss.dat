5000|$|In {{the case}} of the Su-27, the pilot {{initially}} disengages the angle of attack limiter of the plane, normally set at 26°. [...] This action also disengages the g limiter. After that the pilot pulls back on the stick hard. The aircraft reaches 90-120° angle of attack with a slight gain of altitude and a significant loss of speed. When the elevator is centered, the drag {{at the rear of the}} plane causes torque, thus making the aircraft pitch forward. At that time the pilot adds power to compensate for the <b>lift</b> <b>loss.</b> In a properly performed Pugachev's Cobra, the plane maintains almost straight flight throughout the maneuver; the plane does not roll or yaw in either direction. Proper entry speed is significant because, if entering at too low a speed, the pilot might not be able to accomplish the maneuver; entering at too high a speed might result in airframe damage due to the high g-force or for the pilot to lose consciousness.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the FAA {{has worked}} with Transport Canada, National Research Council Canada (NRC) and APS Aviation, Inc. to develop {{allowance}} times for aircraft operations in ice-pellet precipitation. These allowance times are critical to ensure safety and efficient operation of commercial and cargo flights. Wind-tunnel testing with uncontaminated anti-icing fluids and fluids contaminated with simulated ice pellets had been carried out at the NRC Propulsion and Icing Wind Tunnel (PIWT) {{to better understand the}} flowoff characteristics and resulting aerodynamic effects. The percent <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> on the thin, high-performance wing model tested in the PIWT was determined at 8 angle of attack and used as one of the evaluation criteria in determining the allowance times. Because it was unclear as to how performance degradations measured on this model were relevant to an actual airplane configuration, some means of interpreting the wing model <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> was deemed necessary. This paper describes how the <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> was related to the loss in maximum lift of a Boeing 737 - 200 ADV airplane through the Aerodynamic Acceptance Test (AAT) performed for fluids qualification. A loss in maximum lift coefficient of 5. 24 percent on the B 737 - 200 ADV airplane (which was adopted as the threshold in the AAT) corresponds to a <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> of 7. 3 percent on the PIWT model at 8 angle of attack. There is significant scatter in the data used to develop the correlation related to varying effects of the anti-icing fluids that were tested and other factors. A statistical analysis indicated the upper limit of <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> on the PIWT model was 9. 2 percent.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{investigation was}} conducted to estimate the aerodynamic performance penalties produced by de- and anti-icing fluids. This investigation included experiments using both neat and diluted fluids as well as fluids that had been contaminated by freezing precipitation. The experiments were carried out in National Research Council Canada 2 ̆ 019 s 3 m x 6 m open circuit Propulsion Wind Tunnel. The model was a two-dimensional, single-element NACA 23012 aerofoil of 1. 5 m chord. The investigation showed that the flow of anti-icing fluids during the take-off roll and rotation was dominated by waves with a height of about 0. 5 mm. These waves produced a small, temporary <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> during rotation, with no {{significant impact on the}} model 2 ̆ 019 s stall characteristics. The contamination of anti-icing fluids by freezing precipitation resulted in a decrease in the aerofoil stall margin of up to 3. 3 deg with a <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> of up to 9. 8 percent just prior to stall. The growth of a layer of frost on a simulated cold-soaked unprotected aerofoil caused a decrease in stall margin of 4. 5 deg, with a <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> of approximately 18. 6 percent.

40|$|Effects {{of varying}} jet decay rate on jet-induced loads {{on a flat}} plate located in {{the plane of the}} jet exit {{perpendicular}} to the jet axis were investigated using a small-scale laboratory facility. Jet decay rate has been varied through use of two cylindrical centerbodies having either a flat or hemispherical tip, which were submerged various distances below the flat plate jet exit plane. Increased jet decay rate, caused by the presence of a center-body or plug in the jet nozzle, led to an increased jet-induced <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> on the flat plate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{flow field}} past the {{rotating}} blade of a {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} has been modeled {{with a full}} 3 –D steady–RANS approach. Flow computations have been performed using the commercial finite–volume solver Fluent. A number of blade sections from the 3 –D rotating geometry were chosen and the corresponding 2 –D flow computations have been carried out for comparison, for different angles of attack and in stalled conditions. In order to investigate the effects of rotation a postprocessing tool has been developed, allowing the evaluation of the terms in the boundary layer equations. Examples of the output are proposed for the analyzed flow situations. The main features of the boundary layer flow are described, for both the rotating blade and the corresponding 2 –D profiles.

40|$|Jet efflux {{characteristics}} are a determining factor in STOVL aircraft aero/propulsion induced effects. Subcritical jets may have core lengths which range up to 6 diameters. The shorter core length jets tend to entrain ambient air more rapidly, inducing larger hover lift losses, and decay more rapidly, reducing adverse ground erosion. In transition flight, shorter core length jets show a larger {{decrease in the}} <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> and a slight decrease in nose-up pitching moment. Supercritical pressure ratio jets tend to have longer, higher pressure core lengths with a greater hazard for ground erosion. The decay in the fully developed region is similar for both subcritical and supercritical pressure ratio jets. For subsonic jets the decay is inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} jet exit. In ground effect the supercritical jet induces an oscillating pressure distribution on the ground with reflected shocks and expansions which can increase ground erosion and, at low ground heights, cause non-monotonic <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> variations...|$|E

The effects of jet dynamic pressure decay rate upon the jet location and jet induced pressure distribution on the plate were studied over a range of jet to crossflow velocity ratios of 2. 2 or = R or = 10. Jet decay rate was varied through use of cylindrical centerbodies with flat or hemispherical tips submerged in the jet nozzle at various depths below the jet exit plane. Quicker jet dynamic pressure decay, caused by the presence of a centerbody, resulted in reductions in the jet induced <b>lift</b> <b>loss</b> by as much as 45 percent relative to values for jets with no centerbody.

40|$|The single {{shooting}} {{method is}} applied to the optimal control of very flexible aeroelastic wings and the combined structural and control design (co-design) of geometrically nonlinear beam models in vacuum. As large deflections occur, the dynamical properties of these systems can undergo substantial changes. Efficient actuation strategies require characterising, and possibly exploiting, these phenomena. With this purpose, geometrically-nonlinear models are built using composite beams and an unsteady vortex-lattice aerodynamics description. Optimal control is employed to identify actuations time-histories. Numerical solutions are obtained via single-shooting and sequential quadratic programming upon parametrisation of the control input. The approach is also extended to assess the feasibility of an integrated design strategy for active geometrically-nonlinear structures. Numerical studies are first presented for a very flexible actuated pendulum with large rigid-body motion. The impact of local (B-splines) and global (discrete sines) basis functions is investigated for increasing levels of actuation authority, underlining the importance of the time-frequency resolution of the parametrisation on the convergence properties and outcome quality of the process. Locking between control and structural vibrations around specific design points is found, thus highlighting the limitations of a sequential design approach. Simultaneous designing of control law and structure is seen, instead, to explore more efficiently larger portions of the design space. The lateral manoeuvring of very flexible partially-supported wings is then considered. A flight-dynamics model based on elastified stability derivatives is shown to capture the relevant dynamics either under slow actuation or for stiff wings, and it is hence used as a reference.
