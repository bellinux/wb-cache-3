5|$|A {{subgroup}} of solar urticaria, fixed solar urticaria, {{has also been}} identified. It is a rare, <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> form of the disease with wheals (swollen areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar urticaria is induced by {{a broad spectrum of}} radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700nm.|$|E
5|$|Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP): {{similar to}} glow {{discharge}} plasmas, but generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically 13.56 MHz. These differ from glow discharges {{in that the}} sheaths are much <b>less</b> <b>intense.</b> These are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the genus Pholiota may be mistaken for Pholiota flammans, {{especially}} Pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts {{at the base of}} deciduous as well as coniferous trees. P.squarrosa tends to be a <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> yellow color than P.flammans. P.adiposa is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P.flammans, it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Ron Wynn awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "Pianist Steve Kuhn's {{greatest}} attributes are his steady, sometimes impressive phrasing and interpretative ability; his weak links are a <b>less</b> than <b>intense</b> rhythmic capability and a derivative style. That's overcome on this session mainly because he's {{playing with a}} sympathetic rhythm section".|$|R
50|$|The {{album is}} {{noted for its}} {{sometimes}} radical reworking of the older material. Although Van der Graaf Generator were seldom <b>less</b> than <b>intense</b> on stage, the 1977 and 1978 tours were remarkable for their ferocity. The absence of Hugh Banton, whose organ work was {{a hallmark of the}} group's sound before his departure in 1976, as well as frontman Peter Hammill's increased duties as a rhythm guitarist, account for much of this.|$|R
5|$|The rivalry {{had been}} <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird {{in the early}} 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals {{for the first time}} since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in 7 games. Since 1960, the Lakers are 4-2 against their fiercest rival in the Finals.|$|E
5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E

50|$|The SWB {{baseline}} {{is maintained}} by psychological and biological homeostasis (Brickman & Campbell, 1971; Cummins & Lau, 2004). Measurement of overall happiness determined the SWB baseline. A higher SWB baseline indicates a higher SPQL. People {{who have experienced}} more positive and <b>less</b> negative <b>intense</b> experiences during their lives (i.e., transient deviations), have a higher SPQL. Intense experiences were assessed through measuring the frequency and intensity of nonnormative transient subjective experiences of happiness/unhappiness that deviate from the SWB baseline throughout time.|$|R

5|$|In Greco-Roman times saffron {{was widely}} traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. Their {{customers}} {{ranged from the}} perfumers of Rosetta, in Egypt, to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae. Large dye works operating in Sidon and Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> purple hue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavors, though in <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernet— often around 75%.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August, {{with his}} forces encircled, Model {{organised}} {{attacks on the}} Polish position from {{both within and outside}} the pocket. The Germans managed to isolate the ridge and force open a narrow escape corridor. Lacking the fighting power to close the corridor, the Poles nevertheless directed constant and accurate artillery fire on German units retreating from the pocket, causing heavy casualties. Exasperated, the Germans launched fierce attacks throughout 20 August which inflicted losses on Hill 262's entrenched defenders. Exhausted and dangerously low on ammunition, the Poles managed to retain their foothold on the ridge. The following day, <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> attacks continued until midday, when the last German effort to overrun the position was defeated at close quarters. The Poles were relieved by the Canadian Grenadier Guards shortly after noon; their dogged stand had ensured the closure of the Falaise pocket and the collapse of the German position in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{consists}} of five administrative divisions, {{which are in}} turn divided into 25 districts. For each district, the state government appoints a village headman (known as ketua kampung) for each village. The administrative divisions are inherited from the British administration, which are before administered as province. During the British rule, a Resident was appointed to govern each division and provided with a palace (Istana). The post of the Resident was abolished and replaced with district officers {{for each of the}} district when North Borneo became part of Malaysia. As in the rest of Malaysia, local government comes under the purview of state government. However, ever since the suspension of local government elections {{in the midst of the}} Malayan Emergency, which was much <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> in Sabah than it was in the rest of the country, there have been no local elections. Local authorities have their officials appointed by the executive council of the state government.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Argentina {{is a complex}} subject: the vast size {{of the country and}} {{considerable}} variation in altitude make {{for a wide range of}} climate types. Argentina has four seasons: winter (June–August), spring (September–November), summer (December–February) and autumn (March–May), all featuring different weather conditions. Summers are the warmest and wettest season in most of the country except in most of Patagonia where it is the driest season. Winters are normally mild in the north, cool in the center and cold in the southern parts with the latter experiencing frequent frost and snow. Because southern parts of the country are moderated by the surrounding oceans, the cold is <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> and prolonged than areas at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Spring and autumn are transition seasons that generally feature mild weather.|$|E
50|$|After three {{interviews}} in this fashion, 25% of participants from the imagery condition reported remembering the false situation of spilling the punch bowl, {{as compared to}} fewer than 10% of subjects {{in the control condition}}. An overall improvement in the detail of responses given and the confidence of those responses was observed for both true and false memories in the imagery condition, while those in the control condition showed much less improvement. While participants who 'remembered' the false situation rated this event as being <b>less</b> emotionally <b>intense</b> than the other remembered true events, participants rated their confidence in accurately remembering the false scenario higher than any of the true events.|$|R
3000|$|Prior to the shale {{boom in the}} United States, the {{position}} of natural gas as <b>less</b> GHG <b>intense</b> when compared to coal in the power sector was unquestioned. This changed with the shale boom, where new studies confirmed that the magnitude of methane leaks from natural gas production systems is uncertain and may even be great enough to change this broadly accepted assumption [1]. The most potent environmental {{argument in favor of}} natural gas in comparison to coal still holds: gas is a cleaner burning fossil fuel than coal and has substantially lower emissions of local air pollutants, such as NO x [...] and SO x [...]. However, there are some important caveats complicating the argument that are specific to greenhouse gas emissions.|$|R
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} neon color {{spreading}} {{that can affect}} {{the magnitude of the}} illusion are the colors used within the illusion. Different colors tend to cause a <b>less</b> or more <b>intense</b> illusion. Changing the color of the background can also enhance or inhibit the effect. If contrasting colors are used, such as a yellow background with blue and black lines, the effect will be enhanced. If similar colors are used, the effect will be inhibited.|$|R
5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme {{left side of the}} painting. All the other, <b>less</b> <b>intense,</b> black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> and shorter lived.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian church exteriors {{had been}} {{decorated}} in elaborate styles {{from the first}} quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of sculpture, stucco, frescoes, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and <b>less</b> <b>intense</b> (compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the pièce de resistance: in many instances a single block of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo.|$|E
40|$|Study Objectives: Chronic {{insomnia}} is a prevalent sleep {{disorder that}} negatively affects daytime functioning and confers {{risk for the}} future development of psychiatric disorder. Patients with insomnia often report problems with emotion regulation and impaired social interactions. Moreover, experimental sleep loss in healthy adults is associated with altered reactivity to and interpretation of emotional information. In the current study, we investigated socioemotional processing in patients with chronic insomnia disorder relative to healthy good sleepers. Design: Between-groups comparison. Setting: Sleep Research Laboratory. Participants: Patients with well-defined psychophysiological insomnia (PI; n = 16), free from psychiatric disorder, and an age- and sex-matched control group of good sleepers (GS; n = 15). Interventions: N/A. Measurement and Results: All participants completed a facial expression recognition task, between 18 : 00 and 19 : 00, requiring participants to categorize and rate the intensity of four emotional expression categories: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. People with PI {{did not differ from}} GS with respect to categorization of facial expressions. However, in terms of intensity judgements, across all emotion categories, patients tended to rate faces as <b>less</b> emotionally <b>intense</b> (Cohen's d = 0. 70). Specifically, they rated expressions displaying sadness and fear as significantly <b>less</b> emotionally <b>intense</b> than healthy GS (both P &# 60; 0. 05; Cohen's d = 0. 77 and 0. 89, respectively). Measures of sleepiness (Psychomotor Vigilance Test, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) or self-reported sleep were not reliably associated with emotional intensity ratings. However, anxiety and depression were negatively related to intensity ratings. Conclusion: For the first time we show that chronic insomnia is associated with reduced ratings of emotion intensity for face expressions displaying sadness and fear. Further work is required to elucidate possible mechanisms and pathways underlying insomnia-related emotional impairment...|$|R

5|$|The Indian Navy orchestrated a {{disaster}} relief operation {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Alok Bhatnagar, the Flag Officer Commanding Tamil Nadu, Puducherry Naval Area (TNNA). The Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy rushed an amphibious warfare vessel, the INS Airavat, to Chennai on 2 December, with a complement of 20 divers, five Gemini boats, four landing craft and two boats. Three naval flood relief teams, comprising 86 trained swimmers and divers and three officers, were rushed to Tamil Nadu, along with several hundred food packets. The INS Rajali naval air station at Arakkonam functioned as a makeshift airport for transporting relief materials and evacuating stranded people. On 3 December, the Eastern Naval Command despatched the fleet tanker INS Shakti and the stealth guided missile frigate INS Sahyadri to Tamil Nadu; the ships brought 105 additional divers, 200 tents, 3000 towels, 1000 blankets, 10 field kitchens and food, milk powder, medicines, 5000 litres of bottled water and 700 tonnes of fresh water. General Dalbir Singh Suhag, the Chief of the Army Staff, flew to Chennai on 4 December to supervise the Army's rescue efforts; he and the General Officer Commanding, Dakshin Bharat Area, conducted an aerial reconnaissance. An additional 15 NDRF teams were planned to arrive in a day or two. With rainfall gradually becoming <b>less</b> <b>intense,</b> the pace of relief efforts intensified by 5 December. By then, more than 11 lakh (1,100,000) people had been evacuated to safer places and thousands more temporarily housed in relief camps across the city and adjoining districts. People in many localities began draining stagnant water, while government relief efforts were supplemented by thousands of NGO volunteers and individuals with food packets, drinking water, clothes, blankets and medicines. 92 mobile medical teams were deployed across Chennai on 4 December to tend to the needy, while 200 special medical camps became operational on 5 December, in addition to more than 210 camps already operating.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We have {{recently}} introduced an algorithm for semi-automatic segmentation {{of the left}} ventricular wall in short-axis echocardiographic images (EMBC 30 : 218 – 221). In its preprocessing stage, the algorithm uses temporal averaging for image denoising. Motion estimation is used to detect and reject frames that do not correlate well with the set of images being averaged. However, the process of estimating motion vectors is computationally intense, which increases the algorithm’s computation time. In this work, we evaluate the viability of replacing the motion estimation stage with <b>less</b> computationally <b>intense</b> approaches. Two alternative techniques are evaluated. The ventricular contours obtained {{from each of the}} three algorithm variants were quantitatively and qualitatively compared with contours manually-segmented by a specialist. We show {{that it is possible to}} reduce the algorithm’s computational load without significantly reducing the segmentation quality. The proposed algorithms are also compared with three other techniques from the literature...|$|R
