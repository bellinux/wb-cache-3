500|$|Though {{critics have}} pointed out the song's {{similarities}} {{to some of the}} hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News that he did not intend to write anything mimicking by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. [...] "I don't think it initially tried to sound <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else,</b> but I picked up the guitar and just started playing ," [...] Mars explained. [...] "That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get...". John Marx, a partner in the music division at William Morris Endeavor (WME), who was responsible for managing the Moonshine Jungle Tour said [...] "it's the type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket. It has that live element to it; it was a very active track".|$|E

The song stayed at number one for six weeks, and won awards from both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association.

2500|$|Lukács {{restricted}} {{the application of}} the idea to capitalists only, claiming that Marx had considered capitalists as [...] "mere character masks" [...] – meaning that capitalists, as the personifications ("agents") of capital, did not do anything [...] "without making a business out of it", given that their activity consisted of the correct management and calculation of the objective effects of economic laws. Marx himself never simply equated capitalists with their character masks; they were human beings entangled in a certain life predicament, <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> Capitalists became the [...] "personification" [...] of their capital, because they had money which was permanently invested somewhere, and which necessarily had to obtain a certain yield. At most one could say that capitalists had more to hide, and that some had personal qualities enabling them to succeed in their function, while others lacked the personal prerequisites. According to Lukács, the character masks of the bourgeoisie express a [...] "necessary false consciousness" [...] about the class consciousness of the proletariat.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{soon became}} notorious for causing controversy, {{such as his}} infamous quote that resurfaced in {{interviews}} and articles in the following years, that he was [...] "a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience". In February 1993, Suede went from highly touted indie band to major chart contenders with their third single, [...] "Animal Nitrate", which went into the UK top ten. The single earned them a last-minute invitation to play at that year's Brit Awards ceremony. Impressed by the band's charged sexuality, Suede's first sequence of singles and first album shocked audiences and critics alike. Suede's sexual lyrics made them a rallying point for the alienated, {{one of the few}} British bands since the Smiths who united as much as they divided. Comparisons were being made with David Bowie, though Suede sounded nothing quite <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> around at the time, and soon they fell upon what critics quickly deemed was a new movement. Anderson recalls, [...] "I had always been fascinated by suburbia, and I liked to throw these twisted references to small-town British life into songs. This was before we had that horrible term Britpop." ...|$|E

I don't like them. I'd rather I didn't work 'em. Ever so much. That's the first thing. And the second is--let me be back just before the miracles begin; let everything be {{just as it was}} before that blessed lamp turned up. It's a big job, but it's the last. Have you got it? No more miracles, everything as it was--me back in the Long Dragon just before I drank my half-pint. That's it! Yes." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Van Vliet {{established}} an {{association with the}} Michael Werner Gallery.

In doing so, it was said that he had effectively [...] "succeeded in leaving his past behind". Gordon Veneklasen, one of the gallery's directors in 1995 described Van Vliet as an [...] "incredible painter" [...] whose work [...] "doesn't really look <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else's</b> work but his own". Van Vliet {{has been described as a}} modernist, a primitivist, an abstract expressionist, and, [...] "in a sense" [...] an outsider artist. Morgan Falconer of Artforum concurs, mentioning both a [...] "neo-primitivist aesthetic" [...] and further stating that his work is influenced by the CoBrA painters. The resemblance to the CoBrA painters is also recognized by art critic Roberto Ohrt, while others have compared his paintings to the work of Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Antonin Artaud, Francis Bacon, Vincent van Gogh and Mark Rothko.|$|R

2500|$|Feeling {{that the}} songs {{played on the}} radio at that time were [...] "homogenized", Madonna pursued the musical {{direction}} of MDNA {{with the idea that}} it should not sound <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else's</b> music. The music composed could be divided into two categories. She described the songs crafted with Orbit as [...] "introspective" [...] while the work with Solveig as [...] "more ironic and funny and upbeat. There's a really up aspect to it and a really fun aspect to it". A pop and EDM record, MDNA opens with the track [...] "Girl Gone Wild", which contains influences of four on the floor and a similar sound to songs from Madonna's tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Its introduction included elements of [...] "Act of Contrition" [...] from Like a Prayer (1989), with the chorus talking about [...] "a girl gone wild" [...] with [...] "burning desire". The next song, [...] "Gang Bang", is an electronic dance song, with a dubstep breakdown and industrial beats. The sinister lyrics talk about a woman who takes revenge on her lover, shooting him in his head.|$|R

6000|$|Then {{on market}} days Jean-Pierre was seen {{bargaining}} bitterly, quarrelsome and greedy; then getting drunk with taciturn earnestness; then driving {{home in the}} dusk at a rate fit for a wedding, but with a face gloomy enough for a funeral.

He was of the ordinary stature, and had the ordinary aspects; yet in him were hidden such strange contradictions and disproportions! He was majestically fearless and heroic; he had the strength of thirty men and the daring of thirty thousand; handling armies, organizing states, administering governments--these were pastimes to him; he publicly and ostentatiously accepted the human race at its own valuation--as demigods--and privately and successfully dealt with it at quite another and juster valuation--as children and slaves; his ambitions were stupendous, and his dreams had no commerce with the humble plain, but moved with the cloud-rack among the snow-summits. These features of him were, indeed, extraordinary, but the rest of him was ordinary and usual. He was so mean-minded, in the matter of jealousy, that it was thought he was descended from a god; he was vain in little ways, and had a pride in trivialities; he doted on ballads about moonshine and bruised hearts; in education he was deficient, he was indifferent to literature, and knew nothing of art; he was dumb upon all subjects but one, indifferent to all except that one--the Nebular Theory. Upon that one his flow of words was full and free, he was a geyser. The official astronomers disputed his facts and deeded his views, and said that he had invented both, they not being findable in any of the books. But many of the laity, who wanted their nebulosities fresh, admired his doctrine and adopted it, and it attained to great prosperity in spite of the hostility of the experts."--The Legend of the Man-Mystery, ch. i.|$|R
