25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger <b>load.</b> <b>Amplifiers</b> are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|R

40|$|The next {{generation}} of integrated transceiver front-ends needs both robust low noise amplifiers and high power amplifiers on a single-chip. The Aluminium Gallium Nitride / Gallium Nitride (AlGaN/GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) is a suitable semiconductor technology for this purpose due to its high breakdown voltage and high electron mobility. In this thesis the AlGaN/GaN HEMT’s thermal properties, noise and survivability have been characterized for the intended use in robust high power transceivers. Furthermore, a new characterization setup for load modulated high efficiency power amplifiers have been developed. The thermal properties of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs have been carefully investigated considering self-heating {{and its effect on}} small-signal parameters and high frequency noise. Self-heating is a severe problem for a high power transistor on any semiconductor material, including GaN. In addition to reliability problems, the performance of the operating HEMT degrades with temperature. The access resistances showed a large temperature dependence, which was also verified with TLM measurements. Due to the large self-heating, the temperature dependence of the access resistances has {{to be taken into account}} in the modeling of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT. A temperature dependent small-signal noise model was derived and verified through fabricated amplifiers. Design strategies for robust low noise amplifiers are discussed and implemented using the derived model.

Notable exceptions are various [...] "OTL" [...] (output-transformerless) tube amplifiers, pioneered by Julius Futterman in the 1950s, or somewhat rarer tube amplifiers that replace the impedance matching transformer with additional (often, though not necessarily, transistorized) circuitry in order to eliminate parasitics and musically unrelated magnetic distortions.
