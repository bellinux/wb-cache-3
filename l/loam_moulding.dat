50|$|The mills were {{converted}} to brass mills by the Bristol Brass Company, formed in 1702 by Abraham Darby, Edward lloyd, John Andrews, and Arthur Thomas. In 1706, further partners were admitted, the business becoming an early unincorporated joint stock company with a capital of £8000. While there, Darby recruited skilled 'Dutchmen' to operate a brass battery with trip hammers. He may also have recruited men skilled in sand moulding {{as opposed to the}} <b>loam</b> <b>moulding</b> hitherto used in England. Darby was the active partner in the business, but later withdrew to concentrate on his new ironfounding business at Coalbrookdale.|$|E
5000|$|He also {{developed}} a method for casting pots in 'greensand' moulds, previously only used for smaller castings. This enabled pots to be mass-produced and to be thinner than those made by the traditional process of casting in <b>loam</b> <b>moulds.</b> For this purpose, he established the Cheese Lane Foundry in 1704. Initially he cast brass pots, but by 1705, {{he moved on to}} using iron. [...] A young Welsh apprentice, John Thomas, solved the problem by using sand for the mould, with a special casting box and core. Using this casting method Darby could cast pots of sufficient thinness and lightness. Darby took out a patent on the new casting method in 1707, [...] Darby's successors sold pots over wide areas of England and Wales, and had a virtual monopoly in the trade. [...] For this he used a reverberatory air furnace of a kind developed by Sir Clement Clerke, initially for smelting lead near Bristol, and applied by him or his son Talbot to iron founding at Vauxhall.|$|R
40|$|Comparison {{with the}} {{magnetic}} anisotropy of unbaked (only dried) and baked <b>loam</b> bricks, hand <b>moulded</b> in a rectangular frame, {{reveals that the}} same moulding technique had been applied to produce the bricks of a Medieval brick kiln that was archaeomag-netically dated at 1650 AD [Geoarchaeology (to be published) ]. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements show that the unbaked and baked bricks have a shape-related magnetic fabric, induced during the moulding process, with average Kmax occurring in the greatest faces along {{the direction of the}} longest edges and Kmin perpendicular to the greatest faces of the bricks. The anisotropy of thermoremanence (ATRM) is high, indicating that the remanence directions of bricks may accuse large deviations from the geomagnetic field direction responsible for it. However, anisotropy seems unlikely to be the cause for the apparent dis-crepancy between the archaeomagnetical and archaeological date of the brick kiln, the latter presumably about half a century older. Besides AMS, also the anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence was examined as a possible substitute for ATRM and to obtain in-formation on the magnetic state of the minerals contributing to the remanence anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{leaching}} during autumn {{and winter}} after establishment of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus L.) in Sweden is usually relatively high. The reasons {{are most likely}} the tillage operations {{that need to be}} carried out in summer and the common use of fertilizer nitrogen at establishment. To reduce these negative effects of tillage and fertilizers when growing winter rape, the possibility to establish Winter rape by direct drilling into growing ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) or white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was evaluated in a field experiment at Lönnstorp, Skåne. On a morainic clay <b>loam,</b> autumn <b>mould</b> board ploughing followed by conventional seedbed preparation and sowing was compared with direct drilling into barley stubble, and with direct drilling into the growing catch crop, previously established in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Throughout the experiment, 48 cm row spacing was used for the rape. The tillage treatments were combined with nitrogen fertilizer strategies, with or without 40 kg N ha- 1 in autumn at establishment. Where nitrogen was added in the autumn, the amount of fertilizer added in spring was reduced with the same amount. In spring, only the treatments without a catch crop were inter-row weeded because of too vigorously developed ryegrass and white clover, and weeding was therefore not possible to carry out in these treatments. Direct drilling of winter rape was successful compared to conventional tillage, even though the mean root neck diameter of oil seed rape in November was small and the over-wintering was poor There was no yield of oil seed rape when it was sown into growing ryegrass due to poor establishment of the rape and poor overwintering. In the direct drilled treatment, the yield was 11 % higher with autumn fertilizer than without. Tillage strategies for establishing catch crops and main crops in catch crop production systems need to be further developed to be of practical use in agricultural production...|$|R
