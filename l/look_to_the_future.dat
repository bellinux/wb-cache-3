500|$|For {{the only}} time in this series, Angelou {{describes}} her son's accident in detail at both the end of this book and the beginning of her next one, All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes, a technique that centralizes the two books, connects them with each other, creates a strong, emotional link between them, and repeats Angelou's pattern of ending each book on a positive note. In this book, Angelou ends with a hopeful <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> as her son attains his independence and she looks forward to hers.

500|$|This led to Boycott {{being dropped}} from the side and forced to return to England, despite apologising via a note to the England {{dressing}} room. He claimed in his autobiography, however, {{that he went to}} the golf course following medical advice to get fresh air. Later in 1982 he was instrumental in organising, in defiance of a United Nations and a TCCB ban, a so-called [...] "rebel" [...] tour of apartheid South Africa by 13 current and former England Test cricketers, who were almost all nearing the end of their careers. All the players were banned from international cricket for three years as a result. By the mid-1980s, with Boycott in good county form and physical shape, there was speculation that he might return to the England side. David Gower, England captain of the time, stated, however, that [...] "Geoffrey's been a marvellous servant for England but we have to <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> and, in view of his age, it wouldn't make an awful lot of sense to pick him again." [...] This was confirmed by the return of Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson's 175 against Australia at Leeds, which prompted Botham, who had once remarked that Boycott was [...] "totally, almost insanely, selfish", to sing [...] "Bye-bye Boycott" [...] from the England balcony.|$|E

2500|$|Cleveland was a preservationist by nature, {{respecting}} the natural landscape features {{around him and}} shunning unnecessary decoration. [...] Believing that a growing population would make open spaces like parks all the more valuable and desirable, Cleveland wrote that, {{to be successful in}} the landscape architecture field, one must [...] "Look forward a century, to the time when the city has a population of a million, and think what will be their wants." [...] Essentially, he believed that a good landscape architect should <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> in order to design sustainable landscapes in the here and now, and that landscape architects should speak openly against the destruction of natural landscapes, {{to make sure that they}} would be available for future generations to enjoy.|$|E

An OSCE spokesman said that [...] "the key point here is that it's not the OSCE's role to pass judgment, or point the finger.

2500|$|On October 1, 2007, a four-minute long, one-day only tag commemorating Epcot's 25th Silver Anniversary {{followed}} IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth.

[...] Once the music began, select segments of classic Epcot music were played including We've Just Begun to Dream, Tapestry of Nations and Tapestry of Dreams. After the show, the retro music loop played throughout the park that day began to play, beginning with New Horizons. Due to the extra amount of fireworks used for the special tag, it took much longer than normal to move the firework barges off of the lagoon which resulted in a Burn-Off after midnight.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{two days}} after the huge {{disappointment}} of the Crawley game, {{the last day of the}} January transfer window finally saw the departure of top striker Elliot Benyon to Swindon. [...] Benyon had been one of Paul Buckle’s first signings when he took over at Plainmoor in 2007, and had now developed into Torquay’s main goal threat. [...] As such he had been tracked by several clubs over a number of months and his eventual move had been seen as inevitable by the majority of Gulls fans. [...] The last day of the window also saw the transfer of Nicky Wroe to Shrewsbury and the cancellation of Ashley Hemmings’ loan deal with Wolves. [...] In their place came striker Jake Robinson and midfielder Craig Stanley on loan deals from Shrewsbury and Morecambe respectively. [...] With a new-look squad and just the league to concentrate on, Torquay had to now put an ultimately disheartening month behind them and <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{few days}} before the club's last home match of that 2003–04 season, Norwich manager Nigel Worthington {{announced}} that Roberts would not be offered a new contract when his deal expired that summer. Worthington felt that, following promotion to the Premiership, the club had to <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> and that Roberts was now surplus to requirements. The Norwich supporters gave him a rapturous reception at his last match for the club at Carrow Road and during the post-match promotion celebrations Roberts wore a T-shirt that bore the legend 'Thanks for 7 great years'. With the championship already won, Worthington restored Roberts to the starting line-up for the last game of the season at Gresty Road against Crewe Alexandra and made him captain for the day. Roberts scored twice as City won 3–1. The first of his goals that day is rated by many Norwich fans {{as one of the best}} that he ever scored for the club. Overall, he scored 96 goals in 306 games for Norwich. [...] "Iwan Roberts scored two goals, one of them an absolute corker, to bring the curtain down on a wonderful career in highly appropriate fashion." ...|$|E

If {{you think this}} is a too-indulgent way of alluding to a man who has so shamefully wronged you, let my conviction that he is already beginning to suffer the penalty of his crime plead my excuse. Herbert's nature is, in some respects, better known to me than it is to you. I am persuaded that your hold on his respect and his devotion is shaken--not lost. He has been misled by one of those passing fancies, disastrous and even criminal in their results, to which men are liable when they are led by no better influence than the influence of their senses. It is not, and never will be, in the nature of women to understand this. I fear I may offend you in what I am now writing; but I must speak what I believe to be the truth, at any sacrifice. Bitter repentance (if he is not already feeling it) is in store for Herbert, when he finds himself tied to a person who cannot bear comparison with you. I say this, pitying the poor girl most sincerely, when I think of her youth and her wretched past life. How it will end I cannot presume to say.

60|$|We {{have seen}} that the {{essential}} process arising out {{of the growth of}} science and mechanism, and more particularly out of the still developing new facilities of locomotion and communication science has afforded, is the deliquescence of the social organizations of the past, and the synthesis of ampler and still ampler and more complicated and still more complicated social unities. The suggestion is powerful, the conclusion is hard to resist, that, through whatever disorders of danger and conflict, whatever centuries of misunderstanding and bloodshed, men may still have to pass, this process nevertheless aims finally, and will attain to the establishment of one world-state at peace within itself. In the economic sense, indeed, a world-state is already established. Even to-day we do all buy and sell in the same markets--albeit the owners of certain ancient rights levy their tolls here and there--and the Hindoo starves, the Italian feels the pinch, before the Germans or the English go short of bread. There is no real autonomy any more in the world, no simple right to an absolute independence such as formerly the Swiss could claim. The nations and boundaries of to-day do no more than mark claims to exemptions, privileges, and corners in the market--claims valid enough to those whose minds and souls are turned towards the past, but absurdities to those who <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> as the end and justification of our present stresses. The claim to political liberty amounts, as a rule, to no more than the claim of a man to live in a parish without observing sanitary precautions or paying rates because he had an excellent great-grandfather. Against all these old isolations, these obsolescent particularisms, the forces of mechanical and scientific development fight, and fight irresistibly; and upon the general recognition of this conflict, upon the intelligence and courage with which its inflexible conditions are negotiated, depends very largely the amount of bloodshed and avoidable misery the coming years will hold.|$|E
6000|$|At last, {{in a very}} unworthy spirit, I {{determined}} to debauch the lad from his good resolutions, and, waylaying him at the gate, easily persuaded him to join me in a ramble. It was a fine day, and the woods to which I led him were green and pleasant and sweet-smelling, and alive with the hum of insects. Here he discovered himself in a fresh character, mounting up to heights of gaiety that abashed me, and displaying an energy and grace of movement that delighted the eye. He leaped, he ran round me in mere glee; he would stop, and look and listen, and seem to drink in {{the world like a}} cordial; and then he would suddenly spring into a tree with one bound, and hang and gambol there like one at home. Little as he said to me, and that of not much import, I have rarely enjoyed more stirring company; the sight of his delight was a continual feast; the speed and accuracy of his movements pleased me to the heart; and I might have been so thoughtlessly unkind as to make a habit of these walks, had not chance prepared a very rude conclusion to my pleasure. By some swiftness or dexterity the lad captured a squirrel in a tree top. He was then some way ahead of me, but I saw him drop to the ground and crouch there, crying aloud for pleasure like a child. The sound stirred my sympathies, it was so fresh and innocent; but as I bettered my pace to draw near, the cry of the squirrel knocked upon my heart. I have heard and seen much of the cruelty of lads, and above all, of peasants; but what I now beheld struck me into a passion of anger. I thrust the fellow aside, plucked the poor brute out of his hands, and with swift mercy killed it. Then I turned upon the torturer, spoke to him long out of the heat of my indignation, calling him names at which he seemed to wither; and at length, pointing towards the residencia, bade him begone and leave me, for I chose to walk with men, not with vermin. He fell upon his knees, and, the words coming to him with more clearness than usual, poured out a stream of the most touching supplications, begging me in mercy to forgive him, to forget what he had done, to <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> [...] "Oh, I try so hard," [...] he said. [...] "Oh, commandante, bear with Felipe this once; he will never be a brute again!" [...] Thereupon, much more affected than I cared to show, I suffered myself to be persuaded, and at last shook hands with him and made it up. But the squirrel, by way of penance, I made him bury; speaking of the poor thing's beauty, telling him what pains it had suffered, and how base a thing was the abuse of strength. [...] "See, Felipe," [...] said I, [...] "you are strong indeed; but in my hands you are as helpless as that poor thing of the trees. Give me your hand in mine. You cannot remove it. Now suppose that I were cruel like you, and took a pleasure in pain. I only tighten my hold, and see how you suffer." [...] He screamed aloud, his face stricken ashy and dotted with needle-points of sweat; and when I set him free, he fell to the earth and nursed his hand and moaned over it like a baby. But he took the lesson in good part; and whether from that, or from what I had said to him, or the higher notion he now had of my bodily strength, his original affection was changed into a dog-like, adoring fidelity.|$|E
