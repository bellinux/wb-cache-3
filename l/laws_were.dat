50|$|Public <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>law</b> {{that governs}} the {{relationship}} between people and the State, and it is composed of three types: constitutional law, criminal law, and administrative <b>law.</b> Constitutional <b>law</b> <b>is</b> the body of law that governs the principles and powers of the government, and {{the relationships between the}} different parts of the government. Criminal <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>law</b> that restricts conduct that threatens safety and welfare of society or the State.

5|$|Boniface {{accompanied}} {{the queen and}} Prince Edward to Burgos for the marriage of Edward to Eleanor of Castile and Edward's knighting. But in 1261 Boniface held a church council at Lambeth, where a series of ecclesiastical <b>laws</b> <b>were</b> published which denounced any royal limitations on ecclesiastical courts. These decrees were done without royal consent and thus was tantamount to an ecclesiastical revolt against royal authority similar to the baronial opposition movement that had begun in 1258.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} about {{these changes in}} society. William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman {{in the years before}} 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters. There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy <b>laws</b> <b>were</b> more widely applied and the treason <b>laws</b> <b>were</b> extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.|$|E
