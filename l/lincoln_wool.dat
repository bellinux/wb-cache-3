40|$|A new {{testing method}} using a mini split Hopkinson tensile bar was {{employed}} in the impact tests of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fibers. Stress-strain curves of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fibers subjected to impact loadings at strain rates {{in the order of}} 10 (2) s(- 1) were obtained, which fill the gap in the impact data for <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fibers. For comparison, quasi-static tests were also carried out with a single <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fiber using a Micro-Tester. Stress level was observed to increase with increasing strain rates...|$|E
40|$|A new testing {{approach}} using a mini-split Hopkinson tensile bar (mSHTB) {{was employed}} in the impact tests of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fibres and Merino wool yarns. Stress-strain curves of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fibres and Merino yarns subjected to impact loadings at strain rates {{in the order of}} 102 s- 1 were obtained, which fills the gap in the impact data for <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fibres and Merino yarns. For comparison, quasi-static tests were also carried out with a single <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fibre and Merino yarn using a Micro-Tester. The stress levels of fibres in impact tests were higher than those in the quasi-static tests and the stress level increased with strain rates. The same trend was found in force for Merino yarns. The quantitative relation between stress and strain rate of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> fibre was expressed by a Cowper-Symonds relation. Empirical quantitative relation between the force and strain rate of Merino yarn was also obtained...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis [...] Caucasian hair, Negro hair, and <b>Lincoln</b> <b>wool</b> are {{compared}} in ternis of physical structure, mechanical properties, chemical composition, {{and rate of}} reaction with various re-agents. Several significant differences are found between wool and the two hair samples. The principal one is the extent of crosslinking, which is greater in the hair, as indicated by higher sulfur and cystine contents, and {{a higher proportion of}} the material found in the â€¢-keratose fraction after oxidation. The heavier crosslinking is reflected in greater resistance to attack by hot acid and in slower reduction by thioglycolate or sulfite solutions. The main difference between Caucasian and Negro hair is in fiber geometry; the Cau-casian fiber approximates a cylinder, the Negro a twisted oval rod. In their physical and chemical properties, the two fibers are very similar. I...|$|E

The president watches troops embarking to attack Norfolk, an operation he helped plan. The city surrendered May 10, 1862. Next day the Confederate ironclad 'Merrimac,' deprived of her base, was blown up by her crew to prevent capture. With Lincoln are Secretary of War Stanton, Secretary of the Treasury Chase and Major General <b>Wool.</b> <b>Lincoln</b> was at Fort Monroe May 6 - 11, 1862.

50|$|In {{purchasing}} Braeside, a well-watered grazing {{property on}} the southern Darling Downs, from FH Needham in 1879, Allan was able to concentrate on stock breeding and improvement, developing the property as a model stud farm, his pastoral headquarters, and his family's permanent place of residence. At Braeside Allan established a purebred Hereford Cattle Stud and bred black Merino and <b>Lincoln</b> sheep, the <b>wool</b> selling well on the London market. He took {{a great interest in}} developing the stud, keeping detailed herd books. His bulls had a reputation for hardiness and longevity, and were in demand with graziers. Braeside Stud was sufficiently significant to Queensland to be featured in the Department of Agriculture's Queensland Agricultural Journal of September 1899. At this time the property totalled about 12,000 acres, and included Mount Crystal. The Hereford cattle stud numbered over 1,000, all descended from high-class imported English stock. In addition there was a fine Jersey dairy herd at Braeside, and some cropping for home consumption, on the creek flats. The house was set amid extensive gardens and an orchard.|$|R
