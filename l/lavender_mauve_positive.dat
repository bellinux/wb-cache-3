Other items included the Kim Chi Electric Teal Eyeshadow and Kim Chi Liquid Lip Color.|$|R
50|$|In 1940, while escorting a convoy, Lord Mountbatten {{noted that}} one {{ship in the}} group {{vanished}} from view much earlier than the remainder. The ship, a Union-Castle liner, was painted <b>lavender</b> <b>mauve</b> grey. Mountbatten thus became convinced of the colour's effectiveness as a camouflage during dawn and dusk, often dangerous times for ships, and had all of the destroyers of his flotilla painted with a similar pigment, which he created by mixing a medium grey {{with a small amount}} of Venetian Red. By early 1941, several other ships began using the same camouflage, though no formal testing was done to determine how well it worked.|$|R

5000|$|Rose de France is {{a member}} of the {{amethyst}} family of gemstones. It is defined by its markedly light shade of the purple known to the amethyst family. The color is reminiscent of a lavender/lilac shade. Amethyst is found in a variety of hues of purple including deep purple, light lilac, <b>lavender,</b> and <b>mauve.</b> The pale lilac colors, coined Rose de France, were once considered undesirable but have recently become popular due to intensive marketing.|$|R
25|$|In Britain, {{black is}} the colour {{traditionally}} associated with mourning for the dead. The customs and etiquette expected of men, and especially women, were rigid {{during much of}} the Victorian era. The expectations depended on a complex hierarchy of close or distant relationship with the deceased. The closer the relationship, the longer the mourning period and the wearing of black. The wearing of full black was known as First Mourning, which had its own expected attire, including fabrics, and an expected duration of 4 to 18 months. Following the initial period of First Mourning, the mourner would progress to Second Mourning, a transition period of wearing less black, which was followed by Ordinary Mourning, and then Half-mourning. Some of these stages of mourning were shortened or skipped completely if the mourner's relationship to the deceased was more distant. Half-mourning was a transition period when black was replaced by acceptable colours such as <b>lavender</b> and <b>mauve,</b> possibly considered acceptable transition colours because of the tradition of Church of England (and Catholic) clergy wearing <b>lavender</b> or <b>mauve</b> stoles for funeral services, to represent the Passion of Christ.|$|R
50|$|Howittia trilocularis is a shrub {{that grows}} to between 1 and 3 metres in height. It has lancelolate to ovate leaves up to 10 cm long that are dark green above and white or yellow to brown beneath.

50|$|Scientists are yet {{to produce}} a truly blue colored rose; however, after {{thirteen}} years of collaborative research by an Australian company, Florigene, and a Japanese company, Suntory, a rose containing the blue pigment delphinidin was created in 2004 by genetic engineering of a white rose.

50|$|After {{thirteen}} years of collaborative research, an Australian company - Florigene, and a Japanese company - Suntory, created a blue rose (actually <b>lavender</b> or <b>mauve)</b> in 2004. The genetic engineering involved three alterations - adding two genes, and interfering with another. One of the added genes {{was for the}} blue plant pigment delphinidin cloned from the pansy. The researchers then used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to depress all color production by endogenous genes by blocking a crucial protein in color production, called dihydroflavonol 4-reductase) (DFR), and adding a variant of that protein {{that would not be}} blocked by the RNAi but that would allow the delphinidin to work. The roses are sold in Japan, the United States, and Canada. Florigene has also created and sells lavender-colored carnations that are genetically engineered in a similar way.|$|R
50|$|Iris pseudopallida ('Southern Adriatic iris') is {{a species}} in the genus Iris, it {{is also in the}} {{subgenus}} of Iris. It is a rhizomatous perennial from Croatia. It has flat, curved of sickle-shaped leaves, tall slender stems, 3-8 fragrant flowers, in shades of violet, or pale violet flowers, <b>mauve,</b> <b>lavender,</b> purple, yellow or white, between May and June. The iris was originally thought to be a separate species, but later classified as subspecies of Iris pallida, known as Iris pallida subsp. pseudopallida, although in Croatia, it is still known as Iris pseudopallida. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, especially in the Balkan regions.|$|R
5000|$|The Russian Blue has {{bright green}} eyes, pinkish <b>lavender</b> or <b>mauve</b> paws, {{two layers of}} short thick fur, and a blue-grey coat. The color is a bluish-gray that is the dilute {{expression}} of the black gene. However, as dilute genes are recessive ("d") and each parent will {{have a set of}} two recessive genes ("dd") two non-CPC Russian Blues will always produce a blue cat. Due to the breeding with Siamese after WWII there are colorpoint genes floating around. If you breed two carriers together then you will get a litter of mixed colors - solid blue or white with blue like a Siamese. People call these CPC cats [...] "colorpoint", [...] "whites" [...] or [...] "pointed" [...] Russians. In most registries you cannot register, breed or show a colorpoint Russian.The coat is known as a [...] "double coat", with the undercoat being soft, downy, and equal in length to the guard hairs, which are an even blue with silver tips. The tail, however, may have a few very dull, almost unnoticeable stripes. The coat is described as thick, plush and soft to the touch. The feeling is like the softest velvet. The silver tips give the coat a shimmering appearance. Its eyes are almost always a dark and vivid green. Any white patches of fur or yellow eyes in adulthood are seen as flaws in show cats. Russian Blues {{should not be confused with}} British Blues (which are not a distinct breed, but rather a British Shorthair with a blue coat; the British Shorthair breed itself comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns), nor the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally occurring breeds of blue cats, although they have similar traits.|$|R
50|$|It has a bluish {{coloured}} rhizome, and has flat, curved, or sickle-shaped leaves. The leaves {{can grow}} up to 35 cm long, and up to 3 cm wide. They can survive the winter. It has a slender stem or peduncles, that can {{grow up to}} between 60 - 100 cm tall. It has branches (or pedicels) near top of the plant. The stem has (scarious) membranous, (or translucent) spathes (leaves of the flower bud). Similar to Iris illyrica, the spathes can have a dirty, rusty markings. The stems (and the branches) hold between 3 and 8 flowers, between May and June.The fragrant flowers, come in shades of violet, or pale violet flowers, <b>mauve,</b> <b>lavender,</b> purple, yellow or white. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are bent backwards, they have a light brown edge and reddish purple veins. They also have a thick strip of yellow hairs (the 'beard') in the centre. The flowers has dry, spheroidal pollen, that are 51-100 Âµm large. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, that has 5 mm long seeds.|$|R
6000|$|Inclined to long {{pauses and}} slow {{approaches}} herself, Euphemia {{was a great}} sitter {{at the feet of}} breathless volubility, and there were moments when she fairly hung upon the lips of Mademoiselle Marie de Mauves. Her intimacy with this chosen schoolmate was founded on the perception--all her own--that their differences were just the right ones. Mademoiselle de <b>Mauves</b> was very <b>positive,</b> very shrewd, very ironical, very French--everything that Euphemia felt herself unpardonable for not being. During her Sundays en ville she had examined the world and judged it, and she imparted her impressions to our attentive heroine with an agreeable mixture of enthusiasm and scepticism. She was moreover a handsome and well-grown person, on whom Euphemia's ribbons and trinkets had a trick of looking better than on their slender proprietress. She had finally the supreme merit of being a rigorous example of the virtue of exalted birth, having, as she did, ancestors honourably mentioned by Joinville and Commines, and a stately grandmother with a hooked nose who came up with her after the holidays from a veritable castel in Auvergne. It seemed to our own young woman that these attributes made her friend more at home in the world than if she had been the daughter of even the most prosperous grocer. A certain aristocratic impudence Mademoiselle de Mauves abundantly possessed, and her raids among her friend's finery were quite in the spirit of her baronial ancestors in the twelfth century--a spirit regarded by Euphemia but as a large way of understanding friendship, a freedom from conformities without style, and one that would sooner or later express itself in acts of surprising magnanimity. There doubtless prevailed in the breast of Mademoiselle de Mauves herself a dimmer vision of the large securities that Euphemia envied her. She was to become later in life so accomplished a schemer that her sense of having further heights to scale might well have waked up early. The especially fine appearance made by our heroine's ribbons and trinkets as her friend wore them ministered to pleasure on both sides, and the spell was not of a nature to be menaced by the young American's general gentleness. The concluding motive of Marie's writing to her grandmamma to invite Euphemia for a three weeks' holiday to the castel in Auvergne involved, however, the subtlest considerations. Mademoiselle de Mauves indeed, at this time seventeen years of age and capable of views as wide as her wants, was as proper a figure as could possibly have been found for the foreground of a scene artfully designed; and Euphemia, whose years were of like number, asked herself if a right harmony with such a place mightn't come by humble prayer. It is a proof of the sincerity of the latter's aspirations that the castel was not a shock to her faith. It was neither a cheerful nor a luxurious abode, but it was as full of wonders as a box of old heirlooms or objects [...] "willed." [...] It had battered towers and an empty moat, a rusty drawbridge and a court paved with crooked grass-grown slabs over which the antique coach-wheels of the lady with the hooked nose seemed to awaken the echoes of the seventeenth century. Euphemia was not frightened out of her dream; she had the pleasure of seeing all the easier passages translated into truth, as the learner of a language begins with the common words. She had a taste for old servants, old anecdotes, old furniture, faded household colours and sweetly stale odours--musty treasures in which the Chateau de Mauves abounded. She made a dozen sketches in water-colours after her conventual pattern; but sentimentally, as one may say, she was for ever sketching with a freer hand.|$|R
