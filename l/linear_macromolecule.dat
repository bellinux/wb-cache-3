40|$|Our {{studies on}} the {{viscosity}} of macromolecular polysaccharides such as plant gum or plant mucilage relating to the industrial utilization of polyphosphates are interesting. Following these studies for gum tragacanth and C. M. C., now the similar studis for locust bean mucilage (gum), also known as carob bean gum were carried out using Stormer type rotational viscosimeter. Furthermore, instead of the previous measurements on the viscosity of ca. 3 % aqueous solution with the viscosimeter of the falling ball type, the present measurements on that of ca. 1. 5 % aqueous gum tragacanth solution with rotational viscosimeter are also canied out. The results obtained may be summarized in the following: (I) Effects of 5 sorts of polyphosphates such as sodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripoly phosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and their mixtures on the about 1. 0 [...] 1. 5 % aqueous solution of locust bean gum as one of plant mucilage and on the about 3 % aqueous solution of gum tragacanth as one of plant gum are studied and the considerable increase of their viscosity are observed. (II) In both cases, each curve relating the viscosity-quantities added has maximum and the orders for the increassing effect with these polyphosphates resembled each other. (III) It appears that this increasing of the viscosity will be partly ascribed to the increased formation of aggregation of the linear negative ions and may be partly based on the untwisting of somewhat kinked <b>linear</b> <b>macromolecule</b> having many hydroxyl groups probably caused by the adsorption of these polyphosphate ions kindred with that group. 浅岡が従来行って来ている重合燐酸塩の利用に関連した多くの研究のうちで発表済のものは若千に過ぎない。しかしその中に高分子物質水溶液の粘度に対する添加物の影響の研究としてトラガントゴム水溶液についての報告があるので，ゴム類ではないが或意味ではこれと類似とも云える植物粘質物であるローカストゴムについて同様の実験を行ったものである。このローカストゴムは食品，化粧品，繊維加工，製紙，医薬用ゼリーなどの方面の用途が知られているので，これに対する添加物効果はその利用面からも主要である。更に既報ではトラガントゴム水溶液の粘度測定が落球式であったので，今回はローカストゴム水溶液と同じく回転粘度計によって測定可能の粘度まで低下させるために，前の約半分の濃度である約 3 %にして同種の実験を行ったものである...|$|E
40|$|The thesis aims to gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} on the mechanisms of the complicated macromolecular fouling in ultrafiltration (UF). The work is divided into three main parts. Firstly, comprehensive literature reviews on both membrane fouling and cleaning were carried out for a better overview on this problem. The findings such as the identification of the main foulants and the current knowledge on fundamental fouling mechanisms, directly contributed to further parts of the thesis. Secondly, a multiscale approach was developed to form generalised framework for modelling complex fouling scenarios. Two complex fouling models combining multi- ple fouling mechanisms were derived accordingly. The models were then applied to the filtration data collected from UF experiments (constant-pressure and dead-end) on three individual macromolecular solutes, i. e., dextran blue (DB), polyethylene oxide (PEO), and humic acid (HA), respectively. During the experiments, the effect of macromolecular concentration and transmembrane pressure was investigated. Using the appropriate combined model, the overall and initial fouling behaviours and the predominant fouling mechanisms at different stages of filtration were identified. The fouling parameters in the combined models were determined and found to be consistent with the existing theories. The switch points between the dominant fouling mechanisms were assessed using two methods (integral and differential), respectively. Comparing all the information together gave a comprehensive understanding of the physics involved in the macromolecular fouling. Finally, the effect of the deformability of a macromolecule on membrane fouling was studied. The sieving results from the experiments indicated a flux-dependent permeation during UF of the DB solution, hypothetically due to the elongational deformation of the large DB molecule (a linear polymer at 2000 kDa MWCO) under high velocity gradient at the pore entrance, allowing the molecule to adapt a smaller transversal size to enter pores at nominally 100 kDa cutoff. This not only increased the chances of permeation but also the probability of severe irreversible fouling. Subsequently, a mesoscopic model using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) was developed to investigate the blocking event at the pore entrance in the presence of a deformable <b>linear</b> <b>macromolecule.</b> The simulation results shed lights on the threshold permeating flux at which the molecular chains start to deform. </p...|$|E

They are {{a combination of}} a short-range repulsion, which varies exponentially over at least five decay lengths, and an inferred, longer-ranged attraction responsible for spontaneous assembly. From 5 degrees C to 35 degrees C the relative contribution of the attraction to the net force increases with temperature. These forces are strikingly similar to the "hydration" forces measured between several other <b>linear</b> <b>macromolecules</b> (DNA, polysaccharides) and between lipid bilayer membranes.

The automated nature of this data analysis makes it straightforward to accumulate vast quantities of data while excluding the unreliable parts of it.

Dendrimers have numerous potential applications in chemical, biological, medicinal and materials research which have been facilitated by their commercial availability. In this work, we chose the second generation poly(propylene imine) (PPI, DAB-dendr-(NH 2) 8) dendrimer as starting material. A series of hydrophobically-modified dendrimers were prepared by using fatty acid chlorides. The modified dendrimers are amphiphiles which contain a hydrophilic (water-loving) core (head) and eight hydrophobic (water-fearing) tails. These dendrimers are designed to be interfacial stabilization agents between electrode and electrolyte in lithium batteries, and so how these dendrimers behave on flat surface is very intriguing to us.

40|$|Entanglement in polymer and {{biological}} physics involves {{a state in}} which <b>linear</b> interthreaded <b>macromolecules</b> in isotropic liquids diffuse in a spatially anisotropic manner beyond a characteristic mesoscopic time and length scale (tube diameter). The physical reason is that <b>linear</b> <b>macromolecules</b> become transiently localized in directions transverse to their backbone but diffuse with relative ease parallel to it. Within the resulting broad spectrum of relaxation times there is an extended period before the longest relaxation time when filaments occupy a time-averaged cylindrical space of near-constant density. Here we show its implication with experiments based on fluorescence tracking of dilutely labeled macromolecules. The entangled pairs of aqueous F-actin biofilaments diffuse with separation-dependent dynamic cross-correlations that exceed those expected from continuum hydrodynamics up to strikingly large spatial distances of approximate to 15 mu m, {{which is more than}} 104 {{times the size of the}} solvent water molecules in which they are dissolved, and is more than 50 times the dynamic tube diameter, but is almost equal to the filament length. Modeling this entangled system as a collection of rigid rods, we present a statistical mechanical theory that predicts these long-range dynamic correlations as an emergent consequence of an effective long-range interpolymer repulsion due to the de Gennes correlation hole, which is a combined consequence of chain connectivity and uncrossability. The key physical assumption needed to make theory and experiment agree is that solutions of entangled biofilaments localized in tubes that are effectively dynamically incompressible over the relevant intermediate time and length scales. clos...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} is developed for stochastic simulation of dynamics of polymer reactions in a homogeneous, batch or continuous flow reactor. The {{procedure is}} applicable to condensation-type reactions involving <b>linear</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> and yields the dynamic evolution of product microcomposition.

Link is a reactive site between adjacent groups. The reactor space is a combination of vectors, representing the types of species in the reactor, their weights and the weights of the links associated with them. The occurrence of various events such as inflow, outflow, volatilisation and reactions, is regarded as random. A priori probabilities of occurrence of these events and magnitudes of the changes they bring about in the reactor space are related to their global rates. Deterministic bias and event scaling techniques are employed to improve accuracy of the simulation. The procedure is illustrated with a test example. The developed procedure is general in its applicability to stochastic modelling of any homogeneous, condensation-type polymerisation process...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} {{large-scale}} computer simulations and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), we investigate solutions of single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs), covering the whole concentration range from infinite dilution to melt density. The {{analysis of the}} conformational properties of the SCNPs reveals that these synthetic nano-objects share basic ingredients with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), as topological polydispersity, generally sparse conformations, and locally compact domains. We investigate {{the role of the}} architecture of the SCNPs in their collapse behavior under macromolecular crowding. Unlike in the case of <b>linear</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> which experience the usual transition from self-avoiding to Gaussian random-walk conformations, crowding leads to collapsed conformations of SCNPs resembling those of crumpled globules. This behavior is already found at volume fractions (about 30 %) that are characteristic of crowding in cellular environments. The simulation results are confirmed by the SANS experiments. Our results for SCNPs—a model system free of specific interactions—propose a general scenario for the effect of steric crowding on IDPs: collapse from sparse conformations at high dilution to crumpled globular conformations in cell environments...|$|R

Stepwise irradiation of such samples {{in the presence of a}} triplet sensitizer causes successive dimerization of the maleimides leading to progressive crosslinking. Studies were performed with varying concentrations of matrix polymer (20 – 80 g L 1) as well as different molar masses (200, 000 – 1, 300, 000 gmol 1) and particle radii (17 and 36 nm) of enclosed labeled probes. Results show notable differences between the behavior of linear and spherical tracers: while the mobility of flexible linear chains remains nearly unaffected by {{the transition from a}} semidilute polymer solution into a chemically crosslinked network, spherical tracers get completely immobilized when the degree of crosslinking exceeds a certain threshold. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
