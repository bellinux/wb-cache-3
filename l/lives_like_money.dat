5000|$|By {{the end of}} 1850 the British {{rule was}} {{established}} in Chota Nagpur region. From ages tribals have their own traditional autonomous self-governance rule of [...] "Parha System" [...] and they were almost free from any outside interference. But this autonomous self - governance rule was disturbed and destroyed by the regulations imposed by British Raj. Now tribals had to pay revenue(malgujari) on their own land {{which they had been}} prepared and cultivated for centuries. They were alienated from their land in the hands of zamindars and Britishers, when they failed to pay land revenue. In their own land they were forced to <b>live</b> <b>like</b> a farm labourers. The middlemen <b>like</b> <b>money</b> lenders(sahukars) and zamindars didn't miss any single chance to loot common people. There also existed the major problem of rural indebtness. Poor people had to lose their land when they were unable to repay loans taken from village moneylenders. Many times these debts were inherited from the past and increased with the passage of time. The plight of a common man was very miserable.|$|R
