A previously developed vehicle model has been incorporated into the TrainDy software for longitudinal train dynamics. This complex dynamic model of the whole train has been employed to perform pushing tests and emergency braking on freight train.

40|$|Purpose. The {{analytical}} {{study of}} the connection between the longitudinal force, acting on the light-weight car, lateral and vertical forces of interaction in the contact zone «wheel – rail» with the lift resistance factor value is to provide a simple relationships between them. Methodology. Research was conducted by the method of mathematical modeling of loading the freight car when driving at different speeds on straight and curved sections of a track. Findings. Even in the absence of «lift» accordingly the classical train stability theory, as the hinge-rod system, the presence of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> may become a factor provoking cars derailment. The main reason of wheel climbing on rails is the combination of processes of dynamic interaction between the hunting vehicle and the track with simultaneous action of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>forces,</b> and not the destabilization of train as a hingedrod system. To assess the impact of the longitudinal forces value on the lift resistance factor there are presented the calculation results for the empty gondola car motion, model No. 12 - 532, on 250 m radius curve with 150 mm rise and cross starting of car underframe relating to the track axis in 50 mm guiding section. The calculations were made in such a curve excluding the inertial forces from outstanding acceleration and taking into account the unbalanced acceleration with the permissible speed of 65 km/h. Originality. This study provides the technique of determining the lift resistance factor by longitudinal forces, which is somewhat different from the standard one, as well as evaluates impact of rolling stock speed on this factor. Practical value. The authors clarify the current method of determining the lift resistance factor by longitudinal forces and assess the impact of rolling stock speed on the value of this factor. From these studies one can conclude that because of cars hunting their lift is possible even when the train as hinge-rod system does not lose stability. The developed proposals allow reducing the number of car derailment by taking into account important parameters and characteristics during the process of calculation and design that increase their stability in the rail track especially in case of increased speed of freight trains...|$|E

Methodology. The study was conducted by an analytical method assessing the sustainability of the freight car when driving at different speeds on the straight and curved track sections. Findings. In the process of studying the motion of the train, in the investigation of transport events, as well as during the training on the simulator operator, to assess the actions of the driver, the values of the longitudinal forces in the inter car connections are used. To calculate the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>forces,</b> acting on the car, in which car lift resistance factor will be equal to the allowable value (critical force). To assess the impact on the value of the longitudinal force speed, coefficients of the vertical and horizontal dynamics, as well as the wind load on the side surface of the car body are the results of calculations of motion of the empty gondola car, model № 12 - 532 curve radius of 250 m with a rise of 150 mm and a transverse run of body of car frame relative to the track axis of the guide section 50 mm.

After validating the presented locomotive dynamic model by comparing its calculated results with test data, simulations are carried out to analyse the influences of the coupler-tail arc surface and locomotive secondary suspension parameters on the coupler compressed stability and locomotive running safety. Results indicate that the friction coefficient and the arc radius of the coupler-tail arc surfaces have a remarkable influence, and that the locomotive secondary lateral stop and lateral stiffness also have a significant effect.

40|$|A novel porous {{conducting}} nanofiber mat (PCNM) with nanostructured polyaniline (nanoPANi) on {{the fiber}} surface was successfully prepared by simple oxidative polymerization. The composite PCNM displayed a core/shell structure with highly rough surface. The thickness and the morphology of PANi layer on the electrospun polyamide (PA) fiber surface {{could be controlled}} by varying aniline concentration and temperature. The combination {{of the advantages of}} electrospinning technique and nanostructured PANi, let the PA/PANi composite PCNM possess more than five good properties, i. e. high conductivity of 6. 759 S·m- 1, high specific surface area of 160 m 2 ·g- 1, good strength of 82. 88 MPa for mat and 161. 75 MPa for highly aligned belts, good thermal properties with 5 % weight loss temperature up to 415 oC and excellent biocompatibility. In the PA/PANi composite PCNM, PANi is the only conducting component, its conductivity of 6. 759 S·m- 1 which is measured in dry-state, is not enough for electrode. Moreover, the conductivity decreases in neutral pH environment due to the de-doping of proton. However, the method of spontaneous growth of nanostructured PANi on electrospun fiber mats provides an effective method to produce porous electrically conducting electrospun fiber mats. The combination advantages of nanostructured PANi with the electrospun fiber mats, extends the applications of PANi and electrospun nanofibers, such as chemical- and bio-sensors, actuators, catalysis, electromagnetic shielding, corrosion protection, separation membranes, electro-optic devices, electrochromic devices, tissue engineering and many others. The electrical conductivity of electrospun PCNM with PANi as the only conducting component is too low for application of as anode in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). So, we turn to electrospun carbon fiber due to its high electrical conductivity and environmental stability. The current density is greatly dependent on the microorganism density of anode in MFCs. While the two-dimensional electrospun carbon fiber mat (2 D-ECFM) which was prepared by normal electrospinning only allows growth of microorganism on the surface with thin layer owing to the low porosity and small pore size in the mat. With the concept of increasing the power density of MFCs by increase of microorganism density in the anode, two novel 3 D electrospun carbon fiber mats, porous three-dimensional electrospun carbon fiber mat (3 D-ECFM) and layered 3 D-ECFM, were developed. The porous 3 D-ECFM made by GE-spinning shows high specific surface area due to small fiber diameter of about 1 μm, stable highly porous structure with high porosity of 99 %, big pore size of around 5. 8 μm in the mat and very low density of 18 kg·m- 3. The porous 3 D-ECFM anode is very suitable for microbial biofilms growth and generates very high geometric current density of 3. 0 mA·cm- 2, and super-high weight current density of 714 mA·g- 1. The layered 3 D-ECFM made by layer-by-layer electrospinning also shows high porosity of 98. 5 % which mainly come from the void-space between layers, and high specific area due to small electrospun carbon fibers on each layer. This layered design is suitable for layer-by-layer growth of biofilm and generates geometric current density of 2. 0 mA·cm- 2 and weight current density of 294 mA·g- 1. Though the porosity and pore size in the mats are high enough for penetration single small microorganism, the tendency of biofilms formation makes the biofilm is unable to be grown in whole mat but only in the upper layer about several hundreds micrometers. Because the growth of biofilm is affected by multiple factors, e. g nutrition transfer, but they are greatly hindered by the biofilm formed in the upper layer. The current density of 3 D-ECFM anode could be further improved by further increasing porosity and introducing large holes or channels in the mats for sufficient nutrition transportation to inside the mats. According to the results of above, the porosity and the pore size in the fiber mat are utmost important for the performance of anode in MFCs. With concept of curve or helix in fibers can lead to higher porosity in the fiber mat, a novel 3 D porous architecture, nanospring, was designed for high performance anode structure in future MFC. Polymeric nanospring was prepared by bicomponent electrospinning. The reasons for the formation of polymeric nanosprings were investigated by coaxial electrospinning of bicomponent rigid i. e. Nomex® or polysulfonamide (PSA) (rigid) and flexible polymers i. e. thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) (flexible). The results indicated that the nanospring formation is attributed to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> which are resulted from the different shrinkages of the rigid and flexible two polymer components and a good electrical conductivity of one of the polymer solutions in coaxial electrospinning system. The modified electrospinning i. e. off-centered electrospinning and side-by-side electrospinning are much more effective than the coaxial electrospinning for generating polymer spring or helical structures, because of the higher <b>longitudinal</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> which derived from the lopsided elastic forces. The aligned nanofiber mat with high percent of nanospring shows higher elongation and higher storage modulus below transition glass temperature (Tg) compared to that with straight fibers. The nanospring or helical shape preserves much void-space in the mat. It would be a potential architecture for highly efficient anode in future MFCs...|$|E

40|$|In present work {{we discuss}} the rod made by two {{cylindrical}} surfaces under applied <b>longitudinal</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>force.</b> It has constant width, but variable thickness. We determine analytically value of the critical <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> that leads to curvature of the originally straight rod. For derivation of the critical <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> in the rods with variable cross-section one cannot use the traditional methods because of their excessive complexity. Therefore, in this work we have applied the method of flexible hinge chains, which is {{a variation of the}} finite elements method. More precisely, compressed rod is replaced with a straight elastic chain, which is composed of elastic joints, connected by completely rigid links. Equivalence of the rod and replaced elastic chain is ensured by equality of the angular stiffness at each part of the rod and corresponding elastic joint in the chain. We have noticed that {{increase in the number of}} joints in elastic chain leads to substantial complication of the analytical solution. It is shown that in case of three-, four-, five-and six-link chains, the approximate values of the forces contain the analytical part and a numerical factor. Moreover, the numerical factor under application of four-, five-and six-link differs from the three-link approximation only in the third digit after a decimal point. Thus the difference in accuracy of an elastic hinge chain with more than six joints is not significant, and latter approximation is of no use. In conclusion, presented work shows an accurate expression for dependence of the critical force, which leads to losses in stability of the rod formed by two cylindrical surfaces, on its parameters. ??????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ????? ????????, ???????????? ????? ??????????????? ?????????????. ??? ?????? ????????? ?? ?????, ? ??????? ??????????. ??? ??????? ???????????? ????? ??????? ????????? ????, ??????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????. ???????? ?????????????????? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ????, ?????????? ????? ????? ????????. ???????? ?????????, ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????, ?????????? ? ?????? ???????????? ????????, ???????????? ????? ??????????????? ?????????????, ?? ??? ??????????...|$|R

The authors apply well-known expressions to identify the stability loss by a rectilinear elastic cantilever bar that has a constant cross-section compressed by a longitudinal force at its free end, with account for the inequalities generated by the best approximation problem in the Hilbert space. They constructed two series of functionals, the bottom bounds of which are the bilateral bounds of the unknown critical value of the load parameter. The calculation of the bottom bounds is reduced to determination of the biggest eigenvalues for the matrices presented {{in the form of}} second-order matrices with elements, expressed through the integrals of well-known forms of stability loss by a bar that has a constant cross-section. The calculation of the top bound is reduced to the determination of the biggest eigenvalue for the matrix which almost coincides with the one of the block matrices constructed for the determination of the bottom bound. Bilateral bounds identified in accordance with the above method make it possible to assess the reduction of the critical load value in the first problem and to compare it to the one of the second problem.

40|$|In this study, {{comparisons}} were made among three representative methods for predicting <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> on the lumbosacral disc: LP-based model, double LP-based model and EMG-assisted model. Two subjects simulated lifting tasks that were frequently {{performed in the}} refractories industry in Korea, in which vertical distance, frontal plane horizontal distance, and weight of load were varied. To calculate the L 5 /S 1 <b>compressive</b> <b>forces,</b> EMG signals from six trunk muscles were measured and postural data were recorded using the Motion Analysis System. The EMG-assisted model was shown to reflect well all three factors considered here. On the other hand, the <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> of the two LP-based models were significantly affected only by weight of load. Furthermore, relatively low correlation was observed between the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> of the EMG-assisted model and the 1991 NIOSH lifting index(LI), while highly positive correlation was observed between that of the two LP-based models and LI...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} modelling techniques with {{finite element}} method (FEM) for a composite beam subjected to combined negative bending and axial <b>compressive</b> <b>forces.</b> Flexural behaviours of composite beam were thoroughly analysed to determine the ultimate limit state due to vertical and axial <b>compressive</b> <b>forces.</b> Failure state of composite beam was revealed by the level of axial <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> and reduced negative moment due to axial <b>compressive</b> <b>forces.</b> The results obtained from FEM analysis were compared {{with the results of}} experimental analysis. Reliability agreement has been observed between the results of FEM and experimental analysis on ultimate state behavior and failure modes. Detailed numerical techniques such as loading strategies in combined vertical and axial compressive directions and potential convergence problems due to complicated contacts between the material components are discussed in this paper. Finally simplified numerical techniques for uncertainties in axially compressed composite beam subjected to negative bending are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{the neural}} arch in weight {{transmission}} in the cervical and upper thoracic regions of the vertebral column has been investigated. Measurements at the levels of C 2, C 4, C 6, C 7, T 1 and T 5 vertebrae were made in 44 adult male vertebral columns. At each level, {{the area of the}} inferior surface of the body was compared with the area of the inferior articular facets, the pedicle index and the arch index; inclination of the pedicle in relation to the body was also measured. On the basis of these studies it was found that at C 2 level the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> acting on the superior articular surfaces was transmitted to the inferior surface of the body and to the two inferior articular facets. From C 2 to C 7, <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> is transmitted through three parallel columns - one anterior, formed by the bodies and intervertebral discs, and two posterior, formed by the articulations of the articular processes on either side. Due to the posterior curvature in the cervical region, the posterior columns here sustain more of the <b>compressive</b> <b>force.</b> From C 7 level downwards, the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> is transmitted through two columns, i. e. one anterior formed by the bodies and intervertebral discs and one posterior formed by successive articulations of the laminae. Below C 7 level, <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> from the posterior column is partly transferred to the anterior column through the pedicles at T 1 and T 2. In the upper thoracic region, due to the anterior curvature, {{the main part of the}} <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> is transmitted through the anterior column, which sustains even greater <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> than is suggested by body area, with resulting increased stress...|$|R

Ten uninjured male subjects performed 4 isotonic repetitions with a 12 repetition maximal weight for each exercise. Tib-iofemoral forces were calculated using electromyo-graphic, kinematic, and kinetic data. During the squat, the maximal <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> was 6139 &plusmn; 1708 N, occurring at 91 &deg; of knee flexion; whereas the maximal <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> for the knee extension exercise was 4598 &plusmn; 2546 N (at 90 &deg; knee flexion).

40|$|UnrestrictedAnterior {{cruciate}} ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is often performed {{to reproduce the}} function of the original ligament and restore functional stability of the knee joint following ACL injury. Despite substantial improvements in surgical techniques and satisfactory outcomes, individuals who have undergone ACLR have been shown to have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis (OA) at the knee. To date, the underlying mechanism(s) for the high risk of knee OA in individuals post-ACLR are not fully understood. The primary objectives of this dissertation were to develop a subject-specific EMG-driven model to examine whether females with ACLR demonstrate greater tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> when compared to healthy females, and to examine whether muscle co-contraction and tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> in females who have undergone ACLR can be reduced when trained to utilize a landing strategy that emphasizes greater hip and knee flexion. Chapter III describes the development of an imaging-based subject-specific EMG-driven knee model to quantify the joint forces at the tibiofemoral joint. Using this model, the purpose of Chapter IV was to determine whether females who have undergone ACLR demonstrate greater tibiofemoral compression when compared to healthy females. Results revealed that females who have undergone ACLR exhibit greater peak tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> when compared to healthy controls. The increased tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> observed in ACLR subjects was accompanied by increased muscle co-contraction and decreased knee flexion during landing. The purpose of Chapter V was to examine whether utilization of a landing strategy that emphasizes greater hip and knee flexion can decrease tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> in the ACLR population. Consistent with the proposed hypotheses, a decrease in peak tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> was observed when female individuals post-ACLR were trained to land with greater hip and knee flexion.; The decreased tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> was accompanied by decreased muscle co-contraction at the knee. Overall, the findings of this dissertation support the premise that individuals with ACLR exhibit elevated tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>force,</b> which may contribute to the high risk of knee OA in this population. The findings of this dissertation also indicate that muscle co-contraction as well as elevated tibiofemoral <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> observed in individuals who have undergone ACLR can be reduced by utilizing a landing strategy that encourages greater hip and knee flexion. Interventions aimed at correcting abnormal neuromuscular strategies following ACLR should be emphasized in an effort to minimize the loading at the tibiofemoral joint...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the response of human periodontal ligament (hPDL) fibroblasts to an intermittent <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> and its effect on the expression of SOST, POSTN, and TGFB 1. A computerized cell <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> loading apparatus was introduced, and hPDL cells were subjected to intermittent <b>compressive</b> <b>force.</b> The changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were monitored by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. An increased expression of SOST, POSTN, and TGFB 1 was observed in a time-dependent fashion. Addition of cycloheximide, a transforming growth factor (TGF) -β inhibitor (SB 431542), or a neutralizing antibody against TGF-β 1 attenuated the force-induced expression of SOST and POSTN as well as sclerostin and periostin, indicating a role of TGF-β 1 in the pressure-induced expression of these proteins. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis revealed an increased level of TGF-β 1 in the cell extracts but not in the medium, suggesting that intermittent <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> promoted the accumulation of TGF-β 1 in the cells or their surrounding matrix. In conclusion, an intermittent <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> regulates SOST/POSTN expression by hPDL cells via the TGF-β 1 signaling pathway. Since these proteins play important roles in the homeostasis of the periodontal tissue, our results indicate the importance of masticatory forces in this process...|$|R
