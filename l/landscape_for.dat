5|$|The {{album was}} a {{critical}} and commercial success, particularly in Europe, unusually so for a hip hop album at that time. Bumrush the Show had been recorded {{on the heels of}} Run-D.M.C.'s Raising Hell, but was held back by Def Jam {{in order for them to}} concentrate on releasing and promoting the Beastie Boys' License to Ill. Chuck D of Public Enemy felt that by the time their first record was released, BDP and Rakim had already changed the <b>landscape</b> <b>for</b> how an MC could rap. Public Enemy were already recording their second album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (Def Jam, 1988) when Bumrush hit stores.|$|E
5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert <b>landscape</b> <b>for</b> the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E

25|$|Of {{particular}} {{importance to the}} development of the genre was that the Gothic writers used novelistic techniques and love, such as Defoe was using, rather than the literary style of the romance, and also began to use the <b>landscape</b> <b>for</b> purposes of expressing the characters' moods.|$|E

25|$|The {{third and}} the last {{campaign}} by Algirdas was organized in summer 1372. This time Dmitry Donskoy marched with his army to meet the invaders and the Lithuanian Army was stopped near Lyubutsk, a fort on the Oka River northeast of Tula. Lithuanian vanguard troops were defeated and had to retreat. The two armies were separated by a steep ravine which was not suitable <b>landscape</b> <b>for</b> combat. After a period of standoff, the Treaty of Lyubutsk was concluded. Algirdas agreed to abandon the plans of promoting Mikhail thus ending Lithuania's assistance to Tver.|$|E
25|$|The town is {{situated}} in an area {{with an abundance of}} archaeological monuments dating from the Neolithic period onwards, of which the large Passage Tombs of Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth are probably the best known. The remarkable density of archaeological sites of the prehistoric and Early Christian periods uncovered in recent years in the course of development, notably during construction of the Northern Motorway: Gormanston to Monasterboice, or 'Drogheda Bypass', have shown that the hinterland of Drogheda has been a settled <b>landscape</b> <b>for</b> millennia.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, the Dunsmuirs {{engaged the}} American {{landscape}} architects Franklin Brett and George D. Hall of Boston, students of Frederick Law Olmsted, {{to develop a}} <b>landscape</b> <b>for</b> the entire site. They prepared a classic design for an Edwardian park that included the overall layout for the entire property. The plan organized the estate into four distinct landscape zones, progressing {{from a series of}} nine formal 'garden rooms' near Hatley Castle, to recreational spaces, then to agricultural lands, and finally to the forest surrounding the estate.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, seven {{families}} {{formed the}} Big Sur Land Trust. They envisioned preserving the iconic Big Sur <b>landscape</b> <b>for</b> {{the benefit of}} future generations. The founding members were Zad Leavy, an experienced attorney and his wife Laela; Sherna and Kipp Stewart; Roger and Beverly Newell; Nancy Hopkins; Lloyd and Pat Addleman; Martin and Suzanne Forster; and Peter Harding. Hopkins, daughter-in-law of Hewlett Packard founder David Packard, became the trust's first president. Attorney Zad Leavy became its first executive director and served for 25 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 the Bank of Canada {{introduced}} {{new banknotes}} called the Birds of Canada Series. The design {{on the back}} of each note features a bird indigenous to Canada with a background representing the typical <b>landscape</b> <b>for</b> that bird. The portraits {{on the front of the}} note were made larger than those of previous series, and a metallic patch was introduced on the larger notes. Each banknote weighs 1 gram. This series was the first to include a bar code with the serial number. This allows the visually impaired to distinguish notes with the use of a hand-held device that tells the note's denomination.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the Kobuk River in {{its middle}} and lower reaches is an anastomizing stream, with several braided {{channels}} in places, wide migrating meander bends, and oxbow lakes. It {{is controlled by}} yearly cycles of freeze and thaw, much like its surrounding <b>landscape.</b> <b>For</b> {{six months of the}} year, the river is largely still, frozen on top by a thick layer of ice. In the spring, warmer temperatures cause this ice to begin to melt. But the resulting process is not gradual. Rather, the pressure of melting ice from upstream builds up upon ice “dams” in the river’s channel, eventually causing an “ice break-up” event, in which a flood of ice and water moves powerfully downstream.|$|E
