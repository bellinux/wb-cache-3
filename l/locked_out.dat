5|$|Despite briefly being <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> of Boothferry Park by bailiffs {{and facing}} the {{possibility}} of liquidation, Hull qualified for the Third Division play-offs in the 2000–01 season, losing in the semi-finals to Leyton Orient. A boardroom takeover by former Leeds United commercial director Adam Pearson had eased the club's precarious financial situation and all fears of closure were banished.|$|E
5|$|Susan's accident-proneness is {{commonly}} used throughout the series to provide comic relief. Her susceptibility to bad luck and embarrassing situations have created some of the series' most memorable moments, including accidentally burning down Edie's house and being <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> of her own house completely naked. Susan's poor cooking skills have also become a running gag in the series.|$|E
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> by the time limit.|$|E

As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally <b>locked</b> <b>out.</b> He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's {{inspiration}} for his holiday empire {{had come from}} a holiday to Barry Island in his twenties, when he had been <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> of his B all day by his landlady. He finally decided to build the last and smallest of the camps there in 1965. Butlin took out a 99-year lease on the headland at Nell's Point, Barry Island, in 1966. Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E

Smith’s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E
5|$|Matthew died in 1973, {{sparking}} {{an internal}} conflict over who would succeed him {{as head of}} the Harlem congregation. Shortly before his death, Matthew named his grandson, David Matthew Doré, as the new spiritual leader. Doré was 16 years old at the time. In 1975, the synagogue's board elected Rabbi Willie White to be its leader. Rabbi Doré occasionally conducted services at the synagogue until the early 1980s, when White had Doré and some other members <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> of the building. Membership declined throughout the 1990s and by 2004, only a few dozen people belonged to the synagogue. In 2007 the Commandment Keepers sold the building, while various factions among former members sued one another.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1946, the club's {{home was}} the scene of the Burnden Park disaster, which at the time was the worst tragedy in British {{football}} history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an FA Cup quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and Stoke City. There was an estimated 67,000-strong crowd crammed in for the game, though other estimates vary widely, with a further 15,000 <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> as it became clear the stadium was full. The disaster led to Moelwyn Hughes's official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had come under attack from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines.|$|E
5|$|This concern {{led to an}} {{independent}} review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered {{for the simple reason}} that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.|$|E
5|$|At {{one meeting}} in October 1853, he shared the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were <b>locked</b> <b>out.</b> Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E

Seconds later Simon returns, telling Rachel he has turned down the Hong Kong job. After getting <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> the house, Karen interrupts a seminar David is holding, demanding they get a nanny. He relents, embarrassed after being shown {{up in front of}} his colleagues. Determined to get Rachel back, Adam goes to Simon's flat, where he serenades her wearing nothing but a rose between his buttocks. Jenny and Pete arrive to find Simon chasing a naked Adam down the street. The fight is interrupted by a passing policeman, who lists multiple felonies Adam has committed, until Rachel steps forward and takes the blame for what has happened. She declares her love to Adam and the two leave. Pete and Jenny watch and she tells him her last pregnancy test was positive.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Berkman, Goldman, and Aronstam {{relocated}} to Worcester, Massachusetts, where they operated a successful luncheonette. At {{the end of}} June, Goldman saw a newspaper headline that brought to her attention the trio's first opportunity for political action: the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, workers at a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania were <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> when negotiations between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers failed. Henry Clay Frick, the factory's notoriously anti-union manager, hired 300 armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union's picket lines. When the Pinkerton guards arrived at the factory {{on the morning of}} July6, a gunfight broke out. Nine union workers and seven guards were killed in the 12-hour fight.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{political}} moments that brought Berkman and Goldman together was the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania owned by Andrew Carnegie {{became the focus of}} national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> the workers, who immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton guards to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.|$|E

5|$|STAC {{suggested}} that two designs naturally {{fell out of}} their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan {{suggested that}} a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962. Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.|$|E

Three months later, Sweden defeated the Czech Republic and won the 2006 World Championships. They became the first team to win Olympic gold and a separate World Championship tournament in the same year. At the 2007 World Championship in Moscow, Canada defeated Finland to win the gold medal. The following year, the tournament was held in Canada for the first time. Russia defeated the home team to win their first gold medal since 1993.

Every other driver was limited to only one timed lap and in the end, the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> the second row on the grid ahead of Max Verstappen and Felipe Massa. Sainz and Ricciardo rounded up the top eight on the grid. Therefore, Q3 saw little running with the final positions determined very early on and drivers exiting their cars five minutes before the end of qualifying.|$|E
