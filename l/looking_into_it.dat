500|$|On June 18, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno {{asked the}} FBI {{to look into}} it; FBI Director Louis Freeh {{acknowledged}} that both the FBI and especially the White House had committed [...] "egregious violations of privacy" [...] (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was {{a conflict of interest}} for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In any case, Starr had already begun <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|In a May 8, 2008 {{appearance}} on CNN, Church of Scientology spokesman Thomas W. Davis said that Scientology was [...] "dealing with ninety-six death threats, bomb threats, acts of violence, vandalism" [...] {{from the group}} Anonymous. CNN's John Roberts responded, stating that the Federal Bureau of Investigation found nothing connecting Anonymous to the Church of Scientology's accusations of violence: [...] "You are leveling these accusations at this group, the F.B.I., which is <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> says it has found nothing to connect this group Anonymous with what you're talking about, or death threats against members of the church, the F.B.I. at this point says - it {{has no reason to}} believe that charges would be leveled against this group." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{rough cut}} of the premiere was leaked onto the {{internet}} {{three weeks before the}} scheduled series premiere. This attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans, and caused interest in the show to skyrocket. The BBC released a statement that the source of the leak appears to be connected to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which responded by stating that they [...] "are <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> That's all I can say at this point because we don't know exactly what happened. It certainly wasn't done intentionally." [...] Asa Bailey, founder of the Viral Advertising Association, said that the BBC hired them for viral marketing strategies, and that he told them [...] "they should release things before their time", to create a [...] "cool factor". Both the BBC and CBC denied any involvement, but Bailey believes that to be disingenuous, saying that it is [...] "the best viral advert they could have done". The leak was ultimately traced to a third party company in Canada which had a legitimate preview copy. The employee responsible was fired by the company.|$|E
500|$|Around 6:30 pm on {{the evening}} of Friday, December 26, 1873, the three-story Orange Hotel station depot caught fire. Some staff of the re-christened Erie Railroad were {{examining}} a room in the roof of the building, and upon <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> found it engulfed in smoke. The fire quickly spread, consuming the entire story. There was a lull, but the building re-ignited as flames continued through the building. The Mansard roof on top of the building was destroyed by the flames. No fire-ridding materials to douse the blaze were available to staff and no one could get near the building to inspect where the flames were. The flames finally destroyed the entire building, and just two hours after the fire was discovered, the walls began to collapse on the structure. Within a half-hour, the entire hotel/depot had collapsed and was a pile of brick ruins. Train service on the Erie main line was disrupted for several hours due to the fire and station depot collapse. A later study determined the station depot burned down due to a defective flue.|$|E
500|$|Not My Life {{begins with}} a black screen on which the words [...] "Human {{trafficking}} is slavery" [...] appear in white. A sequence filmed in Ghana follows, showing children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day. Many of the children die {{as a result of}} the working conditions. A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a fishing net. Next, Senegalese talibes, Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten. Many of these children suffer from skin and stomach diseases because of their diet of spoiled foodâ€”one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally sorting through hazardous waste in Ghazipur and New Delhi landfills. Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes. The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking [...] "are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet's youth." ...|$|E

The sisters probed further, and asked Police if they knew who Jack's male companion was, but Police did not know and were not <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Jen described the Police's attitude as 'shocking' and she was taken aback at how little the Police seemed to care about finding the man Jack was with.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2013 Paris Air Show, Kaman {{promoted}} the unmanned K-MAX to foreign buyers. Several countries reportedly {{expressed interest in}} the system. The K-MAX supporting Marines in Afghanistan was planned to remain in use there until at least August 2014.

2500|$|After Maria's baby is {{declared}} dead, Erica {{finds the}} little girl and tries to return her to Maria. When she gets to Wildwind, she overhears Maria and Dimitri discussing the baby and deciding the baby's death was for the best. Hearing this, Erica decides to pass the baby off as a child she adopts from Russia. Erica names the baby Sonya Kane. Dimitri sees this as another {{chance to have a}} family with Erica and wants to be a father to Sonya. Erica refuses to let him be a part of either of their lives. This makes Dimitri so angry he begins checking into Sonya's adoption. Tad Martin and Gloria Marsh are also <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Losing Erica leads Dimitri to do very cruel things such as conning mentally challenged Stuart Chandler out of his television station, WRCW, in an attempt to get back at Erica for leaving him. She has a television show, the Cutting Edge, on that station. He also [...] "kidnaps" [...] and romantically pursues a very taken Gloria Marsh. While in a rage he accidentally hits Erica and baby Sonya with his car. Sonya is taken to the hospital where Maria gives her a check up and feels a connection with her. Eventually, Erica returns Sonya to Maria and is sent to prison for kidnapping. Maria is presumed dead not long afterward, leading to a custody battle between Dimitri and Edmund over the baby, now named Maddie Grey. Dimitri is awarded custody after a few dirty tricks such as drugging Edmund so he will look like an unfit parent. Even after Dimitri finds out he is not Maddie's father, he keeps the secret from his brother. To insure the secret does not get out, Dimitri threatens Skye and beats the lab technician who helped her switch the results. From behind bars, Erica finds out Dimitri is not Maddie's father and helps Edmund reunite with his daughter.|$|E
