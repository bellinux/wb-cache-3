5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

Between fire in open {{pastures}} and seed predation by bruchid beetles in closed-canopy forest, S. mombin does not stand a chance. But, today, in Guanacaste, seeds are dispersed by White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and some 15 other mammals, that feed mostly in forest edges, where bruchids are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the seeds and}} fires are not so frequent.|$|E
25|$|According to writer Rebecca French, Tibetans viewed {{criminal}} offenses as uncommon, {{but there}} are few records to establish frequency. However, Tibetans also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes. Because it was considered harsh by most Tibetans, they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials were also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> peaceful outcomes in a community setting than to resort to harsher government resolution.|$|E
25|$|According to Jean Chapelle, a {{professor}} of History specializing on Chadian ethnic groups, the clan system developed out of necessity. Nomadic life means being scattered throughout a region; therefore, belonging to a clan means that the individual is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> hospitable clan people in most settlements or camps of any size. A second factor is the maintenance of ties with the maternal clan. Although the maternal clan does not occupy the central place of the parental clan, it provides ties. The third factor is protective relationships at the primary residence.|$|E

25|$|Lambic {{is usually}} a blend {{of at least two}} {{different}} beers; many producers are blenders who buy beer from other brewers and blend them together to create the desired result. A gueuze may have occupied space in several different cellars over six years or more. While those outside Belgium are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> bottled gueuze and fruited versions, a wider variety of styles is available to local drinkers. Beers are often blended again or sweetened with sugar or flavoured syrups before drinking as some can be extremely tart.|$|E
25|$|Junaluska {{salamanders}} {{have only}} {{been found in the}} Blue Ridge Mountain area in the Cheoah River, Santeetlah Creek, and Tululah Creek in Graham County of North Carolina. They are also found in a limited number of creeks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Sevier County, Tennessee. These salamanders are very rarely encountered in either area. One looking for this species is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> E. junaluska in larger rocky streams in colder weather. Another popular way of spotting this species is late-night driving along roads on rainy nights. They can be seen moving between the terrestrial habitat they inhabit and the areas where they breed.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the balls}} {{have not had}} their {{discovery}} site recorded and most are found {{as a result of}} agricultural activity. Five were found at Skara Brae village and one at the Dunadd hillfort. The distribution of the balls {{is similar to that of}} mace-heads, which were both weapons and prestige objects used in ceremonial situations. The lack of context is likely to distort the interpretation. Random finds are only likely to have been picked up and entered a collection if they were aesthetically appealing. Damaged and plain balls were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a market than decorated examples so some more decorated examples might be fraudulent.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} major {{implications}} of self-schemata. First, information about oneself is processed {{faster and more}} efficiently, especially consistent information. Second, one retrieves and remembers information that is relevant to one's self-schema. Third, one will tend to resist information in the environment that is contradictory to one's self-schema. For instance, students with a particular self-schema prefer roommates whose view of them is consistent with that schema. Students who end up with roommates whose view of them is inconsistent with their self-schema are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new roommate, even if this view is positive. This {{is an example of}} self-verification.|$|R

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the number}} of {{proficient}} speakers of Occitan is dropping precipitously. A tourist in the cities in southern France is unlikely to hear a single Occitan word spoken on the street (or, for that matter, in a home), and is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> only <b>find</b> the occasional vestige, such as street signs (and, of those, most will have French equivalents more prominently displayed), to remind them of the traditional language of the area.|$|R
25|$|The {{sale and}} {{production}} of absinthe has never been prohibited in Sweden or Norway. However, the only outlet that may sell alcoholic beverages containing more than 3.5% ABV in Sweden and 4.75% ABV in Norway, is the government-owned chain of liquor stores known as Systembolaget in Sweden and Vinmonopolet in Norway. Systembolaget and Vinmonopolet did not import or sell absinthe for many years after the ban in France; however, today several absinthes are available for purchase in Systembolaget stores, including Swedish made distilled absinthe. In Norway, on the other hand, one is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> many absinthes since Norwegian alcohol law prohibits the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages above 60% abv, which eliminates most absinthes.|$|E
25|$|D {{note that}} the {{internal}} energy, , of a solution is lowered by the electrical interaction of its ions, but that this effect can't be determined by using the crystallographic approximation for distances between dissimilar atoms (the cube root of the ratio of total volume {{to the number of}} particles in the volume). This is because there is more thermal motion in a liquid solution than in a crystal. The thermal motion tends to smear out the natural lattice that would otherwise be constructed by the ions. Instead, D introduce the concept of an ionic atmosphere or cloud. Like the crystal lattice, each ion still attempts to surround itself with oppositely charged ions, but in a more free-form manner; at small distances away from positive ions, one is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> negative ions and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Complete and {{correctly}} copied texts {{would usually}} be immediately placed in use and thus usually would wear out fairly quickly, requiring repeated recopying. Further, because manuscript copying was highly costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods, a manuscript might only be made when commissioned, {{in which case}} the size of the parchment, script used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost), whether it was one book or a collection of several, etc. would be determined by the one commissioning the work. The idea of stocking extra copies would probably have been considered at best wasteful and unnecessary since the form and presentation of a manuscript were more often than not customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer. This {{is part of the reason}} why scholars are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> incomplete, and at times conflicting, segments of manuscripts than complete and largely consistent works.|$|E
30|$|A {{fundamental}} {{constraint on}} performance in any visual task is {{the information available}} at a glance. Searching for {{a person in a}} natural scene will be more difficult if we cannot detect them at a glance. Being able to at least extract target-relevant features at a glance will speed up search; otherwise, we may have to execute a number of eye movements <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the target. Our ability to quickly get the gist of a scene can also speed up search if it provides layout information, identifying <b>likely</b> locations <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a person.|$|R

25|$|There {{are other}} {{theories}} regarding this final scene, however. For example, in his 1990 {{edition of the}} play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Kurt Schlueter suggests that Valentine is indeed handing Silvia over to Proteus, but the audience {{is not supposed to}} take it literally; the incident is farcical, and should be interpreted as such. Schlueter argues that the play provides possible evidence it was written to be performed and viewed primarily by a young audience, and as such, to be staged at university theatres, as opposed to public playhouses. Such an audience would be more predisposed to accepting the farcical nature of the scene, and more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> humorous the absurdity of Valentine's gift. As such, in Schlueter's theory, the scene does represent what it appears to represent; Valentine does give Silvia to her would-be rapist, but it is done purely for comic effect.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 a {{dedicated}} search for suitable KBOs using ground telescopes {{was started by}} mission scientists. Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras, notably the twin 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes in Chile, the 8.2-meter Subaru Observatory in Hawaii, and the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope were used to search for potential targets. Through the citizen-science project, the public helped to scan telescopic images for possible suitable mission candidates by participating in the Ice Hunters project. The ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 KBOs of potential interest, {{but none of these}} were close enough to the flight path of New Horizons. Only the Hubble Space Telescope was deemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a suitable target in time for a successful KBO mission. On June 16, 2014, time on Hubble was granted. Hubble has a much greater ability to find suitable KBOs than ground telescopes. The probability that a target for New Horizons would be found was estimated beforehand at about 95%.|$|E
25|$|Stack {{analyzed}} {{the results from}} 42 studies and found that those measuring {{the effect of a}} celebrity suicide story were 14.3 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect and research based on televised stories was 82% less likely to report a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. Other scholars have been less certain about whether copycat suicides truly happen or are selectively hyped. For instance, fears of a suicide wave following the death of Kurt Cobain never materialized in an actual increase in suicides. Furthermore, there is evidence for an indirect Werther effect, i.e. the perception that suicidal media content influences others which, in turn, can concurrently or additionally influence one person's own future thoughts and behaviors. Similarly the researcher Gerard Sullivan has critiqued research on copycat suicides, suggesting that data analyses have been selective and misleading, and that the evidence for copycat suicides are much less consistent than suggested by some researchers.|$|E
50|$|In December, 2013, metal {{detector}} operator Bruce Campbell found an English coin made between 1551 and 1553 near Victoria, British Columbia. While Campbell believes the coin {{is only the}} oldest thing he's <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>find,</b> and Royal British Columbia Museum curator Grant Keddie {{did not believe the}} find can be connected to Drake, Samuel Bawlf (see below) says the coin is proof the English arrived here (Canada) first.

40|$|Systems are {{attempting}} to detect botnets by examining traffic content for IRC commands or by setting up honeynets. Our approach for detecting botnets is to examine flow characteristics such as bandwidth, duration, and packet timing looking for evidence of botnet command and control activity.

25|$|One of the {{propelling}} {{factors of}} the explosion of hip hop onto the music scene in Japan is the fashion aspect. At hip hop nightclubs, often owned and run by Africans, one would find clubbers wearing hip hop clothing typical of American youth such as oversized shirts, Tommy Hilfiger jeans and baseball caps. This macho look is even found on the women. In Tokyo you are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the latest fashions amongst the youth including burapan, the black wannabe fashion. Shibuya is a center of youth culture in Tokyo, where hip hop's growing presence can be most experienced. Here many stores offer hip hop clothing including the Bathing Ape line. Bape has been worn by Pharrell Williams and other popular hip hop artists of America. The hip hop clothing available {{in many of these}} stores can be very expensive. Hip hop fashion is now also popular in the suburbs - although some people are only following fashion trends and are not necessarily into hip hop music. Hip hop's presence can definitely be seen on the youth of Japan as they use their clothing to express themselves.|$|E
25|$|In Boston, the LRV {{situation}} {{was becoming a}} major political and public relations nightmare {{and led to the}} LRV fleet availability typically being less than 50% {{of the total number of}} cars on the property for the first few years of service. The MBTA was still accepting new cars from Boeing-Vertol, but the cars were falling out of service faster than the MBTA's maintenance staff could repair them. Additionally, the MBTA could not acquire replacement parts fast enough to repair the disabled LRVs. In a desperate effort to keep as many LRVs operating as possible, MBTA maintenance crews began cannibalizing some of the disabled cars for replacement parts. To help prevent the riding public from seeing the sheer number of brand-new, but heavily cannibalized LRVs, several of the cars were hidden around the system where the public was not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> them. A major newspaper story emerged when a reporter and a photographer managed to get into a section of the Green Line's subway which was not in use at the time and found it was full of cannibalized cars which had been abandoned in the tunnel. The MBTA had been towing the cars into the subway during the middle of the night when the subway was closed to the public. The story and photographs brought the problems with the LRV into the public eye for the first time. After the story broke, out-of-service LRVs began to appear in several storage yards which were easily viewed by the public, though this may have simply been due to the ever-increasing number of disabled cars.|$|E
500|$|Knowledge of Chekhov will {{increase}} the enjoyment of this work's in-jokes, {{but not as much}} as an understanding of Durang's absurdism, according to Theatermania.com's Brian Scott Lipton. Brantley noted that the work was suitable for any audience: [...] "Even if you’ve never read a word of Chekhov, you’re <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> plenty to make you laugh: Mr. Hyde Pierce’s skillfully low-key comic discomfort; Ms. Nielsen’s segues from manic eruption into glazed smiling stupor; Ms. Weaver’s game sendup of every self-loving, self-doubting movie queen there ever was." [...] He noted the play does not compare with some of Durang's most absurd work, calling it [...] "blander and thinner". Brantley said there was comfort in an evening of deliverance of Chekhov's [...] "lost souls", by Durang.|$|E

40|$|Silicon Valley {{continues}} to receive attention as a resilient cluster of high-tech entrepreneurship. This article {{lays out the}} essential elements of the Silicon Valley model, specifically by identifying key supporting institutions and complementarities amongst them. In the US context, the article argues that the large Chandlerian modern corporation and the Silicon Valley cluster of small start-ups are in a dialectical relationship, corresponding to different stages {{of the growth of}} firms. The article then offers a framework for analysing how the Silicon Valley model might be replicated, with or without modifications. In the case of Japan, national institutions in financial and labour markets are becoming weaker and heterogeneous, giving greater scope for hybrid forms of corporate governance to evolve.
