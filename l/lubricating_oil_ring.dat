Of the many {{factors that affect}} their long-term performance, contamination in the bearing <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> plays a major part. Of particular concern are contamination and degradation of the <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> over {{a short period of}} time. Repeated short-term contamination implies that the lubricating properties of the oil will be impaired and bearing reliability will be reduced. This paper presents an analysis of the factors affecting the short-term contamination of <b>oil</b> in <b>ring</b> <b>oil</b> <b>lubricated</b> rolling element bearings. The bearings analyzed were those used in the author?s company?s standard range of centrifugal pumps where short-term oil degradation had been reported in a number of installations.

The dehydration and purification treatment of emulsified <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> is important in prolonging the service life, recovering the usability of the oil, reducing the generation of waste oil and ensuring the safe operation of the equipment [4].
