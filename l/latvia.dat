40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature by comparing predictive accuracy of one-period real-time simple seasonal ARIMA forecasts of <b>Latvia’s</b> Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as by comparing a di-rect forecast of <b>Latvia’s</b> GDP versus three kinds of indirect forecasts. Four main results are as follows. Direct forecast of <b>Latvia’s</b> Gross Do-mestic Product (GDP) seems to yield better precision than an indirect one. 퐴푅(1) model tends to give more precise forecasts than the bench-mark moving-average models.

The International Monetary Fund suggested a devaluation of <b>Latvia's</b> currency, but the European Union objected to this, {{on the grounds}} that the majority of <b>Latvia's</b> debt was denominated in foreign currencies. Financial economist Michael Hudson has advocated for redenominating foreign currency liabilities in Latvian lats before devaluing.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{promotion}} paper is to forecast <b>Latvia's</b> current account, and using this forecast to define, whether the current account deficit is a significant risk factor for Latvian economy. The modelling of <b>Latvia's</b> current account is made by using econometric methodology, {{on the base of}} all the most important theoretical concepts of current account. Although the current account deficit is a risk factor for Latvian economy, it will not cause currency and financial crisis during the time period before <b>Latvia's</b> accession into the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The econometric models well describe <b>Latvia's</b> current account and its components. Developed current account models are suitable for macroeconomic analysis and forecasting. ...|$|R

5|$|Lithuania, <b>Latvia,</b> and Estonia, {{the three}} Baltic states, had formed the Baltic Entente in 1934. Its {{principal}} purposes were coordination of joint {{foreign policy and}} mutual international diplomatic support; {{it was not a}} military alliance. In Latvian and Estonian opinion, the Polish–Lithuanian dispute over Vilnius was outside the scope of the Entente, but they wished for a resolution, considering the conflict detrimental to the stability of the region. <b>Latvia</b> attempted to persuade Estonia to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for a speedy acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.|$|E
