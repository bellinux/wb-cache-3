The first element in the concept of <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> is producing and enhancing human capital on individual, organisational and regional level. The formation of new human capital {{plays an important role in}} innovation process, and it is also closely linked to the learning process, which can be realised through new technological and scientific innovations. The second element is the co-operation of regional actors and the diffusion of human capital and know-how in and between organisations. This can be regarded as an opportunity to gain agglomeration benefits. The third – and perhaps the most important – issue in the framework of <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> is transferring human capital and new know-how into practise. From a regional point of view this means a growing GDP, employment, better quality of services and welfare. The purpose of this paper is to form a practical description of the concept of <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> as a doctrine of regional development in the context of Structural Funds. The empirical part of the study is based on the dissection of ESF-projects of the ongoing programme period 2000 - 2006. The purpose of the dissection is to find out how ESF interventions and their measures are integrated into different {{processes of}} <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> and, in addition to this, to conceptualise the problems of the prevailing monitoring and evaluation indicators in reference to the concept of <b>learning</b> <b>region.</b> Key words: Structural Funds, evaluation, <b>learning</b> <b>region,</b> regional developmen...|$|E

In this paper, we look at critical limitations to the realization of the <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> and at potential conflicts arising from the relative power of private and public interests in determining the <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> agenda.

The starting point is awareness of the facts on the creation of Subotica region as it is at present. The healthy future of each region is provided by looking back in the past and learning from the history. The other important thing is bench marking- learning on the positive and successful experiences of other regions, and finally, making its own concept of <b>Learning</b> <b>Region</b> adapted to local surrounding and true need of local people. Some experiences, suggestions and comparisons will be made in this case study, in relation to one of the Serbian municipalities nearest t to EU neighboring countries in a territorial way. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a global}} economy and a world of {{increasing}} polarisation and unsustainable development, learning is critical to change. With most of the world&# 039;s population in cities and the region increasingly the focus of measures to improve prospects, the <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> concept integrates the conflicting, diverse and complex issues of development. This thesis examines learning in networks and further develops {{the theory of the}} <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> through a case study in Melbourne, Australia. It begins with a case study of an industry network which was part of a research project - City Regions, Intelligent Territories, Innovation Competitiveness and Learning (CRITICAL). The CRITICAL research project examined learning processes in five cities and developed theory and tools to support learning regions. In this thesis the study of the industry network became {{the first step in a}} case study of the northern metropolitan regional economic development project. The study of the region demonstrated that there existed a strategic regional approach supporting local learning and action developed through projects based on local research and collaboration. The theories of &# 039;communities of practice and &# 039;architectures of learning&# 039; (Wenger 1998) provided the conceptual framework for the case study and proved to be a novel way to discern how learning was supported. A key finding in this thesis was how learning in networks was supported and that this led to organisational change, innovation and learning across differ ent sectors and organisations. Data was analysed using a typology of the <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> developed in the CRITICAL project and the region was found to have characteristics of a <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> although without wider connectivity across the city could only be considered a sub region. The study contributes to the body of work which demonstrates that the university can play a significant role in supporting the <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> and local engagement of key organisations, enterprises and government, and in the understanding of policy and programs to develop learning regions. The findings also contribute to innovation theory particularly with regard to networks and small to medium enterprises in manufacturing. Findings support the development of frameworks for urban regional development with the partnering of different levels of government to create new ways of operating and learning in the emerging mode of local governance partnerships and highlight the need to develop ways of measuring and understanding success or failure which capture the social, economic, cultural and environmental priorities of society...|$|E

40|$|Since the Industrial Revolution the {{cyclical}} {{processes of}} {{rise and fall}} of regional economies have been accelerating. Many of the specific problems of the falling part of clustering, that is old industrial areas, are related to path dependency and lock-ins. Particularly political lock-ins hinder the necessary restructuring processes in old industrial areas. They can be considered as thick institutional tissues aiming at preserving existing industrial structures and therefore unnecessarily slowing down industrial restructuring and indirectly hampering the development of indigenous potential and creativity. Of the recently born offspring of the family of territorial innovation models, the <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> concept seems to be most focused on overcoming and avoiding political lock-ins in old industrial areas. Most scholars consider learning regions as regional 2 development concepts in which the main actors are strongly, but flexibly connected with each other and are open both to intra-regional and inter-regional learning processes. Policy-makers in learning regions are involved in learning from institutional errors made in the past and by doing that in avoiding path-dependent development. Empirical evidence shows that the <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> is of limited importance to unlock regional economies from path dependency, due to three weaknesses: its fuzziness, its normative character in its squeezed position between national innovation systems and global production networks. A less normative and more process-oriented concept is proposed in this paper, namely that of the learning cluster. key words: <b>learning</b> <b>region,</b> regional innovation policy, industrial restructuring, path dependency, lock-ins, learning cluste...|$|E

The operation of local action groups is in line with the current concept led by local community development (community led local development, CLLD), which uses elements of the LEADER method. In this method the solution of development problems comes primarily from the inside, not from the outside of the studied territory.

40|$|Cooperation {{between people}} of {{different}} nations has existed throughout Europe for centuries on an informal basis as borders have shifted and power has {{found its way into}} different hands. During the European integration process of the 1950 s, this cooperation was formalized with the creation of the Euroregions, or cross-border regions. These regions were formed to promote common interests and cooperation to counteract barriers and benefit the people residing in the area. The Czech Republic is currently a member of 13 different Euroregions either exclusively or with multiple neighboring countries: Poland (7), Austria (3), Germany (4), and Slovakia (2). Of these 13 regions, four - Silva Nortica (Czech-Austrian, 2002), Bílé-Biele Karpaty (Czech-Slovak, 2000), Silesia (Czech-Polish, 1998), and Egrensis (Czech-German, 1993) - have been chosen to further evaluate how the creation of Euroregions has facilitated regional development.

40|$|The term ‘Learning Region’ is {{commonplace in}} the lifelong {{learning}} debate. This is logical {{as they have}} been a key plank of EC policy – they are the places where lifelong learning is implemented. The EC definition is ‘A city, town or region which recognises and understands the key role of learning in the development of prosperity, stability and personal fulfillment, and mobilises all its resources creatively to develop the full human potential of all its citizens’. These resources include both people and organisations – VET, HEIs, SMEs, local authorities, schools and adult education and non-formal/informal education providers, all key stakeholders in a <b>learning</b> <b>region.</b> Limerick Declaration identified economic, social and environmental indicators distinguishing learning cities and regions. Germany is covered by more than 64 learning regions, UK and Finnish national learning city networks boast 100 + members, and the EC has itself supported projects and programmes to create learning regions, notably the R 3 L programme, TELS, LILLIPUT, INDICATORS, PALLACE, LILARA, PENR 3 L and others. All this effort has produced data, tools, indicators, reports, videos, projects, recommendations, plans, strategies and learning materials – a wealth of potentially valuable knowledge for EU regions that urgently needs to be brought together in one place and made available to them.

40|$|Learning Cities and Learning Regions are terms now {{in common}} {{use as a}} result of the growing {{importance}} of lifelong learning concepts to the economic, social and environmental future of people and places. Why ‘learning’ regions? Why not intelligent, creative, clever, smart or knowledge regions? In truth, all of these can, and some do, also exist, but we argue that this is not a semantic debate. The basis of intelligence, smartness, cleverness, creativity and knowledge is effective learning and its intelligent application in creating a better future. We can, we believe, only learn our way into the future and the same is true, in developmental terms, of cities, towns, regions and communities. What therefore is a <b>learning</b> <b>region?</b> Definitions tend to differ according to perception, situation, occupation and objective. Where the focus is on technology a <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> will emphasise the advantages of hi-tech for the development of a physical infrastructure that will assist regeneration and be useful for more efficient behaviour and learning by people and organisations. Hence the growth of ‘smart cities,’ mainly in North America. Where it is on employment, employability, organisational management and training for industry, the development of human and social capital for economic gain and competitive edge tends to predominate. Most regions concentrate on this aspect. Where the motivation is based on the use of valuable resources, it will concentrate on volunteering, active citizenship and the building of social capital. Such an approach is not well developed in many regions and the optimum balance between economic, community and personal growth is poorly understood. Where the goal is the competent use of organisational potential a <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> will mobilise all its stakeholder institutions as partners in the service of the region as a whole. Here, very little is understood or implemented. This article argues that all of these approaches and others in the fields of environment, personal and cultural growth, innovation, diversity and communication are a holistic part and parcel of <b>learning</b> <b>region</b> development. Its meaning and its characteristics will become clear as it charts the development of ideas about learning regions, particularly those that have occurred during the past 20 years. It suggests the existence of a paradigm shift at work — the age of education and training, which has served us well in the late 20 th century in satisfying the needs of a growing, upwardly mobile proportion of the population, has now given way to the era of lifelong learning, in which the means, the tools and techniques are employed to target and motivate everyone in a city, town or region. Those regions that achieve this nirvana will be the winners in the apparent paradox that intelligent local action leads to success in a globalised world, a version of the concept of ‘glocalisation’ coined by Robertson (1995). </p...|$|E
