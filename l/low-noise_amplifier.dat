This excitation is commonly realized by using a balun interfacing the balanced antenna to single-ended amplifiers. However, practical designs of such passive networks are often bulky and lead to power dissipation losses. Power dissipation reduces the antenna radiation efficiency and increases the system thermal noise temperature. Another limiting factor is that the ultra wideband balun design restricts the reference impedance for the optimum noise matching between the antennas and <b>low-noise</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (LNAs). To obviate these disadvantages, differential <b>low-noise</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (dLNA), which can be directly integrated at the antenna terminals, represent an interesting alternative solution...|$|R

Designers minimize noise by considering trade-offs that include impedance matching, choosing the amplifier technology (such as low-noise components) and selecting low-noise biasing conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} radio {{astronomy}} continues to provide fundamental {{contributions to the}} understanding of the evolution, and inner workings of, our universe. It has done so from its humble beginnings, where single antennas and receivers were used for observation, to today's focal plane arrays and interferometers. The number of receiving elements (pixels) in these instruments is quickly growing, currently approaching one hundred. For the instruments of tomorrow, the number of receiving elements will be in the thousands. Such instruments will enable researchers to peer deeper into the fabric of our universe and do so at faster survey speeds. They will provide enormous capability, both for unraveling today's mysteries as well as for the discovery of new phenomena. Among other challenges, producing the large numbers of <b>low-noise</b> <b>amplifiers</b> required for these instruments will be no easy task.
