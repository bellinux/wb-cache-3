50|$|<b>Lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{compares the}} amount of light {{produced}} from a light source or from a luminaire when it is brand new to {{the amount of}} light output at a specific time in the future. For instance, if a luminaire produced 1,000 lumens of light when it was brand new and now produces 700 lumens of light after 30,000 hours, then it would have <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> of 70% at 30,000 hours. Useful lifetime estimates for LED lighting products are typically given in terms of the expected operating hours until light output has diminished to 70% of initial levels (denoted L70 life).|$|E
40|$|Most glandular tissues {{comprise}} polarized {{epithelial cells}} organized around a single central lumen. Although there is active research investigating the molecular networks {{involved in the}} regulation of lumenogenesis, {{little is known about}} the extracellular factors that influence <b>lumen</b> formation and <b>maintenance.</b> Using a three-dimensional culture system of epithelial endometrial cells, we have revealed a new role for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha and IL 1 alpha in the formation and, more importantly, maintenance of a single central lumen. We also studied the mechanism by which glucocorticoids repress TNF alpha and IL 1 alpha expression. Interestingly, regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and subsequent lumen formation is mediated by estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) but not by the glucocorticoid receptor. Finally, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of lumen formation by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our results demonstrate that activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, but not the PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway, is important for the formation and maintenance of a single central lumen. In summary, our results suggest a novel role for ER alpha-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in <b>lumen</b> formation and <b>maintenance.</b> Supported by grants from Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias (FIS) [grant numbers FISPI 10 / 00604, FISPI 070304, FISPI 070276]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [grant numbers SAF 2002 - 10529 -E, SAF 2004 - 05250]; National Cancer Institute [grant number CA 90400]; Marato de TV 3 2005 - 47 (Fundacio la Marato de TV 3), RD 06 / 0020 / 1034 and RD 06 / 0020 / 0013 (Red Tematica de Investigacion Cooperativa en Cancer), 2009 SGR 794 (Grups Consolidats de Recerca) and 2004 XT 00090 (Xarxa Tematica); AECC, Catalunya contra el cancer and programa de intensificacion de la investigacion; and Instituto Carlos III.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} in flux {{and efficiency of}} Light Emitting Diodes (LED) {{has resulted in a}} flooding of the lighting market with Solid State Lighting (SSL) products. Many traditional light sources can advantageously be replaced by SSL products. There are, however, large variations in the quality of these products, and some are not better than the ones they are supposed to replace. A lack of quality demands and standards makes it difficult for consumers to get an overview of the SSL products. Here the results of a two year study investigating SSL products on the Danish market are presented. Focus has been on SSL products for replacement of incandescent lamps and halogen spotlights. The warm white light and good color rendering properties of these traditional light sources are a must for lighting in Denmark and the Nordic countries. 266 SSL replacement lamps have been tested for efficiency and light quality with respect to correlated color temperature and color rendering properties. This shows a trade-off between high color rendering warm white light and energy efficiency. The <b>lumen</b> and color <b>maintenance</b> over time has been investigated and results for products running over 11000 h will be presented. A new internet based SSL product selection tool will be shown.

40|$|<b>Lumen</b> {{formation}} and <b>maintenance</b> {{are important for}} the development and function of essential organs such as the lung, kidney and vasculature. In the Drosophila embryonic trachea, lumena form de novo to connect the different tracheal branches into an interconnected network of tubes. Here, we identify a novel role for the receptor type guanylyl cyclase at 76 C (Gyc 76 C) in de novo lumen formation in the Drosophila trachea. We show that in embryos mutant for gyc 76 C or its downsteam effector protein kinase G (PKG) 1, tracheal lumena are disconnected. Dorsal trunk (DT) cells of gyc 76 C mutant embryos migrate to contact each other and complete the initial steps of lumen formation, such as the accumulation of E-cadherin (E-cad) and formation of an actin track {{at the site of}} lumen formation. However, the actin track and E-cad contact site of gyc 76 C mutant embryos did not mature to become a new lumen and DT lumena did not fuse. We also observed failure of the luminal protein Vermiform to be secreted into the site of new lumen formation in gyc 76 C mutant trachea. These DT lumen formation defects were accompanied by altered localization of the Arf-like 3 GTPase (Arl 3), a known regulator of vesicle-vesicle and vesicle-membrane fusion. In addition to the DT lumen defect, lumena of gyc 76 C mutant terminal cells were shorter compared to wild-type cells. These studies show that Gyc 76 C and downstream PKG-dependent signaling regulate de novo lumen formation in the tracheal DT and terminal cells, most likely by affecting Arl 3 -mediated luminal secretion...|$|R
40|$|Lumen {{degradation}} is {{a common}} failure mode in LED light sources. <b>Lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> life, defined as {{the time when the}} maintained percentages of the initial light output fall below a failure threshold, is a key characteristic for assessing the reliability of LED light sources. Owing to the long lifetime and high reliability of LED lights sources, it is challenging to estimate the <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> life for LED light sources using traditional life testing that records failure data. This paper describes a particle filter-based (PF-based) prognostic approach based on both Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Bayesian techniques to predict the <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> life of LED light sources. The <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> degradation data collected from an accelerated degradation test was used to demonstrate the prediction algorithm and methodology of the proposed PF approach. Its feasibility and prediction accuracy were then validated and compared with the TM- 21 standard method that was created by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). Finally, a robustness study was also conducted to analyze the initialization of parameters impacting the prediction accuracy and the uncertainties of the proposed PF method. The results show that, compared to the TM- 21 method, the PF approach achieves better prediction performance, with an error of less than 5 % in predicting the long-term <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> life of LED light sources.

40|$|Abstract—High-pressure mercury (HPM) lamps use a {{phosphor}} {{on their}} outer envelope {{for the sake}} of improvement of efficacy and color rendition. Although this is basically a rare earth phosphor, if its composition is changed in part, the <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> ratio of the lamp is improved by about 5 % for 8000 hours of lighting. Factors in the <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> ratio are not the phosphor alone, but the influence of variation in amount on lamp characteristics have not been reported so far. In the current study, we attempted to determine the influence of these phosphors on various characteristics of a standard 400 W lamp. With regard to <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> ratio of a lamp designed for about twice the life, the phosphor involved is identified as one of the components, and the optimum amount of change is verified from the practical application viewpoint. Results obtained indicate that an improvement of as much as about 20 % is feasible. This provides a new finding useful for energy saving and reliability improvement.

40|$|Synthetic small {{diameter}} vascular grafts fail clinically due to thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia. The attachment of endothelial cells (ECs) {{onto the}} inner lumen of synthetic small diameter vascular grafts can improve graft patency; however, significant challenges remain that prevent wide clinical adoption. These issues include {{difficulties in the}} autologous sourcing of ECs, the lack of attachment, growth and retention of the layer of ECs to the graft <b>lumen,</b> and the <b>maintenance</b> of an anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory profile by the layer of ECs. This dissertation describes the isolation, characterization, and use of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to improve the performance of small diameter vascular grafts. First, EPC isolation efficiency and expression of critical EC markers was compared between young healthy volunteers and patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). EPCs were isolated and expanded from patients with CAD and had a similar phenotype to EPCs isolated from healthy donors, and a control population of human aortic ECs. Second, we assessed the ability to enhance the anti-thrombotic activity of patient derived EPCs through the over expression of thrombomodulin (TM). In vitro testing showed TM-transfected EPCs had significantly increased production of key anti-thrombotic molecules, reduced platelet adhesion, and extended clotting times over untransfected EPCs. Finally, native and TM-transfected EPCs were seeded onto small diameter vascular grafts and tested {{for their ability to}} improve graft performance. EPCs sodded onto the lumen of small diameter ePTFE vascular grafts had strong adhesion and remained adherent during graft clamping and exposure to flow. TM-transfected EPCs improved graft anti-thrombotic performance significantly over bare grafts and grafts seeded with native EPCs. Based on these promising in vitro results, grafts were implanted bilaterally into the femoral arteries of athymic rats. Bare grafts and grafts with air removed clotted and had only 25 % patency at 7 days. In contrast, graft sodded with native EPCs or TM-transfected EPCs had 87 % and 89 % respective patency rates. High patency rates continued with 28 day implant testing with EPC sodded grafts (88 % Native; 75 % TM). There {{were no significant differences in}} patency rates at 7 or 28 days between native and TM-transfected grafts. These in vivo data suggest patient blood-derived EPCs can be used to improve the performance of small diameter vascular grafts. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|High-power white {{light-emitting}} diodes (HPWLEDs) have {{attracted much attention}} in the lighting market. However, {{as one of the}} highly reliable electronic products which may be not likely to fail under the traditional life test or even accelerated life test, HPWLED's lifetime is difficult to estimate by using traditional reliability assessment techniques.

40|$|High power {{white light}} {{emitting}} diodes (HPWLEDs), with advantages in terms of luminous efficacy, energy saving, and reliability, have become a popular alternative to conventional luminaires as white light sources. Like other new electronic products, HPWLEDs must also undergo qualification testing before being released to the market. However, most traditional qualification tests, which require all devices under testing to fail, are time-consuming and expensive. Nowadays, as recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES, IES-TM- 21 - 11), many LED manufacturers use a projecting approach based on short-term collected light output data {{to predict the future}} <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> (or lumen lifetime) of LEDs.

[...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Resources Engineering, 2011 Two {{low-cost}} {{test methods}} {{for measuring the}} <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> of off-grid lighting products, a box-photometer and a tube-photometer, were compared to a high-accuracy integrating sphere system in order to evaluate the measurement error of the low-cost testing devices. Results from {{this study indicate that}} the box- and tube-photometers can be used to accurately measure the relative change in light output of typical off-grid lighting products. The tube and box are simple and inexpensive to construct, and they are quicker and easier to use than an integrating sphere system. The box-photometer and tube-photometer are recommended for use in testing off-grid lighting products according to the Long-Term Lumen Degradation Test specified in Lighting Africa???s Quality Test Method and Initial Screening Method. The box???s strengths lie in its versatility and ease-of-use. The box-photometer can be used for testing product run-time and <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and a single measurement can be conducted {{in a matter of seconds}} by a minimally trained technician. The tube- photometer, while nearly as easy to use as the box, excels in terms of constructability, cost, and physical size. A tube-photometer can be built of basic materials that are widely available at very low cost. No specialized tools or skills are necessary to build the device. The tube-photometer is small, light and portable, allowing for easy storage and minimal space for operation. Results from this study indicate that a small degree of measurement error can result from improper use of the low-cost devices. Box-photometer measurements are susceptible to error caused by changes in the light source location and orientation, especially for highly directional and adjustable products. The tube-photometer is prone to small errors due to false identification of the maximum illuminance measurement. These errors, however, can be easily minimized by repetition of measurements and training test operators to use the equipment properly...|$|E

After it was confirmed the LED products were not equivalent to HPS in terms of initial photopic illumination, the following parameters were scaled proportionally to enable equitable (albeit hypothetical) comparisons: light output, input wattage, and pricing. Four replacement scenarios were considered for each LED product, incorporating new IES guidance for mesopic multipliers and <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> extrapolation, but life cycle analysis indicated cost effectiveness was also unacceptable.

40|$|Phosphor-converted white {{light-emitting}} diodes (pc-white LEDs) utilize a blue LED chip converted by the phosphor to obtain white light emission. Pc-white LEDs have {{become one of}} the most popular white LEDs. The reliability concerns of pc-white LEDs involve both <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> and chromaticity state. However, previous research on the health of LEDs has not taken chromaticity state shift into consideration. Therefore, this paper investigates the chromaticity state shift of pc-white LEDs during an aging test using a data-driven prognostic approach. The chromaticity coordinates (u', v') in the CIE 1976 color space are used to define the states of chromaticity. The Euclidean distance measures between two different chromaticity states represent the chromaticity state shift of LED after aging. A nonlinear dual-exponential model is selected to describe the chromaticity state shift process. Usually, the LED industry used an extrapolating approach to project future states of LED lighting sources, which relies on the nonlinear least square method to fit the obtained data and extrapolates the fitting curve to get the future state. In this paper, a recursive nonlinear filter (an unscented Kalman filter) is used to track the future chromaticity state. The result shows that the unscented Kalman filter approach can improve the prognostic accuracy more compared with the conventional extrapolating approach.

40|$|Light-emitting diode (LED) based lights used {{in safety}} {{critical}} applications need continuous monitoring of their light output since lumen degradation {{is one of}} many failure modes. Airport ground lighting is one such application where LED lights are replacing traditional halogen lamp-based lights in the approach, runways, and taxiways. The question that still remains to be addressed is the prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of LED light any time during the service life cycle of the light. Life prediction methods based on reliability analysis and filtering algorithms proposed in the past were predominantly based on accelerated life tests and cannot be readily implemented for on-board diagnosis. Here, we present a model-based prognostic approach that uses particle filtering (PF) to predict the RUL for high power white LEDs that can be readily implemented on-board the lighting system. <b>Lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> data at different test conditions are used in the PF method to calculate the L- 70, i. e., time at which lumen output reaches 70 % of the initial value.

In order to determine the robustness of this continuously growing class of lighting devices we arranged an experiment of accelerated aging: the four groups of LEDs (from different manufacturers) were submitted to a series of stress tests in environmental chambers with set-point temperatures ranging from 45 °C to 105 °C, in accordance to the IES LM- 80 - 08 <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> measurement standard. The experimental data gathered all along the 4000 h of stress accumulated up to now suggest the presence of multiple degradation mechanisms that may limit the useful lifespan of the light-emitting diodes under test. In particular we observed the following phenomena: i) a decay of the luminous flux; ii) an increase in the reverse and forward leakage current; iii) the worsening of the chromatic properties of the emitted light; and iv) the presence of a thermally activated degradation mechanism.

40|$|The Program for the Evaluation and Analysis of Residential Lighting (PEARL) is a {{watchdog}} program. It {{was created in}} response to complaints received by utility program managers about the performance of certain Energy Star lighting products being promoted within their service territories {{and the lack of}} a self-policing mechanism within the lighting industry that would ensure the reliability of these products and their compliance with ENERGY STAR specifications. To remedy these problems, PEARL purchases and tests products that are available to the consumers in the marketplace. The Lighting Research Center (LRC) tests the selected products against the corresponding Energy Star specifications. This final report summarizes the experimental procedure and results of all cycles (Cycles 1 through 8) of PEARL program from the beginning of year 2000 to the end of 2007, along with the description of apparatus used, equipment calibration process, experimental methodology, and research findings from the testing. In each cycle of PEARL program, PEARL Board selects a list of Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) and Residential Lighting Fixture (RLF) models that are Energy Star qualified. In Cycle 5, Cycle 7, and Cycle 8, no fixture models were selected. After that PEARL sponsors procure product samples for each selected model from different stores and locations in the retail market and send them to LRC for testing. LRC then receive and select the samples, and test them against Energy Star specifications. After the testing LRC analyze and report the results to PEARL Board. Totally 185 models of CFL and 52 models of RLF were tested in PEARL program. Along with the evolution of the Energy Star specifications from year 2000 to 2003, parameters that were required by Energy Star changed during the eight years of PEARL program. The testing parameters and number of samples tested in PEARL program also changed during this time. For example, in Cycle 1, three samples of each models were tested for their photometric and electrical parameters only; in Cycle 2, 1000 -hour <b>Lumen</b> <b>Maintenance</b> and the Rapid Cycle Stress Test was added and an additional set of six samples of each models were tested for Rapid Cycle Stress Test.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the performance of commercially available high-brightness light emitting diodes (HBLEDs). Three different families of white HBLEDs from three different manufacturers are considered. The main issues taken into account and reported in detail are the following: quality of the emitted light, impact of the driving strategy on the expected device lifetime, thermal management and related aging effects. The execution {{of a large number of}} accelerated stress tests reveals the weaknesses of the technology with respect to thermal degradation and the sensitivity of the device performance degradation to the adopted driving strategy. Furthermore, square-wave driving has been compared to conventional dc driving in terms of device performance and reliability. Comparison has been carried out for the same average current value of the driving waveforms. It has been found that square-wave driving can be an effective alternative to dc driving in terms of device efficiency only for high duty cycles. For low duty cycles, worse performance was detected due to the saturation of efficiency at high peak current evels. Reliability tests did not univocally indicate whether the use of pulsed bias can be more convenient than dc driving in terms of <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The three families of devices submitted to dc and pulsed stresses showed different behaviors, indicating that stress kinetics strongly depends on the LED technological structure and package thermal design...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis: To date, {{consideration}} for parametric failure of LED products {{has largely been}} focused on <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance.</b> However, color shift is a cause of early failure for some products, and is especially important to consider in certain applications, like museums, where visual appearance is critical. Example data collected by the GATEWAY program for LED lamps installed in museums shows that many have changed color beyond a reasonable tolerance well before their rated lifetime was reached, necessitating replacement. Similar data collected by the CALiPER program between 2008 and 2010 reveals that many early products shifted beyond acceptable tolerances {{in as little as}} a few thousand hours. In contrast, data from the L Prize program illustrates that commercially available LED products can have exemplary color stability that is unmatched by traditional light sources. Beyond presenting data from the aforementioned DOE programs, this report discusses the metrics used for communicating color shift—namely MacAdam ellipses and Δu'v'—as well as providing guidance for end users on how to monitor color shift and what to look for in manufacturer warranties. Also included are descriptions of the physical changes that have been documented as leading to color shift in some example types of LED packages. As with complete products, the data presented herein for LED packages shows that a wide variety of products are available; in order for specifiers and consumers to make educated choices, more detailed and standardized information should be made available...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{development}} of both GaN-based LED chips and pcLED packaging technique continued to move toward increasingly higher power pcLED packages (> 1 Watt/chip), driven by the needs for the BLU for large screen TVs and general illumination. However, a unique aspect of conventional pcLED is that the phosphors used in such packages are in physical contact with the LED chip, and the LED chips operate at high temperatures (e.g., {{in the range of}} 100 °C- 150 °C). Traditional phosphors (e.g., BOSE) exhibit a significant drop in efficiency at such operating temperatures, limiting the performance of the pcLED devices. This stimulated another round of discovery for phosphor formulations which were required to operate efficiently at high temperatures in high power LED packages. The primary criterion for the phosphor is high thermal stability of luminescence with a <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> at 150 °C of > 90 % that at room temperature. Naturally, the search for good host crystals started among refractory materials such as nitrides with a high melting point. As a result, several nitride and oxynitride phosphors were successfully formulated in the early 2000 ’s, and in turn applied to pcLED products. The formulations include the red-emitting CaAlSiN 3 :Eu [16],[17] and Sr 2 Si 5 N 8 :Eu [18],[19], the yellow-emitting Ca-α-sialon:Eu [20],[21] and La 3 Si 6 N 11 :Ce [22], the green-emitting β-sialon:Ce [23] and SrSi 2 N 2 O 2 :Eu [24]. All these phosphors are converters of blue or nUV light and have high thermal stability. The application of these phosphors not only enabled the pcLED products operating at[*]>[*] 1 Watt per single chip package, but also significantly expanded the luminescence features of pcLED packages.|$|E
40|$|By {{solving the}} problem of very long test time on {{reliability}} qualification for Light-emitting Diode (LED) products, the accelerated degradation test with a thermal overstress at a proper range {{is regarded as a}} promising and effective approach. For a comprehensive survey of the application of step-stress accelerated degradation test (SSADT) in LEDs, the thermal, photometric, and colorimetric properties of two types of LED chip scale packages (CSPs), i. e., 4000 °K and 5000 °K samples each of which was driven by two different levels of currents (i. e., 120 mA and 350 mA, respectively), were investigated under an increasing temperature from 55 °C to 150 °C and a systemic study of driving current effect on the SSADT results were also reported in this paper. During SSADT, junction temperatures of the test samples have a positive relationship with their driving currents. However, the temperature-voltage curve, which represents the thermal resistance property of the test samples, does not show significant variance as long as the driving current is no more than the sample’s rated current. But when the test sample is tested under an overdrive current, its temperature-voltage curve is observed as obviously shifted to the left when compared to that before SSADT. Similar overdrive current affected the degradation scenario is also found in the attenuation of Spectral Power Distributions (SPDs) of the test samples. As used in the reliability qualification, SSADT provides explicit scenes on color shift and correlated color temperature (CCT) depreciation of the test samples, but not on <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> depreciation. It is also proved that the varying rates of the color shift and CCT depreciation failures can be effectively accelerated with an increase of the driving current, for instance, from 120 mA to 350 mA. For these reasons, SSADT is considered as a suitable accelerated test method for qualifying these two failure modes of LED CSPs...|$|E
40|$|Trends in the {{development}} of different types of light sources and their energy characteristics have been described in the paper. Analysis of regulatory documents has been given. The results of experimental studies of a number of modern LED lamps have been described. Investigation has been made for a number of LED lamps produced by Philips, Xavax and Melitec. The experimental data have been obtained with the complex of devices: the dual-channel oscilloscope (GDS- 71042), the power quality analyzer (Fluke- 434) and the multi-function device EcoLight- 01 (light-, pulse- and luminance meter). It has been shown that operation of LED lamps is characterized by emission of higher current harmonics and reactive power consumption, which depends on the type and design of the lamp driver. It has been found that the value of luminance created by LED lamps in case of acceptable (for ships) prolonged deviation of voltage (– 10 %) is reduced by 3 %; in case of permissible short-term voltage deviation (– 20 %) luminance is reduced by 7 %. For incandescent lamps this indicator is characterized by a decrease in luminance by 40 % and 60 %, respectively. Despite the low sensitivity to voltage changes (in comparison with other types of lamps), the operation of LED lamps is also associated with the appearance of flicker. Absence of limitations for fluctuations of the light flux in shipboard lighting systems and imperfection of methods for determining the flicker make it difficult to ensure electromagnetic compatibility of LED lamps. Therefore due to reliability, environmental friendliness, energy efficiency and <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> LED lamps have prospects for introduction into shipboard lighting systems. However, to ensure electromagnetic compatibility of LED lighting systems it is necessary to conduct a detailed study of energy characteristics of LED lamps and to develop appropriate regulatory requirements and technical solutions...|$|E
40|$|High-brightness, high-efficiency GaN-based LEDs {{have already}} found many applications, and are {{extremely}} promising devices for solid-state lighting, including general illumination [1]. While reliability of LEDs is significantly better in most aspects compared to traditional light sources, <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{remains one of}} the critical issues concerning this new technology. Early reliability studies [2] observed a rapid loss of light output, severe degradation of the transparent encapsulating material under blue and UV illumination and elevated temperatures; non-optimized packaging also induced other reliability problems due to difficulties in thermal management. As the packaging technology improves, the interest is focussing on failure modes and mechanisms related with the semiconductor material and the die technology, which have been less investigated in the past. This work presents the results of extensive high-current accelerated aging tests carried out on blue InGaN/GaN LEDs packaged with the usual epoxy encapsulation (lamps) as well as mounted without encapsulation (chips), in order to isolate the chip-related failure modes. As a result, 5 distinct failure modes were identified: (i) in encapsulated devices, testing at high current levels and, consequently, at high junction temperatures, induces degradation of the epoxy material in contact with the heated device surface, leading to the formation of an opaque layer on the device surface; (ii) high current and temperature affect the semi-transparent ohmic contact on top of the device, leading to increase in series resistance, with consequent current crowding effects that reduce the optical power; (iii) an increase in doping of the p-type layer takes place, possibly due to decomposition of Mg complexes [3, 4], and Mg reactivation; (iv) Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) detects changes in the distribution of deep levels already present in untreated devices, and also a generation of shallow traps; (v) both DLTS and photocurrent spectra indicate the creation of extended defects in devices treated at high current density. Identification of the specific failure mechanisms allows an accurate extrapolation of LED lifetime, and suggests specific actions for improving device reliability...|$|E
40|$|Lighting consumes {{approximately}} 20 - 25 % of {{the energy}} produced worldwide. LED based lighting is rapidly becoming the preferred choice over incandescent and fluorescent based lighting. LEDs have advantages such as high efficacy, long operating lifetime and excellent <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Therefore, to gain benefits from LEDs for lighting purposes, they must be driven with efficient drivers which maintain high LED efficacy and long LED lifetime. A review of existing LED drivers is done, and their advantages and drawbacks are identified. Existing fault-tolerant drivers are also reviewed. Several dimming methods and their effects on the LED efficacy and lifetime are investigated. As a result, a converter with coupled inductors, suitable as an LED driver which has high efficiency and can maintain high LED efficacy, incorporated with a high efficiency dimming method, is chosen. For the proposed LED driver, a comprehensive analysis {{on the effects of}} coupling type and coupling coefficient on converter performance is done. This is carried out to establish the best coupled inductor structure and coupling coefficient, for the proposed LED driver. The coupled inductor obtained is used to achieve high LED efficacy and also used to eliminate the need for an output filtering capacitor. This results in a highly compact, high efficiency and low cost LED driver. A lossless method of LED string current sensing is proposed, so that driver efficiency is not negatively impacted. The LED driver and a digital control system are designed, with the fault-tolerant feature incorporated. The LED driver and the control system are simulated and practically implemented. The results obtained show excellent LED driver performance. The fault-tolerant feature can enable the driver to operate under fault conditions, saving repair costs and down time. Additionally, a novel digitally controlled LED driver, which can drive several independent multiple LED loads, is proposed. This novel driver is simulated and practically implemented; with the results showing excellent driver performance. The novel LED driver can simplify and reduce costs of existing LED lighting systems.

30|$|The {{relatively}} broad line-width of red emission from OLEDs {{makes it}} difficult to achieve excellent color quality and high efficacy simultaneously. Nevertheless, over the last years an enhanced interest towards OLEDs has {{led to the development of}} new units characterized by higher luminous efficacy, longer life-spam, lower cost and better light and colour quality (warm light with different Correlated Colour Temperatures). According to two other studies carried out by the US Department of Energy [4, 5], the average cost of OLEDs, estimated equal to 500 $/klm in 2014 for an OLED panel will drop to 50 dollars/klm in 2015 and to 25 dollars /klm in 2020, whilst the luminous efficacy is expected to reach values as high as 135 lm/W in 2015 (being 45 lm/W in 2011 and 80 lm/W in 2014), with a feasible goal of 190 lm/W. The brightness is also expected to double its value in 2015 compared to the current performance. On the geometrical side, the sizes of OLED units, presently limited to 300 mm ∗ 100 mm (but 100 mm ∗ 100 mm square unites are typically manufactured) will be consolidated in 30 mm ∗ 30 mm square units in 2015. According to [5], from laboratory measurements, “Konica Minolta has shown a 15  cm 2 panel with an efficacy of 131  lm/W at 1000  cd/m 2 and 118  lm/W at 3000  cd/m 2, while Panasonic has successfully scaled their technology to an area of 25  cm 2, achieving efficacy of 112  lm/W at 1000  cd/m 2 and 98  lm/W at 3000  cd/m 2. <b>Lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> (L 50) for both panels is acceptable at 55, 000  h for the Konica Minolta panel and over 100, 000  h for the Panasonic panel when operated at 1000  cd/m 2 ”. According to what Ron Mertens reports in a website on OLED technologies [6], some analysts optimistically forecast that the OLED lighting market will reach 82 million in 2015 and $ 4.7 billion in 2020, while other analysts see a $ 200 million panel market in 2019 that will grow to $ 1.9 billion in 2025. Other analysts expect OLED to compete with LEDs in 2016.|$|E
40|$|Light {{emitting}} diode (LED) -recessed downlighting {{is currently}} mainly used for indoor lighting of {{residential and commercial}} buildings. Maintaining a low junction temperature and increasing the lifetime and reliability of LED lighting is desirable. This study investigated designed heat sinks’ heat dissipation and capability of maintaining a low junction temperature, as well as increases in the lifetime and reliability of the lighting. This paper presents a designed traditional trapezoidal aluminum finned heat sink (ALFHS) and annular open cell copper foam heat sink (CUFHS) mounted to a 10 W compact LED-recessed downlight (CLRDL) and individually installed in a simulation 105 mm × 105 mm × 100 mm (L × W × H) test box. The purpose was to evaluate the temperature performance by testing the downlight in a small enclosed space with high ambient temperature while the LED is in operation. The downlight exhibited a long lifetime at normal use temperature and functioned according to Arrhenius’ law. Numerical simulation was performed first and followed by experimental validation. The heat sink design was the main factor in the heat management of the CLRDL. The heat sinks height was determined using numerical simulation and experimental validation before and after installation (INST) of the ALFHS and CUFHS. The CUFHS height was initially selected based on a larger heat dissipation capacity, and then by determining the ALFHS height. Both the ALFHS and CUFHS with the same height of 17 mm exhibited a similar capacity of heat dissipation before INST. Subsequent to INST, {{the temperature of the}} solder point of the ALFHS was higher than that of the CUFHS with an identical height of 17 mm. To compare the heat dissipation behavior of the two heat sinks, the ALFHS height was increased to 23 mm, which is 6 mm higher than that of the CUFHS. The results of a stationary simulation study for junction temperature coincides with the experimental results tested obtained using J-type thermocouples and a data acquisition system. The temperature of the solder point of the CLRDL with both the ALFHS and CUFHS was 91. 7 °C after INST, corresponding to an LED junction temperature of 121. 7 °C, which is lower than specified 135 °C LED limit temperature. The temperature distributions of specified points under natural convection were evaluated. The CLRDL installed in a small enclosed space withstood the lifetime requirements according to the results of an accelerated life test prediction. The CLRDL <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance</b> was tested to be more than 25, 000 h.

40|$|EDITORIAL The {{papers in}} this special issue of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics (JPhysD) {{originate}} from the 12 th International Symposium on the Science and Technology of Light Sources and the 3 rd International Conference on White LEDs and Solid State Lighting, held 11 – 16 July 2010 at Eindhoven University. Abstracts of all papers presented at this combined conference {{were published in the}} Conference Proceedings LS-WLED 2010 by FAST-LS, edited by M Haverlag, G M W Kroesen and T Taguchi. Special issues of the previous three LS conferences have been well-cited and have proven to be an important source of information for the lighting community. The 2010 LS-Symposium was a combined conference with the White LED Conference in order to enhance the scope of this conference series towards new light source technologies such as LEDs and OLEDs, and this co-operation will be continued in the future. Given the faster technology development in these areas it was also decided to shorten the interval between conferences from three to two years. Well over 200 invited presentations, landmark presentations and poster contributions were presented at the 2010 LS-Symposium. The organizing committee have selected from these a number of outstanding contributions with a high technological content and invited the authors to submit a full paper in JPhysD. The criteria were that the work should not be a repetition of the work already published in the Proceedings, but should be new, complete, within the scope of JPhysD, and meeting the normal quality standards of this journal. After peer review a combined set of 18 papers is published in this JPhysD special issue. In addition, a number of lighting-application-orientated papers will be published in a special issue of Journal of Light 2 ̆ 6 amp; Visual Environment later in 2011. The papers {{in this special}} issue of JPhysD show that research in the science and technology of light sources still covers a broad set of subject areas which includes both 'classical' discharge light sources and (O) LED sources, and new concepts are still being added to the range of technologies that are being used in practice. A truly classic aspect of lamp operation is <b>lumen</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and despite being in use for almost 50 years, Na/Sc quartz metal halide lamps until recently still suffered from a strong lumen depreciation over life. This issue has been resolved to a large extent with the introduction of high-frequency operation. In the paper of Van Erk et al, indications are given as to why this mode of operation is so successful. Another classic theme in the area of discharge lamp sources is ignition, still a major issue. In two consecutive papers by Sobota et al, several aspects of the cold ignition of ceramic metal halide lamps are discussed, including statistical delay effects, the role of the driving voltage, and ignition aids. The ignition becomes more complex when mercury is left out of a metal halide lamp and this is clearly shown in the paper by Estupiñán et al. When not buffered by mercury, water impurities will give rise to the formation of hydrogen iodide, which is very volatile and a strongly electronegative species, thereby hampering the ignition process. Mercury-free metal halide lamps will potentially show very different spectral properties. This is shown in the paper by Käning et al, where use has been made of the ongoing improvements in ceramic lamp technology to make lamps with a high rare-earth iodide content. It was found that in such lamps the contribution of molecular lines can become so important that some lines even become self-reversed. This opens new possibilities for making high-quality white light sources without mercury while retaining the use of electrodes. High rare-earth content also changes the behaviour of electrodes {{as a result of the}} lowering of the work function due to gas-phase emitter effects. In the paper by Reinelt et al some clear examples of this effect are investigated as well as their dependence on the operational frequency in ceramic metal halide lamps. Despite the fact that ceramic metal halide lamps with electrodes have already been on the market for more than 15 years, the latest developments in materials and lamp-shaping technologies continue to push the limits of efficiency and colour quality of these lamps. In an effort to clarify the energy balance of these lamps, Rijke et al have shown that it is possible to deduce from integrated sphere measurements in the visible and IR region the complete energy balance of such lamps. This method will provide valuable insights to push the efficacy of HID technologies even further. New concepts based on discharges are also being proposed and some of these are also being introduced to the market. It is interesting to note that all of these concepts are either mercury-free or can easily be adapted to mercury-free versions. One such contender is the electrodeless HID lamp. In the paper by Gilliard et al it is shown how a cavity resonator can be effectively used to couple power into a capacitively coupled electrodeless metal halide lamp. In contrast, the paper by Hilbig et al shows a concept in which the power is inductively coupled. Both methods potentially offer more freedom in salt choice, and this is used in the paper by Hilbig et al to test various new molecular radiators including some oxygen-containing molecules. With a larger choice of applicable salt systems, it becomes even more important to know the thermodynamical properties of rare-earth molecules. A nice overview of these properties for the mono-halides is given in the paper by Mucklejohn. Operating at lower pressures is another concept; employment of phosphor-converted DBD and microplasma lamps is studied in the papers by Eden et al and Guivan et al. A relatively new concept based on pulsed operation of pure Xe discharges and phosphor conversion is described by Motomura et al. These papers show that there is still an abundance of developments in discharge-based light sources. However, the progress in the last few years in LED and OLED sources has been even greater. In the editorial for the LS- 11 conference by previous guest editor David Wharmby, it was stated that most LED lighting was still mostly used for signalling and decorative sources. In the three years that have passed, things have changed considerably and we now see LED light sources entering every application, ranging from street lighting and parking lots to shop lighting and even greenhouses. Currently LED prices for traditional lighting applications are high, but they are dropping rapidly. The papers published in this special issue give some indications of things to come. The paper by Jamil et al deals with the possibility of using silicon wafers as substrate material instead of the now commonly used (but more expensive) sapphire substrates. This is attractive from a cost price point of view, but leads to an increased lattice mismatch and therefore strain-induced defects. In this paper it is shown that when using intermediate matching layers it is possible to retain the same electrical and optical properties as with structures on sapphire. Another aspect that directly relates to cost is efficiency and droop in green InGaN devices, which is addressed in the paper by Lee et al. They show that by providing a flow of trymethylindium prior to the growth of the quantum wells it is possible to significantly increase the internal quantum efficiency of green LEDs. Improvement of the optical out-coupling of InGaN LEDs is discussed by Mak et al, and it is found that localized plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles (and especially silver) can help to increase the optical out-coupling in the wavelength region of interest. Nanoparticles in the form of ZnO nanorods are described by Willander et al as a possibility for phosphor-free wavelength conversion on polymer (O) LEDs. More advanced functions besides light emission can be achieved with OLEDs and this is demonstrated in the article by Generali et al which describes various aspects of organic light-emitting (field) transistors based on different substrates. The guest editors of this special issue of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics would like to thank all the colleagues who helped us identify this exhaustive collection of papers.
