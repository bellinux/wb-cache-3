This study, however, focused on the potential problem of driving too slowly. Six thousand, four hundred and eighty vehicles from around the Perth metropolitan area in Western Australia had their speeds recorded; observations were also made of these vehicles to identify characteristics of the driver and vehicle. In addition, a community survey with 240 {{members of the public}} was conducted to examine their attitudes towards slow drivers. As expected, results showed that older drivers drove more slowly than the other age brackets, women drove more slowly than men, and that heavily <b>laden</b> <b>vehicles</b> drove more slowly than other types of vehicles. Additionally, the slowest days were weekdays and the quickest were Saturdays. Community attitudes, generally mirrored the observational findings, and indicated that the public believed that slow driving was sometimes a safety problem causing some accidents.

Ahmed's transformation from average American teenager to an Islamic jihadist was gradual and complex. This thesis will examine how Ahmed and other Somali-Americans morphed into Salafi jihadists. Through interviews with law enforcement, social services providers, and homeland security officials, this thesis identifies cultural, religious, and assimilative traits existing in within this unique diaspora community that effects the trajectory of the radicalization of its members. First generation Somali eÌ migreÌ s are not particularly susceptible to radicalization. The historic clan identity, pragmatic religious practices, pastoralism, and nationalism of Somalis generally discourage the adoption of transnational movements like global jihadism. A study of the profiles of the Somali-American travelers shows that these youths are less like their Somali parents and more like their American and European Muslim counterparts. Thus, they are a "blank slate" for jihadist recruiters; much of their parent's clan and cultural traits are erased or otherwise diluted in the process of integration. These youths rush to embrace American culture but are torn between two diametrically opposed identities. This tension leaves these youths in a gap and Salafi Islam offers a ready-made solution.

In this study diesel engine exhaust emissions were collected from a light duty direct injection diesel engine on a standard test bed. Engine conditions of speed and load were altered to provide a set of total emission samples from over the engine's operating range. Diesel emission samples collected were fractionated on a silica column into aliphatic, aromatic, and polar groups of compounds, which were tested for their genotoxicity in the chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary CHO-K 1 cells both with and without metabolic activation (rat liver S 9 fraction). The aliphatic fractions did not exhibit cytotoxicity up to the maximum concentration assayed, and one emission sample (3000 rpm speed and 5 Nm load) assayed for effect on chromosome aberrations was not clastogenic (up to 600 µg/ml). The aromatic fractions of all engine emission samples assayed and of the fuel were not clastogenic, but did show high levels of cytotoxicity at relatively low doses, raising concern that any genotoxic effect was masked by the toxicity of certain chemicals within the fraction. Further fractionation, using HPLC, was therefore performed which separated the aromatics into various ring sizes. Assay of the ring fractions showed evidence of increasing clastogenicity with increasing ring size, with the 3 + -ring fractions of both the fuel and one emission sample clearly clastogenic when assayed with metabolic activation (evidence of the presence of indirect-acting genotoxic compounds within both samples). The final fractions to be assayed, the polar fractions, were clastogenic when assayed both with and without metabolic activation. All seven fractions from emission samples collected over a range of speed and load conditions caused highly significant increases in chromosome aberrations at concentrations as low as 20 µg/ml. An engine running for less than 30 minutes at 1000 rpm speed and 55 Nm load (urban driving conditions for a heavily <b>laden</b> <b>vehicle)</b> would emit 148 mg of polar group compounds for every litre of fuel consumed. Polar compounds {{have been shown to be}} a highly mutagenic fraction of air particulate samples, and as diesel emissions contribute up to 80 % of the particulate matter in urban air in some areas, diesel emissions and the polar compounds in particular are of real concern to human health...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method {{is used to}} {{calculate}} unsteady wind loadings acting on a railway vehicle. The method takes input data from wind tunnel testing or from computational fluid dynamics simulations (one example of each is presented in this article), for aerodynamic force and moment coefficients and combines these with fluctuating wind velocity time histories and train speed to produce wind force time histories on the train. This method is fast and efficient and this has allowed the wind forces to be applied to a vehicle dynamics simulation for a long length of track. Two typical vehicles (one passenger, one freight) have been modelled using the vehicle dynamics simulation package ‘VAMPIRE®’, which allows detailed modelling of the vehicle suspension and wheel—rail contact. The aerodynamic coefficients of the passenger train have been obtained from wind tunnel tests while those of the freight train have been obtained through fluid dynamic computations using large-eddy simulation. Wind loadings were calculated for the same vehicles for a range of average wind speeds and applied to the vehicle models using a user routine within the VAMPIRE package. Track irregularities measured by a track recording coach for a 40 km section of the main line route from London to King's Lynn were used as input to the vehicle simulations. The simulated vehicle behaviour was assessed against two key indicators for derailment; the Y/Q ratio, which is an indicator of wheel climb derailment, and the Δ Q/Q value, which indicates wheel unloading and therefore potential roll over. The results show that vehicle derailment by either indicator is not predicted for either vehicle for any mean wind speed up to 20 m/s (with consequent gusts up to around 30 m/s). At a higher mean wind speed of 25 m/s derailment is predicted for the passenger vehicle and the unladen freight vehicle (but not for the <b>laden</b> freight <b>vehicle)</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|As the {{commander}} of the 3rd Division, Brivonesi was the protagonist of the Italian defeat in the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy. On 8 November 1941, Brivonesi sailed from Messina with Trieste, Trento and the 13th Destroyer Flotilla (Granatiere, Bersagliere, Fuciliere, Alpino) as distant escort of the [...] "Beta" [...] convoy (later known as the [...] "Duisburg" [...] convoy), which consisted in 7 merchant ships (the Italian cargo ships Maria, Sagitta and Rina Corrado, the Italian tankers Conte di Misurata and Minatitlan and the German cargo ships Duisburg and San Marco, <b>laden</b> with 389 <b>vehicles,</b> 34,473 long tons of munitions and matériel and 17,281 long tons of fuel) with a close escort of six destroyers (under the command of Captain Ugo Bisciani on Maestrale). The convoy was spotted by a British reconnaissance plane, and Force K (light cruisers Aurora and Penelope and destroyers Lance and Lively) sailed from Malta to intercept. The attack happened during the following night; Force K took the close escort by surprise, sank one destroyer (Fulmine) and disabled another (Grecale), then proceeded to sink all the seven merchants, while the confused and disarticulated reaction of the other destroyers (left without orders, as Maestrales radio antenna was shot away) was unable to stop or damage the British ships. Brivonesi's 3rd Division, {{at the time of the}} attack (00:57 on 9 November), was sailing at 12 knots about three miles astern and to the east of the convoy. The Division only realized that the convoy was being attacked when they spotted the flash of the British guns; shortly before, at 00:30, Trieste had intercepted a coded message of unknown source and meaning (the source was Force K), and Brivonesi was about to send a general alert to all his ships, when the battle started. Trieste and Trento opened fire on Force K at 1:03, from a distance of 9,000-10,000 meters; Brivonesi's subsequent manoeuvre later drew heavy criticism: instead of turning southeast, where Force K was, to close in on the British ships and attack them at once, he turned starboard so that his cruisers could bring all guns to bear, which required several minutes. Brivonesi's ships briefly assumed a southerly course (thus distancing themselves from Force K even more), then turned to port and then to starboard, advancing at a speed of only 15-16 knots, less than half the speed that they could keep. Force K kept manoeuvring around the convoy so that the latter was constantly between the British ships and the Italian Division, which caused the blazing merchants and their smoke to hamper the aim of the Italian gunners. At 1:12 Brivonesi ordered to increase speed to 18 knots and at 1:25 to 24 knots, but by then the distance had risen to 17,000 meters, and he ordered to cease fire, as it was pointless. At 1:29 Brivonesi ordered to turn north, in order to intercept the Force K when the latter would turn back towards Malta (by then the convoy was completely destroyed). Meanwhile, however, Supermarina (the Italian Navy high command) had informed him that the risk of a torpedo bomber attack on his ships was high; as they were outside of Malta's aircraft's reach, Brivonesi believed that a British aircraft carrier was in the area. Upon realizing that the fires of the disabled merchant ships lighted up his ships, making them easier targets for submarines as well as aircraft, Brivonesi ordered to cease fire, leave the area and assume a northwesterly course, at 1:32. Overall, Trieste and Trento had fired 207 8-inch shells, without scoring any hits. The 3rd Division only returned to the area after a few hours, to cover the search and rescue operation, during which the destroyer Libeccio was sunk by HMS Upholder and Trento was narrowly missed by a torpedo.|$|R
