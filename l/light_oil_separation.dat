Mixture of greases is formulated using poly-methylsiloxane (with viscosity 500, 1000 and 2000 cS at 25 °C) as base oil and thickened with 5 - 13 % wt. fume silica. The results of testing have been done on formulated grease (penetration test, <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> test, drop point test, corrosive substance, stability of the consistency at high temperature test) show {{that the increase in}} the fume silica concentration at same base oil viscosity increases the consistency of formulated grease, while the <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> rapidly decreases by increasing the fume silica concentration at same oil viscosity. After 10 % wt. addition of fume silica, <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> becomes approximately unchanged. The result of the study of the effect of the base oil viscosity on the <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> and consistency of formulated grease using 10 % addition of fume silica shows that <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> decreases and consistency increase with viscosity.

30|$|In the Tahe {{oilfield}} in China, {{heavy oil}} is commonly lifted using the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending technology. However, {{due to the}} lack of <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> the production of heavy oil has been seriously limited. Thus, a new compound technology of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending and electric heating is discussed in this paper, which aims to reduce the usage of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and maintain heavy oil production. Based on the mass, momentum and energy conservation, a pressure and temperature coupling model is developed. The heat-transfer parameters are calculated by using Hasan–Kabir method and the pressure drop is calculated by using Hagedorn–Brown method. The model also considers the blend effect of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and heavy oil, and the heating effect of electric rod. Example calculation shows that only electric heating or <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending technology cannot meet the requirement. The amount of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> used can be reduced by combining the electric heating technology.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A closed type {{crankcase}} ventilation system has been adopted to engines to prevent emission of blow-by gas to atmosphere. In the early closed type {{crankcase ventilation}} system, blow-by gas which contains engine lubricating oil is re-circulated into the intake system. The blow-by gas containing oil mist leads to increased harmful emissions and engine problems. To reduce loss of the engine oil, a highly-efficient <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> device is required. Principle of a cyclone oil separator is to utilize centrifugal force in the separator and, therefore, oil separator designs depend on rotational flow which causes the centrifugal force. In this paper, flow characteristics and <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> performances for cyclone type designs are calculated with CFD methodology. In the CFD model, oil particle was injected on a inlet surface with Rosin-Rammler distribution and uniform distribution. The major design parameters considered in the analysis model are inlet area, cone length and outlet depth of the oil separator. As results, reducing inlet area and increasing cone length increase <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> performance. Changes in outlet depth could avoid interference betwee...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates {{and compares}} {{the effect of}} {{fractional}} flow curves on the heavy <b>oil</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> recoveries in a petroleum reservoir. Fingering of flowing water {{is one of the}} serious problems of the oil displacement by water and another problem is the estimation of the amount of recover oil from a petroleum reservoir. To address these problems, the fractional flow of heavy <b>oil</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> are investigated. The fractional flow approach treats the multi-phases flow rate as a total mixed fluid and then describes the individual phases as fractional of the total flow. Laboratory experiments are implemented for two different types of oils, heavy <b>oil,</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> to experimentally obtain relative permeability and fractional flow curves. Application of the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> fractional curve, which exhibits a regular S-shape, to the water flooding method showed that a large amount of mobile oil in the reservoir is displaced by water injection. In contrast, the fractional flow curve of heavy oil does not display an S-shape because of its high viscosity. Although the advance of the injected waterfront is faster than in <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs, a significant amount of mobile oil remains behind the waterfront...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Combustion {{and fuel}} {{qualities of the}} animal-fats {{biodiesel}} as a heating fuel for agricultural hot air heater were studied. Methods: Biodiesel (BD) was made from animal-fats by reacting with methanol and potassium hydroxide in the laboratory. The biodiesel made in the laboratory was tested for fuel and combustion qualities. Results: The kinematic viscosity and the calorific values of the biodiesels were measured. Kerosene based biodiesel, BD 20 (K) showed 18 cSt at- 20 ℃. It seemed that BD 100 was not suitable for a heating fuel under some temperature. As BD content increased, the calorific value decreased up to 40, 000 J/g for BD 100, while the calorific value of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> was 45, 567 J/g showing difference of 5, 567 J/g, about 12 % difference. Several different fuels including BD 20 (biodiesel 20 % + <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> 80 %), BD 50 (biodiesel 50 % + <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> 50 %), BD 100 (biodiesel 100 %), and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> were tested for fuel combustion qualities for agricultural hot air heater, and their combustion performances were compared and analyzed. Flame dimensions of biodiesels and <b>light</b> <b>oils</b> were almost the same shape at the same combustion condition. Generally, the CO 2 amounts of BDs were greater than <b>light</b> <b>oil.</b> However, in this study the differences were minor, {{so there was no}} significant difference existed between the BDs combustion and <b>light</b> <b>oil.</b> Conclusions: It seemed that quality was good for heating oil for agricultural hot air heater because of showing no barriers for continuous combustion and proper exhaust gas temperature and CO 2 amount discharged. But, for fuel fluidity for higher BD content fuel could be a detrimental problem in situations where the outdoor temperature is lowered. As BD content increased, calorific value decreased up to 40, 000 J/g for BD 100. Calorific value difference between BD 20 and ligh...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Performances of {{a tractor}} diesel engine fueled by three {{different}} animal fats biodiesels were evaluated comparing with <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> tractor {{in terms of}} power, fuel consumption rate, exhaust gases, particulate matter amount and field work capacity. Methods: Animal fats based on pig biodiesel were manufactured manually and tested for its engine performance in the tractor diesel engine and fuel adoptability in the field works. Four different fuels, three different content of biodiesel (BD 20, BD 50, BD 100) and <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> were prepared and tested in the four strokes diesel engine. Power output, fuel consumption rate and exhaust gases of the four fuels in the diesel engine were compared and discussed. Results: Power output of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> engine was the greatest showing 5. 3 % difference between <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and BD 100, but 0. 37 % better power than BD 20 engine power. Less exhaust gases of CO 2, CO, NOX and THC were produced from animal fats biodiesel than <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> which confirmed that biodiesel is environmental friendly fuel. For fuel adoptability in the tractor, biodiesel engine tractor showed its fuel competitiveness comparing with <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> for tractor works in the faddy field. Conclusions: With four different fuel types of animal-fats biodiesel, performances of a four cylinder diesel engine for tractor were evaluated in terms of power, exhaust gases, particulate matters (PM) and field work capacity. No significant differences observed in the engine performances including power output and exhaust gases emission rate. No significant power difference observed between the various fuels including <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> on the engine running, however, amounts of noxious exhaust gases including CO 2 and NOX decreased as biodiesel content increased in the fuels.

The product was developed using pistachio paste (as main ingredient), mixture of sugar-glucose, egg white and citric acid. The effect of soapwort root extract (from saponaria officinalis) and Glycyrrhizin (from Glycyrrhiza glabra) as whitening and emulsifying agent in three levels (0. 00, 0. 10, and 0. 15 %) on the <b>oil</b> <b>separation,</b> consumer acceptance, and texture of pistachio halva was investigated. Sensory evaluation was carried out after 4 months storage at 20 ± 2 °C. There was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between samples with and without soapwort and glycyrrhizin. The <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> (R = 0. 595, P= 0. 001), from halva were moderately correlated to the hardness. The sensory texture of halva was negatively correlated to the hardness (R =- 0. 694, P = 0. 000) and <b>oil</b> <b>separation</b> (R =- 0. 730, P = 0. 000).
