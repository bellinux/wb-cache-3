The illegal exportation of endangered rosewood from protected national forests abruptly increased under the HAT, with several business leaders and politicians linked to the HAT having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects.

Responding to worldwide crises The year 2005 was a historic one, marking the sixtieth anniversary of the end of World War II. It was also a year in which a variety of severe threats, each capable of thrusting people’s daily lives into crisis, became manifest. Nowhere was this more shockingly visible than in the series of natural disasters that struck different parts of the world. Before the wounds of the calamitous Sumatra earthquake and tsunami had begun to heal, India was hit in July 2005 by widespread flooding and, at the end of August, hurricanes inflicted enormous damage on the southern Gulf Coast of the United States.

40|$|The Desert locust {{represents}} {{a major threat}} for agro-pastoral resources, from Northern Africa to the Arabian peninsula and India over almost 30 million km². <b>Locust</b> <b>infestations</b> and invasions repetitively jeopardizes the food security of more than 60 countries. Remote sensing plays {{a major part of}} in the preventative control strategy as it allows monitoring the locust habitats in near real-time over its entire repartition area, especially in remote or unsecured regions. Since 2010, dynamic greenness maps are provided every ten days to the Food and Agriculture Organization and the affected countries to help them analyze the current situation and plan the control operations. These maps indicate the priority areas for survey by detecting the appearance of green and fresh vegetation, i. e. locusts' potential habitats. The successful implementation and integration of the dynamic greenness maps into the daily operations led to a new need: control centers want to know where and when the habitats are becoming less attractive and thus likely to be abandoned as vegetation is drying out. This information through a dynamic dryness map would enable control centers to assess if they can remove or redirect their survey teams, leading to more efficiency in the allocation of resources and in decision making. In this context, this work aims at developing and evaluating a method to detect in near real time the senescence of vegetation. The design of the detection method relies on the temporal behavior of two indices : the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), depending on green vegetation, and NDTI (Normalized Difference Tillage Index), sensitive to both green and dry vegetation. The method is demonstrated in Mauritania a ever-affected country with 10 -day MODIS mean composites for the years 2010 and 2011. The Mauritanian field survey database provided the validation samples necessary to distinguish between three phenological classes, "growth", "density reduction" and "drying". The discrimination performance of these three classes were analyzed for three classification methods: a decision tree (DT), a support vector machine (SVM) and a maximum likelihood (ML) classifier. The DT and SVM, with an overall accuracy of 71. 5 % and 72. 3 % respectively, outperform the ML (61. 4 %). Performance of the DT and SVM is affected by several factors: (i) the spatial distribution of the error confirms the influence of the north-south climatic gradient on the detection, with an error 10 % higher in northern regions, (2) the vegetation density {{plays an important role in}} detection and depends on the type of habitat and on rainfall, itself subjected to climate and seasons, (3) the relief interferes also with vegetation detection. On the other hand, the overlap of the "density reduction" and "drying" class distribution leads to an important omission (46, 19 % for the DT and 49, 14 % for SVM) of vegetation patches affected by density reduction. Application of the decision tree to the Mauritanian case highlights the diachronic consistency of the land cover classification; the seasonal cycle is clear, despite some patches whose temporal behavior is difficult to interpret. Smoothing the NDVI and NDTI temporal profiles results in an increase of the overall accuracy of 5 % for the decision tree and of 4 % for the SVM. The classification performance could be enhanced using the new generation of satellites with a higher spatial resolution such as PROBA-V or Sentinel- 2. The results obtained in the framework of this paper are promising to pave the way for a first operational implementation of the senescence dynamic maps and, consequently, further strengthen the capacity of the locust control management...|$|R

40|$|On 20 July 2004 Reuters {{reported}} that swarms of desert locusts had infested {{large areas of}} Mauritania, and were sweeping into Senegal and Mali. According to a local official, the locusts threatened to destroy crops and spark a food crisis in West Africa´s worst locust plague in 15 years. * The news report came {{five months after the}} UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) first warned of a major locust plague in the making, potentially affecting agricultural production and food security throughout West and Northwest Africa. The FAO based this early warning in part on local meteorological and field survey data that are received daily through the Electronic Locust Information System (eLocust). The desert locust, a creature similar to a grasshopper, breeds in the deserts of North Africa. Most years, the locusts stay within their breeding grounds. They are normally solitary, scattered insects but when climatic conditions are favourable, such as after a period of good rains and mild temperatures, they can rapidly increase in number. As the rainy season ends, the locusts tend to group together in the remaining areas of green vegetation. They then change their behaviour and appearance, and form enormous swarms that can devastate entire crop fields in minutes, and can travel more than 120 km per day. They can easily cross the Red Sea into the Arabian Peninsula and even to India, depending on the prevailing winds. They have even been known to reach the UK and the Caribbean. Since the last desert locust plague of 1987 - 89, the FAO has been actively involved in strengthening the early warning and reaction capacities of the affected countries. Most of these countries have now established national locust units with teams of specialists who conduct regular field surveys using four-wheel drive vehicles equipped with eLocust monitoring and data transmission equipment. The eLocust system consists of a palmtop computer (Psion 5 mx), a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) device, and HF radio equipment (a mobile transceiver and data modem), all of which run on the vehicle´s battery. The palmtop is equipped with a customized database and shareware software (PsiDat, RealMaps). Each day, between sunrise and sunset, a field survey team makes about a dozen stops to monitor environmental conditions, such as vegetation, temperature, rainfall and soil moisture. They are also on the lookout for locusts, and interview nomads, travellers, villagers and farmers along the way. At each survey and control location, the field officer opens a new record in the database and enters relevant data. He taps on the touch-sensitive screen with a stylus to select the appropriate items from a drop-down menu, and uses the full keyboard to enter the names of locations and general comments. The GPS device automatically adds the coordinates, date and time to the record, which is then stored in the computer database. Different types of maps can be linked to the database, including satellite imagery such as Landsat or maps showing the extent of <b>locust</b> <b>infestations</b> in the past. The field team can view different combinations of the data as well as the survey route using the RealMaps software. Almost any type of map can be loaded onto the Psion. At scheduled times throughout the day, the officer connects the Psion to the HF radio and data modem inside the vehicle and within a minute or so transmits the data to the national locust centre. With the eLocust system, data transmission is much faster and more reliable than in the past, when field officers recorded their observations on paper forms, which were then sent to the national centre. Most important, the data they send are now automatically included in a national geographic information system (GIS), together with data from the national meteorological service, such as temperature, humidity, wind direction and atmospheric pressure, and forwarded to the Desert Locust Information Service (DLIS) at FAO headquarters in Rome for analysis. Nearly 20 locust-affected countries are currently using the eLocust system. A French version is available for use in at least seven of these countries. Data from the remotest parts of Africa now arrive at the FAO in a matter of minutes. This has led to significant improvements in analysis and forecasting, enabling the affected countries to take steps to reduce the frequency of desert locust outbreaks. During the current crisis the system is being used to track the movements of locust swarms, and to identify locations where targeted ground and aerial spraying could minimize their devastating consequences for farmers in some of the world´s poorest countries. mailto:Keith.

Geographical Information Systems bring together all sorts of geographic data maps, satellite images, aerial photos, statistics and texts. With integrated and up-to-date GIS information, natural resource management (NRM) can be improved, with better analysis, forecasting and planning. GIS have many very useful applications in NRM, rural development and risk prevention, but there is a but. You have to be able to obtain the data. Here are some leads. In the field of NRM, increasing numbers of livestock are causing numerous problems: overgrazing, deforestation and water shortages and pollution. By using GIS data, it is possible to combine these multiple factors and to analyse their inter-relationships. Some Websites provide examples: www. fao. org/ giews/english/Basedocs/ lacbase. htm provides satellite images of each country with the state of vegetation from year to year. The site of the US Geological Survey - edcwww. cr. usgs. gov/earthshots/ slow/ tableofcontentsmap provides satellite images of year-by-year trends in land use in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Watch it grow, erode, burn: Santo Domingo's changing vegetation Mauritania and Senegal. The University of Maryland has set up a GIS which pulls together the key elements of information available on vegetation, climate, population and infrastructure in all the countries of central Africa, on a regional scale (1 : 1, 000, 000). Its analysis of changes in vegetation cover is aimed at improving NRM in the countries concerned (carpe. gecp. virginia. edu/ french/gisthemes. html). Hydrological data (locations, rainfall data, ground reservoirs) are available on-line on the HAPEX - Sahel Hydrology GIS at gaya. mpl. orstom. fr/grasslinks/. On a more modest scale, the site www. nhm. ac. uk/botany/projects_ research/project 3 /index. html shows the results of a survey of the ecosystem of the 'Maya Mountains' in Belize, drawing on satellite images and land-based observations. Harvests can be predicted through monitoring crop growth. This can be clearly seen on the FAO site geoweb. fao. org/, which gives access to the data used in the Global Information and Early Warning System on food and agriculture (GIEWS) for each country in the world. Several early warning systems are of immediate value for ACP countries, providing maps which are regularly updated for weather watches (drought, heavy rainfall, cyclones) and monitoring of crop pests. On the site of the World Meteorological Organisation (www. wmo. ch) there is live weather information drawn from nine satellites and 17, 000 monitoring stations. It includes details about El Niño and La Niña, meteorological and marine information and links to national meteorological offices. Similarly, the site www. intellicast. com/LocalWeather/World/ contents. html will give weather forecasts for the next days in thousands of towns and cities, from Timbuktu to Johannesburg. And FAO provides weekly updates on <b>locust</b> <b>infestations</b> (see Spore 84) on [URL] If these examples have whetted your appetite and you want to know more about how a GIS works, you can go online and even download free software to make a start. The GIEWS mentioned above allows you to make personalised maps of a country (geoweb. fao. org/GeoWEB. exe$ChooseCtry) providing information from the FAO database and satellite images from its ARTEMIS: basis maps, indications of crops and topics by zone using statistics of population, agricultural production, cloud cover, and vegetation, along with detailed instructions on compiling your map. FAO also has a free software called WinDisp (www. fao. org/giews/ english/windisp/windisp. htm.) for displaying and analysing satellite images, maps and databases, with an emphasis on early warning systems for food security. Another software programme Arcview can be downloaded from www. ce. utexas. edu/prof/ maidment/gishydro/africa/ ex 1 af/ex 1 af. htm, and used in analysing meteorological data, on the Niger basin for example. If you want to go further than these sites and get a real training in GIS, several universities provide short (1 to 3 year) post-graduate courses, and there are specialised bodies such as the ITC (International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences, PO Box 6, 7500 AA Enschede, Netherlands Fax : + 31 53 487 44 00 Email : pr@itc. nl). Luckily for many, GIS are not just accessible on the Internet. True, the Net is a good place to play host to data of this kind, but it is almost as easy to obtain maps, software and all sorts of data from research institutes, national geographic bodies and map publishers. However, there is still a long way to go before all the data gathered by GIS is widely available, and even further to go before people at the grassroots can use the data, although encouraging steps are being made (see News in Brief).

The illegal exportation of endangered rosewood from protected national forests abruptly increased under the HAT, with several business leaders and politicians linked to the HAT having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects. A large, unexplained stash of rosewood logs was discovered at the presidential palace {{after the end of}} Rajoelina's term in office. Due to accelerating deforestation and a spike in bush meat consumption linked with deepening poverty, the island's lemurs moved closer toward extinction under Rajoelina's tenure. A July 2012 assessment found that 90 percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, an increase from 38 percent in 2008. Lack of funds for pesticides and systematic spraying resulted in the March 2013 outbreak of a <b>locust</b> <b>infestation</b> that was anticipated to persist for five to ten years and require $41 million U.S. dollars to bring under control, deepening the risk of nationwide famine and destruction of habitat for endangered species.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-20th century, border {{conflicts}} between India, Pakistan and China caused Ladakh and Zanskar {{to be closed}} to foreigners. During these wars Ladakh lost two thirds of its original territory, losing Baltistan to Pakistan and the Aksai Chin to China. Ladakh and Zanskar, despite a tumultuous history of internal wars and external aggressions, have never lost their cultural and religious heritage since the 8th century. Thanks to its adherence to the Indian Union, this {{is also one of}} the rare regions in the Himalaya where traditional Tibetan culture, society, and buildings survived the Chinese Cultural Revolution. In the last twenty years, the opening of a road and the massive influx of tourists and researchers have brought many changes to the traditional social organisation of Zanskar. In 2007 the valley suffered its third year of a desert <b>locust</b> <b>infestation</b> with many villages losing their crops. The response of the monasteries was to carry out Puja ( [...] prayer [...] ) to get rid of them while the government was advocating the use of insecticides which the Buddhists were reluctant to use, but in some cases were forced to try with as yet undocumented success. In 2008 it was reported that the Locusts had left the central Zanskar plains.|$|E
50|$|After Wang Meng's death, Fú Jiān {{continued}} {{to carry out}} his campaigns to try to unite the empire. These campaigns, while largely successful, were, according to historical resources, draining on the resources of the empire and of the people, and wore out his troops. Further, Fú Jiān, who was known for thrifty living in his early years, began to spend somewhat extravagantly on palace designs. Further, one of Wang's focus areas—to keep the governmental officials honest and competent—appeared to have been ignored, as one began to see false governmental reports in historical records. For example, in 382, Former Qin suffered a major <b>locust</b> <b>infestation</b> that required a failed extermination effort throughout You (幽州, modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei), Qing (青州, modern central and eastern Shandong), Ji (冀州, modern central Hebei), and Bing (并州, modern Shanxi) Provinces—and yet the governmental records paradoxically recorded that these provinces, except You Province, received large yields on their crop fields, and that the locusts did not infest the hemp and bean plants, a fairly impossible scenario. This suggested that government officials were no longer reporting statuses of their provinces honestly but were only making reports that pleased Fú Jiān and the high level officials. This might be because Fú Jiān, after Wang's death, felt that he had to personally oversee everything, and was burdening himself with too many tasks, as evidenced in an edict that he issued in 376 indicating that his workload was burdening him so much that half of his hair turned white.|$|E
5000|$|After Wei's removal (along with Xue's, {{after the}} defeat against Khitan), Yao and Lu {{were the only}} {{remaining}} chancellors, and Yao bore {{the brunt of the}} responsibilities. It was said that in 715, when Yao had to take about half a month of vacation due to his son's death, the important affairs stacked up at the legislative bureau, which Lu was unable to handle, and that once Yao returned from vacation, he was able to handle the matters quickly. Lu, realizing that he was not as capable as Yao, usually yielded to Yao in important matters, and the people at the time derogatorily referred to Lu as [...] "the chancellor who simply ate together" [...] (伴食宰相). Also that year, when there was a major <b>locust</b> <b>infestation</b> in central China, Yao advocated capturing and killing the locusts—a strategy that initially yielded no results, and Emperor Xuanzong considered abandoning it. Yao insisted on the strategy, and eventually this led to the improvement of the situation. Lu opined that killing many locusts may lead to disharmony in the spiritual world, but Yao stated that locusts were harming farmers and {{that he was willing to}} take any supernatural punishment for killing locusts. Later that year, when Emperor Xuanzong considered eliminating the posts of circuit-reviewing officials (按察使, Ancha Shi), Yao advocated keeping the posts, as he believed that it would be relatively easier to find people suitable to be these officials than to make sure that the prefectural prefects were all suitable officials without Ancha Shi reviewing their acts.|$|E
5000|$|Starting from December 1731 {{and into}} March 1732, the heavy rains has damaged the winter cereals (wheat and barley) fields, and {{communities}} has difficulty re-planting fields because the seeds reserve was already driven low {{by years of}} marginal harvests. In the May-June 1732, the cold, wet weather has continued for two months in Chūgoku, Shikoku and Kyushu regions, resulting in favourable conditions for proliferation of insects and rotting of rice seedlings. Either [...] or <b>locust</b> <b>infestation,</b> has appeared in Seto Inland Sea region and proceed to destroy rice paddies across West Japan, leaving only 10% of crops unaffected. The total rice tax available to public over Japan in 1732 was 630,000 koku - only 27% of average. Also, the epizooty killing draft animals has broke out in July 1732 in Fukuoka Domain. The prices to the rice on market soared, reaching 5 to 7 times of normal values during the peak of famine. Consequently, the fishing villages relying on cash products to get the essential foods were hardest hit, losing up to the third of the population. Average population die-off reported in Fukuoka Domain was 20% (66,000 of 320,000), while inland villages suffered less than 10% deaths. Majority of deaths were children. Southern Kyushu was also affected, but the mortality was less than in Northern Kyushu. Furthermore, at least 5919 deaths from starvation were recorded in Iyo-Matsuyama Domain, where people resorted to eating bracken and kudzu roots, straw and wood flour.Also, during the New Year celebrations of 1733, the household utensils and rice sacks of merchant Takama Denbii (高間伝兵衛)were thrown to river by a farmer's mob of 1,700 men frustrated by the rumours of him hoarding a food, in the event known in Japan as [...] - the first recorded strike action in Japan.|$|E
