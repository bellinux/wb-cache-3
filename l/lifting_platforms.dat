40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{modelling}} {{and experimental}} measurements {{led to the}} assessment of stress of structural nodes of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform,</b> which is used for relocation of cars from a production line. It also led to the optimization of producing process. Immediate load of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> by a car on stand causes additional bending moment that must be captured in a scissor mechanism. At the beginning the experimental measurements on the real <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> were made for obtaining of dependence of displacement, velocity and acceleration on time, which was almost 1. 5 ± 0. 1 g. Then a dynamical analysis of <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> was performed using the numerical method Runge Kutta 4 th order. Model analysis showed that the initial immediate acceleration of <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> at start and immediate deceleration at stop lead to dynamic shocks. These dynamic shocks are dangerous due to a long term operation because they permanently load not only pivots but also other parts – bearings and joining parts. A resonance may occur as well. In particular, dynamic shocks caused damage of structural nodes. Immediate load of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> by a car on stand causes additional bending moment. It is not appropriate {{in terms of a}} long-term operation. The recommended load <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> should be symmetrical...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEngineering {{industry}} {{is one of}} the prior sector where application of modern innovative technologies allow to gain better productivity. In order to produce new machines and devices we have to develop its design methods. As marketing analysis shows, there isn’t any manufacturer of load lifting mechanisms in our country. “Nurnberg scissors” type load lifting mechanisms are produced abroad. But such load <b>lifting</b> <b>platforms</b> are very dangerous and might overturn since equipments’ stiffness is low. Also these load <b>lifting</b> <b>platforms</b> are very heavy. The main reason is when mechanism is in the built-up condition its state is close to singularity, that is why it is very big on reactions of kinematical chains, the value of balancing force is very high. For instance in some equipments it can be observed that balancing force is 16 times higher than lifted load.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a method, which integrates digital human models (DHM) and virtual prototyping techniques to analyse ergonomic issues of devices {{to be used}} by workers. It is based on the comparison between the analysis of AS-IS and TO-BE scenarios with the aim of assessing design concepts, highlighting improvements or worsening and residual deficiencies to be faced. In particular, this paper refers to the case study of display units for groceries or supermarkets. Actually, workers who are in charge of filling the shelves perform highly repeated tasks, potentially dangerous for their health. The AS-IS and TO-BE analysis compares the actual practices with a new scenario in which workers are provided with <b>lifting</b> <b>platforms</b> to load the shelves. The method allows assessing several ergonomics parameters; in this study posture and fatigue are the most relevant. The results achieved with the simulations permitted to propose alternative solutions.

40|$|Conventional {{building}} inspection of bridges, dams or large constructions {{in general is}} rather time consuming and often cost expensive due to traffic closures and the need of special heavy vehicles such as under-bridge inspection units or other large <b>lifting</b> <b>platforms.</b> In consideration that, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will be more reliable and efficient as well as less expensive and simpler to operate. The utilisation of UAVs as an assisting tool in {{building inspection}}s is obviously. Furthermore, light-weight special sensors such as infrared and thermal cameras as well as laser scanner are available and predestined for usage on unmanned aircraft systems.

For this purpose, a fleet of UAVs, equipped with several sensors for navigation, obstacle avoidance and 3 D object-data acquisition, has been developed and constructed. This contribution deals with the potential of UAV-based data in building inspection.
