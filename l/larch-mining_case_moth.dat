50|$|Coleophora caespititiella is a moth of the Coleophoridae family. This {{species is}} found {{throughout}} the United Kingdom and much of Europe. It is also known from North America. The Coleophoridae group are often collectively known as the <b>case</b> <b>moths</b> or case-bearers.|$|R
50|$|The Coleophoridae are {{a family}} of large moths, {{belonging}} to the huge superfamily Gelechioidea. Collectively known as case-bearers, casebearing <b>moths</b> or <b>case</b> <b>moths,</b> this family is represented on all continents, but the majority are found in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. They are most common in the Palearctic, and rare in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Australia; consequently, they probably originated (like most or all other Gelechioidea families) in northern Eurasia.They are relatively common in houses, they seek out moist areas to rest and procreate.|$|R

50|$|Nontoxic traps {{are also}} {{available}} to monitor outbreaks. One type of trap is a triangular box with a pheromone lure and sticky walls inside. These traps are generally known as pheromone traps.

50|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate between pupa, chrysalis and cocoon. The pupa is the stage between the larva and adult stages. The chrysalis generally refers to a butterfly pupa although the term may be misleading as there are some moths whose pupae resembles a chrysalis, e.g.: the plume winged moths of the family Pterophoridae and some geometrid moths. A cocoon is a silk <b>case</b> that <b>moths,</b> and sometimes other insects, spin around the pupa.|$|R
5000|$|Certain moths, {{mainly of}} the {{subfamily}} Calpinae, are somewhat notorious for their blood- and tear-drinking habits. Hemiceratoides hieroglyphica of Madagascar {{has been noted}} to visit and suck tears by inserting their proboscis into the closed eyelids of roosting birds. Other <b>cases</b> of <b>moths</b> drinking human tears have been reported from Thailand. Some species of the genus Calyptra are called [...] "vampire moths" [...] as they suck blood from sleeping vertebrates, including humans. Ophthalmotropy (eye-attraction) and lachryphagy (tear drinking) occur {{in a number of}} unrelated moths that visit mammals. Mecistoptera griseifusa is a notable example.|$|R
50|$|For Cosmopterix gomezpompai a twirling {{behaviour}} {{has been}} observed by the adult. In this <b>case</b> the <b>moth</b> runs on the upper side of a leaf and simultaneously makes very fast circling movements. As soon as it comes across something unusual on the surface, like a spot, the circling slows down and is concentrated on that spot. It appears that it is feeding mostly on the dark brown spots (most likely {{a part of a}} bird dropping) on the leaf. Probably the moth is looking for nutrition. The twirling behaviour, without the possible feeding, has also been observed with Cosmopterix pulchrimella in Greece. This behaviour is described for Cosmopterix victor and also for a species of the family Gelechiidae.|$|R

5000|$|Cactoblastis cactorum shows both r-selected and k-selected {{life history}} traits. Although the moth reproduces {{more than once}} in its {{lifetime}} (a more k-selected trait), it produces a large number of eggs at one time (a more r-selected trait). A female moth can lay up to 50 eggs per generation, and produce at least three generations. Multiple generations are a sign of iteroparous reproduction. However, large amounts of offspring during a single generation time is a trait of semelparous reproduction. In this particular <b>case,</b> the <b>moth</b> also has high adult mortality rates which tend to push organisms towards semelparous reproduction. [...] Also, these generations occur over a short period of time, considering that an adult moth only lives for about nine days.|$|R

"In the <b>cases</b> of <b>moths</b> {{being like}} various {{species of the}} Hymenoptera aculeata wasps it is {{impossible}} to argue that the same environment and general conditions can produce habits in moths which are of no use whatever to them except as a disguise.

30|$|Several hundred traps {{were laid}} that {{included}} pheromones as attractants {{for either the}} webbing clothes moth or less commonly the <b>case</b> bearing clothes <b>moth.</b> The largest number {{were placed in the}} key London properties after 2004. The catch rate was 2.67 moths per trap where pheromone was present, as expected e.g. [9] much greater than the 0.065 moths per trap caught when it was absent; a more than thirty-fold increase in catch rate (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Some 29 % of the traps showed the presence of <b>moths</b> in the <b>case</b> of pheromone traps compared with 3.3 % presence {{in the absence of the}} pheromone. This situation was repeated in the Southeast where the catch rate was 3.18 and 0.03 for the pheromone and non-pheromone traps (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Fewer pheromone traps were laid for the <b>case</b> bearing clothes <b>moth</b> and most of these were in the West. However, here the situation was much as expected with increases in the catch rate 0.97 with pheromones and 0.05 without (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test) and the occupancy (respectively 20 % and 2.1 %).|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} combinations and gradients between semelparity and iteroparity. However, it is clear in this <b>case</b> that the <b>moth</b> {{is closer to the}} semelparous side of the scale. Semelparity is an r-selected trait, whereas iteroparity is a k-selected trait. Other r-selected traits that the moth exhibits besides large breeds of offspring and short life span are: a small body structure, low adult investment in rearing offspring, and high dispersal ability. This shows that the moth is much more r-selected than it is k-selected. Most invasive species tend to be r-selected individuals because of their high growth rate and dispersal ability.|$|R
30|$|Among {{the traps}} placed out {{there were more}} than 550 that {{contained}} pheromones to attract either the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella) or the <b>case</b> bearing clothes <b>moth</b> (Tinea pellionella). There are observations from more than 29600 of the simpler sticky traps, and it is these that form the basis of much of the discussion here. The data is difficult to interpret and gain an overall sense of distribution or change. On the simplest level it exists on almost 1500 individual spreadsheets collected for management purposes over more than ten years. The data contained on the individual spreadsheets were transformed to a single ASCII file for each territory, which could then be read by a wide range of software.|$|R
40|$|Habituation to sex pheromones {{is one of}} the key {{mechanisms}} in mating disruption, an insect control tactic. Male moths often show reduced sexual response after pre-exposure to female sex pheromone. Mating disruption is relatively rare in insect orders other than Lepidoptera. As a positive control we confirmed habituation in a moth (Epiphyas postvittana) using 24 h pre-exposure to sex pheromone to reduce subsequent activation behaviour. We then tested the impact of pre-exposure to sex or trail pheromone on subsequent behavioural response with insects from three other orders. Similar pre-exposure for 24 h to either sex pheromone (Pseudococcus calceolariae (Homoptera) and apple leaf curling midge Dasineura mali (Diptera), or trail pheromone of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile (Hymenoptera)), followed by behavioural assay in clean air provided no evidence of habituation after pre-exposure in these latter <b>cases.</b> The <b>moths</b> alone were affected by pre-exposure to pheromone. For pests without habituation, sustained attraction to a point source may make lure and kill more economical. Improved knowledge of behavioural processes should lead to better success in pest management and mechanisms should be investigated further to inform studies and practical efforts generally enhancing effectiveness of pheromone-based management...|$|R
50|$|A prime {{difficulty}} {{in dealing with}} codling moth infestations seems to lie with appropriate timing. The method of calculating 'degree-days' is often used by orchardists to approximate when a particular pest will reach a particular stage of development during a given season. Since stages of insect development are triggered by the accumulation of {{a certain amount of}} heat over time, this calculation involves careful tracking of changes in daily temperature. In the <b>case</b> of codling <b>moths,</b> adults emerging from pupae in bark and other overwintering spaces will mate and begin laying eggs soon after petal fall. For a given moth, this migration can take place within a mere two to three hours. Effective control using any method, therefore, depends crucially on identifying when decisive moments such as these occur.|$|R
50|$|After Bartholin's {{death in}} 1690, Árni became {{librarian}} and secretary to a Danish statesman, Matthias Moth, {{brother of the}} king's mistress, Sophie Amalie Moth. From late 1694 to late 1696, he was in Germany, primarily to assess a book collection that had been offered to the university, but he extended the stay. Meanwhile, presumably thanks to his employer, he was appointed a professor designate at the university, and since he had never published, while still in Leipzig he published an edition of some Danish chronicles that he had copied while working for Bartholin. When he returned to Denmark, he resumed working for Moth but in 1697 was also appointed secretary at The Royal Secret Archives (Det Kongelige Gehejmearkiv).

5000|$|Most B. vulgaris genotypes are {{naturally}} resistant to some insect {{species that are}} otherwise specialized on the crucifer family. In the <b>case</b> of diamondback <b>moth</b> (Plutella xylostella) and the flea beetle Phyllotreta nemorum, the resistance is caused by saponins. Glucosinolates such as glucobarbarin and glucobrassicin are used as a cue for egg-laying by female cabbage white butterflies such as Pieris rapae. Indeed, the larvae of this butterfly thrive well on this plant. Diamondback moth females are also stimulated by these chemicals, but the larvae die due {{to the content of}} saponins which are apparently not sensed by the moths. This phenomenon has been tested for biological insect control: B. vulgaris plants are placed in a field and attract much of the diamondback moth egg load. As the larvae die shortly after hatching, this kind of insect control has been named [...] "dead-end trap cropping".|$|R

30|$|Trends {{over time}} were {{difficult}} to establish. The total rate of catch of booklice (Liposcelis bostrychophila) increased over time, but when we examined the seven houses in London, where there were rather similar approaches to sampling, {{there was no evidence}} of similar trends or correlations. Determining the relationship between changes in catch and climate or environmental factors requires more thorough analysis. The distribution of insects in traps did not follow the Poisson distribution, expected if insects were randomly distributed. This is evident from the occasional capture of large numbers of insects and hints at the importance of infestation. Some insects showed a tendency to be associated with other insects at a higher frequency than expected, but there were no especially obvious entomological reasons for this, apart from the occasional association of adults with their larvae. Webbing and <b>case</b> bearing clothes <b>moths</b> were more abundant in pheromone traps, confirming effective capture through the use of attractants. Traps that are covered to prevent dust or admission of bats may not give a true indication of the distribution of other insect species.|$|R
40|$|EnThe {{knowledge}} on Lepidoptera in subterranean environments is scarce and fragmentary. Usually,the majority of references {{deals with the}} showy species,mostly Geometridae and Noctuidae,whereas other cavedwelling moths,including species adapted to eat bat-guano such as Tineidae moths,are disregarded. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to bring together the scattered literature on Lepidoptera recorded in Italian caves,both natural or arti &# 64257;cial,obtained from entomological and speleological journals,and to provide an up-to-date list of species. Moreover,the paper reports new records of Lepidoptera collected in about 40 caves of Central Italy from 1993 to 2005. Altogether, 65 species of cavernicolous Lepidoptera are known from Italy (40 %of the European species). The most abundant family was Noctuidae (20 species),followed by Geometridae (11 species),Alucitidae (7 species) and Tineidae (5 species). Four species of Tineid moths,belonging to Monopis e Niditi- nea genera,have cave-dwelling populations with their larvae feeding bird-guano. Other <b>cases</b> of <b>moths</b> having permanent cave-dwelling populations are Nudaria mundana (Linnaeus, 1761) (family Arctiidae),that feed on cryptogams in calcareous caves and Orectis proboscidata (Herrich-Schäffer, 1851) (family Noctuidae), observed in Sicily living inside lava tubes,where larvae feed on dead apical roots. Subtroglophiles elements are well represented;their larvae are phytophagous and adults regularly frequent caves for aestivation or hibernation. 15 species are reported,belonging mainly to the families crolepiidae,Alucitidae,Geometridae, such as Triphosa dubitata (Linnaeus, 1758) and Triphosa sabaudiata (Duponchel, 1830) and Noctuidae,such as Scoliopteryx libatrix (Linnaeus, 1758). The majority of remaining species are occasional visitors looking for a shelter, but some of them,for example Nymphalidae or genus Hypena (family Noctuidae), are frequently found in caves. Records of the pyralid moth Udea decrepitalis (Herrich-Schäffer, 1848),new for Central and Southern Italy and the noctuid moth Eremohadena chenopodiphaga (Rambur, 1832),a very localized species,are re- ported.

30|$|About 55 % of {{the traps}} {{of the more}} than 30000 traps {{examined}} over that period contained insects that were readily categorised. The rate of catch (insects/trap) was highest in London and the Southeast. Booklice (Liposcelis bostrychophila) and silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) were the most frequent catch. Woolly bear (Anthrenus spp.) larvae and crustacean woodlice (Porcellio spinicornis) were also common. A higher frequency of furniture beetles (Anobium punctatum) is notable in the Southeast and West. Despite this overall pattern, catch varied greatly between individual properties. The general view that insects have increased over time was not universal, although the dominant booklouse showed an increased catch over the last decade. The insects {{did not appear to be}} randomly distributed, but clustered onto traps in greater numbers than might be expected from a Poisson distribution, which suggested they occurred as infestations. Some insect species appeared in combination with other species at a higher frequency than expected, but the reasons for these associations were not always obvious. Pheromone traps collected more webbing and <b>case</b> bearing clothes <b>moths</b> (Tineola bisselliella, Tinea pellionella) than traps without attractants, much as expected.

40|$|The {{olfactory}} receptor neuron {{provides a}} good opportunity to analyze a biophysical model of a single neuron because its dendritic structure is simple and even close to a cylinder in the <b>case</b> of the <b>moth</b> sex-pheromone receptor cell. We have considered this cylindrical case and studied two main problems. First, we were concerned with the effect of the neuron’s length on the receptor potential for a constant stimulus-induced conductance change. An analytical solution for the receptor potential was determined by using input resistances. It was shown that the longer the neuron, the greater its ability to code over a wide range of values of the intensity of the stimulus. Second, we studied numerically the passive backpropagation of action potentials into the dendrite and its influence on the firing frequency. While propagat-ing along the dendrite the action potential decreases in amplitude and its shape becomes rounded. The firing frequency in the model with backpropagation was found to be greater than that obtained analytically in the absence of backpropagation. However, for any given conductance change, when normalized with respect to their maxima, both firing frequencies ‘Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 49...|$|R
40|$|A plant {{community}} {{may be considered}} as an assemblage of species whose chemical defenses against herbivores {{are more or less}} efficient. In the same way a community of phytophagous insects {{can be viewed as a}} group of consumers which are capable either of bypassing the plants'chemical defenses, or of taking advantage of them. The inter-relations between the two communities result in an array of compromise solutions originating from the coevolution of plants and insects. The pros and cons of such a coevolutionary theory of community structure are discussed. Particular attention is given to the following points : the concept of community structure, the major categories of toxichemicals and digestibility-reducing substances involved in the « arms race » between plant producers and animal consumers, the evolutionary mechanisms implied in coevolution, the costs and benefits of the alternative adaptive strategies adopted by insect consumers (with particular emphasis on their bioenergetic implications), and the dynamic aspect of coevolution. Whereas coevolution undoubtedly plays a role in plant-insect interactions, such a role should not be overemphasized. The weil documented <b>case</b> of the <b>moths</b> living on various oak species highlights sorne obvious inconsistencies.

40|$|There is scant {{literature}} describing inadvertent {{ingestion of}} insects visualized during endoscopy. 1, 2 Previously de-scribed insects include ants, wasps, bees, yellow jackets, and cockroaches. We present {{a case of}} a 55 -year-old male with a normal colonoscopy except for the discovery of a lifeless winged insect between folds of the trans-verse colon (Figure 1). In the image, the insect is ventral side up on the colon lining. Two compound eyes and abdomen are visible, but the thorax and portions of the wings are overexposed. Six legs can be discerned, and the insect had roughly a 6 -mm craniocaudal length and a 12 -mm wingspan. The image was later identified by an entomologist as a moth belonging to order Lepidoptera. Moths typically have scales covering the body and wings, but these scales are easily removed when exposed to an acidic environment. A loss of these scales explains the whitish coloration of the moth, as most of the pigmentation is found on the scales.

40|$|Abstract The case of {{industrial}} melanism in the peppered moth {{has been used}} as a teaching example of Darwinian natural selection in action for half a century. However, over the last decade, this case has come under attack from those who oppose Darwinian evolution. Here, the main elements of the case are outlined and the reasons that the peppered <b>moth</b> <b>case</b> became the most cited example of Darwinian evolution in action are described. Four catego-ries of criticism of the case are then evaluated. Criticisms of experimental work in the 1950 s that centered on lack of knowledge of the behavior and ecology of the moth, poor experimental procedure, or artificiality in experi-ments have been addressed in subsequent work. Some criticisms of the work are shown to be the result of lack of understanding of evolutionary genetics and ecological entomology on the part of the critics. Accusations of data fudging and scientific fraud in the case are found to be vacuous. The conclusion from this analysis of criticisms of the case is that industrial melanism in the peppered moth is still one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action and that it should be taught as such in biology classes.

The experiments were conducted in the Czech Republic, Greece and Italy during 2007 and 2008 in storage facilities that varied in their size and type, and included flour mills, retail stores, storage rooms with currants and raw grain stores. After a summer pre-treatment monitoring period to assess moth population in, dispensers containing TDA were placed in the fall. Adjacent facilities without dispensers were used as control units. Pheromone-baited traps were used to monitor the population fluctuation of the pyralid moths during the entire experimental periods. The presence of MD dispensers notably reduced the number of adults found in the traps in comparison with control rooms. Monitoring of female oviposition, measured as number of hatched larvae in cups containing food, indicated that there was a {{reduction in the number of}} larvae in the areas with MD dispensers. The results of the present work indicate that the use of mating disruption is feasible against pyralid moths in storage facilities, and should be further evaluated as a component of an integrated pest management based control strategy...|$|R
40|$|The Karoo is an arid inland plateau in {{the central}} and northeastern Cape Province of South Africa and is characterised by sparse, stunted {{vegetation}}. The vegetation is rich in species, and over large areas species of Pentzia, which are drought-resistant shrubs, are extremely abundant. These plants are food for stock (mainly sheep), and because the larvae of the Karoo caterpillar periodically occur in sufficient numbers to defoliate the plants, they assume pest status. Fully-fed Loxostege frustalis larvae construct cases in the soil beneath their food plants and they overwinter in these cases. A census of the numbers of larval cases accumulated in the soil, conducted from 1975 to 1980, showed that an expanded distribution of the pentzias {{is responsible for the}} periodic larval outbreaks. Further, alternate food plants are an important food supply for L. frustalis larvae when they disperse under crowded conditions The census data for L. frustalis were analysed by constructing partial life tables for the life-history period from <b>case</b> construction to <b>moth</b> emergence. The mortality of 'encased larvae' is useful for assessing the impact of the known L. frustalis natural enemies. The most important natural enemies were the braconids Chelonus curvimaculatus Cameron, Macrocentrus maraisi Nixon and the fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin. The collective responses of all the natural enemies to the density of L. frustalis encased larvae was direct, but undercompensating, so that areas with more pentzias produced more L. frustais. Strategies for immediate measures to alleviate the Karoo caterpillar problem, and for future research, are discussed. It is concluded that reduction of pentzia populations to acceptable levels and/or supplementing pastures with non-host plants of L. frustalis offer the only practical solutions to the Karoo caterpillar problem.

40|$|This report details one {{of three}} {{experiments}} performed during FY 2007 for the NASA RPC (Rapid Prototyping Capability) at Stennis Space Center. This RPC experiment assesses the potential of VIIRS (Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data for detecting and monitoring forest defoliation from the non-native Eurasian gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). The intent of the RPC experiment {{was to assess the}} degree to which VIIRS data can provide forest disturbance monitoring information as an input to a forest threat EWS (Early Warning System) as compared to the level of information that can be obtained from MODIS data. The USDA Forest Service (USFS) plans to use MODIS products for generating broad-scaled, regional monitoring products as input to an EWS for forest health threat assessment. NASA SSC is helping the USFS to evaluate and integrate currently available satellite remote sensing technologies and data products for the EWS, including the use of MODIS products for regional monitoring of forest disturbance. Gypsy moth defoliation of the mid-Appalachian highland region was selected as a <b>case</b> study. Gypsy <b>moth</b> is one of eight major forest insect threats listed in the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) of 2003; the gypsy moth threatens eastern U. S. hardwood forests, which are also a concern highlighted in the HFRA of 2003. This region was selected for the project because extensive gypsy moth defoliation occurred there over multiple years during the MODIS operational period. This RPC experiment is relevant to several nationally important mapping applications, including agricultural efficiency, coastal management, ecological forecasting, disaster management, and carbon management. In this experiment, MODIS data and VIIRS data simulated from MODIS were assessed for their ability to contribute broad, regional geospatial information on gypsy moth defoliation. Landsat and ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data were used to assess the quality of gypsy moth defoliation mapping products derived from MODIS data and from simulated VIIRS data. The project focused on use of data from MODIS Terra as opposed to MODIS Aqua mainly because only MODIS Terra data was collected during 2000 and 2001 -years with comparatively high amounts of gypsy moth defoliation within the study area. The project assessed the quality of VIIRS data simulation products. Hyperion data was employed to assess the quality of MODIS-based VIIRS simulation datasets using image correlation analysis techniques. The ART (Application Research Toolbox) software was used for data simulation. Correlation analysis between MODIS-simulated VIIRS data and Hyperion-simulated VIIRS data for red, NIR (near-infrared), and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) image data products collectively indicate that useful, effective VIIRS simulations can be produced using Hyperion and MODIS data sources. The r(exp 2) for red, NIR, and NDVI products were 0. 56, 0. 63, and 0. 62, respectively, indicating a moderately high correlation between the 2 data sources. Temporal decorrelation from different data acquisition times and image misregistration may have lowered correlation results. The RPC experiment also generated MODIS-based time series data products using the TSPT (Time Series Product Tool) software. Time series of simulated VIIRS NDVI products were produced at approximately 400 -meter resolution GSD (Ground Sampling Distance) at nadir for comparison to MODIS NDVI products at either 250 - or 500 -meter GSD. The project also computed MODIS (MOD 02) NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) products at 500 -meter GSD for comparison to NDVI-based products. For each year during 2000 - 2006, MODIS and VIIRS (simulated from MOD 02) time series were computed during the peak gypsy moth defoliation time frame in the study area (approximately June 10 through July 27). Gypsy moth defoliation mapping products from simated VIIRS and MOD 02 time series were produced using multiple methods, including image classification and change detection via image differencing. The latter enabled an automated defoliation detection product computed using percent change in maximum NDVI for a peak defoliation period during 2001 compared to maximum NDVI across the entire 2000 - 2006 time frame. Final gypsy moth defoliation mapping products were assessed for accuracy using randomly sampled locations found on available geospatial reference data (Landsat and ASTER data in conjunction with defoliation map data from the USFS). Extensive gypsy moth defoliation patches were evident on screen displays of multitemporal color composites derived from MODIS data and from simulated VIIRS vegetation index data. Such defoliation was particularly evident for 2001, although widespread denuded forests were also seen for 2000 and 2003. These visualizations were validated using aforementioned reference data. Defoliation patches were visible on displays of MODIS-based NDVI and NDMI data. The viewing of apparent defoliation patches on all of these products necessitated adoption of a specialized temporal data processing method (e. g., maximum NDVI during the peak defoliation time frame). The frequency of cloud cover necessitated this approach. Multitemporal simulated VIIRS and MODIS Terra data both produced effective general classifications of defoliated forest versus other land cover. For 2001, the MOD 02 -simulated VIIRS 400 -meter NDVI classification produced a similar yet slightly lower overall accuracy (87. 28 percent with 0. 72 Kappa) than the MOD 02 250 -meter NDVI classification (88. 44 percent with 0. 75 Kappa). The MOD 13 250 -meter NDVI classification had a lower overall accuracy (79. 13 percent) and a much lower Kappa (0. 46). The report discusses accuracy assessment results in much more detail, comparing overall classification and individual class accuracy statistics for simulated VIIRS 400 -meter NDVI, MOD 02 250 -meter NDVI, MOD 02 - 500 meter NDVI, MOD 13 250 -meter NDVI, and MOD 02 500 -meter NDMI classifications. Automated defoliation detection products from simulated VIIRS and MOD 02 data for 2001 also yielded similar, relatively high overall classification accuracy (85. 55 percent for the VIIRS 400 -meter NDVI versus 87. 28 percent for the MOD 02 250 -meter NDVI). In contrast, the USFS aerial sketch map of gypsy moth defoliation showed a lower overall classification accuracy at 73. 64 percent. The overall classification Kappa values were also similar for the VIIRS (approximately 0. 67 Kappa) versus the MOD 02 (approximately 0. 72 Kappa) automated defoliation detection product, which were much higher than the values exhibited by the USFS sketch map product (overall Kappa of approximately 0. 47). The report provides additional details on the accuracy of automated gypsy moth defoliation detection products compared with USFS sketch maps. The results suggest that VIIRS data can be effectively simulated from MODIS data and that VIIRS data will produce gypsy moth defoliation mapping products that are similar to MODIS-based products. The results of the RPC experiment indicate that VIIRS and MODIS data products have good potential for integration into the forest threat EWS. The accuracy assessment was performed only for 2001 because of time constraints and a relative scarcity of cloud-free Landsat and ASTER data for the peak defoliation period of the other years in the 2000 - 2006 time series. Additional work should be performed to assess the accuracy of gypsy moth defoliation detection products for additional years. The study area (mid-Appalachian highlands) and application (gypsy moth forest defoliation) are not necessarily representative of all forested regions and of all forest threat disturbance agents. Additional work should be performed on other inland and coastal regions as well as for other major forest threats...|$|R
