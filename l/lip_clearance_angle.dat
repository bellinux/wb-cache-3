40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThe {{drilling}} {{of metals}} produces undesirable projections {{at the surface}} of the hole called burrs, which are very costly to remove from the work piece. Any effort involved in simplifying the drilling process that decreases the burr size significantly helps in reducing deburring cost. This study focuses on the burrs formed in drilling of AL 6061 -T 6 at the exit side of the work piece as they are usually larger and have complicated shape and size. Two models are developed using back propagation neural networks to predict burr height and thickness separately as a function of point angle, chisel edge angle and <b>lip</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>angle.</b> The results of this research show that the height and thickness of the burr can be controlled by proper selection of drill bit that consists of suitable geometric parameters. The optimal geometric parameters that yield minimum burr height and thickness are also suggested. Thus, the model assists in identifying suitable drill bit that yields minimum burr height and thickness and as a result helps in reducing deburring cost...|$|E

The {{purpose is to}} examine the influences of various control factors on tool wear. Control factors under investigation include coating layer, side <b>clearance</b> <b>angle,</b> feed rate, and spindle speed.

Titanium alloy used commonly in aviation industry is one typical difficult-to-machine material.

Thus, chatter is one important restriction for the quality and efficiency of titanium alloy manufacture, especially for the thin-walled workpiece made of titanium alloy due to poor structural stiffness.

A trans-scale numerical framework is {{conducted with the}} purpose of revealing the underlying influence mechanism of tool structure parameters on subsurface dislocation configurations using a dislocation dynamics-based model, which considers both dislocation structural transformation and grain refining. Results showed that the developed framework not only captured the essential features of workpiece microstructure, but also predicted the subsurface damages layer states and their modifications. A series of defects were found in the material subsurface during the orthogonal cutting of titanium alloy, such as edge and screw dislocations, junctions, parallel slip lines, intersection dislocation bands, vacancy defects, and refinement grains. Particularly, in the process of micro-cutting, the depth of subsurface damages layer increased significantly with cutting length at the beginning, and then remained unchanged in the stable removal phase. Moreover, smaller edge radius and larger rake angle can greatly weaken the squeezing action and heat diffusion effect between the tool tip and workpiece, which further prevents the formation of subsurface defects and enhances finished surface quality.
