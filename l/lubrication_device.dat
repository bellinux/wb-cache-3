5000|$|The Salvator-Dormus M1893 {{also known}} as Skoda M1893 was a heavy machine gun of Austro-Hungarian origin. It was {{patented}} by Archduke Karl Salvator of Austria and Count George von Dormus and was manufactured by Skoda Works Plzeň. The Salvator-Dormus was chambered in the 8x50mmR round fed from an overhead magazine and was water-cooled with an oil <b>lubrication</b> <b>device.</b> There was also a pendulum adjustment in the trigger mechanism that allowed the operator to select the cyclic rate of fire, anywhere from 180 to 250 rounds per minute. The M1893 was cheaper than the Maxim gun but was gradually replaced by the Schwarzlose MG M.07/12. The M1893 machine guns were mounted aboard the SMS Zenta during the successful defence of the Austro-Hungarian Embassy in Peking.|$|E

50|$|The Breda 30 {{was rather}} {{unusual for a}} light machine gun. It was fed from a fixed {{magazine}} attached {{to the right side}} of the weapon and was loaded using brass or steel 20-round stripper clips. If the magazine or its hinge/latch were damaged the weapon became unusable. It also fired from a closed bolt along with using blowback for its action. The blowback operation was violent, and often resulted in poor primary extraction. During primary extraction, the initial very small rearward movement of the hot expanded cartridge case away from the chamber's walls must be powerful but very slow, if an automatic weapon is to be reliable. Separated cases resulting in jamming of the weapon beyond field clearing, were usually the consequence of poor primary extraction. Breda 30 also inherently lacked good primary extraction in its design and thus utilized a small <b>lubrication</b> <b>device</b> that oiled each cartridge as it entered the chamber. With the dust and sand of the deserts of North Africa, came a combination of premature wear and jamming.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the service life of gears and bearings inside the ranging arm, and increase {{the reliability of the}} shearer, the hydraulic system of the gear pump was installed for forced lubrication and cooling. The ranging arm gearbox was used as an oil tank for the automatic <b>lubrication</b> <b>device.</b> At the other side of shearer ranging arm I, screw pump 1 was mounted. In the gear oil tank, N 320 middle load gear oil was injected. The gear on axial group I drives the gears on the gear pump, and the lubricating oil in the pump, under the action of centrifugal force, was pumped out through the oil tube to filter, which filters out impurities in the oil. After the cooling, the oil was transported by pipeline to the axial group III, axial group IV, axial group V, axial group VI and axial group VII. Each axial group and gear had special holes drilled, and the lubricating oil lubricated the mating surfaces through the hole as the gear turned.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the areas where microhydrodynamics, flow of fluids in very reduced spaces of less than a millimeter, plays an important role. Historically, microhydrodynamics has been around forever. Examples of typical natural systems are the flow of blood in capillaries, of air in liquid lined lung passages, of sap in plants, of water, oil and gas in porous media, of suspended matter in liquids and gases, as well as the motion of microorganisms (bacteria), etc. In man made systems, microhydrodynamics is essential in bearings and <b>lubrication</b> <b>devices,</b> seals, filters, ore separation, etc. From the very beginning, scientist such as Poiseuille, Darcy, Stokes, Oseen and many others have contributed to the theoretical developments that, even today, guide most of the engineering applications. During the last ten years, the intense development of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS), due essentially to the continuum miniaturization of electronic devices, has prompted the birth and growth of modern microhydrodynamic with applications in areas as varied as micro heat exchangers, on-line biological analysis, on-line drug monitoring and delivery, cell manipulation, etc. Also, the flow of liquids through very small passages at high and very high velocities, such as in the injectors of Diesel engines and the valves of power steering has developed new challenges for scientists and engineers. The new trend is to move from micro to nano applications. Creating and controlling the flow of fluids at the nano scale is one of the challenges of the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|Single atomic {{monolayer}} (SAM) {{technology will be}} used to design an air bubble array for the <b>lubrication</b> of MEMS <b>devices</b> with sliding and rotating parts. Patterning a matrix of hydrophobic patches on a hydrophilic substrate will result in an array of air bubbles formed by the repulsive behavior of water molecules with the hydrophobic surfaces. The performance of the air bubble array will be determined by using a serpentine spring force gauge to measure the static friction required to pull a hydrophilic shuttle across the patterned substrate. Force calculations for air bubbles under hydrostatic pressure and a uniaxial compressive load show that the air bubbles will be able to withstand the external forces acting upon it. INTRODUCTON In MEMS devices with sliding and rotating parts, friction forces are the limiting factor to the successful performance of the device [1]. Previous work investigating the friction forces in micromotors suggests that hydrophobic lubricants are ideal for MEMS lubrication [1]. Alongside friction, adhesion is a common problem, especially in the fabrication process of various MEMS devices. Subjecting a structure to an aqueous rinse and dry cycle can form strong capillary forces that cause the collapse of beams and plates [1]. The application of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is a popular technique for creating hydrophobic surfaces that repel water to prevent adhesion [1, 3 - 5]. There have also been recent studies on using SAM technology for fluid directing and fluidic self-assembly by patterning hydrophobic-hydrophilic surfaces [6, 7]. This report investigates the use of SAM technology to design an air bubble array for the <b>lubrication</b> of MEMS <b>devices</b> with sliding and rotating parts. Patterning a matrix of hydrophobic patches on a hydrophilic substrate will result in an array of air bubbles formed by the repulsive behavior of water molecules with the hydrophobic surfaces (see Figure 1).

40|$|Nanodroplets on a solid surface (i. e. surface nanodroplets) have {{practical}} implications for high-throughput {{chemical and biological}} analysis, <b>lubrications,</b> lab-on-chip <b>devices,</b> and near-field imaging techniques. Oil nanodroplets can be produced on a solid-liquid interface in a simple step of solvent exchange in which a good solvent of oil is displaced by a poor solvent. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the formation of nanodroplets by the solvent exchange process under well-controlled flow conditions. We find that the contact angle of the nanodroplets is independent of the flow condition. However, there are significant effects from the flow rate and the flow geometry on the droplet size. We develop a theoretical framework to account for these effects. The main {{idea is that the}} droplet nuclei are exposed to an oil oversaturation pulse during the exchange process. The analysis gives that the volume of the nanodroplets increases with the Peclet number Pe of the flow as ∝ Pe^ 3 / 4, which is in good agreement with our experimental results. In addition, at fixed flow rate and thus fixed Peclet number, larger and less homogeneously distributed droplets formed at less narrow channels, due to convection effects originating from the density difference between the two solutions of the solvent exchange. The understanding from this work provides valuable guidelines for producing surface nanodroplets with desired sizes by controlling the flow conditions. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{problem of}} fluid flow and heat {{transfer}} in lid-driven cavities {{has been studied}} extensively because of the wide engineering applications such as cooling of electronic <b>devices,</b> <b>lubrication</b> technologies, food processing and float glass production, etc. In this study, a numerical investigation was conducted to analyze the steady state two-dimensional mixed convection in two sided lid-driven porous cavity under the combined buoyancy effects of thermal and mass diffusion. The left and right vertical walls are submitted to horizontal thermal and concentration gradients and they are moving in opposite directions. The horizontal walls are impermeable and thermally insulated. The finite volume method is used to resolve the governing equations of the flow using the formulation of Darcy-Brinkman. The heat and mass transfer rates were examined using several operational dimensionless parameters, such as the Richardson number Ri, Schmidt number Sc, Darcy number Da and buoyancy ratio parameter N. The results of this work illustrate that heat transfer and mass transfer characteristics inside the cavity are enhanced for low values of the Richardson number due to the dominant mechanical effect induced by the moving lids. Thinner mass boundary layers are observed along the bottom wall of the cavity {{with an increase in}} Lewis number resulting in higher mass transfer rates. In addition, it’s observed that heat and mass transfer are decreased for low values of the Darcy number...|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{tribological}} interactions, such as {{friction and}} adhesion between contacting interfaces {{is critical for}} the advancement of technologies such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. The challenge in MEMS <b>device</b> <b>lubrication</b> lies in the inherent nature of the material?s surface at the nanoscale as well as the nature of the surfaces typically used during experimentation. Device surfaces often display nanoscale roughness with surface asperities dictating the tribological properties between interfaces, yet the vast majority of past research has focused predominately on nanotribological studies of thin films on flat silicon substrates to model the behavior of these self-assembled wear-reducing coatings. New model surfaces have been manufactured and integrated into experiments in which surfaces with controlled asperity sizes act as more realistic models of MEMS surfaces. As friction and adhesion between real surfaces in sliding contact are dominated by the interactions of nanoscaled surface asperities, this research is an extension of previous work, moving beyond smooth surfaces by manufacturing and implementing new experimental platforms possessing controlled asperity sizes. The influence of asperity size on the tribological properties of these contacts is being studied for both native oxide and organosilane derivatized surfaces. These studies more readily mimic the conditions found at true asperity-asperity contacts. This research has aimed to develop new lubricant thin films that can effectively protect MEMS device surfaces during use with the long term goal of bringing MEMS devices out of the laboratory and into wide scale commercial use. This work investigates how self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on curved surfaces can be utilized in manners that their analogs on flat surfaces cannot. SAMs on curved asperities can be used to trap short chain alcohols, which during contact may be released to function as an additional lubricant layer on the surface. Both atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy have been employed to evaluate how chain disorder influences the protective function of these molecular lubricant layers on asperities. It was found that functionalized surfaces resisted wear and were able to operate under continuous scanning for longer time frames than unfunctionalized surfaces and that multicomponent films improved upon the performance of their base, single component analogs...|$|R
