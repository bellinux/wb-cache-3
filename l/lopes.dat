Their marriage took place before 1079, when the couple made a donation to San Millán. Ticlo may have brought part of Las Encartaciones to <b>Lope,</b> thus uniting them permanently with Biscay. She gave birth to an heir, Diego I, named after her father. The names Diego and <b>Lope</b> would alternate in {{the heads of the}} family for generations.

5|$|Around 1563 Lopez married Sarah Anes (b. 1550), {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of another New Christian refugee from the Portuguese Inquisition, the merchant Dunstan Anes, who {{had settled in}} London in 1540. According to Samuel, both the Anes and Lopez households secretly practised Judaism, which was then illegal in England, while outwardly conforming as Anglicans. Other scholars are ambivalent on the matter; Lopez would always insist {{that he was a}} Christian. Roderigo and Sarah had four sons and two daughters, of whom at least the eldest five—Ellyn (Elinor), Ambrose, Douglas, William and Ann—were baptised within the hospital precincts at St Bartholomew-the-Less between 1564 and 1579.

5|$|By the 1880s Romanticism was {{superseded}} by new literary styles. The first to appear was Realism, which had among its most notable writers Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis and Raul Pompeia. Newer styles that coexisted with Realism, Naturalism and Parnassianism, were both {{connected to the}} former's evolution. Among the best-known Naturalists were Aluísio Azevedo and Adolfo Caminha. Notable Parnassians were Gonçalves Crespo, Alberto de Oliveira, Raimundo Correia and Olavo Bilac. Brazilian theater became influenced by Realism in 1855, decades earlier than the style's impact upon literature and poetry. Famous Realist playwrights included José de Alencar, Quintino Bocaiuva, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Júlia <b>Lopes</b> de Almeida and Maria Angélica Ribeiro. Brazilian plays staged by national companies competed for audiences alongside foreign plays and companies. Performing arts in Imperial Brazil also encompassed the staging of musical duets, dancing, gymnastics, comedy and farces. Less prestigious, but more popular with the working classes were puppeteers and magicians, {{as well as the}} circus, with its travelling companies of performers, including acrobats, trained animals, illusionists and other stunt-oriented artists.|$|E

5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympic Games, Pramila Rijal {{was the oldest}} person to compete for Nepal at the London Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 27. She {{attained}} qualification to the Games {{with the use of a}} wildcard because she had not set any previous time for her event, the 100 metres. Rijal revealed that she had problems with the starting block but hoped the training in Kent would aid her in setting a new Nepalese national record. She took part in the event's fourth heat on 3 August, finishing sixth out of nine competitors, with a time of 13.33 seconds. The result was attributed to Rajal having back pain in the days before the event and required painkillers to help her cope. She finished in front of Janice Alatoa of Vanuatu (13.60 seconds) and Mihter Wendolin from Micronesia (13.67 seconds) but behind Lidiane <b>Lopes</b> of Cape Verde (12.72 seconds) in a heat led by Papua New Guinea's Toea Wisil (11.60 seconds). Rajal finished 71st out of 78 runners overall, and was 1.11 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the first round and did not make the later rounds.|$|E
5|$|In March 1995, American Tejano music singer Selena {{was shot}} and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of the singer's boutiques. The impact of the singer's death had a {{negative}} impact on Latin music, her genre—which she catapulted it into the mainstream market—suffered and its popularity waned following Selena's death. She continued to be the last remaining Tejano recording artist to appear on the United States Billboard 200 chart since 2000. In the fall of 2011, Chilean record producer Humberto Gatica and Capitol Latin senior vice president Sergio <b>Lopes</b> had the idea of turning Selena's songs into duets in popular music genres. Mexican singers Cristian Castro, Samo, American singers Don Omar, Carlos Santana, Selena Gomez (who was named after Selena), and Spanish singer Juan Magan lent their voices for the duet/remix style album. The project—named Enamorada de Ti—was released in April 2012 and debuted and peaked at number one on the U.S. Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart. Lo Mejor de...Selena followed the commercial success of Enamorada de Ti, released on the twentieth anniversary of Selena's death.

5|$|In architecture, {{the huge}} profits of the spice trade financed a sumptuous {{composite}} {{style in the}} first decades of the 16th century, the Manueline, incorporating maritime elements. The primary painters were Nuno Gonçalves, Gregório <b>Lopes</b> and Vasco Fernandes. In music, Pedro de Escobar and Duarte Lobo produced four songbooks, including the Cancioneiro de Elvas. In literature, Sá de Miranda introduced Italian forms of verse. Bernardim Ribeiro developed pastoral romance, plays by Gil Vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and Luís de Camões inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem Os Lusíadas. Travel literature especially flourished: João de Barros, Castanheda, António Galvão, Gaspar Correia, Duarte Barbosa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press. After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, Amerigo Vespucci coined the term New World, in his letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.|$|E
