2500|$|When {{electricity}} {{was first}} introduced into houses, it was primarily used for lighting. As electricity became a common method of operating labour-saving appliances, a safe means of connection to the electric system other than using a <b>light</b> <b>socket</b> was needed. According to British Author John Mellanby the first plug and socket in England was introduced by T.T. Smith in 1883, and there were two-pin designs by 1885, one of which appears in the (British) General Electric Company Ltd. catalogue of 1889. [...] Gustav Binswanger, a German Jewish immigrant who founded the (British) General Electric Company Ltd, obtained a patent (GB189516898) in 1895 for a plug and socket using a concentric (co-axial) contact system.|$|E
2500|$|Table lamp wire is {{typically}} #18, while extension cords are #16, with #14 common on cords grounded for outdoor use, and #12 available. [...] Mini Christmas lights were mostly #24 through 1997, when that gauge was arbitrarily de-rated from 3 to 2.5 amps, preventing manufacturers from getting UL certification {{for the same}} products which had already been approved {{for more than two}} decades. [...] They were forced to use the formerly heavy-duty standard of #22 wire (itself de-rated from 5 to 4 amps), plus thicker insulation, which in turn caused them to shortchange customers by drastically shortening the <b>light</b> <b>socket</b> spacing and usable length of sets. [...] This change also made light strings stiff and unsightly. [...] Heavy-duty mini lights are now 20 AWG, with larger screw-in bulbs having sockets on 18 AWG lamp wire.|$|E
2500|$|As {{electricity}} {{became a}} common method of operating labour-saving appliances, a safe means of {{connection to the}} electric system other than using a <b>light</b> <b>socket</b> was needed. Thomas Tayler Smith of London, England received British patent 4162 in 1882 for an [...] "Electric-Circuit Connection" [...] to [...] "enable the electric conductors conveying the current {{to one or more}} lamps, or along a flexible cord, to be rapidly and safely brought into connection with the line or main wires". [...] Smith subsequently received US patent 311,616 for the same device in 1885. [...] According to British Author John Mellanby there were British patents for plug and sockets granted to T.T. Smith in 1883 (No. 3883) and W. B. Sayers & G. Hookham in 1884, (No. 16655). [...] Mellanby also writes that there were two-pin designs by 1885, one of which appears in the (British) General Electric Company Ltd. catalogue of 1889.

50|$|Lightbulb <b>sockets,</b> <b>light</b> <b>sockets</b> lamp sockets or lampholders provide {{electrical}} {{connections to the}} lamps and support it in the lighting fixture. The use of sockets allows lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced (re-lamping). There are many different standards for these lampholders, created by de facto and by various standards bodies. A general coding system is a letter or abbreviation followed by a number. Some miniature lamps have wire leads suitable for direct connection to wires; some reflector lamps have screw terminals for wire connections.|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{cigarette}} <b>lighter</b> <b>socket</b> was originally designed only to heat a cigarette <b>lighter,</b> repurposing these <b>sockets</b> as generic power connectors {{can lead to}} many problems. In addition to the issues with partially-compatible physical dimensions, the plugs can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions, owing to poor retention. Also, {{there have been reports}} of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from ohmic resistance. [...] Non-vehicular use in stationary settings may avoid vibration problems when used as an alternative to 120 volt AC outlets, but low-quality connectors may still develop high resistance or intermittent contact.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} electric distribution {{lines in}} Appleton {{were made of}} bare copper. This posed many challenges in the early development of commercial electricity, because just about everything was made out of wood or other flammable materials.

Likewise, wood was used for fuse boxes, <b>light</b> <b>sockets,</b> and switch handles.|$|R
50|$|Some {{adapters}} {{for wall}} outlets use an Edison screw, allowing a <b>light</b> <b>socket</b> {{to become an}} ungrounded electrical outlet (such as to install Christmas lights temporarily via a porch light), or to make a pull-chain switch with two outlets, or to split it for two lamps.

50|$|Some modern coolers are thermoelectric, {{plugging}} into a car's cigarette <b>lighter</b> <b>socket.</b> Rather {{than using}} a compressor and refrigerant {{such as a}} refrigerator or other heat pump, these use the Peltier effect along with an external fan to draw away the heat. By reversing the current, this concept can also heat the contents instead of cooling them, useful for keeping meals hot from a drive-through, or even to keep items from freezing in severely cold climates.|$|R
