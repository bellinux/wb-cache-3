40|$|We use {{a dynamic}} model {{to study the}} effects of {{technology}} and learning on the long run economic growth rates of a leading and a <b>lagging</b> <b>region.</b> New technologies are developed in the leading region but technological improvements in the <b>lagging</b> <b>region</b> are the result of learning from the leading region's technologies. Our analysis sheds light on four salient questions. First, we determine the long run growth rate of output per human capital unit in the leading region. Second, we define a lagging to leading region technology ratio, study its stability properties, and then use this ratio to ascertain the long run growth rate of output per human capital unit in the <b>lagging</b> <b>region.</b> Third, for specific parameter values, we analyze the ratio of output per human capital unit in the <b>lagging</b> <b>region</b> to output per human capital unit in the leading region when both regions have converged to their balanced growth paths. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our analysis and then offer suggestions for extending the research described here...|$|E
40|$|Most prokaryotes contain CRISPR-Cas {{immune systems}} that provide {{protection}} against mobile genetic elements. We {{have focused on}} the ability of CRISPR-Cas to block plasmid conjugation, and analyzed the position of target sequences (protospacers) on conjugative plasmids. The analysis reveals that protospacers are non-uniformly distributed over plasmid regions in a pattern that is determined by the plasmid's mobilization type (MOB). While MOBP plasmids are most frequently targeted in the region entering the recipient cell last (<b>lagging</b> <b>region),</b> MOBF plasmids are mostly targeted in the region entering the recipient cell first (leading region). To explain this protospacer distribution bias, we propose two mutually non-exclusive hypotheses: (1) spacers are acquired more frequently from either the leading or <b>lagging</b> <b>region</b> depending on the MOB type (2) CRISPR-interference is more efficient when spacers target these preferred regions. To test the latter hypothesis, we analyzed Type I-E CRISPR-interference against MOBF prototype plasmid F in Escherichia coli. Our results show that plasmid conjugation is effectively inhibited, but the level of immunity is not affected by targeting the plasmid in the leading or <b>lagging</b> <b>region.</b> Moreover, CRISPR-immunity levels do not depend on whether the incoming single-stranded plasmid DNA, or the DNA strand synthesized in the recipient is targeted. Our findings indicate that single-stranded DNA may not be a target for Type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems, and suggest that the protospacer distribution bias might be due to spacer acquisition preference...|$|E

Derived from this comparative analysis, some lessons, which leading and <b>lagging</b> rural <b>regions</b> can learn from each other with regard to employment creation, are given. During the period 1980 - 1995 leading rural regions tend to have both growth in industrial employment and in services employment. Besides, in this period leading rural regions showed also a population growth, whereas that in <b>lagging</b> rural <b>regions</b> stagnated. Leading rural regions are characterized by a rather well developed road infrastructure relatively to <b>lagging</b> <b>regions.</b> So in leading regions infrastructure is no serious economic constraint for entrepreneurs, whereas the poorer condition of infrastructure in <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> hampers economic development. On the whole actors in leading regions show a better developed capacity than actors in <b>lagging</b> <b>regions.</b> This is for example reflected in the way in which they co-operate with other actors inside and outside the region, in which they face challenges, in which they innovate and in which they launch projects in line with the strengths and needs of the region. Due to the higher capacity of actors in leading regions, both internal and external networks are rather strong. Lessons, which may be helpful in the creation of employment in rural regions, are: design projects according to the strengths of the region, integrate infrastructure into a broader development concept, follow a multisectoral approach in employment creation, tourism is not the only solution, involve a wide range of local actors in the development process and strengthen both internal and external networks...|$|R
40|$|The {{geography}} of poverty has changed. More than 70 {{percent of the}} world s poor live not in low-income countries, but in middle-income countries. In 2008, nearly 570 million people lived on less than US$ 1. 25 a day in South Asia, compared to 385 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, nearly 70 percent of the poor people in South Asia live in the <b>lagging</b> <b>regions.</b> Improving the living standards of these regions is crucial to achieving the goal of shared prosperity. Economic growth is not sufficient to enable the <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> of South Asia {{to catch up with the}} leading regions, in terms of proportional reductions in poverty rates. Policies must be specifically targeted toward achieving greater growth and poverty reduction in these regions. One particular policy channel to achieve shared prosperity is pro-poor fiscal transfers. For the most part, interstate fiscal transfers in South Asian countries do promote equity through transfer of resources to poorer regions, but this outcome usually occurs when pro-poor redistribution has explicit rules and transparency. Further, simply directing financial resources to <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> may not be sufficient, and may need to be complemented with increases in capacity, transparency, and participation to facilitate accountability at the local level. Policy makers need to boost shared prosperity and take another look at the millennium development goal paradigm.

It is demonstrated that the short-, medium- and long-term effects of the policies on per-capita output and between as well as within regional inequality differ substantially depending on how successful the policy is in incentivizing firms to choose best available capital vintages and on how flexible labor markets are in the targeted region. ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{studies the}} {{differential}} effects that trade openness {{may have on}} leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> within a country. Examining data from India, we find that while trade liberalization is associated with reduced poverty, this effect is smaller in lagging states. The expected transmission of international prices to domestic prices with openness to trade is seen to be less perfect in lagging states than in leading ones, especially in the rural sector. This suggests that poverty reduction in <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> is impeded {{by the lack of}} exposure to international markets as opposed to another commonly argued factor – the competition to domestic production from international trade. Cross-country analysis with a sample of countries in South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) also suggests that countries with a smaller proportion of their populations in <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> experience greater reduction in poverty rates following trade liberalization. Our study confirms that though trade liberalization can bring gains, there is scope for policy to ensure that these gains are distributed more equally across sub-national regions. Our results highlight the importance of developing infrastructure including equipped ports, better and more extensive roads and communication links in exploiting gains from international trade. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{initiation}} of innovation in <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> {{has become one}} of the most pressing issues in regional policy. Several studies have attempted to identify the factors that influence the creation and development of product innovation in firms located in <b>lagging</b> <b>regions.</b> The identification of these factors could assist regional decision-makers in promoting technological innovation in such regions. The research question investigated in this study is whether the effectiveness of such regional policies is related to the degree of regional innovation potential and innovativness. This paper tries to deal with this central question by implementing an extended empirical model developed by the author. The Extended Model combines two prevailing probability models: LOGIT and Bayesian decision theory. The data analyzed in the paper were collected from a field survey of a sample of 211 industrial firms located in the northern region of Israel. In the first stage of the analysis, the model was used to identify variables influencing product innovation; the second stage investigates changes in the probability of producing innovations in the defined region. The results of the analyses point to the effectiveness of a regional policy that could promote and support the creation of factors fostering technological innovation in selected industries in <b>lagging</b> <b>regions.</b> ...|$|R

In this paper, we examine the contribution of location to regional economic growth using municipio-level data for the Brazilian Northeast-a historically <b>lagging</b> <b>region</b> of the country. We test if productivity among northeastern municipios is converging to a steady state and whether spatial externalities are linked to productivity growth in individual municipios. We find that, conditional on structural characteristics, productivity among municipios is converging at about 3 percent per year. Further, productivity in individual municipios is positively associated with own-structural characteristics but negatively associated with productivity growth in neighboring municipios. This means that there are negative spatial externalities coming from productivity improvements in neighboring regions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing, Inc. 2003...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} claimed {{that in recent}} years the {{evolution}} of regional disparities within European nations has become pro-cyclical, that is, disparities tend to increase in times of economic boom and to decrease during recessions. This represents a change with respect to the traditional patterns in the 1960 s and 1970 s, when growth in European <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> was higher than in the core during periods of economic growth, but <b>lagging</b> <b>regions</b> were more affected by economic crises. In this paper we first assess where and when this change has happened and then analyse what are the factors behind the change in the evolution of disparities. We use a 20 -year long database, comprising NUTS II regions in five European countries (France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain) which include the great majority of European <b>lagging</b> <b>regions.</b> The evidence supports the shift to pro-cyclical patterns in the evolution of regional disparities, especially in those countries with a large number of Objective 1 regions (Spain, Italy and, less clearly, in Greece) whereas in France such a change has not yet occurred. Looking for the determinants of regional economic cycles, we conduct regression analyses finding that the shift in growth patterns is related to the emergence of what is known as sheltered economies, i. e. economies that are increasingly detached from the market, and thus increasingly impervious to economic cycles. <b>Lagging</b> European <b>regions</b> have become over the period of analysis increasingly dependant on factors such as transfers, public investment, and public employment and therefore less exposed to changes in market conditions. ...|$|R
