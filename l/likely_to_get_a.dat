Generally, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim were more often prescribed for medical card and older patients, but less often in males, while ampicillin and co-amoxiclav showed the opposite, less often prescribed in medical card and older patients and more often in males. Quinolones were more often prescribed for medical card patients, older patients and males. For tetracycline and macrolides, both were less often prescribed to patients with medical cards (Table 2).|$|R

30|$|In {{a survey}} of {{physicians}} affiliated with tertiary hospitals, Karsli et al.

Recchia et al. [1] are right in suggesting a combination of visual displays and descriptions of the risk in order to help the patient understand the magnitude. It may be easier to perceive the approximate exposure of a specific examination if the dose is expressed by the corresponding number of chest radiographs rather than by the physical dose.

50|$|Batters also remain {{keenly aware}} of the count during their at bat. The count is {{considered}} to be in the batter's favor when there are more balls than strikes (e.g., two balls and no strikes). This puts pressure on the pitcher to throw a strike to avoid a walk so the batter is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> easier pitch <b>to</b> hit and can look for a particular pitch in a particular zone or take a riskier or bigger swing. The count is considered to be in the pitcher's favor when there are fewer balls than strikes (e.g., no balls and two strikes). This gives the pitcher more freedom to try enticing the batter to swing at a pitch outside the strike zone or throwing a pitch that is harder to control (e.g. a curve, slider or splitter), but that is also harder to hit. Thus the batter will take a more protective swing.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSuburbanization and car-ownership have {{increased}} rapidly in developing-world cities {{over the past}} half-century. This study examines the relationship between income, car ownership, and suburbanization across geographies and households in metropolitan Mexico City. Neither car-ownership trends by geography nor a mixed logit model of 43, 000 households’ joint car-ownership and residential-location decisions suggest that car ownership and suburbanization are moving hand-in-hand. Instead, wealthier households tend to live in central locations and own and drive cars, while poorer households tend to live further from the urban center and rely more heavily on transit. If a random household’s income doubles, that household is around 44 % more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> additional car and 29 % more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> live in the urban center. Given the sticky nature of housing supply and the current model of peripheral housing production, aggregate responses to higher income {{are more difficult to}} predict, as they will almost certainly be offset by higher prices. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that higher income and car ownership do not tend to encourage a move to larger houses on larger suburban lots in Mexico City...|$|R
