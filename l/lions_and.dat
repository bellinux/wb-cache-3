5|$|Although adult lions have {{no natural}} predators, {{evidence}} suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or members of the same pride fighting at a kill. Crippled <b>lions</b> <b>and</b> lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E

500|$|The <b>Lion</b> <b>and</b> Sun [...] {{remained}} the official emblem of Iran {{until after the}} 1979 revolution, when the <b>Lion</b> <b>and</b> Sun symbol was—by decree—removed from public spaces and government organizations and replaced by the present-day Coat of arms of Iran. For the Islamic revolution, the <b>lion</b> <b>and</b> sun symbol allegedly resembled the [...] "oppressive Westernizing monarchy" [...] {{that had to be}} replaced, despite the fact the symbol had old Shi'a meanings <b>and</b> the <b>lion</b> was associated with Ali. In the present day, the <b>lion</b> <b>and</b> the sun emblem is still used by a segment of the Iranian community in exile as the symbol of opposition to the Islamic Republic. Several exiled opposition groups, including the monarchists, and People's of Mojahedin continue to use the <b>lion</b> <b>and</b> sun emblem. In Los Angeles and cities with large Iranian communities the <b>lion</b> <b>and</b> sun emblem is largely used on mugs, Iranian flags, and souvenirs to an extent that far surpasses its display during the years of monarchy in the homeland.|$|R

5|$|The koala is {{classified}} with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial <b>lions</b> <b>and</b> giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia. The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.|$|E

5|$|The {{programs}} of the new center were geared toward educating children. Classrooms for the Discovery Center were housed in a dedicated building on the north wing of the zoo. Exhibits housed smaller species, eschewing elephants, tigers, and <b>lions,</b> <b>and</b> augmented displays with interactive exhibits. The public, however, continued to call the facility 'The Prospect Park Zoo', and over the ensuing thirteen years the old name quietly stuck. Even in WCS literature 'Prospect Park Zoo' is now used interchangeably with the new name.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to <b>lions,</b> <b>and</b> the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E
