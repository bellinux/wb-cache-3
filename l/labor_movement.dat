5|$|Finnish {{society had}} {{experienced}} rapid population growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive <b>labor</b> <b>movement.</b> The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> and the Finnish conservatives.|$|E

5|$|The Finnish <b>labor</b> <b>movement,</b> {{which emerged}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century from temperance, {{religious}} movements and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, working-class character. From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-burghers and the <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> concerning voting rights for the common people.|$|E
5|$|Eugene Debs helped {{motivate the}} American Left {{as a measure}} of {{political}} opposition to corporations and World War I.

Several books have been written about his life as an inspirational American socialist.|$|E

40|$|<b>Labor</b> <b>movements</b> {{are known}} to exist for {{the primary purpose of}} {{protecting}} the interests of labor in the society. They ensure members’ welfare and interests are given priority attention by employers and government. However, in Nigeria, <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> have emerged as champions of causes that exist outside the walls of corporate employment. They have become the voice of the voiceless, platform for the unheard and downtrodden, and the hope of the masses. Situated {{within the context of a}} belligerent climate of repression, exploitation, and subjugation by the political and economic managers of the state, <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> have turned around to push for reforms and transformation of the Nigerian society in different spheres. This study therefore examines the dynamic and phasic evolution of <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> in Nigeria, and how they have transformed from being a strictly industrial relations actor to a dynamic force for social change in the face of an unwilling, repressive, and indifferent state...|$|R

5|$|In 1953, under Meany's leadership, the International Longshoremen's Association, {{accused of}} racketeering, was {{expelled}} from the AFL, an early example of Meany's efforts against corruption {{and the influence of}} organized crime in the <b>labor</b> <b>movement.</b> After bitter internal reform, the union was readmitted to the now-merged AFL-CIO, in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the <b>labor</b> <b>movement.</b> On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E

In October 1945, he led the AFL boycott of the founding conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which welcomed participation by labor unions from the Soviet Union and was later called a communist front.|$|E

He assumed that in war-torn, splintering Europe, the proletariat of free nations would carry out socialist revolutions and unite with Soviet Russia later. The majority of the Finnish <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> supported Finland's independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential though few in number, favoured annexation of Finland by Russia. The question of annexation, in the aftermath of World War I, was resolved by the defeat of Red Finland and weakness of Russia.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] What {{power can}} counter the growing {{strength}} of MNCs {{and the forces}} of globalization?

Equally important, we would suggest, is the countervailing power of modernized <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> working actively at local, national, and transnational levels. Further, we suggest that in the current era, the renewal of national and local <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> may in fact depend greatly on increased coordination with the <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> of other countries. Transnational collaboration will be—and should be—an increasingly important feature of tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s global economy...|$|R

5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s, Dælenenga was {{dominated}} by the Workers' Sports Federation (AIF) and served as its main stadium in Oslo. AIF's Grünerløkka chapter was established at Dælenenga and used it as its training ground. Dælenenga was used for major AIF tournaments and the largest tournament took place 5 July 1929, with 500 participants. It also served as the terminus of many of AIF's and other <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> parades. Each May Day the stadium would be packed. From the early 1930s, AIF moved its largest tournaments to Jordal. The local AIF club was particularly good at boxing, and in 1937 gathered thousands of spectators to watch a boxing match at Dælenenga.|$|E
40|$|New <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> are {{currently}} emerging across the Global South. This {{is happening in}} countries as disparate as China, Egypt, and Iran. New developments are taking place within <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> {{in places such as}} Colombia, Indonesia, Iraq, Mexico, Pakistan and Venezuela. Activists and leaders in these <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> are seeking information from workers and unions around the world. However, many labor activists today know little or nothing about the last period of intense efforts to build international labor solidarity, the years 1978 - 2007. One of the key <b>labor</b> <b>movements</b> of this period, and which continues today, is the KMU Labor Center of the Philippines. It is this author’s contention {{that there is a lot}} unknown about the KMU that would help advance global labor solidarity today. This paper focuses specifically on the KMU’s development, and shares five things that have emerged from this author’s study of the KMU: a new type of trade unionism, new union organizations, an emphasis on rank and file education, building relations with sectoral organizations, and the need to build international labor solidarity...|$|R

5|$|Even the Jäger {{battalion}} {{was divided}} {{in the same}} way that the rest of the country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in Germany as they could have chosen the Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted a nationalist war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} {{passed a bill}} requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks, and many poor whites and Latinos. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring that minorities {{were excluded from the}} formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for their opposition to US involvement in World War I.|$|E
