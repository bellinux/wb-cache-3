In simulations where the number of nodes is varied, we observe an optimal value of cell density for which information in the grid is maximized.

A model of an equivalent circuit is proposed and a theoretical simulation and calculation are fitted with the experimental data. The principle of measurement is based on changes in the dielectric constant of the analyte dissolved in the buffer solution at different concentrations. Thus, an increased sensitivity is obtained at a higher measurement frequency (4 MHz).

40|$|International audienceOne {{essential}} {{advantage of}} digital microfluidic systems such as, for instance, drop-based <b>lab-on-a-chips,</b> {{is a massive}} parallelization of biochemical functions achieved by moving drops under surface acoustic waves or electrowetting on dielectrics (EWOD). This paper aims at characterizing the evaporation rate of a population of drops in a microsystem. Up to now, and despite its importance for end-users, the evaporation rate of one target drop selected among a population of drops has not been measured. This is essentially due {{to the difficulty of}} developing imaging in confined microfluidic drop arrays. In this paper, interferometry together with coplanar electrowetting are proposed as a new (non-imaging) evaporation rate measurement method fully compatible with digital microfluidic systems, and easy to be integrated into closed or open geometries. We investigate the impact on drop evaporation of different arrangements of drops and for different degrees of confinement. Use is made of dual-frequency electrowetting [1] : a classical actuation at a high-frequency (15 kHz) allows to set the contact angle equal to 90 while the low-frequency actuation (100 - 500 Hz) is responsible for the excitation of a perfectly spherical standing capillary wave along the drop surface. By considering natural frequencies of the oscillating drop and its capillary spectrum, it is possible to measure a spectral shift under evaporation. The evaporation law by Picknett and Bexon [2] is found valid even for a matrix of drops. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report an}} {{experimental}} study of 2 D microfoam coarsening confined in a micrometer scale geometry, the typical bubbles diameter being {{of the order of}} 50 - 100 Œºm. These experiments raise both fundamental and applicative issues. For applicative issues: what is the typical time of foam ageing (for a polydisperse foam) in microsystems in scope of gas pocket storage in <b>lab-on-a-chips?</b> Experimental results show that a typical time of 2 - 3 mn is found, leading to the possibility of short-time storing, depending on the application. For fundamental interests, 2 D foam ageing is generally described by von Neumann's law (von Neumann J., Metal Interfaces (American Society of Metals, Cleveland) 1952, p. 108) which is based on the hypothesis that bubbles are separated by thin films. Does this hypothesis still hold for foams confined in a 40 Œºm height geometry? This problematic is analyzed and it is shown that von Neumann's law still holds but that the diffusion coefficient involved in this law is modified by the confinement which imposes a curvature radius at Plateau borders. More precisely, it is shown that the liquid fraction is high on a film cross-section, in contrast with macrometric experiments where drainage occurs. An analytical description of the diffusion is developped taking into account the fact that soap film height is {{only a fraction of the}} cell height.

We loaded the described substrates with a PtCl(O, O‚Ä≤ ‚àí acac) (DMSO) antitumor drug and determined its release profile {{as a function of}} pore size over time up to 15 days. We observed that the efficacy of delivery augments with the pore size moving from small (‚àº 8 nm, efficiency of delivery ‚àº 0. 2) to large (‚àº 55 nm, efficiency of delivery ‚àº 0. 7). Then, we verified the adhesion of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells on the described substrates with and without the administration of the antitumor drug. This permitted to decouple and understand the coincidental effects of nano-topography and a controlled dosage of drugs on cell adhesion and growth. While large pore sizes guarantee elevated drug dosages, large fractal dimensions boost cell adhesion on a surface. For the particular case of tumor cells and the delivery of an anti-tumor drug, substrates with a small fractal dimension and large pore size hamper cell growth.

The advance of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and microfluidic technologies opened a major challenge for a large number of researchers, industrial health and bio companies to invest their time and budget into the avenue of Point of Care (POC) health instruments or devices that help in the early detection of cancer cells within the human blood, via circulating malignant cells. A large project that addresses the design of a point of care (POC) prototype in the area of bio-MEMS is presently ongoing in our laboratories. This device will enable the early detection of specific malignant species from a blood sample and integrates subprojects regarding the separation of malignant species from the blood sample, the characterization of these particles and the precise identification of the detected species. The detection method is based on the interaction between a microstructure, in this case a cantilever beam, and the reacting large organic molecules. The aim of the present work is the detection part and represents the effort of the candidate to confirm theoretically and experimentally a series of pre-existing experimental results performed within the research group. The detection experiments take in consideration both the specific deflection obtained by means of direct measuring and the optical variation of the capillary angle during the interaction at micro-level between a pair antibody-antigen. The option of performing the assessment on an in-plane configuration rather than the out-of-plane method is also taken in consideration.

40|$|<b>Lab-on-a-chips</b> and micro total {{analysis}} {{systems have}} been around for more than three decades. They find applications in medical, environmental and food diagnostics and appear in many different configurations and complexities. They all have in common that fluids are transported in small volumes through micrometer sized structures. A promising and growing subcategory of these microfluidic systems are the multiphase, droplet or segmented flow microfluidics. Discrete volumes of reagents are transported inside microfluidic channels, surrounded with an immiscible fluid or a gas, which prevents cross-contamination between the plugs or droplets. These droplets with a typical volume between 1 microliter and 1 picoliter can be used as reaction vessels for (bio) chemical reactions or for bioassays such as ELISA and PCR. They can be generated at high frequencies, up to 10000 per second, which is especially promising for high-throughput applications. Many commonly applied bioassays (e. g., ELISA) use a solid support to anchor the antibodies or capture probes, allowing the separation of targets from the complex biological matrices. Magnetic nano- or microparticles are perfectly suited for this task due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and the potential to magnetically separate them from the sample matrix. In that context droplet-based segmented flow microfluidics (DBSF) and on‚Äëchip manipulation of magnetic microparticles appears a logic and attractive combination. However, integrating both technologies requires a good understanding of micro-engineering, microfluidics and bioassay development to come to a successful diagnostic device. The objective of this PhD research was to study the integration of magnetic microparticle manipulations in a DBSF microfluidic chip. The first part of this work consisted mainly of capacity building. First, existing fabrication protocols for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chips were adjusted to match the available equipment and the design requirements. Next, DBSF was implemented in the microchannels. In order to minimize the absorption and migration of biomolecules, specific fluorocarbon was introduced, replacing traditional hydrocarbon-based oil. This in turn required corresponding surfactants and surface coating and made it necessary to repeat much previously reported work. The basic unit operations such as droplet generation, mixing and splitting were studied before novel concepts were attempted. In the second part, a novel microfluidic concept was developed to actively control the splitting ratio of droplets. A computational fluid dynamics model was composed, validated and implemented to simulate the effect of different designs and flow parameters. With the final design, droplet splitting ratios between 50 / 50 and 95 / 5 were achieved solely by controlling the operational parameters. This considerably reduces the time necessary to match the splitting ratio with potential (bio) assays in future work. The dynamic control especially accelerated the experimental phase of microparticle separation in the follow-up research. In the third part, the magnetic configuration to separate the microparticles from the sample matrix was studied using mathematical simulations and experimental tests. A detailed three-dimensional model of the magnetic field in proximity of a cubic permanent magnet was applied to accurately calculate the magnetic force on superparamagnetic particles. Using these results, the conditions for particle aggregation, attraction and immobilization were studied and good separation conditions were determined. In the improved setup, up to 90 % of the droplet volume was removed from the microparticles while the non-separated particle fraction remained below 5 %. Only when more than 95 % of the original sample volume was removed in a single purification step, 10 % of the microparticles were not correctly separated. Finally, in a last part, a selective DNA extraction assay with microparticles was studied in the DBSF microfluidic system to evaluate the overall performance of the novel design. It was demonstrated that the hybridization and capture efficiency of the biofunctionalized particles was identical for off‚Äëchip and on‚Äëchip methods. Also, the effect of the particle separation efficiency on the extraction efficiency was tested for different splitting regimes. Finally, the impact of separation at a higher splitting ratio for the repeated washing of the particles was discussed. The successful implementation of selective DNA extraction is new to the field of DBSF microfluidics and is very promising for future applications.
