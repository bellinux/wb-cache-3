In this paper we further investigate the <b>lead</b> [...] <b>lag</b> effect in financial markets, this time treating them as causal effects. To incorporate causality {{in a manner consistent}} with {{our previous}} study, that is including non-linear interdependencies, we base this study on a generalisation of Granger causality in the form of transfer entropy, or equivalently a special case of conditional (partial) mutual information.

We apply this procedure to stocks belonging to the NYSE 100 index for various time lags, to investigate the short-term causality on this market, and to comment on the resulting Bonferroni networks.

40|$|The {{derivation}} {{of a set}} of nonlinear coupled flap-lag-torsion equations {{of motion}} for moderately large deflections of an elastic, two bladed teetering helicopter rotor in forward flight is concisely outlined.

Quasi-steady aerodynamic loads are considered and the effects of reversed flow are included. The aeroelastic stability of the complete rotor is investigated using a linearized system of equations of motion. The equilibrium position about which the equations are linearized is obtained by considering the trim state of the helicopter, in true or simulated forward flight conditions. The sensitivity of the aeroelastic stability boundaries to interblade structural and mechanical coupling is illustrated by comparing the complete rotor stability boundaries with those obtained from a single blade analysis for a number of hover and forward flight cases...|$|E
