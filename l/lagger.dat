The studies were designed to determine their use of best practices and thus enable firms to identify areas in which {{they need to make}} improvements. The questionnaire contained around 200 questions to which 452 firms responded. In analysing the results, questions and responses were grouped into six categories. Two indices were developed.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the risks of}} developing asbestos-related diseases, we con- ducted a historical cohort study on 249 ship repair workers (90 <b>laggers</b> and 159 boiler repairers) in a single refitting shipyard in Yokosuka city, Japan. We successfully identified the vital status of 87 (96. 7 %) <b>laggers</b> and 150 (94. 3 %) boiler repairers, and, of these, 49 (56. 3 %) and 65 (43. 3 %) died, respectively, during the follow-up period from 1947 {{till the end of}} 1996. Our in-person interviews with some of the subjects clarified that asbestos exposure was considered to be substantially high in the 1950 - 60 s, decreased thereafter gradually but remained till the end of 1979 in the shipyard. The <b>laggers,</b> who had handled asbestos materials directly, showed a significantly elevated SMR (Standardized Mortality Ratio) of 2. 8 [95 % C. I. (Confidence Interval) : 1. 1 - 6. 5] for lung cancer. The magnitude of the risk developing the cancer was greater after considering a 20 -year latency (SMR= 3. 4). Pancreatic cancer also yielded a greater SMR than unity (5. 2, 90 % C. I. : 1. 4 - 16. 9) in the 20 -year latency group. Four <b>laggers</b> died from asbestosis. The boiler repairers, who had many chances for secondary exposure to asbestos and a few for direct exposure, showed no elevation of the SMR of lung cancer in either the overall group or the group after a 20 -year latency. One boiler repairer died from mesothelioma and four from asbestosis. We were able to interview 71 among 85 living retired workers. Forty-three (60. 6 %) of them had been diagnosed to have asbestosis by physicians. The prevalence of the subjects having asbestosis and working for 180 months and more was significantly higher than that among those working for a shorter period after adjusting the different distributions of ages and smoking habits. These results suggested that asbestos exposure in the refitting shipyard causally related to some types of malignant neoplasms among the deceased and to respiratory symptoms among the living retired workers...|$|R

40|$|Asbestos {{diseases}} are {{closely associated with}} cancer and death. They are therefore widely recognised for their insidious, fearsome and tainted nature. Through an examination of stress associated with disease, the paper explores the medical and legal framings of asbestos disease in the UK and complements them with an investigation of laggers’ (or thermal insulation engineers) personal and bodily experience of asbestos diseases. These emic perspectives are then contextualised through examination {{of the social and}} political-economic ramifications of disease and litigation in a context of increasing distrust of science and of authority. The paper argues that victims of asbestos-related diseases draw on – and extend – medical and statistical estimations of disease; but also challenge medical notions of cause and effect while advancing their perspective based on lived experience. The paper also shows that <b>laggers</b> are facing uncertain futures as a result of industrial exposure to asbestos, while their way of life and socio-economic standing is also under threat.

40|$|Purpose: Typical {{childhood}} and adolescent development and acquiring self-management skills are crucial for a satisfying adult life and autonomy in social participation. The aims {{of this study}} were to identify patterns of autonomy in social participation and to explore differences between these patterns. Methods: Adolescents with various chronic conditions participating in a survey in 2006 (T 0) were re-invited for a follow-up study (T 1) in 2012. The young adults (18 – 25 years of age) assessed self-management skills, their condition's impact on school or work, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and social participation in various domains. Patterns were identified through cluster analysis. Differences between patterns were analyzed in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Compared with healthy age-mates, our sample (n = 483) generally lagged behind in social participation. Four patterns emerged: typical developers, financially secure <b>laggers,</b> slow developers, and outgoing <b>laggers.</b> The patterns differed regarding gender, educational level, attending special education, having disability benefits, and degree of physical limitations. Groups with a higher level of autonomy in social participation did not necessarily have higher HRQoL but did report higher self-efficacy and independence at both measurements. Conclusions: Autonomy in some participation domains can coincide with a lack of autonomy in others. In addition, better social participation does not necessarily correlate with higher HRQoL, or vice versa. Yet, more social participation was associated with more self-efficacy and independence. Our results emphasize that there is no standardized approach. Clinicians should take care to address all life areas in clinical practice to screen patients' lived experiences and the need for social and self-management support. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mortality}} of 3000 male factory workers, 1400 <b>laggers,</b> and 700 women factory workers in east London has been studied. The men were first employed between 1933 and 1964, the women between 1936 and 1942. Textiles were produced {{until the late}} 1950 s {{as well as other}} asbestos products. <b>Laggers</b> were employed on contract in increasing numbers in later years. Crocidolite asbestos was used until the late 1950 s as well as asmosite and chrysotile. Exposure of workers was graded according to the job into two categories, low/moderate and severe, and subdivided by duration of employment up to two years or longer. Mesothelial tumours accounted for 7. 5 % of the total mortality in men, and 9 % in women with their longer follow up period. Lung cancer accounted for 20 % of deaths in men and 14 % in women. Both mesothelial tumours and lung cancer showed a dose response relationship. Histopathological examination of a series of predominantly postmortem specimens showed 22 % of adenocarcinomas of lung among men and 21 % in women. There was an excess of gastrointestinal tumours but no dose response relationship could be shown. Among severely exposed male factory workers there was an excess of deaths from cancer of the larynx and among severely exposed women of carcinoma of the breast and ovary. Twenty four deaths (2 %) were due to asbestosis. There is an indication that the incidence of mesothelial tumours is declining but a further period of observation is required for confirmation...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores people’s {{experience}} of asbestos-related diseases {{in relation to}} medicine, identity and gender. The paper adopts a comparative approach, examining the experiences of impoverished former asbestos mine workers in South Africa and working class factory workers and <b>laggers</b> in the United Kingdom (UK). These two areas are connected through the activities of Cape plc, a company that dealt with asbestos for about a hundred years, mining in the Northern Cape of South Africa and manufacturing and processing in Barking, in the UK. As indicated in the title, these industrial diseases are not contracted through worker negligence, but rather because of governments’ and managements’ framing of risk and the implementation of safety measures. The {{first part of the}} paper therefore contrasts authoritative and emic values through the examination of governmental recognition of risk and people’s own understandings of danger. The second part of the paper examines gendered and identity issues, focusing on how men’s masculinity is both undermined and bolstered through their involvement with asbestos production, while women’s identity is primarily vested in their household and primary caretaker role. Throughout the paper, a comparative anthropological approach focuses on the similarities of ‘meaning’ and subjective interpretations – as contrasted with the country specific medical, legal and political categorisations of disease with which these people regularly engage – highlighting how people experience, interpret and respond to asbestos-related diseases. Using an ‘effects made by gender approach’, the paper also examines how asbestos diseases intersect with identity, leading people to emphasise conventional gender roles.
