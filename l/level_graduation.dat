40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the job placement process, competition and satisfaction on part of graduate students from Virtual University of Pakistan. The study was qualitative in nature. Few research questions were framed. The sample comprised of 24 graduate students of Virtual University working on managerial posts in different multinational companies. The sample was chosen through chain sampling technique. An interview protocol was used as research tool. The data from interview protocol was analyzed through thematic analysis technique. It was found that the well groomed graduates of virtual university felt no problem in finding out their proper jobs in multinational companies. It was also found that graduates from FAST institute, LUMS University, COMSAT institute etc competed with graduates of virtual university in most of the cases. It was suggested that courses of competitive nature with respect to their usage in market may be arranged. A strong coordination among institutions of higher learning with national and multinational companies was also suggested.

40|$|PSNP is an {{approach}} to improve livelihood of more than 7. 5 Million people. Graduation of beneficiaries from the program was among the measurements which show effectiveness of PSNP, determines the sustainability of PSNP client’s livelihood and realizing the broader food security agenda. There is low level of graduation in the study area. The main objective {{of this study was}} to identify factors affecting household PSNP graduation in Emba Alaje district of Tigray Region, Ethiopia. Primary and secondary data were used for this study. Cross-sectional survey was employed taking a sample of 235 households selected through systematic random sampling technique to gather data using semi structured questionnaire. Moreover, focused group discussion and interview were employed to collect qualitative data. Furthermore, the study employed binary logistic regression model to identify the factors determining household <b>level</b> <b>graduation</b> from PSNP. The finding of the study shows, 78. 30 % of the beneficiaries didn’t believe the graduated households are food self sufficient rather the respondents argue, there is no significant difference among the current and graduated beneficiaries. The binary logistic regression results showed that, sex, credit, irrigable land ownership, total crop production and targeting mechanism had a positive and significant impact on graduation, while dependency ratio and drought negatively influence graduation. Likewise, implementation of PSNP graduation is not satisfactory because the process failed to be consistent with the PSNP implementation manual and graduation guidance note. These all leads to premature graduation of program participants which change perception of graduation from being food self sufficient to matter of receiving cash or food aid for six years. To achieve food self sufficiency officials should follow the implementation manual, supporting beneficiaries beyond PSNP projects and experience need to be shared from PSNP plus projects in Ethiopia...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} effects of environmental conditions on graduation and dropout rates in the United States. Neighborhood effects studies are not uncommon, however they typically fail to account for serious selection issues that potentially bias results. The contribution of this dissertation is to offer an alternative approach, natural experiments, to deal with such methodological problems. The dissertation consists of one theoretical chapter and two analytical chapters. In chapter one, I establish the econometric difficulties of estimating neighborhood effects and outline how a natural experiment can obviate these problems if applied correctly. This chapter sets up the rest of my dissertation, which includes two empirical chapters using major urban riots and county mass layoffs as natural experiments. In chapter one, I describe the econometric difficulties of estimating neighborhood effects within the context of youth educational well-being. I outline the three levels of selection bias, individual, family and school, that researchers normally confront when attempting {{to examine the effects of}} community conditions on education outcomes. While most studies attempt to minimize individual and family level bias, they often neglect to account for school level context. Doing so will lead to biased results because model parameters will fail to reflect the lack of independence between units due to clustering within schools and the deep selection issues caused by the interwoven relationship between neighborhoods and schools. I then outline the conditions under which a natural experiment can solve these problems. This chapter sets the stage for the two empirical articles that make up the rest of my dissertation. In the first analytical chapter, I examine the effects of large urban riot shocks to city wide conditions on aggregate dropout rates. Using decennial census data, I examine the 1960 s civil rights riots on city level school non enrollment rates. I find that the 1960 s urban riots had negative short- and long-term consequences on school enrollment rates. In order to test the robustness of these results to a more contemporary setting, I estimate the effect of the 1992 Los Angeles riots on city and census tract level dropout rates. I find evidence of a short-term effect, but no long-term impact. In the second empirical chapter, I estimate the effects of diminished county conditions due to mass layoff occurrences in the U. S from 1996 to 2010 on county <b>level</b> <b>graduation</b> and dropout rates. Although I find no evidence of a negative single year effect on schooling persistence rates, I uncover lagged and cumulative effects. Specifically, I find that a large two-year lagged shock has a negative effect on current graduation rates. I also find that minor and large four-year average shocks have a significant effect on graduation and dropout rates. These results indicate that point-in-time measurements may not capture the temporal effects of neighborhood disadvantage, especially for processes like schooling persistence that may not be sensitive to minor, short-term shocks...|$|E
