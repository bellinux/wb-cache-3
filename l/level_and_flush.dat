40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of potentially harmful phytoplankton was examined in the oyster-growing estuaries of New South Wales. Forty-five taxa from 31 estuaries were identified from 2005 to 2009. Harmful species richness was latitudinally graded for rivers, with increasing number of taxa southward. There were significant differences (within an estuary) in harmful species abundance and richness for 11 of 21 estuaries tested. Where differences were observed, these were predominately due to species belonging to the Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima group, Dinophysis acuminata, Dictyocha octonaria and Prorocentrum cordatum with a consistent upstream versus downstream pattern emerging. Temporal (seasonal or interannual) patterns in harmful phytoplankton within and among estuaries were highly variable. Examination of harmful phytoplankton in relation to recognised estuary disturbance measures revealed species abundance correlated to estuary modification <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> <b>flushing</b> time, with modified, slow flushing estuaries having higher abundance. Harmful species richness correlated with bioregion, estuary modification <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> estuary class, with southern, unmodified lakes demonstrating greater species density. Predicting how these risk taxa and risk zones may change with further estuary disturbance and projected climate warming will require more focused, smaller scale studies aimed at {{a deeper understanding of}} species-specific ecology and bloom mechanisms. Coupled with this consideration, there is an imperative for further taxonomic, ecological and toxicological investigations into poorly understood taxa (e. g. Pseudo-nitzschia). 22 page(s...|$|R
40|$|One hundred eighty four Zel ewes, 3 - 5 {{years of}} age were used to {{evaluate}} the effects of strategic supplementary feeding prior to mating and doses of PMSG to ewe synchronization on reproductive performance of Zel ewes mated to Zel or Shal rams. The ewes fed diets containing two levels of metabolizable energy, 2. 0 or 2. 3 Mcal kg - 1 with 115 g kg - 1 DM crud protein for 21 days prior to mating period. After 7 days of experiment, the ewes were synchronised with intra vaginal CIDR devices containing 1. 9 g progesterone for 14 days. Ewes received 300 or 500 IU of PMSG injection at CIDR removal time and later mated with Zel or Shal ram. All important reproductive parameters such as ewe fertility, prolificacy, lambing rate, lamb mortality and twining measured. The results showed that Shal rams increased ewe fertility (p< 0. 05) but not affected by PMSG administration <b>and</b> <b>flushing.</b> Ewes bred to Shal rams had higher fertility compared to ewes bred to Zel rams. Prolificacy was not affected by PMSG administration but it was significantly affected by diet and ram (p< 0. 05). High dietary energy resulted in a higher prolificacy. Lambing rate changed with energy <b>level</b> <b>and</b> ram breed (p< 0. 05) <b>and</b> high <b>level</b> of energy increased lambing rate by 26 %. Administration of 500 IU PMSG resulted in higher lamb mortality in compared to 300 IU (p< 0. 05).

40|$|To {{study the}} {{diversity}} in the in vitro and phenological responses, the model discriminant was used. Six new hybrid cocoa genotypes namely L 120 -A 2, L 126 -A 3, L 231 -A 4, L 232 -A 9, L 233 -A 4 and L 330 -A 9 were analyzed. Three culture media namely PCG 1, PCG 3 and PCG 4, based on DKW basal medium, only differing in hormonal concentration, were sown with staminodes and petals extracted from floral buds. SCA 6 and C 151 - 61 were used as controls. The 6 cocoa hybrids were assessed 3 months later by scoring and calculating of the callogenesis and embryogenesis variables. Parameters from variable means were processed via the Principal Component (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster (HCA) and Factorial Discriminant Analyses (FDA). For the PCA, the number of embryogenic explants, embryos number yielded per embryogenic explants, embryogenesis percentage, flowering <b>level,</b> fructification <b>level</b> <b>and</b> leaves <b>flush</b> were revealed to be pertinent. It was {{the same in the}} first year of the study. However, for the FDA, only the number of callogenic explants <b>and</b> leaves <b>flush</b> were showed to be pertinent. This indicates that the pertinentness appears to vary from analysis to analysis. Cocoa hybrids known as L 120 -A 2, L 126 -A 3, L 231 -A 4 and L 330 -A 9 yielded the highest number of callogenic explants and expressed the highest leaf flush. The first 3 are half sibs of common father IMC 67, justifying their belonging to the same group. The discriminant model associated with the analysis is spelt Z 1 = - 29. 123 + 0. 201 *Flush + 1. 710 *Ncal. It significantly and completely discriminated the clusters in the proportion of 96. 20 %.
