40|$|We have {{previously}} shown {{the existence of}} migratory hematopoietic stem cells in adult solid organs. This study demonstrates that granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (G-CSF) and <b>lisofylline,</b> a phosphatidic acid inhibitor that suppresses hematopoiesis-inhibiting cytokines, can enhance the engraftment of organ-based hematopoietic stem cells. When syngeneic heart grafts or liver nonparenchymal cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated (9. 5 Gy) Lewis rats, complete hematopoietic reconstitution and animal survival were significantly improved by treating the recipient with G- CSF or, to a lesser extent, with <b>lisofylline.</b> Pretreatment of hepatic nonparenchymal cell donors with G-CSF, but not <b>lisofylline,</b> also resulted in striking improvement of recipient survival which was associated with an augmented subpopulation of donor stem cells. The results suggest that these drugs {{can be used to}} enhance the chimerism that we postulate to be the basis of organ allograft acceptance...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the kinetics of pentoxifylline formation from <b>lisofylline</b> in human liver microsomes using selective inhibitors of cyto-chrome P 450 isozymes, correlation studies with specific isozyme activities, and cDNA-expressed human CYP 1 A 2 and 2 E 1. A bipha-sic model fitted the data {{best for the}} formation of pentoxifylline, Km 1 5 0. 282 6 0. 135 mM, Vmax 1 5 0. 003 6 0. 001 nmol/min/mg protein, Km 2 5 158 6 42. 6 mM and Vmax 2 50. 928 6 0. 308 nmol/ min/mg (N 5 4). Pentoxifylline formation by the low Km isoform (200 mM <b>lisofylline)</b> required NADPH, was not inhibited by any isozyme-specific P 450 inhibitor, and was inhibited only 10 % and 20 %, re-spectively, by aminobenzotriazole and N-octamylamine. We con-cluded that the low Km enzyme was not a cytochrome P 450. At 5 mM of <b>lisofylline</b> the CYP 1 A 2 inhibitor, furafylline, inhibited pentoxi-fylline formation by 58. 8 %, and the nonspecific CYP 2 E 1 inhibitor, diethyldithiocarbamate, inhibited pentoxifylline formation b...|$|E
40|$|Certain phosphatidic/plasmanic/plasmenic acid (PA) species {{function}} as lipid intermediates in cell activation and may function directly as intracellular signaling molecules. PA {{can also be}} dephosphorylated to 1, 2 -diradyl-sn-glycerol by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. Treatment of various cell types, including murine P 388 monocytic leukemia cells, with bacterial lipopolysaccharide rapidly stimulates large increases in PA and PA-derived diradylglycerol. Pentoxifylline, 1 -(5 -oxohexyl) - 3, 7 -dimethylxanthine, inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated formation of PA in P 388 cells at high concentrations (IC 50 = 500 microM). <b>Lisofylline</b> [1 -(5 R-hydroxyhexyl) - 3, 7 -dimethylxanthine] is a unique metabolite of pentoxifylline in humans and is > 800 -fold more active as an inhibitor of PA formation than pentoxifylline (IC 50 = 0. 6 microM). <b>Lisofylline</b> does not inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and generation of phosphatidylinositol-derived diradylglycerol. <b>Lisofylline</b> but not pentoxifylline protects BALB/c mice from endotoxin lethality when administered 4 hr after lipopolysaccharide. This protective effect is independent of either agent's effect on suppression of plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha. These data suggest that inhibitors of PA formation may have significant clinical potential {{in the treatment of}} sepsis and septic shock...|$|E
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{and radical}} scavenging properties of 8 -oxo derivatives of pentoxifylline, <b>lisofylline,</b> enprofylline (3 -propyl xanthine), and 1, 7 -dimethyl enprofylline were studied in vitro. The {{results show that}} 8 -oxopentoxifylline and 8 -oxolisofylline are signifi-cantly better hydroxyl and peroxyl radical scavengers and more potent inhibitors of t-butylhydroperoxideinduced lipid peroxidation in human erythrocyte membranes than the parent drugs. The ydroxyl radical scavenging property of 8 -oxoenprofylline and its analogue 1, 7 -dimethyl- 8 -oxoenprofylline is marginally etter than their corresponding xanthines. Interestingly, 1, 7 -dimethyl- 8 -oxoenprofylline is an effective inhibitor of lipid peroxidation whereas enprofylline, 1, 7 -dimethylenprofylline, and 8 -oxoenprofylline exhibit significantly less activity. All the 8 -oxo derivatives tested are better hydroxyl radical scavengers than uric acid, a natural antioxidant and a free radical scavenger in humans. The rate constant for the reaction between 8 -oxopentoxifylline and hydroxyl radical is 1. 6 - 4. 2 × 10 ^ 10 M^- 1 s^- 1 which is {{comparable to that of}} dimethyl sulfoxide (1. 4 - 1. 6 × 10 ^ 10 M^- 1 s^- 1) and better than that of mannitol (1. 9 - 2. 5 × 10 ^ 9 M^- 1 s^- 1), the known hydroxyl radical cavengers. Both 8 -oxo pentoxifylline (IC_ 50, 1. 8 ± 0. 08 μ M) and 8 -oxolisofylline (IC_ 50, 2. 2 ± 0. 13 μ M) are as efficient peroxyl radical scavengers as uric acid (IC_ 50, 1. 9 ± 0. 05 μ M). The results presented clearly indicate that the anti-inflammatory property of pentoxifylline and <b>lisofylline</b> is exerted more through their 8 -oxo derivatives than through the parent drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} {{the effect of}} the xanthine derivates <b>lisofylline</b> (LSF) and pentoxifylline (PTX) on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and the de-activating cytokine interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) by human leucocytes during stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), heat-killed Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) or Gram-positive bacteria (GPB). The production of TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta by leucocytes stimulated with LPS, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) or Streptococcus pneumoniae was inhibited by both drugs. The production of IL- 10 by leucocytes stimulated with LPS and Hib was inhibited by both xanthine derivates only at 48 hr. However, incubation of leucocytes with S. pneumoniae in the presence of LSF or PTX stimulated the production of IL- 10 about four- and twofold at 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively. In all instances, the extent of inhibition or enhancement of cytokine production by LSF or PTX was equal. The divergent effects of xanthine derivates on the IL- 10 production indicate the existence of distinct intracellular pathways depending on whether leucocytes are stimulated by GPB or GNB...|$|E
40|$|Background The signal {{transducer}} and activator of transcription- 4 (STAT 4 /Stat 4) is a {{transcription factor}} known to convey signals from interleukin- 12, interleukin- 23, and interferon-alpha/beta to the nucleus, resulting in activation of dendritic cells, T-helper cell differentiation {{and production of}} interferon-gamma. Objective To demonstrate a novel role for STAT 4 in cell mitosis. Results Phosphoserine STAT 4 (pSerSTAT 4) is increased in cells undergoing mitosis, and is distributed throughout the cytoplasm during {{this stage of the}} cell cycle whilst phosphotyrosine STAT 4 (pTyrSTAT 4) is confined to the chromosomal compartment. This distinct pattern of pSerSTAT 4 during mitosis is seen in vitro in human keratinocytes and in other cell types. This is also present in vivo in cells undergoing mitosis in normal skin, psoriasis and squamous cell carcinoma. Inhibition of STAT 4 phosphorylation by <b>lisofylline</b> and depletion of STAT 4 by RNA interference results in a delay in progression of mitosis and leads to a reduction in cells completing cytokinesis. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that STAT 4 plays a role in enabling the normal and timely division of cells undergoing mitosis. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{results from the}} autoimmune and inflammatory destruction of insulin-producing islet β cells, rendering individuals devoid of insulin production. Recent studies suggest that combination therapies consisting of anti-inflammatory agents and islet growth-promoting factors {{have the potential to}} cause sustained recovery of β cell mass, leading to amelioration or reversal of type 1 diabetes in mouse models. In this study, we hypothesized that the combination of the anti-inflammatory agent <b>lisofylline</b> (LSF) with an active peptide fragment of islet neogenesis associated protein (INGAP peptide) would lead to remission of type 1 diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. We treated groups of spontaneously diabetic NOD mice with combinations of LSF, INGAP peptide, or control saline parenterally for up to 6 weeks. Our results demonstrate that the mice receiving combined treatment with LSF and INGAP peptide exhibited partial remission of diabetes with increased plasma insulin levels. Histologic assessment of pancreata in mice receiving combined therapy revealed the presence of islet insulin staining, increased β cell replication, and evidence of Pdx 1 -positivity in ductal cells. By contrast, diabetic animals showed severe insulitis with no detectible insulin or Pdx 1 staining. We conclude that the novel combination treatment with LSF and INGAP peptide has the potential to ameliorate hyperglycemia in the setting of established type 1 diabetes via the recovery of endogenous β cells and warrant further studies...|$|E
40|$|Lipid-induced insulin {{resistance}} {{is associated with}} intracellular accumulation of inhibitory intermediates depending on the prevalent fatty acid (FA) species. In cultured myotubes, ceramide and phosphatidic acid (PA) mediate {{the effects of the}} saturated FA palmitate and the unsaturated FA linoleate, respectively. We hypothesized that myriocin (MYR), an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis, would protect against glucose intolerance in saturated fat-fed mice, while <b>lisofylline</b> (LSF), a functional inhibitor of PA synthesis, would protect unsaturated fat-fed mice. Mice were fed diets enriched in saturated fat, n- 6 polyunsaturated fat, or chow for 6 wk. Saline, LSF (25 mg/kg · d), or MYR (0. 3 mg/kg · d) were administered by mini-pumps in the final 4 wk. Glucose homeostasis was examined by glucose tolerance test. Muscle ceramide and PA were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Expression of LASS isoforms (ceramide synthases) was evaluated by immunoblotting. Both saturated and polyunsaturated fat diets increased muscle ceramide and induced glucose intolerance. MYR and LSF reduced ceramide levels in saturated and unsaturated fat-fed mice. Both inhibitors also improved glucose tolerance in unsaturated fat-fed mice, but only LSF was effective in saturated fat-fed mice. The discrepancy between ceramide and glucose tolerance suggests these improvements may not be related directly to changes in muscle ceramide and may involve other insulin-responsive tissues. Changes in the expression of LASS 1 were, however, inversely correlated with alterations in glucose tolerance. The demonstration that LSF can ameliorate glucose intolerance in vivo independent of the dietary FA type indicates it may be a novel intervention for the treatment of {{insulin resistance}}...|$|E
40|$|Central {{obesity is}} {{associated}} with low-grade inflammation that promotes type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in obese individuals. The 12 - and 5 -lipoxygenase (12 -LO and 5 -LO) enzymes {{have been linked to}} inflammatory changes, leading to the development of atherosclerosis. 12 -LO has also been linked recently to inflammation and insulin resistance in adipocytes. We analyzed the expression of LO and proinflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue and adipocytes in obese Zucker rats, a widely studied genetic model of obesity, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome. mRNA expression of 12 -LO, 5 -LO, and 5 -LO-activating protein (FLAP) was upregulated in adipocytes and adipose tissue from obese Zucker rats compared with those from lean rats. Concomitant with increased LO gene expression, the 12 -LO product 12 -HETE and the 5 -LO products 5 -HETE and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) were also increased in adipocytes. Furthermore, upregulation of key proinflammatory markers interleukin (IL) - 6, TNFα, and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 were observed in adipocytes isolated from obese Zucker rats. Immunohistochemistry indicated that the positive 12 -LO staining in adipose tissue represents cells in addition to adipocytes. This was confirmed by Western blotting in stromal vascular fractions. These changes were in part reversed by the novel anti-inflammatory drug <b>lisofylline</b> (LSF). LSF also reduced p-STAT 4 in visceral adipose tissue from obese Zucker rats and improved the metabolic profile, reducing fasting plasma glucose and increasing insulin sensitivity in obese Zucker rats. In 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, LSF abrogated the inflammatory response induced by LO products. Thus, therapeutic agents reducing LO or STAT 4 activation may provide novel tools to reduce obesity-induced inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Background. The role of {{leukocyte}} {{migration and}} chimerism in organ allograft acceptance has been {{obscured by the}} lack of information about the late localization of the donor cells. Methods. Male Lewis rat→female Brown Norway abdominal heart transplantation was performed under tacrolimus immunosuppression (days 0 - 13, 20, and 27) with or without donor bone marrow and (in bone marrow subgroups) a 1 -week postoperative course of a possibly chimerism-enhancing drug. Using rat sex-determining region-Y-specific oligonucleotide primers, we determined the donor DNA concentration by polymerase chain reaction in serial venous blood sampies for 100 days and in tissue specimens when animals were killed. Results. Chimerism was detected out to 56 days in 89 % of the blood samples but in none of the samples at 100 days. However, donor DNA was detected when animals were killed in 95 % of the native hearts, 80 % of the skin biopsy specimens, and 23 % of the spleens. The presence and quantity of early and late chimerism were strongly correlated the administration of adjunct bone marrow and with a reduction in the vasculopathy and inflammation index in the cardiac allografts. Marginally significant further increases in chimerism and/or reductions in chronic heart rejection beyond those achieved with adjunct bone marrow alone were associated with additional treatment with the growth factors Flt- 3 ligand, granulocyte colonystimulating factor, and a recombinant molecular variant of interleukin- 6 (interleukin- 6 mutein) but not with hepatocyte growth factor or <b>lisofylline.</b> Conclusions. The previously suspected shift of early chimerism in the blood and lymphoid organs to dominance in host nonlymphoid tissues is consistent with the dual mechanisms of clonal exhaustion and immune indifference, governed by antigen migration and localization, that have been postulated elsewhere to account for organ allograft acceptance...|$|E
