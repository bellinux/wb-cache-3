5000|$|Many {{possible}} uses of terahertz sensing and imaging {{are proposed}} in manufacturing, quality control, and process monitoring. These in general exploit the traits of plastics and cardboard being transparent to terahertz radiation, {{making it possible}} to inspect packaged goods. The first imaging system based on optoelectronic terahertz time-domain spectroscopy were developed in 1995 by researchers from AT&T Bell Laboratories and was used for producing a transmission image of a packaged electronic chip. This system used pulsed laser beams with duration in range of picoseconds. Since then commonly used commercial/ research terahertz imaging systems have used pulsed lasers to generate terahertz images. The image can be developed based on either the attenuation or phase delay of the transmitted terahertz pulse. Since the beam is scattered more at the edges and also different materials have different absorption coefficients, the images based on attenuation indicates edges and different materials inside of an objects. This approach is similar to X-ray transmission imaging, where images are developed based on attenuation of the transmitted beam. In the second approach, terahertz images are developed based on the time delay of the received pulse. In this approach, thicker parts of the objects are well recognized as the thicker parts cause more time delay of the pulse. Energy of the <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> are distributed by a Gaussian function. The geometry and behavior of Gaussian beam in the Fraunhofer region imply that the electromagnetic beams diverge more as the frequencies of the beams decrease and thus the resolution decreases. This implies that terahertz imaging systems have higher resolution than scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) but lower resolution than X-ray imaging systems. Although terahertz can be used for inspection of packaged objects, it suffers from low resolution for fine inspections. X-ray image and terahertz images of an electronic chip are brought in the figure on the right. Obviously the resolution of X-ray is higher than terahertz image, but X-ray is ionizing and can be impose harmful effects on certain objects such as semiconductors and live tissues. To overcome low resolution of the terahertz systems near-field terahertz imaging systems are under development. In nearfield imaging the detector needs to be located very close {{to the surface of the}} plane and thus imaging of the thick packaged objects may not be feasible. In another attempt to increase the resolution, laser beams with frequencies higher than terahertz are used to excite the p-n junctions in semiconductor objects, the excited junctions generate terahertz radiation as a result as long as their contacts are unbroken and in this way damaged devices can be detected. [...] In this approach, since the absorption increases exponentially with the frequency, again inspection of the thick packaged semiconductors may not be doable. Consequently, a tradeoff between the achievable resolution and the thickness of the penetration of the beam in the packaging material should be considered.|$|E

METHODS AND RESULTS: C 57 /BL 6 mice of different ages were treated with diode laser photocoagulation per eye and perfused with PBS containing fluorescein-labeled dextran at different time of observation. Choroid flat mounts, were then examined by fluorescence microscopy for the measurement of CNV area. Messenger-RNA expression levels of several angiogenic cytokines in eye cups of male and female C 57 BL/ 6 mice at 5 - 8 and 16 - 20 week-old were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assay. The results showed significantly more CNV area in eyes of female mice compared to male mice with the expression level of several angiogenic cytokines elevated. 16 - 20 -week-old female mice developed the biggest area of CNV. The mean area of CNV increased significantly at the 14 th day after photocoagulation. <b>Laser</b> <b>spots</b> delivered 1 PD away from the optic disc induced the biggest area of CNV compared to those 2 PD or 3 PD away.

Methods: Focal laser treatment of diabetic macular edema in 54 consecutive patients was digitally planned on fundus images and performed using the navigated laser photocoagulation system Navilas&reg; (OD-OS GmbH, Teltow, Germany). Treatment-related pain was quantified on a visual analog scale directly after treatment and compared with a matched control group who received conventional laser treatment (n = 46). In addition, for Navilas-treated patients, the accuracy of spot placement on color images was analyzed 1 month after treatment. Results: In total, 5423 <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> (mean 100 per eye) were analyzed. With navigated treatment, 90 % of <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> were visible on color images, of which 96 % were within 100 &micro;m from the target. Eighty percent of the <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> were placed and visible within the 100 &micro;m target on an intention-to-treat basis for color imaging. Optical coherence topography confirmed that laser effects were limited to the outer retina. Treatment-related pain following navigated laser photocoagulation was significantly lower than that of conventional laser treatment (1. 6 vs 4. 4 on a visual analog scale, P &lt; 0. 001). Conclusion: Navigated laser effects could be visualized to a high percentage on post-treatment color images, and their location showed a high concordance to targeted areas. Patients reported that treatment-related pain following Navilas laser photocoagulation was significantly lower than pain following conventional laser treatment.

40|$|This study proposes an {{innovative}} three-dimensional (3 D) Interactive Simulated-Globe System application. The instrument includes: {{a data processing unit}}, a wireless control unit, an image capturing unit, a laser emission unit {{as well as}} 3 D hemispheric body imaging. The 3 D hemispheric body imaging is designed to display the output image from a data processing unit. The Laser emission unit is for emitting a <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> on the output image. Based on the spherical coordinates of the <b>laser</b> <b>spot,</b> detected by a data processing unit through an image capture unit, the spherical coordinates, with a plane coordinates converter operation, can provide spherical coordinates to convert into plane coordinates for the data processing unit. Utilizing the coordinates location, of the <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> through image acquisition, calibration and internal coordinates with external coordinate converter operation can be guided the cursor, output by the data processing unit on 3 D hemispheric body to launch synchronous movement with <b>laser</b> <b>spot.</b> To combine wireless control technology can perform synchronous driven, control and interactive with the software image on 3 D hemispheric body. This work allows general planet software such as Google Earth (Mar, Moon), used in a variety of panel displays or projection turn into the 3 D hemispheric body, and then through the <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> emitted by the laser emission unit and wireless control unit, allows the <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> in synchronization to control the cursor and software on the 3 D hemispheric body imaging for a variety of interactive, and then perform the effect of 3 D interactive globe system in any classroom or astronomical Museum for formal and Social education.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{approach}} for laser-based environment device control systems based on the automatic design of a Fuzzy Rule-Based System for laser pointer detection. The idea is to improve the success rate of the previous approaches decreasing as much as possible the false offs and increasing the success rate in images with <b>laser</b> <b>spot,</b> i. e., the detection of a false <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> (since this could lead to dangerous situations). To this end, we propose to analyze both, the morphology and color of a <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> image together, thus developing a new robust algorithm. Genetic Fuzzy Systems have also been employed to improve the <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> system detection by means of a fine tuning of the involved membership functions thus reducing the system false offs, which is the main objective in this problem. The system presented in this paper, makes use of a Fuzzy Rule-Based System adjusted by a Genetic Algorithm, which, based on laser morphology and color analysis, shows a better success rate than previous approaches...|$|R
40|$|A fiber optical <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> microscope, {{which allows}} the {{simultaneous}} measurements of photocurrent and reflected light intensity or the measurement of <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> photocurrent under the illumination of other light sources, has been developed to study semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces. The capability of this microscope was demonstrated on as-cleaved and Pt-treated p-InSe. The Pt treatment increased the photocurrent and improved the lateral resolution due to the increase of surface reaction rate. The higher photocurrent was observed {{at the spot where}} the reflectivity was higher. This behavior is considered to be due to an uneven distribution of platinum. The <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> photocurrent image under the illumination of other light sources provided useful information to clarify whether the rate was controlled by surface or bulk properties of InSe...|$|R
