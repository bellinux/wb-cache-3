5|$|Recorded in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada.

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
