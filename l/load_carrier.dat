The other vehicles were named to reflect their function; Striker anti–tank guided weapons, Spartan armoured personnel carrier; Samaritan ambulance; Sultan command and control and Samson recovery vehicles.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the field}} of {{transport}} logistics, the planning of routes is usually executed centrally. However, current trends in transport logistics exhibit higher degrees of dynamics and complexity. Central algorithms are not adequate in handling these new challenges. Therefore, new solutions are required. Within this context, the Distributed Logistics Routing Protocol (DLRP) for the autonomous and decentralized routing in transport logistic networks has been developed. In previous work, two types of logistic entities have been integrated within the DLRP, transport vehicles and transport goods. In order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} DLRP in scenarios, which are closer to reality, <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> are integrated into the DLRP as a new type of logistic entities. <b>Load</b> <b>carriers</b> can be applied as supporting components for the transport of goods. Within this work, the concept of the integration of <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> is presented. Furthermore, the influences of the integration are investigated. For that, different scenarios are generated, which enable the comparison with simulations without integrated <b>load</b> <b>carriers.</b> Key-Words:- Autonomous control- Distributed logistics routing protocol (DLRP) – Transport logistics – Routing algorithm – <b>Load</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. Long-term Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{monitoring}} for potentially life-threatening posttransplant {{lymphoproliferative disorder}} (PTLD) has identified asymptomatic patients who maintain high EBV loads over long periods. Methods. Thirty-one pediatric liver transplant recipients were designated as 11 chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> (EBV DNA level 15000 copies/mL of whole blood for 16 months) and 20 control recipients. Serial quantification of EBV DNA, measurement of interleukin 10 (IL- 10) concentrations, EBV-specific tetramer staining, and relative quantification of EBV gene expression in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} were performed. Results. Most of the chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> were seronegative at transplant, the median time to resolution of a chronic high EBV load was 23 months, and no recipient developed late-onset PTLD. EBV DNA was detected predominantly in CD 19 + cells. The plasma concentration of IL- 10 and the EBV-specific CD 8 + cell frequency {{did not differ}} significantly between the chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> and the control recipients. Analysis of gene expression showed that EBV-encoded small RNA 1, BamHI A rightward transcripts, and latent membrane protein 2 were positive in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers.</b> Conclusions. EBV-infected cells in the blood of chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> expressed a highly restricted set of latency genes, suggesting that the EBV-infected cells escaped from a T cell response...|$|R

40|$|The {{report is}} part of the university´engineer program within Industrial Organization and Economics with {{specialization}} in Logistics and Managment at Jönköping´s university. Skoghall´s mill underlies a large supply chain, which means there should be a lot of areas in need of small improvement measures. This report illustrates a small part of one of these areas and is focused on the loading distribution services in the terminal Vänern. At the moment there´s a very unequal load of the <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> SECU box and Container at the terminal. Skoghall´s mill has the desire to equalize the high and low load levels of the 2 <b>loading</b> <b>carriers</b> named previously. One of the options to solve the problem is to set a limit of how much the <b>carriers</b> can <b>load</b> per week or per day. The mill also wants it to be investigated if the proposition would influence the customers in any way and if both the company and its customers could handle a lower level of delivery services in case the proposition was to be applied. The goal to be achieved with this thesis is to provide balance to the unequall loading of the 2 <b>load</b> <b>carriers,</b> SECU and Container, and investigate whether or not the Skoghall´s mill´s customers, could manage the lower degree of delivery service that the proposition would imply. For this goal to be achieved, random sample investigations were taken from orders of a customer that is provided with SECU <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> and the same was made with a Container´s customer. The orders were analysed from production to consumption on the investigation. As a result of random sample investigations and customers´s evaluations, the thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} lower the resources at Vänerterminalen. This means that there is a full possibility to limitate the loadingprocess without causing any major effects on Stora Enso´s customers. Further investigation should be made by the company, such as random sample investigations of more customers, to generate a better picture of what the proposition would mean in reality. In case that investigation turn out to be not in accordance with the thesis, the authors worked on other two solution propositions. Both of them also would contribute to a more even torrent of unloading at Vänerterminalen...|$|R
