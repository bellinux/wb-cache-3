5|$|During {{the days}} after the landing, the ground forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area. AIB {{personnel}} manned an outpost to warn of the approach of Japanese forces, while the combat troops patrolled and established positions near the main <b>landing</b> <b>area.</b> On 6 November the company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion was moved by landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, and subsequently guarded the tracks leading to this area. This unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions to the east of Jacquinot Bay. During this period the 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the <b>landing</b> <b>area,</b> though one of its companies gradually established an outpost between 8 and 12 November.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle of}} Morotai began at 6:30 {{on the morning}} of 15 September. Allied {{warships}} conducted a two-hour-long bombardment of the <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> to suppress any Japanese forces there.

5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their <b>landing</b> <b>area.</b> The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|All four of {{the common}} jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run {{alongside}} the central 60m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> are also alongside the central running track. Shot put (or weight throw) is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area {{is similar to the}} outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the RAAF {{were also}} {{available}} {{to support the}} landing. The plan for the operation specified that, if required, No. 6 Squadron, reinforced with Beauforts from No. 8 and No. 100 Squadrons, would attack the <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> before 6 am on 4 November. An additional two Beauforts could also observe for any bombardments made by the warships. Prior to the landing, the air strike was cancelled by the RAAF officer who {{was attached to the}} landing force to coordinate air support as no opposition was expected.|$|E

50|$|If Schmitt's Island (83-42) {{is granted}} {{the status of}} <b>land</b> <b>area,</b> it is the northernmost <b>land</b> <b>area</b> of the earth, because it {{is closer to the}} North Pole by 2.8 km than ATOW1996.

In most geography books Kaffeklubben Island is still listed as the northernmost land point.|$|R
5|$|In the 1860s {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to improve the <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are some huge boulders which were known throughout the Highlands and Islands in the 19th century as Doirneagan Hirt, Hirta's pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Montcalm in {{particular}} would {{have benefited from}} practicing a more irregular form of warfare. He apparently never inspected the <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> {{at the north end}} of Lake George, which was a location from which he could contest the British landing. Furthermore, the French could then have used the confined woodlands to blunt the numerical advantage of the British, and contested the entire portage road. The fact that fortifications were built along the portage road but then abandoned by the French is one indication of this failure of strategic thinking. Nester estimates that contesting the first crossing on the portage road would have gained Montcalm an additional day for defensive preparations.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery and {{his troops}} {{spent the first}} night near the <b>landing</b> <b>area,</b> under light fire from the British guns. The next morning, he ordered Major Timothy Bedel to occupy a {{position}} north of the fort, but when Montgomery saw that his men were apprehensive, he chose to lead the mission himself. As Montgomery led his troops, they came upon a fight between British troops and another American party. Montgomery took command of the skirmish and forced the British party back into the fort. Montgomery sent Bedel with a force to entrench themselves about a mile north of the fort. Montgomery then put other troops around the fort and began a siege.|$|E

5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} landing behind the 8th Infantry Brigade, {{capturing}} {{the port of}} Ouistreham and linking up with the 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword, where they were holding the high ground near La Plein and the bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal. No. 6 Commando, with Lovat's brigade headquarters, came ashore on Queen Red beach of the Sword <b>landing</b> <b>area,</b> near La Breche, at 8:40am on 6 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Marines {{were able}} to deploy two M1919 Browning machine guns to provide suppressing fire on Gavutu's caves, {{allowing}} more Marines to push inland from the <b>landing</b> <b>area.</b> Seeking cover, the Marines became scattered and were quickly pinned down. Captain George Stallings—the battalion operations officer—directed Marines to begin suppressive fire with machine guns and mortars on the Japanese machine gun emplacements on Tanambogo. Shortly thereafter, American dive bombers dropped several bombs on Tanambogo, diminishing some {{of the volume of}} fire from that location.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century.

5|$|The {{landing of}} the assault troops at Labuan went well. The Allied fleet began bombarding the <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> from 8:15 am, and seven Australian B-24 Liberators dropped anti-personnel bombs in the area behind the {{intended}} beachhead. No Japanese forces opposed the two battalions' assault forces as they came ashore in LVTs, and the landing of later waves of infantry and tanks went smoothly. The 2/43rd Battalion rapidly advanced north and captured No. 1 Strip in the evening of 10 June. Some Japanese soldiers attempted to defend the airfield area, and the 2/43rd Battalion claimed to have killed 23 Japanese {{for the loss of}} four Australians wounded.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} success of Dragoon and support the initial landings, {{preliminary}} commando operations had to be carried out. The first target was the Hyères Islands, specifically Port-Cros and Levant. The guns of the German garrisons on both islands could reach the proposed Allied <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> and the sea lanes that the troops would follow. The First Special Service Force, a joint U.S.-Canadian special forces unit trained in amphibious assault and mountaineering and consisting of three regiments, received the order to take the islands as part of Operation Sitka.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} {{stage of the}} Normandy invasion, {{the decision was made}} to land the 6th Airborne Division (Major-General Richard Gale) on the left flank of the invasion beaches between the River Orne and the River Dives. Their primary objective was to capture the two road bridges over the River Orne and the Caen Canal and prevent a German flanking attack on the <b>landing</b> <b>area.</b> Failure to capture the bridges would leave the 6th Airborne Division cut off in enemy territory, so the 5th Parachute Brigade were earmarked to defend the bridges against counter-attacks. Gale decided that the only way to capture the bridges intact was by a glider coup de main assault. He then asked Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade to nominate his best company for the operation.|$|E
