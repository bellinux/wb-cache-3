500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} whether she got sick of shooting on the Hydra holding cell set, Elizabeth Mitchell responded I guess so. It was creepy because {{it was supposed to}} be underwater, so it was a little bit dingy but kind of great at the same time ... what I will miss is just being one on one with another actor. And then also one on two obviously when it was Michael [...] because the three of us, it was almost <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> stage. We were able to really work off of each other and I thought you don't usually get that in a TV show.|$|E
500|$|Discussing May's {{sickness}} in {{the episode}} after being [...] "infected" [...] by the ghost Lucy {{in the season}} premiere, Wen explained that [...] "It starts to affect May’s perception of things. It’s almost <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t {{want her to be}} paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her. I understand that she’s going in the same direction I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{playing for}} Bermuda, Goater {{was often the}} only {{professional}} player in the team. Bermudian journalist Chris Gibbons described the difference between Goater and his teammates: [...] "He's a class above every other player on the island. Before he went to England he was just quick, but now he's a totally different player, a lot more aggressive and a much better header of the ball. The problem has been that he sets up chances for the others without them being on the same wavelength." [...] However, Goater noted that this had a detrimental aspect: [...] "My fitness dropped off while I was with Bermuda. It was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> holiday. The team just ate what they liked. I kept to my professional diet for {{about two or three}} weeks until peer pressure took over." ...|$|E

50|$|As a boss, Shenton {{proved to}} be a highly egalitarian, {{hands-on}} leader whose enthusiasm was infectious. An approachable man, Shenton <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the factory or shop floor and created a culture in which employers and employees were on first name basis.|$|R

500|$|... "Oh {{it was so}} fun, it was amazing. For me it was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> a Martin Scorsese set. I've been so low {{budget for}} so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even {{seem to be a}} bit of a diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{recalled}} later: [...] "He {{positioned himself}} {{off to one}} side of-and some distance away from-the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. 'Do you see how it's done?', Oberst Mölders' voice came over the R/T. 'Right, now you take the next one.' I carried out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. 'And again!' It was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!" [...] In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Soviet aircraft was never officially credited to him. Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E
6000|$|... "What care I {{about their}} objecting?" [...] said Caleb, with a {{sturdiness}} {{which he was}} apt to show when he had an opinion. [...] "The lad is of age and must get his bread. He has sense enough and quickness enough; he <b>likes</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the land, and it's my belief that he could learn business well if he gave his mind to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid you're {{going to}} find that your {{business}} is several people's business. I am interested in it myself. I don't <b>like</b> your <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the stage. Now bite my head off!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Andy Greenwald of Grantland {{thought the}} episode was [...] "a riotous Roman orgy of hilarity" [...] that {{eventually}} became exhausting: [...] "A nonstop barrage of jokes, even amazing jokes, can eventually feel <b>like</b> <b>being</b> sat <b>on</b> by Hazel two years ago." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Appearing in {{the lead}} role in Scott's Gladiator and Robin Hood, Russell Crowe commented, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> Ridley's set because actors can perform [...] and {{the focus is on}} the performers." [...] Paul M. Sammon, in his book Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner, commented in an {{interview}} with Brmovie.com that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years. More recently during the filming of Scott's 2012 film, Prometheus, Charlize Theron praised the director's willingness to listen to suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on script. Theron worked alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a good review, {{giving it a}} B- overall. In her recap however, she was upset over how they didn't give series regular Sean Maguire more stories for his {{character}} in general: [...] "I’m glad for Sean Maguire that his character bit the dust this episode. When Robin Hood, one of the great, rakish heroes of all time, someone who should be swooping up women right alongside Captain Hook, is reduced to being a glorified blanket carrier for episodes, it’s <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> Once Upon a Time had him trapped in his own personal Underworld. When’s the last time Robin had his own plot—better yet, a plot that didn’t involve just traipsing along after Regina... That’s a plot for a hapless type like Walter Mitty, not Robin Hood." ...|$|E

[...] "In {{the first}} place, I don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> stopped <b>on</b> an open trail; {{and in the}} next, I've spent {{the last few days}} borrowing things for a friend of mine whom you pitched out on to the prairie with his wife and child." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Wittgenstein, {{philosophical}} {{problems arise}} when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, {{where all the}} familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, {{precisely because of the}} lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all. Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the [...] "rough ground" [...] of ordinary language in use. Much of the Investigations consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: [...] "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should completely disappear." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Prodigy {{were getting}} {{considerable}} airplay on rock stations with their controversial track [...] "Smack My Bitch Up"—and also a negative backlash for the song. The National Organization for Women (NOW) criticized {{the song and}} its music video. The song's lyrics consist entirely of the repeated phrase [...] "Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up", which NOW stated are a [...] "dangerous and offensive message advocating violence against women". Howlett responded to the criticism by stating that {{the meaning of the}} song and its lyrics were being misinterpreted, and the phrase meant [...] "doing anything intensely, <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> stage – going for extreme manic energy". The band did not actually write the lyric, but rather, sampled it from the hip hop Ultramagnetic MCs' track [...] "Give the Drummer Some" [...] which also appears on the Dirtchamber Sessions; they had also sampled another Ultramagnetic MCs song [...] "Critical Beatdown" [...] on their earlier [...] "Out of Space" [...] single. The National Organization for Women also believed that the lyrics are in reference to administering heroin (smack) to another person. Several radio stations limited the song's airplay to nighttime hours. In September 1997, the Prodigy performed [...] "Breathe" [...] at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, and won the Viewer's Choice Award.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} month, Kathy {{is shocked}} when Gavin appears in her home. She threatens {{to call the}} police, but he asks her to pass on a message to Sharon, revealing {{that he has been}} on holiday with her and Dennis, but she left. Dot Branning (June Brown) then arrives, and eventually she remembers Gavin from his childhood in Walford, saying that he was a troublemaker who stole money from Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and warns Kathy off getting involved. Gavin simply says he wants the opportunity to be a good father and grandfather, and cries when he remembers that he was unwanted by his own mother. After Dot leaves, Kathy realises that Gavin does not <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> his own and promises to pass on the messaage. Before he leaves, he kisses Kathy as a thank you, saying he misses her. Kathy speaks to Sharon, who reveals that she left the holiday because Gavin hit Dennis. Sharon meets Gavin who says he did it out of love but Sharon wants nothing to do with him. Later, Sharon discovers that Gavin has collected Dennis from school and given him a mobile phone. She meets Gavin and offers him £100,000 to leave forever, revealing that she is selling her half of her bar to fund this. Gavin asks her for another chance but she rejects him and he leaves. After Sharon tells Gavin it will take some weeks to get the money, Gavin sees Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and her family and concludes that they must be wealthy. Gavin blackmails Clauedtte, threatening to reveal a secret from her past. Claudette attempts to pay Gavin with sex, but afterwards he says it is not a payment and asks how Claudette killed her husband, Henry. When he demands more money, she strikes him over the head with a candelabra. She believes he is dead and takes him to the basement, and when her son Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) arrives, she lies about the circumstances, but when Gavin escapes, her lies are revealed to Vincent. Gavin returns to Claudette's home and meets Vincent, who says Claudette has left the country. Gavin says he will track her down, so Vincent offers to pay off the money Gavin claims she owes him. Sharon then meets Gavin and gives him the money from her sale of her bar (to Vincent), and he asks for a reconciliation but she rejects him. He meets Margaret, saying she will get her share of the money, and states that Sharon is now dead to him as he has another plan, which Margaret calls [...] "insane".|$|E

60|$|Mr. Turnbull, {{angry at}} such carelessness, {{accepted}} the apology in a grudging spirit and trudged along in silence. Then he started nervously as a monstrous and unworthy suspicion occurred to him.

50|$|Gummo, who in an {{interview}} said he never <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> stage, left the group and joined the military during World War I. He wasn't sent overseas because the armistice was signed shortly afterward. Gummo's younger brother Zeppo took {{his place in the}} group. Gummo later went into the raincoat business. After his Army career he joined with Zeppo and operated a theatrical agency. After that collaboration ended, Gummo represented his brother Groucho and worked on the television show The Life of Riley, which he helped develop. He also represented other on-screen talent and a number of writers. Gummo was well respected as a businessman. He rarely had contracts with those he represented, his philosophy being that, if they liked his work, they would continue to use him, and if not, they would seek representation elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The tall-tale {{aspect of}} the story begins with Mr Mulliner's claim that writing dialog in Hollywood really is exactly <b>like</b> <b>being</b> {{isolated}} <b>on</b> a remote island. This assertion, which will strike many readers as {{at the very least}} an exaggeration, actually does reflect some aspects Wodehouse's own real-life experiences in Hollywood in the 1930s, when he wrote dialog for movie studios and was disappointed when very little came of it (see below).|$|R
