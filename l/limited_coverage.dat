25|$|Embark (formerly METRO Transit) is the city's {{public transit}} company. The main {{transfer}} terminal is downtown at NW 5th Street and Hudson Avenue. Embark maintains <b>limited</b> <b>coverage</b> of the city's main street grid using a hub-and-spoke {{system from the}} main terminal, making many journeys impractical due to the rather small number of bus routes offered and that most trips require a transfer downtown. The city has recognized transit as a major issue for the rapidly growing and urbanizing city and has initiated several studies in recent times to improve upon the existing bus system starting with a plan known as the Fixed Guideway Study. This study identified several potential commuter transit routes from the suburbs into downtown OKC as well as feeder-line bus and/or rail routes throughout the city.|$|E
500|$|Though Vera was {{accurately}} forecast and its track into Japan {{was well}} anticipated, <b>limited</b> <b>coverage</b> of telecommunications, combined with lack of urgency from Japanese {{media and the}} storm's intensity, greatly inhibited potential evacuation and disaster mitigation processes. Rainfall from the storm's outer rainbands began to cause flooding in river basins {{well in advance of}} the storm's landfall. Upon moving ashore Honshu, the typhoon brought a strong storm surge that destroyed numerous flood defense systems, inundating coastal regions and sinking ships. Damage totals from Vera reached US$600million (equivalent to US$ billion in [...] ). The number of fatalities caused by Vera remain discrepant, though current estimates indicate that the typhoon caused at least 4,000deaths, making it the deadliest typhoon in Japanese history.|$|E
500|$|During the season, the Météo-France office (MFR) {{based on}} Réunion island issued {{warnings}} in tropical cyclones within the basin, {{as part of}} its role as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center. The agency estimated intensities via the Dvorak technique, which uses images from two satellites by the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. On certain days, the satellites had <b>limited</b> <b>coverage</b> in the eastern portion of the region, which limited warning capability. At the time, the MFR issued warnings on tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean from the coast of Africa to 90°E, south of the equator. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center [...] a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force [...] also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the region. Wind estimates from Météo-France and most other basins throughout the world are sustained over 10minutes, while estimates from the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center are sustained over 1minute. 10minute winds are about 1.14 times the amount of 1minute winds.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the deadliest}} Indian wars fought was the Snake War in 1864–1868, which was {{conducted}} by a confederacy of Northern Paiute, Bannock and Shoshone Native Americans, called the [...] "Snake Indians" [...] against the United States Army in the states of Oregon, Nevada, California, and Idaho which ran along the Snake River. The war started when tension arose between the local Indians and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands, which resulted in competition for food and resources. Indians included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the Snake River Valley, which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and {{the intervention of the}} United States army. The war resulted in a total of 1,762 men who have been killed, wounded, and captured from both sides. Unlike other Indian Wars, the Snake War was widely forgotten in United States history due to having only <b>limited</b> <b>coverage</b> of the war.|$|E

2500|$|The Diyarbakir space {{surveillance}} site {{operated a}} detection radar (FPS-17) and a tracking radar (FPS-79) throughout the 1960s and 1970s. If a new space object was sensed by the detection radar's fans, then the tracking radar could be oriented to achieve lock-on and tracking. The orientation was governed by {{knowledge of the}} appropriate [...] "normal" [...] object's astrodynamic laws of motion, or by an assumption as to launch point. Thus, if an unknown was detected, and if it followed an unusual path, {{it was unlikely that}} it could, or would, be tracked. Furthermore, the director of the radar could make a decision that the unknown object detected is not of interest (because of the location of the FPS-17 fan penetration or {{because of the lack of}} prior information on a possible new launch). In the absence of detection fan penetration (the fan had a rather <b>limited</b> <b>coverage),</b> the FPS-79 tracking radar was tasked to follow other space objects on a schedule provided by the Space Defense Center, and again there was almost no likelihood that an anomalistic object could, or would, be tracked.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{activities}} that players {{can do in}} mayor mode include building civic buildings that need constant funding to work properly, such as schools, hospitals, parks, police stations, jails, and fire stations. These buildings now come in two or more sizes compared to the single, universal types {{that were used in}} previous games. Settlements also need public utilities such as electricity with more or less polluting and more or less expensive types of power stations, water pumps, water purification plants, and waste management services. Facilities that had previously provided citywide coverage, such as educational facilities and medical facilities, have now been modified to provide a more <b>limited</b> <b>coverage,</b> as it has been with police stations and fire stations in previous SimCity titles. Funding can now be adjusted for individual buildings rather than having to change the funding to all buildings, allowing users to specify how much money should be spent to supply a service in accordance to the local population. Maintenance expenses for public utility facilities will increase as they age. The maximum output of facilities also decreases as they get older. The rate at which facilities age is dependent on the percentage of its capacity being used and the level of funding being given to it.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{database}} {{is likely}} to produce a different h for the same scholar, because of different coverage. A detailed study showed that the Web of Knowledge has strong coverage of journal publications, but poor coverage of high impact conferences. Scopus has better coverage of conferences, but poor coverage of publications prior to 1996; Google Scholar has the best coverage of conferences and most journals (though not all), but like Scopus has <b>limited</b> <b>coverage</b> of pre-1990 publications. The exclusion of conference proceedings papers is a particular problem for scholars in computer science, where conference proceedings are considered {{an important part of}} the literature. Google Scholar has been criticized for producing [...] "phantom citations," [...] including gray literature in its citation counts, and failing to follow the rules of Boolean logic when combining search terms. For example, the Meho and Yang study found that Google Scholar identified 53% more citations than Web of Knowledge and Scopus combined, but noted that because most of the additional citations reported by Google Scholar were from low-impact journals or conference proceedings, they did not significantly alter the relative ranking of the individuals. It has been suggested that in order to deal with the sometimes wide variation in h for a single academic measured across the possible citation databases, one should assume false negatives in the databases are more problematic than false positives and take the maximum h measured for an academic.|$|E

40|$|Properly {{planned and}} {{conducted}} randomized clinical trials remain susceptible {{to a lack}} of external validity. The authors illustrate a model-based method to standardize observed trial results to a specified target population using a seminal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment trial, and they provide Monte Carlo simulation evidence supporting the method.

The target population was US people infected with HIV in 2006, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results from the trial apply, albeit muted by 12 %, to the target population, under the assumption that the authors have measured and correctly modeled the determinants of selection that reflect heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In simulations with a heterogeneous treatment effect, a conventional intent-to-treat estimate was biased with poor confidence <b>limit</b> <b>coverage,</b> but the proposed estimate was largely unbiased with appropriate confidence <b>limit</b> <b>coverage.</b> The proposed method standardizes observed trial results to a specified target population and thereby provides information regarding the generalizability of trial results...|$|R
