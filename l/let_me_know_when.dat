500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> he surrendered. Keep your eyes fixed on him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I really do not see the signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E
2500|$|To {{maximize}} the output from their holdings, the Bradleys lease their lands during hunting season. Minnie Lou has issued ten suggestions to her temporary tenants. One is “No litter”; anyone caught littering, {{and that includes}} cigarette butts, will not be invited back to hunt on Bradley 3 land. She insists that guests treat her as a friend, not as a business associate, and that they stay in communication: “We have a busy ranch, so I like to have hunters call {{ahead of time and}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> they’ll be there. All of my hunters are great at communicating when they plan on being out and are always quick to let me know if they see any problems on the ranch.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Phillimore and the Edgar {{went with}} Sir Hyde Parker's fleet for his {{expedition}} to the Baltic in 1801. [...] During the Battle of Copenhagen Phillimore {{had been sent to}} Parker's flagship, the 90-gun [...] to take his examination. He served as the Londons acting-signal lieutenant during the battle, sending Parker's famous signal for Nelson to withdraw. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: 'I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> he surrendered. Keep your eyes fixed on him.' He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said 'You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I {{have a right to be}} blind sometimes.' He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said 'I really do not see the signal.' [...] Phillimore returned to the Edgar after the battle, where he learnt that the Edgars first lieutenant had been killed in the engagement. A round of general promotions of the junior officers followed, and Phillimore was promoted to lieutenant.|$|E

I couldn’t have chosen better “academic parents”, who were always there for me with good advice, and knew how to lead me to the next step.

6000|$|It speaks {{strongly}} for {{the charm}} of Madame de Sablé’s nature {{that she was able}} to retain so susceptible a friend as Mademoiselle d’Attichy in spite of numerous other friendships, some of which, especially that with Madame de Longueville, were far from lukewarm—in spite too of a tendency in herself to distrust the affection of others toward her, and to wait for advances rather than to make them. We find many traces of this tendency in the affectionate remonstrances addressed to her by Madame de Longueville, now for shutting herself up from her friends, now for doubting that her letters are acceptable. Here is a little passage from one of these remonstrances which indicates a trait of Madame de Sablé, and is in itself a bit of excellent sense, worthy the consideration of lovers and friends in general: “I am very much afraid that if I leave to you the care of <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> I can see you, I shall be a long time without having that pleasure, and that nothing will incline you to procure it me, for I have always observed a certain lukewarmness in your friendship after our explanations, from which I have never seen you thoroughly recover; and that is why I dread explanations, for however good they may be in themselves, since they serve to reconcile people, it must always be admitted, to their shame, that they are at least the effect of a bad cause, and that if they remove it for a time they sometimes leave a certain facility in getting angry again, which, without diminishing friendship, renders its intercourse less agreeable. It seems to me that I find all this in your behavior to me; so I am not wrong in sending to know if you wish to have me to-day.” It is clear that Madame de Sablé was far from having what Sainte-Beuve calls the one fault of Madame Necker—absolute perfection. A certain exquisiteness in her physical and moral nature was, as we shall see, the source of more than one weakness, but the perception of these weaknesses, which is indicated in Madame de Longueville’s letters, heightens our idea of the attractive qualities which notwithstanding drew from her, at the sober age of forty, such expressions as these: “I assure you that you are the person in all the world whom it would be most agreeable to me to see, and there is no one whose intercourse is a ground of truer satisfaction to me. It is admirable that at all times, and amidst all changes, the taste for your society remains in me; and, if one ought to thank God for the joys which do not tend to salvation, I should thank him with all my heart for having preserved that to me at a time in which he has taken away from me all others.” ...|$|R
