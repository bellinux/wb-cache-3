60|$|Wearied {{at length}} with cutting out, and measuring, and drawing threads, she <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair, and her eye {{rests on the}} pale face of her daughter, who has been sitting for two hours intent on her stitching.|$|R
6000|$|The {{orchestra}} ceases playing suddenly, and {{an important}} voice can be heard loudly talking {{in one of the}} boxes farther down the aisle. No doubt some citizen entertains there some visitor to the town, and Miss Rosa <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair and smiles at some of the words she catches: ...|$|R
60|$|The light {{died out}} of Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes. She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair smiling, and {{wrinkling}} her fine, thin nose.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Pett <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> faintly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair. She felt overcome.|$|R

60|$|When {{the meal}} was finished, Father Agustin kept Walthew talking while Blanca <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> silently <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair. Her look was strained, and once Walthew {{surprised}} her cautious glance at the clock.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Crayford <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> absently <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair. For {{the first}} time since the {{conversation}} had begun, she let a question pass without making a reply. The truth is, Mrs. Crayford was thinking.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bellew {{took his}} hand, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>her</b> corner. She was rather paler than usual, {{but it became}} her, and Captain Maydew thought {{he had never seen}} so charming a creature.|$|R

6000|$|... [HILLCRIST blows his nose. JILL, with a choke, <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> [...] <b>her</b> {{seat and}} folds her arms tightly on her chest. MRS. [...] HILLCRIST passes her {{handkerchief}} over her lips, sitting [...] perfectly still. HILLCRIST, too, is motionless.] ...|$|R
60|$|He {{wondered}} impatiently why Mrs. James did not rise. Mrs. James merely <b>leaned</b> comfortably <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair, {{with the}} righteous expression {{of one who}} has done her duty by her fellow creatures' palates, and looked at Malcolm.|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Wouldn't I? You {{wait and}} SEE, Miss Spaulding! He shall take the money, and he shall sign a receipt for it.

60|$|Her {{long fingers}} stole into the {{cigarette}} box. She accepted a light {{from him and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> once more <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact, I'm not. Nobody could feel very {{pleasant}} at this temperature; and I'm disappointed--with several things." [...] She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> languidly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair {{with an air of}} weariness. [...] "When that happens it's a relief to be disagreeable to anybody who comes along. Besides, you're not in the least entertaining this afternoon." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair. Her {{eyes were}} fixed anxiously upon his face. She {{completely}} ignored his question.|$|E
60|$|She {{closed her}} parasol and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{corner of the}} seat. She seemed to be {{studying}} his expression.|$|E
60|$|She played bridge later--brilliantly as usual, {{and with}} success. Then she <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair and faced them all.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{contrast}} between {{all this and}} that rotten shack. Did you notice that Celia never stopped sewing while we were there, though she once or twice <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> rather heavily <b>in</b> <b>her</b> chair?" ...|$|R
60|$|Madeline Hammond <b>leaned</b> weakly <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> seat, {{cold and}} sick, {{and for a}} moment her ears throbbed to the tramp of the dancers across the way and the rhythm of the cheap music. Then into the open door-place flashed a girl's tragic face, lighted by dark eyes and framed by dusky hair. The girl reached a slim brown hand round the side of the door and held on as if to support herself. A long black scarf accentuated her gaudy attire.|$|R
60|$|The big {{carriage}} {{was full}} of parcels, and even Ben's seat was loaded with Indian war clubs, a Chinese kite of immense size, {{and a pair of}} polished ox-horns from Africa.
