25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket.</b> We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 season saw the {{introduction}} of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. The uniforms had multishade stripes of orange, red and yellow in front and in back behind a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same stripes ran down the pant legs. Players numbers not only appeared {{on the back of the}} jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.|$|E
25|$|ABC's Wide World of Sports {{was unwilling}} {{to pay the price}} Knievel wanted for the Snake River Canyon jump, so he hired boxing {{promoter}} Bob Arum's company, Top Rank Productions, to put the event on closed-circuit television and broadcast to movie theaters. Investors in the event took a substantial loss, including promoter Don E. Branker, as well as Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation. Arum partnered with Invest West Sports, Shelly Saltman's company, to secure from Invest West Sports two things: first, the necessary financing for the jump, and second, the services of Saltman, long recognized as one of America's premier public relations and promotion men, to do publicity so that Knievel could concentrate on his jumps. Knievel hired subcontractor and aeronautical engineer Doug Malewicki to build him a rocket-powered cycle to jump across the Snake River, and called it the Skycycle X-1. Malwecki's creation was powered by a steam engine built by former Aerojet engineer Robert Truax. On April 15, 1972, the X-1 was launched to test the feasibility of the launching ramp. The decision was then made to have Truax build the Skycycle X-2 and have it take off and fly more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> than a motorcycle.|$|E

500|$|Kneale disliked Doctor Who—the most {{successful}} of the British science-fiction programmes—saying {{that it had}} stolen his ideas. An article for The Daily Telegraph in 2005 described Doctor Who as the [...] "spiritual successor" [...] to the Quatermass serials, and Mark Gatiss, a scriptwriter for Doctor Who, wrote of his admiration of Kneale in an article for The Guardian in 2006. [...] "Kneale wrote that [...] was 'an over-confident year' and he piloted his hugely influential tale <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> into the drab schedules of Austerity Britain… What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn't owe Kneale a huge debt?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lift Off" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Before {{the song was}} released, MTV News' Alvin Blanco heard {{a preview of the}} song and described it as [...] "resounding... sounds like it was tailor-made to be performed in large stadiums." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "is rescued by Beyoncé, who whips the chorus with a belt so powerful you'd think it insulted her mother." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole also praised the song writing, [...] "'Lift Off' is a study in stylized blockbuster excess, with West's best fanfare since Encore eventually being drowned out by a simulated rocket launch that will sound awesome in your car stereo provided it doesn't cause your subwoofers to bust your windows." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin found a [...] "hook so ridiculous ('We gon take it to the moon / Take it to the stars!') that only Beyoncé could sell it." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of The Guardian praised the song calling it [...] "bombastic". Digital Spys Robert Copsey put [...] "Lift Off" [...] on his list of [...] "Tracks to download" [...] from the album. Evening Standards John Aizlewood called the song [...] "rocket-propelled". Rolling Stones Matthew Perpetua commented: [...] "Beyoncé joins the boys for a synth-heavy banger that takes off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> and eventually arrives at a spacey, blissful resolution. It all but demands a sci-fi music video featuring Beyoncé as a sexy astronaut." ...|$|E
500|$|U2 Live at Red Rocks {{is often}} cited as a {{watershed}} moment in U2's history which established their reputation as an exceptional live act. In the liner notes of the remastered version of the film, music journalist Anthony DeCurtis wrote, [...] "this concert set goals for U2 that might have daunted any other young band. But {{in the shadow of}} their wild ambitions at Red Rocks, these four boys met, once again, the men of their future, and became who they would become." [...] Rolling Stone called the band's performance of [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] from the film one of the [...] "50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll". The magazine said, [...] "he sight of Bono singing the anti-violence anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' while waving a white flag through crimson mist (created by a combination of wet weather, hot lights and the illumination of those crags) became the defining image of U2's warrior-rock spirit and—shown in heavy rotation on MTV—broke the band nationwide." [...] Director Gavin Taylor said that the video [...] "kick-started their career" [...] and [...] "fired them <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> into the sky". In 2009, Relix named U2's performance at Red Rocks the 24th-best concert of all time. The Denver Post said the concert affirmed Red Rocks Amphitheatre's status as a premier outdoor venue. Rocky Mountain News said that the concert was [...] "asily one of the most famous, acclaimed concerts of the 1980s (if not all time)", and that people who have visited the Amphitheatre ever since have been disappointed to learn that the pyres {{are not part of the}} venue and were only used for the U2 concert. Music biographer Dave Thompson said the concert [...] "transformed U2...into a very successful rock band", and that without U2, [...] "Red Rocks would be just another smartly lit amphitheater".|$|E

You're {{sitting in the}} old arm-chair, thinking of this and that, and then suddenly you look up, and there he is. He moves from point to point with as little uproar as a jelly fish. The thing startled poor old Bicky considerably. He rose from his seat <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocketing</b> pheasant. I'm used to Jeeves now, but often {{in the days when}} he first came to me I've bitten my tongue freely on finding him unexpectedly in my midst.|$|R

Mark intercepted a pass 20 metres from the Australian tryline and raced towards the halfway before floating a pass to Campese who had zoomed up <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket.</b> Campese bamboozled the Argentine fullback, Bernado Miguens, with his goose-step and drew the curtain on a superb performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in his {{volume on}} the artistry of U.S. coins and medals, stated that Kreis [...] "used the great oak... as a most effective composition on the obverse, and a massive eagle, thrusting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket,</b> on the reverse. He noted, [...] "all elements of the Connecticut Tercentenary coin blend superbly, the mottos and aphorisms disappearing amid the leafy clusters on the obverse and {{the balance of the}} opposite side as successful as for the Eagle of 1907 (by Augustus Saint-Gaudens)".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Packard One-Twenty {{had been}} {{introduced}} in 1935, and had taken off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket.</b> Additional competition from the Lincoln-Zephyr, introduced in 1936, did not help, either. For 1937, Cadillac made the LaSalle its own again, giving it the [...] monobloc V8 of the Series 60, new styling, a lower price range, and a heavy promotion, emphasizing the car was completely Cadillac built. It was too late. Model year sales of 32,000 LaSalles was a terrific leap forward, but remained leagues behind the junior Packard.|$|E
5000|$|Reception for Gideon's Corpse {{was mixed}} to positive.

Publishers Weekly panned Gideon's Corpse, saying that it fell [...] "well short of the authors’ usual high standard".|$|R

It was later determined {{that the cause of}} the difference between the Cape and the Redstone Arsenal was atmospheric conditions damping the sound.|$|R

2500|$|Besides the {{previously}} mentioned family of popular 40-mm grenades, {{the only other}} major use of a High-Low System was by the Swedish firm FFV in their development of the 1960s-era Miniman one man infantry antitank weapon. [...] The Miniman was simpler and cheaper than anything imagined by designers in World War II. [...] Inside what looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> launcher tube, is a HEAT projectile attached by a break away bolt to an alloy aluminum tube with ports drilled in it and which acts {{like a kind of}} high-pressure chamber. [...] The launch tube in which it is mounted acts as the low-pressure chamber. [...] When the propellant is ignited in the aluminum tube, gases escape through the ports and are allowed to build up in the launch tube to the point of almost causing a recoil. [...] The break-away bolt then snaps, allowing the projectile to move forward. [...] Unlike other High-Low Systems, gases are allowed to escape {{to the rear of the}} launch tube, achieving a totally recoilless effect.|$|E
2500|$|Cannonball is a mutant who {{possesses}} {{the ability to}} bodily generate thermo-chemical energy and release it from his skin. This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through the air <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket,</b> at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but now he can fire it from almost any part of his body, {{to a wide variety}} of effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible [...] "blast field" [...] that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.|$|E

2500|$|One early recruit to {{join the}} {{regiment}} was named Jack Jackson. Jackson {{was said to be}} very large and strong-willed and quickly became a Sergeant in Company B. At some point Jackson joined the regimental recruiting parties; the officers were having trouble with convincing local field hands to join. Jackson's recruiting method was described as very forceful but ultimately successful. At the Battle of Milliken's Bend one of Jackson´s superior officers, Lieutenant David Cornwell, described the attack; saying that the 23rd Iowa was not behaving courageously but the three black infantry regiments offered great resistance. He said that Jackson, [...] "Laid into a group of Texans... smashing in every head he could reach", and that, [...] "Big Jack Jackson passed me <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket.</b> With the fury of a tiger he sprang into that gang and crushed everything before him. There was nothing left of Jack's gun except the barrel and he was smashing everything he could reach. On {{the other side of the}} levee, they were yelling 'Shoot that big !' while Jack was daring the whole gang to come up and fight him. Then a bullet reached his head and he fell full on the levee." ...|$|E

To win for RUSSIAN TIME after only four races of {{existence}} is a very good feeling." [...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> at the end. Big thanks to my new team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result. We came here to score big points and it’s quite good to go back to Europe knowing that we have a good car, a good team. It keeps getting better and better. I’m feeling quite confident." [...] Coletti believed his third-place finish contributed towards [...] "a good weekend" [...] for himself. He stated that entering the European leg of the season as the points leader had gave him additional motivation and hoped to be competing at the front of the field in Barcelona, [...] "We’re still a few points ahead – ten I think.

500|$|From {{his boyhood}} Wodehouse had {{been fascinated by}} America, which he {{conceived}} of as [...] "a land of romance"; he [...] "yearned" [...] to visit the country, and by 1904 he had earned enough to do so. In April he sailed to New York, which he found greatly to his liking. He noted in his diary: [...] "In New York gathering experience. Worth many guineas in the future but none for the moment". This prediction proved correct: few British writers had first-hand experience of the US, and his articles about life in New York brought him higher than usual fees. He later recalled that [...] "in 1904 anyone in the London writing world who had been to America was regarded with awe and looked upon as an authority on that terra incognita....
