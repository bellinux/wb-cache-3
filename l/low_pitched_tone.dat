40|$|The octave or Deutsch {{illusion}} {{occurs when}} two tones, separated by about one octave, are presented simultaneously but alternating between ears, such {{that when the}} low tone is presented to the left ear the high tone is presented to the right ear and vice versa. Most subjects hear a single tone that alternates both between ears and in pitch; i. e., they hear a <b>low</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>tone</b> in one ear alternating with a high pitched tone in the other ear. The present study examined whether the illusion can be elicited by aperiodic signals consisting of low-frequency band-pass filtered noises with overlapping spectra. The amount of spectral overlap was held constant, but the high- and low-frequency content of the signals was systematically varied. The majority of subjects perceived an auditory illusion {{in terms of a}} dominant ear for pitch and lateralization by frequency, as proposed by Deutsch [(1975 a) Sci. Am. 233, 92 - 104]. Furthermore, the salience of the illusion increased as the high frequency of the content in the signal increased. Since no harmonics were present in the stimuli, {{it is highly unlikely that}} this illusion is perceived on the basis of binaural diplacusis or harmonic binaural fusion...|$|E

40|$|Consistent {{evidence}} suggests that pitch height may be represented in a spatial format, having both a vertical and an horizontal representation. The spatial representation of pitch height results into response compatibility effects for which high <b>pitch</b> <b>tones</b> are preferentially associated to up-right responses, and <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tones</b> are preferentially associated to down-left responses (i. e., the SMARC effect), with the strength of these associations depending on individuals’ musical skills. In this study we investigated whether listening to <b>tones</b> of different <b>pitch</b> affects the representation of external space, as assessed in a visual and haptic line bisection paradigm, in musicians and non musicians. <b>Low</b> and high <b>pitch</b> <b>tones</b> affected the bisection performance in musicians differently, both when pitch was relevant and irrelevant for the task, and in both the visual and the haptic modality. No effect of pitch height was observed on the bisection performance of non musicians. Moreover, our data also show that musicians present a (supramodal) rightward bisection bias in both the visual and the haptic modality, extending previous findings limited to the visual modality, and {{consistent with the idea}} that intense practice with musical notation and bimanual instrument training affects hemispheric lateralization. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{is better}} when a high <b>pitch</b> <b>tone</b> is {{associated}} with an up or right response and a <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tone</b> with a down or left response compared to the opposite pairs, which is called the spatial-musical association of response codes (SMARC) effect. The current study examined whether polarity codes are formed {{in terms of the}} variation in loudness. In Experiments 1 and 2, in which participants performed a loudness-judgment task and a timbre-judgment task respectively, the correspondence effect was obtained between loudness and response side regardless of whether loudness was relevant to the task or not. In Experiments 3 and 4, in which the identical loudness- and timbre-judgment tasks were conducted while the auditory stimulus was presented only to the left or right ear, the correspondence effect was modulated by the ear to which the stimulus was presented, even though the effect was marginally significant in Experiment 4. The results suggest that loudness produced polarity codes that influenced response selection (Experiments 1 & 2), and additional spatial codes provided by stimulus position modulated the effect, generating the stimulus eccentricity effect (Experiments 3 & 4), which is consistent with the polarity correspondence principle...|$|R

40|$|Natural" crossmodal correspondences, {{such as the}} {{spontaneous}} tendency to associate high pitches with high spatial locations, are often hypothesized to occur preattentively and independently of task instructions (top-down attention). Here, we investigate bottom-up attentional engagement by using emotional scenes that are known to naturally and reflexively engage attentional resources. We presented emotional (pleasant and unpleasant) or neutral pictures either below or above a fixation cross, while participants were required to discriminate between a high or a <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>tone</b> (experiment 1). Results showed that despite a robust crossmodal attentional capture of task-irrelevant emotional pictures, the general advantage in classifying the tones for congruent over incongruent visual-auditory stimuli was similar for emotional and neutral pictures. On the other hand, when picture position was task-relevant (experiment 2), task-irrelevant tones did not interact with pictures {{with regard to their}} combination of pitch and visual vertical spatial position, but instead they were effective in minimizing the interference effect of emotional picture processing on the ongoing task. These results provide constraints on our current understanding of natural crossmodal correspondences...|$|R
40|$|Coaches {{traditionally}} rely on explicit approaches (e. g., instruction, video feedback) {{to adapt}} technique in skilled athletes. While such methods can generate relatively rapid learning outcomes, the resultant technical execution {{is susceptible to}} breakdown under competition pressure. An alternative approach is to use ‘implicit motor learning’ in which adaptations occur without conscious knowledge of the underlying rules and the newly learned skill {{is less likely to}} breakdown under pressure. However, research has not demonstrated whether implicit motor learning can be used to adapt technique in athletes whose skills are already expert. Two expert netball players undertook a 6 -week training intervention in which they practiced shooting to an adapted ring (hypothesised to cause an advantageous increase in the trajectory of shots) while responding to a concurrent secondary task (high and <b>low</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>tones).</b> Pre- and post-testing of shooting performance revealed a change in the maximum ball height following the intervention. The players showed no increase in generic or episodic knowledge, remained robust under secondary task load, and were unable to differentiate between pre- and post-test video footage of their shots. These measures indicate that players were unaware of the knowledge underlying adaptations of their technique, but equally highlight the need for further empirical investigation of implicit practice in expert performers. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{aging is}} {{accompanied}} by neurobiological changes and increased susceptibility to many neurological disorders, {{little is known about}} neurophysiological changes that start in old age. Here, neurophysiological changes during old age were assessed by recording brain potentials associated with motor preparation and stimulus expectancy (contingent negative variation, CNV) in young-old (60 - 69), oldest-old (85 - 98), and young (17 - 23) subjects. Individual trials began by a button press, followed 2. 5 s later by either a <b>low</b> or high <b>pitch</b> <b>tone.</b> In the "motor" condition subjects responded following high <b>pitch</b> <b>tones</b> (P = 0. 20); in the "non-motor" condition subjects did not respond. Motor condition CNV amplitudes in the oldest old were more positive than the young and young-old groups, which were similar. In the non-motor condition, the young-old and oldest-old had similar CNV amplitudes that were positive in polarity, and were significantly different from young subjects. Motor potentials before button presses that started the trials were comparable among groups. Results show that neural activity associated with motor preparation and stimulus expectancy changes during advanced age, and that group differences can be modulated by task requirements. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

5000|$|Unlike the {{transverse}} flute, the kaval {{is fully}} open at both ends, and {{is played by}} blowing on the sharpened edge of one end. The kaval has 8 playing holes (7 in front and 1 in the back for the thumb) and usually 4 more {{near the bottom of}} the kaval. These holes are not used for playing the instrument, but determine the <b>lowest</b> <b>tone's</b> <b>pitch</b> and timbre and are supposed to improve tone and intonation. In Bulgaria they are known as [...] "devil's holes", based on a folk tale in which the devil tries to out-play a shepherd in a musical duel. While the shepherd is sleeping, the devil drilled holes in the shepherd's kaval but instead of ruining the kaval, this only served to enhance the shepherd's kaval playing thus thwarting the devil. In Macedonia they are known as [...] "glasnici" [...] (гласници) meaning [...] "giving voice to/of".|$|R

5000|$|The {{acoustic}} {{impression is}} similar to that of a rising tone like the rising pitch contour of the Mandarin second tone, but the Tuvan pitch begins much lower. However, Tuvan is considered a pitch accent language with contrastive <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> instead of a tonal language. When the <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> vowel occurs in a multisyllabic word, there is no rising pitch contour or lengthening effect: [...] 'his/her/its horse'. Such <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> vowels were previously referred to in the literature as either kargyraa or pharyngealized vowels. Phonetic studies have demonstrated that the defining characteristic of such vowels is <b>low</b> <b>pitch.</b> See Harrison 2001 for a phonetic and acoustic study of Tuvan <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> vowels.|$|R

5000|$|Vowels in Tuvan {{exist in}} three varieties: short, {{long and short}} with <b>low</b> <b>pitch.</b> Tuvan long vowels have a {{duration}} that is at least (and often more than) {{twice as long as}} that of short vowels. Contrastive <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> may occur on short vowels, and when it does, it causes them to increase in duration by at least a half. When using <b>low</b> <b>pitch,</b> Tuvan-speakers employ a pitch that is at the very low end of their modal voice pitch. For some speakers, it is even lower and using what is phonetically known as creaky voice. When a vowel in a monosyllabic word has <b>low</b> <b>pitch,</b> speakers apply <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> only to the first half of that vowel (e.g. [...] 'horse'). That is followed by a noticeable pitch rise, as the speaker returns to modal pitch {{in the second half of}} the vowel.|$|R

40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that voice characteristics such as pitch, affect, and dominance can influence perceptions of attractiveness. The present study explores the effect of vocal pitch on ratings of attractiveness and maturity. Maturity scores were used as a manipulation check on the pitch conditions. Participants viewed a slideshow of photographs of three men and three women with accompanying soundtracks of either a high <b>pitched</b> voice, <b>low</b> <b>pitched</b> voice, or no voice. The hypothesis is that participants will find men more attractive when paired with a <b>low</b> <b>pitched</b> voice and women more attractive when paired with a high pitched voice. Both men and women were perceived as more mature in the <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> voice conditions, indicating that the pitch manipulation was effective. The study found that men were rated as more attractive when paired with a <b>low</b> <b>pitched</b> voice, and no significant pitch effect was found for pictures of women. Finally, when the results were separated by subject gender, there was some evidence that men found women with <b>low</b> <b>pitched</b> voices more attractive, and both genders found men with <b>low</b> <b>pitched</b> voices more attractive...|$|R
