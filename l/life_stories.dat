5|$|The {{first modern}} {{biography}} of Tubman {{to be published}} after Sarah Hopkins Bradford's 1869 and 1886 books was Earl Conrad's Harriet Tubman (retitled Harriet Tubman: Negro Soldier and Abolitionist in some later printings). Conrad had experienced great difficulty in finding a publisher – the search took four years – and endured disdain and contempt for his efforts to construct a more objective, detailed account of Tubman's life for adults. Several highly dramatized versions of Tubman's life had been written for children, and many more came later, but Conrad wrote in an academic style to document the historical importance of her work for scholars and the nation's memory. The book was finally published by Carter G. Woodson's Associated Publishers in 1943. Despite her popularity and significance, another Tubman biography for adults did not appear for 60 years, until Jean Humez published a close reading of Tubman's <b>life</b> <b>stories</b> in 2003, and Larson and Clinton both published their biographies in 2004. Author Milton C. Sernett discusses all the major biographies of Tubman in his 2007 book Harriet Tubman: Myth, Memory, and History.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> work is {{increasingly}} being used {{with people with}} dementia; this work offers a critical appraisal of some challenges that may be faced in practice. Design and methods: An in-depth case study analysis was undertaken to understand the experiences of people with dementia, family carers and care staff in using <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work in an NHS Mental Health and Social Care Trust. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, observation, conversations and field notes. Findings: Private memories were sometimes recalled by the person with dementia that were not for inclusion in any written product; enabling the person with dementia to tell their own <b>life</b> <b>story</b> could be a challenge; quality of the <b>life</b> <b>story</b> books was variable and; at times, <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work may be overused with the person with dementia. Conclusion: Services should not be deterred from undertaking <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work with people with dementia, {{but there is a}} need to adopt a planned approach to its implementation that includes facilitation, education and supervision...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> {{work has}} a {{relatively}} long {{tradition in the}} caring sciences and is recognised as {{an important component of}} dementia care and practice. However, to date, {{there has not been a}} review of accessible <b>life</b> <b>story</b> resources. The paper aims to discuss these issues. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Following a systematic approach to identification and inclusion, 11 <b>life</b> <b>story</b> resources were reviewed to ascertain areas of commonality and divergence between the materials. FINDINGS: The authors were able to group the analysis under eight areas and at the end of this process, it was uncertain if <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work is a formal staff intervention or an informal activity that people with dementia and their families could engage in. Resources also varied in terms of whether the <b>life</b> <b>story</b> information was organised in a chronological way, or with topics of interest/discussion or with a combination of both. <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> evaluation and its impact on the life of the person with dementia is in need of development. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Across the resources the authors identified four reasons to do <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work which the authors have named as: emotional connections; interactional connections; building new connections and practical care connections. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: There was limited guidance aimed at helping people with dementia to develop and compile their own <b>life</b> <b>story.</b> ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper provides new insights into the usefulness, future directions and content of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> resources in dementia care. It will be of interest to those in health and social care as well as people living with dementia...|$|R
40|$|Young {{people in}} care often lack basic {{information}} about their lives before care, {{the reasons for their}} entry into care and connection with their birth family. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (2010) recommends the use of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work for young people residing in local authority care in the UK, in order to support them to develop a coherent sense of identity. To date, there has been very little research on the efficacy or acceptability of this work from a young person’s perspective. The aim of this research was to explore care leavers’ experiences of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work. Thirty-eight young people accessing local authority leaving care teams in South Wales completed a short survey to ascertain the perceived level of knowledge they had about their family of origin and to enquire about their experience of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work. Nine of these young people participated in individual, semi-structured interviews that sought to explore their views about the <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work they had undertaken {{and the way in which}} they felt it had impacted on their sense of self. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to explore the interview transcripts. Four super-ordinate themes relating to the experiences of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work were identified: The need to know; Getting <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work right; <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> work: An emotional journey; and <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> work and the concept of family. The young people reported engaging in <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work to be a largely positive experience, and there was a degree of consensus on how the process of using this could be improved. All participants reported the value of contact with birth family members, especially siblings. However, <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work was felt to be useful by most, even when regular contact with their birth family was maintained. The clinical and service implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are proposed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Life</b> <b>story</b> {{books have}} been a part of {{adoption}} social workers practice for over 30 years; though the quality of them has varied. It should take around 12 months to complete it though it may need to be updated as the child's understanding develops. <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> work is distinct from <b>life</b> <b>story</b> books, the process of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work is to assist the person to understand and internalise the feelings associated with their past. However, a <b>life</b> <b>story</b> book does not need to involve the person and can be done by others, this is especially the case when done by social workers before placing a child for adoption. Rees & Goldberg state that a <b>life</b> <b>story</b> book should not include professional reports, later life letters, structured chronology (though this could be recorded in another, more child friendly, format), photo album and should not be an extension of the foster carer's memory book. However, <b>life</b> <b>story</b> books can often be seen as complementary or as an end product to <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work.A <b>life</b> <b>story</b> book is a system of recording information to answer the questions the participant may have in the future. It is an overview of a person's life to help them recall memories and understand their past.A child who does not fully understand their history is at risk of developing an imagined story of fictional family members leading to a misplaced sense of identity as they mature. Often, <b>life</b> <b>story</b> books are written from the perspective of the Past-Present though it has been suggested that writing it in this way causes the child anxiety as past issues may be too painful to come to terms with. Therefore, it has been suggested that a new approach: ‘Present - Past - Present - Future’ allows the child to feel that their life with their current family is secure and symbolically encourages the child to feel contained by their family.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{literature}} on <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work in health and social care practice. <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> work as an intervention has been used with a number of health and social care clients, such as children people with learning disabilities, older people on medical wards and with older people who have dementia. It may help challenge ageist attitudes and assumptions, be used as a basis for individualized care, improve assessment, assist in transitions between different care environments, and help to develop improved relationships between care staff and family carers. However, to date there has been no attempt to collate the findings from published accounts. A systematic search of the literature on <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work was conducted in February 2004, using nursing, medical and social science databases and a combination of thesaurus and free text search terms. This revealed over 1000 publications; the use of carefully constructed inclusion and exclusion criteria identified 51 relevant items. Fourteen were subsequently selected and reviewed using a set of reflective critical appraisal questions. A range of methodological approaches has been adopted to explore the use of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work with no one specific methodology prevailing. The work has been most frequently used with older people and people with a learning disability and <b>life</b> <b>story</b> books are the most common approach. Staff perceptions of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work have been explored, but patient and carer views are less frequently reported. The findings of the studies are discussed in broad themes, offering some tentative recommendations for using <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work in practice. Evidence on the use of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work is immature, leading to the recommendation for more research. Although appraising literature from a range of approaches is complex, there are some potentially far-reaching benefits of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work in health and social care practice...|$|R

40|$|Background.   Person-centred {{care has}} been linked with quality of care but {{difficulties}} remain in person-centred care being implemented in care practice. This study explores the use of <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work to enhance person-centred care with people with dementia. Aims and objectives.   The study investigates how <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work is: understood and developed in practice; experienced by all participants and affects the delivery and outcomes of care. Design and methods.   The experience of older people with dementia, family carers and care staff in using <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work was explored within an NHS Health and Social Care Trust. A multiple case study design was adopted within a constructivist approach. Semi-structured interviews, observation, conversations were employed. Findings.   <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> work has the potential to: enable care staff to see the person behind the patient; allow family carers to uphold their relatives’ personhood; enable {{the voice of the}} person with dementia to be heard, verbally and non-verbally; be enjoyable for all concerned and enable the person with dementia to feel proud about themselves and their lives. Conclusion and implications for practice.   <b>Life</b> <b>story</b> work has the potential to enhance person-centred care for older people with dementia and their families. Taking a practice development approach ensures that <b>life</b> <b>story</b> work can be implemented sensitively and is sustained in practice...|$|R
