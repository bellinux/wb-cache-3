25|$|On Friday morning, February 23, 1945, {{four days}} after the Marines landed at Iwo Jima, Rosenthal was making his daily visit to the island on a Marine landing craft when he heard that an American flag was being raised atop Mount Suribachi, a volcano at the {{southern}} tip of the island. Upon landing, Rosenthal hurried toward Suribachi, <b>lugging</b> along his bulky Speed Graphic camera, the standard for press photographers at the time. Together with Marine combat still photographer Pvt. Bob Campbell and Marine color movie photographer Sgt. Bill Genaust, he began the climb up to the summit of Mount Suribachi. When they got about halfway up, they met Staff Sgt. Louis Lowery, a photographer with the Marine publication “Leatherneck” who was coming down the volcano after an enemy grenade explosion on top had knocked him off his feet and broke his camera. Lowery told them that the flag had already been raised at 10:40 am, and he had gotten photos of the flag on the summit. Lowery told them the view was good from the summit, and Rosenthal convinced Genaust and Campbell to continue {{to take him to the}} top with them since they were armed.|$|E

40|$|Two sets of movable <b>lug</b> {{wheel with}} spring {{mechanism}} for hand tractors {{have been designed}} and tested. The wheels were set on local hand tractors and tested for tilling paddy fields in Cianjur and Subang districts, West Java. A local fixed <b>lug</b> wheel was also tested in each location.

The test result in Cianjur showed that the movable <b>lug</b> wheel had a better traction performance than the fixed <b>lug</b> wheel. The average wheel slip of the movable <b>lug</b> wheel was 11. 54 %, while the average wheel slip of the fixed <b>lug</b> wheel was 20. 89 %. Field efficiency of the movable <b>lug</b> wheel was 76. 33 %, which was bigger than the fixed <b>lug</b> wheel (68. 45 %).

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a precise 3 D <b>lug</b> pose {{detection}} sensor for automatic robot welding of a <b>lug</b> {{to a huge}} steel plate used in shipbuilding, where the <b>lug</b> is a handle to carry the huge steel plate. The proposed sensor consists of a camera and four laser line diodes, and its design parameters are determined by analyzing its detectable range and resolution. For the <b>lug</b> pose acquisition, four laser lines are projected on both <b>lug</b> and plate, and the projected lines are detected by the camera. For robust detection of the projected lines against the illumination change, the vertical threshold, thinning, Hough transform and separated Hough transform algorithms are successively applied to the camera image. The <b>lug</b> pose acquisition is carried out by two stages: the top view alignment and the side view alignment. The top view alignment is to detect the coarse <b>lug</b> pose relatively far from the <b>lug,</b> and the side view alignment is to detect the fine <b>lug</b> pose close to the <b>lug.</b> After the top view alignment, the robot is controlled to move close {{to the side of}} the <b>lug</b> for the side view alignment. By this way, the precise 3 D <b>lug</b> pose can be obtained. Finally, experiments with the sensor prototype are carried out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sensor...|$|R

[...] Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of Reed Richards. [...] This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing's swamp. [...] While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard went off on his own and was captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrapped him in swaddling clothes. [...] Although we last saw him in the swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. [...] The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside him, which he knows because it is making him nauseous.

40|$|Defects are {{produced}} when lifting <b>lugs</b> being welded on ship sections during the building process. The {{large amount of}} heat produced in the welding work causes “heat affected zone” in the base metal on sections and destroys painted coatings on the plates; and residual stress decreases the mechanical performance of the steel plates. To eliminate the defects, it is hypothesized that “structural adhesive bonding” can replace welding for installing lifting <b>lugs</b> to some extent. An investigation of the application of adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs</b> in ship building is processed to give methods for the application and check the feasibility of replacing welded lifting <b>lugs</b> with adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs.</b> In the research, a serious of rules for adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs</b> is adapted from rules for welded lifting lugs; “structural adhesives”, “adhesive bonding joints”, “the shape and geometry of lifting lugs” and “positions for installation” are investigated. Then adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs</b> are designed based on the adapted rules; and then improved after the evaluation by FEM simulation. The results show that adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs</b> can replace welding lifting <b>lugs</b> with high probability when the capacity is less than 20 ton; when the capacity is between 20 ton and 30 ton, limitations such as “not enough bonding area” and “no positions for installation” constrain the replacement.
