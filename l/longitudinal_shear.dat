Earthquakes generate seismic waves when the rupture in the system occurs, the seismic waves consist of different types of waves that are capable of moving through the Earth like ripples over water. The causes that lead to slow earthquakes have only been theoretically investigated, by the formation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shear</b> cracks that were analysed using mathematical models. The different distributions of initial stress, sliding frictional stress, and specific fracture energy are all taken into account. If the initial stress minus the sliding frictional stress (with respect to the initial crack) is low, and the specific fracture energy or the strength of the crustal material (relative to the amount of stress) is high then slow earthquakes will occur regularly.In other words, slow earthquakes are caused by a variety of stick-slip and creep processes intermediated between asperity-controlled brittle and ductile fracture. [...] Asperities are tiny bumps and protrusions along the faces of fractures. They are best documented from intermediate crustal levels of certain subduction zones (especially those that dip shallowly — SW Japan, Cascadia, Chile), but appear to occur on other types of faults as well, notably strike-slip plate boundaries such as the San Andreas fault and [...] "mega-landslide" [...] normal faults on the flanks of volcanos.|$|E

2500|$|The acoustoelastic effect {{describes}} how the sound velocities (both <b>longitudinal</b> and <b>shear</b> wave velocities) of an elastic material change if subjected to an initial static stress field.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In simulations and phantom experiments, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shear</b> strain was estimated using RF and envelope-based methods and compared to the applied values. Additionally, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shear</b> strain estimates in the adventitia of six healthy volunteers were determined.
