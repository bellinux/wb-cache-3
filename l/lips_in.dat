In July 2008, the band performed at the VH1 tribute to The Who alongside Foo Fighters, Incubus and The Flaming <b>Lips.</b> <b>In</b> the days prior to Election Day 2008, Pearl Jam digitally released through its official website a free documentary film, entitled Vote for Change? 2004, which follows the band's time spent on the 2004 Vote for Change tour.|$|E
5|$|Bianca tells Whitney she {{is moving}} to Milton Keynes with her partner Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although {{originally}} agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. Lee develops depression, and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On the ride home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} that the 1110 Ma <b>LIP</b> <b>in</b> Congo-São Francisco, Amazonia, and India was part of a much larger event that also involved West Africa and Kalahari (with a possible but unlikely link to the 1075 Ma Warakurna <b>LIP</b> <b>in</b> Australia). However, while the palaeo-latitudes of India and Kalahari are well constrained, those of Amazonia and Congo-São Francisco are not, making any plate tectonic reconstruction speculative.|$|R
25|$|Alloderm is donor tissue {{taken from}} cadavers and then denatured, {{purified}} and treated to remove viable cells that could pass along disease. Under a local anesthesia, Alloderm is placed into the mucosa, or body, of the <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> small rolls {{to make them}} larger. Alloderm can also be placed into the vermilion, the pink area of the lip, to provide definition and a sharper border.|$|E
25|$|OK Go {{finished}} writing {{new material}} and started {{working in the}} studio in October 2008. They worked for two week intervals (opposite The Flaming <b>Lips)</b> <b>in</b> producer Dave Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios, a converted Amish barn in Cassadaga, New York, through May the following year. Bassist Tim Nordwind described {{the process of the}} studio sessions as a midpoint between the slick production work done on OK Go and the emphasis on live takes with the recording of Oh No.|$|E
25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, {{leaning back in his}} chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing that is going on around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong quickly {{adapted to}} the more tightly {{controlled}} style of Henderson, playing trumpet and even experimenting with the trombone. The other members quickly took up Armstrong's emotional, expressive pulse. Soon his act included singing and telling tales of New Orleans characters, especially preachers. The Henderson Orchestra was playing in prominent venues for white-only patrons, including the famed Roseland Ballroom, featuring the arrangements of Don Redman. Duke Ellington's orchestra would go to Roseland to catch Armstrong's performances and young horn men around town {{tried in vain to}} outplay him, splitting their <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> their attempts.|$|E
25|$|Kisses! is a {{controversial}} urinal {{designed by the}} female Dutch designer Meike van Schijndel. It is shaped like an open pair of red <b>lips.</b> <b>In</b> early March 2004, the National Organization for Women (NOW) took offense to the new urinals that Virgin Atlantic Airways decided to install in the Virgin Atlantic clubhouse at JFK Airport in New York City. After receiving many angry phone calls from female customers, Virgin Atlantic Vice President John Riordan called NOW to apologize. Protestors surmised a connection to oral sex or urolagnia, and based their complaints on the urinals being sexist. A McDonald's restaurant in the Netherlands removed them after a customer complained to the head office in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The incisors, {{known only}} from Ferugliotherium, are procumbent and long. Three lower and four upper incisors are known. As is usual in mammals with {{similarly}} shaped (...) incisors, the lower incisors are more laterally compressed, are less curved, form a greater angle between the front {{side and the}} wear facet at the tip, and are less elliptical in shape than the uppers. The enamel band is restricted to the side that faces the <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> both the lower and upper incisors (the lower side in the lowers and the upper side in the uppers).|$|E

500|$|A music video, co-directed by Neil Pollock and Jonathan Bekemeier, {{to promote}} the single shows the band playing its {{instruments}} through a distorted fish-eye lens, the camera variously panning horizontally across the performance space and vertically over the individual band members. Keeping {{in the spirit of}} the mimed performance, Francis and bassist Kim Deal open and shut their mouths in time with their prerecorded vocals, yet make no attempt to articulate their <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> synch with the words that they are supposed to be singing. Instead, they simply keep their mouths wide open with blank expressions for the duration of each verse. Francis stated that [...] "Water on the brain" [...] was the theme of the clip.|$|E
500|$|... "Sally" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creators James Bobin, Jemaine Clement, and Bret McKenzie, the latter two {{starring}} as the titular Flight of the Conchords. Bobin directed the episode. The episode {{is the first of}} the series to feature Rachel Blanchard as Sally. The character returns to disrupt Bret and Jemaine's lives in the fifth episode, [...] "Sally Returns". In [...] "Sally", the character Mel shows Bret that she carries around a picture of Jemaine's <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> her wallet. This was inspired by an incident that happened to the band during the filming of their documentary A Texan Odyssey which covered their trip to the 2006 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. The incident was caught on camera and is included in the documentary. Judah Friedlander has a cameo appearance in this episode, playing the role of the man who tries to sell Dave a cake.|$|E
500|$|Elements of Rocky Horror were {{sanitized}} for the episode, and Shankman {{believes that}} he was sought out {{in order to make}} the production more audience appropriate. Stamos was initially set to play Dr. Frank N. Furter, but the role was recast due to network resistance. Costumes used in the episode were inspired by the Rocky Horror musical and film, but were adapted for the Glee cast and cost over $30,000. The tight gold lamé underwear worn by Peter Hinwood in the 1975 film were replaced by board shorts for Overstreet. In dressing Riley as Frank, series costume designer Lou Eyrich found it challenging to select outfits which would be acceptable for a primetime series, yet would still appeal to all audiences. To appeal to younger viewers, Eyrich updated the costume worn by Colfer as Riff Raff, pairing a tailcoat with jeans and a J.Crew henley shirt. Michele's costuming as Janet was similar to her regular wardrobe as Rachel, with Eyrich commenting, [...] "That's why she was the perfect Janet." [...] Prior to broadcast, cast member Mark Salling claimed that he would play Rocky Horror talking <b>lips.</b> <b>In</b> the event, however, Salling did not appear in the episode. He was temporarily absent from the series, reportedly for creative reasons, and returned in November 2010. The lips were instead played by Rivera.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{the trumpet}} {{and all other}} modern brass wind instruments, the cornet makes a sound when the player vibrates ("buzzes") the <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> the mouthpiece, {{creating}} a vibrating column of air in the tubing. The frequency of the air column's vibration can be modified by changing the lip tension and aperture or [...] "embouchure", and by altering the tongue position to change {{the shape of the}} oral cavity, thereby increasing or decreasing the speed of the airstream. In addition, the column of air can be lengthened by engaging one or more valves, thus lowering the pitch. Double and triple tonguing are also possible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{similarity}} of Metzinger's own work of 1910 {{to that of}} Picasso is exemplified in his Nu à la cheminée (Nude), exhibited at the 1910 Salon d'Automne. The style of <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> both Metzinger's Nude and Picasso's Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde (spring-automn 1910) bear a resemblance to each other (both are {{in the form of}} an [...] "X"). So too, both pictures merge the model with the environment, blurring the distinction between background and foreground. Metzinger, however—in addition to the simultaneous views and multiple perspective—has included the image of a clock in the upper right quadrant, a fact that reveals Metzinger's didactic visual and literary reference to Poincaré and Bergsonian 'duration'.|$|E

Featured in [...] "I Found a Star on the Ground" [...] is Sean Lennon who, with his band, opened for the <b>Lips</b> <b>in</b> early 2011. In the song Lennon reads off several lists of names of people who donated $100 to the Oklahoma City SPCA and Academy of Contemporary Music at University of Central Oklahoma. 212 names are featured in the song.|$|E
2500|$|Diefenbaker met Fraser {{when the}} Mountie {{found him in}} an {{abandoned}} mine. Diefenbaker later pulled Fraser out of Prince Rupert Sound, saving the Mountie's life, but also bursting the wolf's eardrums - which resulted in, according to Fraser, Diefenbaker's deafness. Whether Diefenbaker is actually deaf, and not just suffering from selective hearing, {{is up to the}} viewer. Diefenbaker is apparently able to read <b>lips,</b> <b>in</b> both English and Inuktitut. Diefenbaker has stayed with Fraser ever since and has gone wherever the Mountie is posted. [...] In the final minutes of Pizzas and Promises, Fraser mentions that Diefenbaker has his own savings account, and that he (Fraser) doesn't like to touch Diefenbaker's money.|$|E
2500|$|The bassoon embouchure {{is a very}} {{important}} aspect of producing a full, round, and dark bassoon tone. The bassoon embouchure is made by opening one's mouth, rolling lips inward to cover the teeth, and then dropping the jaw down as in a yawning motion (without actually yawning or opening the mouth). Both upper and lower teeth should be covered by the <b>lips</b> <b>in</b> order to protect the reed and control applied pressure. The reed is then placed in the mouth, with the lips and facial muscles maintaining an airtight seal around the reed. The upper lip will be farther forward on the reed than the lower lip, as in an [...] "overbite" [...] of the upper jaw.|$|E
