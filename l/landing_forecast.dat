40|$|In most {{empirical}} applications, forecasting {{models for}} the analysis of industrial land focus on the relationship between current values of economic parameters and industrial land use. This paper aims to test this assumption by focusing on the dynamic relationship between current and lagged values of the 'economic fundamentals' and industrial land development. Not much effort has yet been attributed to develop <b>land</b> <b>forecasting</b> models to predict the demand for industrial land except those applying static regressions or other statistical measures. In this research, we estimated a dynamic panel data model across 40 regions from 2000 to 2008 for the Netherlands to uncover the relationship between current and lagged values of economic parameters and industrial land development. Land-use regulations such as land zoning policies, and other land-use restrictions like natural protection areas, geographical limitations in the form of water bodies or sludge areas are expected to affect supply of land, which will in turn be reflected in industrial land market outcomes. Our results suggest that gross domestic product (GDP), industrial employment, gross value added (GVA), property price, and other parameters representing demand and supply conditions in the industrial market explain industrial land developments with high significance levels. It is also shown that contrary to the current values, lagged values of the economic parameters have more sound relationships with the industrial developments in the Netherlands.

30|$|Forecasting acreage {{before the}} start of {{planting}} is crucial for several reasons. First, it serves as an indication of how much food will be available in the subsequent harvest season in the respective countries and for the respective crops. The selected countries in our acreage forecasting models are major players in the global food market, as are the four crops key staple crops in many countries. In other words, forecasting the amount of area allocated to these crops in these countries can be a sound signal to availability of food (a shortfall or an excess) in the international market. This has significant implications for global food security situations, in particular in food deficit (food importing) countries. For a given yield per hectare of <b>land,</b> <b>forecasting</b> acreage is an important first step in understanding and forecasting the entire production of the major crops. Second, the crop acreage elasticities indicate the extent to which food production (through acreage adjustments) responds to scarcity. Having country-specific estimates, the findings inform which countries can respond to prices more strongly. Third, it provides key information for input and crop protection supply industries to adapt their productions accordingly.|$|R

The controlled urbanization area is made a region where the urbanization should be controlled by the city planning and zoning act. However, in the zone, there are also many areas where form regulation of the building is looser than the urbanization zone which should form a city area. Therefore disorderly development acts, such as location of the large-scale commercial institution and leisure facilities unsuitable for circumference environment, are accepted in the controlled urbanization area. On the other hand, energies decrease in existing village by population decrease and declining birthrate and a growing proportion of elderly people become a problem.
