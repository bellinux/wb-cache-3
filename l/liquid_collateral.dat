An innovative theoretical framework based on a hedonic market model is developed. We interpret {{the factors that influence}} interest rates as 'quality' components of the credit contract.

50|$|Nonrecourse debt is {{typically}} used to finance {{commercial real estate}}, shipping, or other projects with high capital expenditures, long loan periods, and uncertain revenue streams. It is also commonly used for stock loans and other securities-collateralized lending structures. Since most commercial real estate is owned in a partnership structure (or similar tax pass-through), nonrecourse borrowing gives the real estate owner the tax benefits of a tax-pass-through partnership structure (that is, loss pass-through and no double taxation), and simultaneously limits personal liability {{to the value of}} the investment. A nonrecourse debt of $30 billion was issued to JPMorgan Chase by the Federal Reserve in order to purchase Bear Stearns on March 16, 2008.

40|$|The {{events from}} the 2007 - 2009 {{financial}} crisis have raised {{concerns that the}} failure of large financial institutions can lead to destabilizing fire sales of assets. The risk of fire sales is related to exemptions from bankruptcy's automatic stay provision enjoyed {{by a number of}} financial contracts, such as repo. An automatic stay prohibits collection actions by creditors against a bankrupt debtor or his property. It prevents a creditor from liquidating collateral of a defaulting debtor since collateral is a lien on the debtor's property. In this paper, we construct a model of repo transactions, and consider the effects of changing the bankruptcy rule regarding the automatic stay on the activity in repo and real investment markets. We find that exempting repos from the automatic stay is beneficial for creditors who that hold the borrowers' collateral. Although the exemption may increase the size of the repo market by enhancing the liquidity of collateral, it can also lead to subsequent damaging fire sales that are associated with reductions in real investment activity. Hence, policy makers face a trade-off between the benefits of investment activity and the benefits of <b>liquid</b> markets for <b>collateral...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper offers}} a {{possible}} explanation for the conflicting results in the literature concerning the empirical relation between collateral and loan risk. We posit that certain economic characteristics of collateral may be associated with the empirical dominance of different risk-collateral channels implied by economic theory, namely the “lender selection,” “borrower selection,” “risk-shifting,” and “loss mitigation” channels. Each of these four channels has different predictions regarding the empirical relations between collateral and loan risk. For our sample of commercial loans, we find that the “lender selection” channel appears to be especially important for outside collateral, the “risk-shifting” and “loss mitigation” channels are important for <b>liquid</b> <b>collateral,</b> and the “borrower selection” channel appears to hold weakly for nondivertible collateral. Our results suggest that the conflicting results in the extant riskcollateral literature may occur because different samples may be dominated by collateral with different economic characteristics. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{possible}} explanation for the conflicting results in the literature concerning the empirical relation between collateral and loan risk. We posit that differences in collateral characteristics, such as liquidity, may be associated with the empirical dominance of different risk-collateral relations implied by economic theory. Using credit registry data and a novel identification strategy to control for borrower and lender selection effects allows us to differentiate between the ex ante and ex post theories of collateral. We find that collateral overall is associated with lower risk premiums and higher default rates. The results indicate an important role for collateral in mitigating losses and reducing risk-taking incentives, consistent with ex post theories. <b>Liquid</b> <b>collateral</b> is associated with especially low risk premiums, and these loans perform better than those with illiquid collateral or no collateral.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-period model {{to analyze the}} need for bank reserves {{in the presence of}} other liquid assets like Treasury securities. If a pair of banks settle bank transfers without bank reserves, they must prepare extra liquidity for interbank payments, because depositors'demand for timely payments causes a hold-up problem in the bilateral settlement of bank transfers. In light of this result, the interbank payment system provided by the central bank can be regarded as an implicit interbank settlement contract to save liquidity. The central bank is necessary for this contract as the custodian of collateral. Bank reserves can be characterized as the balances of <b>liquid</b> <b>collateral</b> submitted by banks to participate into this contract. This result explains the rate-of-return dominance puzzle and the need for substitution between bank reserves and other liquid assets simultaneously. The optimal contract is the floor system, not only because it pays interest on bank reserves, but also because it eliminates the over- the-counter interbank money market. The model indicates it is efficient if all banks share the same custodian of collateral, which justifies the current practice that a public institution provides the interbank payment system. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper offers}} a {{possible}} explanation for the conflicting empirical results in the literature concerning the relation between loan risk and collateral. Specifically, we posit that different economic characteristics or types of collateral pledges may be associated with the empirical dominance of the four different risk-collateral channels implied by economic theory. For our sample, collateral overall is associated with lower loan risk premiums and a higher probability of ex post loan nonperformance (delinquency or default). This finding suggests that the dominant reason collateral is pledged is that banks require collateral from observably riskier borrowers (“lender selection ” effect), while lower risk premiums arise because secured loans carry lower losses given default (“loss mitigation ” effect). We also find that the risk-collateral channels depend on the economic characteristics and types of collateral. The lender selection effect appears to be especially important for outside collateral, the “risk-shifting ” or “loss mitigation ” effects for <b>liquid</b> <b>collateral,</b> and the “borrower selection ” effect for nondivertible collateral. Among collateral types, we find that the lender selection effect is particularly strong for residential real estate collateral and that the risk shifting effect is important for pledged deposits and bank guarantees.

40|$|Executive summary Purpose {{of study}} The use of {{collateral}} {{has become one}} of the most important and widespread risk mitigation techniques in wholesale financial markets. Financial institutions extensively employ collateral in lending, in securities trading and derivatives markets and in payment and settlement systems. Central banks generally require collateral in their credit operations. Over the last decade, the use of collateral in wholesale financial markets has grown rapidly. The collateral most commonly used and apparently preferred by market participants are instruments with inherently low credit and liquidity risks, namely government securities and cash. With the growth of collateral use so rapid, concern has been expressed that it could outstrip the growth of the effective supply of these preferred assets. Scarcity of collateral could increase the cost of financial transactions, slow or inhibit financial activity and potentially encourage greater reliance on more inefficient non-price rationing mechanisms, such as restricting access to markets. These developments suggest two questions for exploration. The first is to what extent trends in the use of collateral and its supply have created or have the potential to create a relative scarcity of low-risk, <b>liquid</b> <b>collateral</b> and, if such scarcity emerges, how markets could adjust. The second is how such adjustment mechanisms and other changes in collateral usage might alter market dynamics and the risk management demands on financial institutions, particularly in stress periods. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{enterprise}} {{receives a}} note, rather than cash, as {{a contribution to}} its equity. The transaction may be a sale of capital stock or a contribution to paid-in capital. The issue is whether an enterprise should report the note receivable as a reduction of shareholders' equity or as an asset. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that reporting the note as an asset is generally not appropriate, except in very limited circumstances when there is substantial evidence of ability and intent to pay within a reasonably short period of time. Some Task Force members would require collateralization, or payment of the note prior to issuance of the financial statements, to permit asset recognition. The SEC requires that public companies report notes received in payment for the enterprise's stock as a deduction from shareholders ' equity. Task Force members confirmed that the predominant practice is to offset the notes and stock in the equity section. However, such notes may be recorded as an asset if collected in cash prior to issuance of the financial statements. Some Task Force members stated that {{they were aware of}} very few cases in which nonpublic companies reported such notes as an asset except in circumstances in which they (1) were secured Copyright © 1985, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution age 1 by irrevocable letters of credit or other <b>liquid</b> <b>collateral</b> or were discountable at a bank and (2) included a stated maturity in a reasonably short period of time.

40|$|This essay {{consist of}} three chapters. In chapter 1, I analyze the {{equilibrium}} behavior of asset prices and margins (i. e collateral required to trade shares using debt), when Market Makers smooth out price fluctuations by trading on a margin. I address {{the questions of}} 1) whether financial margins can increase in reaction to supply shocks without misinformation about the shocks' nature, 2) when non-fundamental shocks reduce asset prices and increase margins, and 3) how margins and prices react to persistent supply shocks, as opposed to temporary ones. In the model, price fluctuations are induced by supply shocks, and margins are set to match the price depreciation induced by a future negative tail shock. Temporary shocks (i. e. shocks that fade very soon) are shown to have no effects on prices or margins, when either they are small or Market Makers hold large collateral amounts. If the shock is sufficiently large, some shares will be held by (currently active) risk averse investors, and price falls due to larger risk premium. If, before the shock, Market Makers were holding asset shares, prices fall even more, because Market Makers wealth is marked down, and expected future prices falls, since it becomes more likely that future shocks will depress prices. Persistent shocks (i. e. shocks that do not fade quickly) reduce current prices, because, in the best scenario, they shift down the future price distribution, and reduce Market Makers' asset valuation. I give conditions for margins to increase with a persistent shock. Falling prices and higher margins {{are not necessarily the}} result of a margin spiral (i. e. when margins increase and constrain Market Makers, who are forced to sell, causing prices to fall and margins increase more). Margins can increase because future price variance increases {{at the same time as}} Market Makers' asset valuation reduces, and Market Makers may not be financially constrained at all. In chapter 2, I study repurchase agreements, short-term collateralized loans known as repos, that are commonly used to fund different sorts of assets. Using a dataset of Money Market Mutual Funds (MMF), I find that repos backed by <b>liquid</b> <b>collateral,</b> such as US Treasuries securities, have on average shorter maturities, lower haircut rates and lower interest rates than less <b>liquid</b> <b>collateral,</b> while the average maturities of repos held by MMF are positively correlated with fund size and overall portfolio maturity. Motivated by these evidences, I develop an equilibrium model to price simultaneously assets and repos. I show that assortative matching between assets and lenders offering different maturities exists in equilibrium. Lenders who offer longer maturities are better suited to finance less liquidity securities, since investors' expected transaction costs are lower, as collateral (to repay debt) is sold long after their debt is considered unworthy. Liquid securities prices increase with repos, in order to make the financing of illiquid securities more attractive to long maturity lenders. Interest rates and haircuts are functions of both the transaction costs and maturities distributions, and are shown to be increasing in illiquidity. Haircuts exceed the securities' transaction costs, in order to cover how much securities depreciate when sold, and to force borrowers to repay the interest on their debt. Moreover, illiquid securities have higher haircuts, because not only they have larger transaction costs but also because the repos used to finance them pay more interest. I emulate a financial crisis through an increase in the probability of a debt run. As repos are terminated earlier, all asset prices decrease. Illiquid securities prices, however, fall notably more and haircuts and interest rates of repos to fund them increase. In chapter 3, which is co-authored with Siwei Kwok, we study the interaction of information and competition in incentivizing quality provision. We estimate a discrete quality game with Los Angeles County restaurant hygiene inspection data set, via the two step method of Bajari et al (2006). Our results suggest that firm competition incentivizes quality provision, but the effect is non-monotonic. If a market is saturated with a sufficiently large number of firms, an additional firm might actually reduces the likelihood that all others will provide quality. Information, however, enhances the effects of competition and reduces the threshold which additional firms reduce quality provided...|$|E

Methodology. In the study the following methods are used: a comparative and morphological methods – to reveal the content and development of scientific thoughts about the interpretation of the concept of «financial support»; methods of systematization and generalization – to determine the functionality of the agricultural sector and the need of its financial support and to reveal the features of its functioning; systemic method – to construct a model of the implementation of agricultural sector financial support; logical method – for a consistent generalization of theoretical and practical scientific research statements. Results. Investigation of formation and development of the doctrine of financial support and systematization of scientific thoughts about its essence gives the opportunity to consider the content of the studied category in terms of the functional approach. Interpretation of the term “financial support” comes down to the statement that the formation of the theoretical foundations of the essence and the economic nature of financial support {{is a result of the}} achievements of several generations of scientists, each of whom invested a significant contribution to the development of the theory of the studied concept. This allowed us to analyze the term «financial providing» and to summarize the existing approaches in the light of the activities of the agricultural sector. In terms of functionality we found that financial support as a phenomenon can be seen in the context of its unique significance in the development of the economy. Practical implications. It was determined that the problems of financial support of the agricultural sector in Ukraine have a complex nature and relate to the economic, social and political spheres of its operation. The most important obstacles in the financial and credit sphere were and remain as follows: lack of adequate financial infrastructure to facilitate its development; lack of property that can be taken as sufficiently <b>liquid</b> <b>collateral</b> to guarantee repayment of the loan; complicated procedure for obtaining a bank loan and the length of the decision-making on the provision of concessional loans; lack of common rules for access of entities to the sources of financial resources; systematic need for funds for working capital; need for financial resources for the operation etc. In the article it is concretized and enhanced the concept of «financial security» as a system, which is characterized by a set of elements (tools, forms, methods of financing, leverages of the financial impact) and the relationship between them, the proper organization of which should focus on the effective development of the agricultural sector, and the fulfillment of its functions and the ability to show the closeness of the relationship between all the structural elements of the system in the process providing of agrarian business by financial resources.
