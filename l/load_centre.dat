5|$|Following the Second World War {{the demand}} for {{electricity}} increased in the United Kingdom. In North East England, {{this led to the}} construction of two new power stations at Stella, along with the expansion of stations at Dunston and Billingham, to meet {{the demand for}} power quickly. At Blyth, a larger and more efficient plant was planned, consisting of six 100megawatts (MW) generating units. This increased to six 120MW units, before increasing again in the final proposal for an A station consisting of four 120MW units and a B station consisting of two 275MW units and two 350MW units. This gave the A and B stations generating capacities of 480MW and 1,250MW respectively. The Blyth Power Stations were to be an experiment, using a variety of generating set sizes at a time when engineers were trying to standardise power station plant and layout. Blyth was the first in the UK to use generating sets larger than the then standard 30MW and 60MW. The station's location was chosen because of its position within the super grid, rather than to be near a <b>load</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To {{provide a}} quality and secured power supply {{in all the}} <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> is a {{challenging}} task. Due {{to the increase in}} load and various emergency conditions the voltage level in <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> may vary beyond the acceptable level which leads to voltage collapse and increase the system losses. To maintain the voltage levels within the acceptable range in all <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> reactive power support is very essential. The control centres has to provide the optimal reactive power where ever necessary to prevent these critical situations. To provide the controllable amount of reactive power and voltage in the needy region efficient power flow analysis are required. Many traditional methods are available but it has limitations and converged in poor optimal solution. In this paper an effective hybrid Differential Evolution Algorithm assisted Genetic Algorithm approach with multi objective functions are considered. In this approach the best features of Differential Evolution Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm are combined together and developed. In IEEE 30 bus the effectiveness and the superiority of this method is verified...|$|R

50|$|The link is {{designed}} to be able to transmit electricity in both northwards and southwards directions, but the design of the transmission system in the lower North Island restricts the amount of electricity that can be transmitted southwards. The North Island's electricity system has most of its generation in the centre of the island, while the two major load centres, Auckland and Wellington, are located north and south of the main generation resources. The HVDC Inter-Island link connects to the North Island AC transmission system at Haywards in Wellington. The Wellington region is a major <b>load</b> <b>centre</b> with a regional peak demand of approximately 780 MW. Local generation capacity is only 165 MW, and the majority of that is wind power, which is intermittent and cannot be relied on to cover load when required, meaning the region must import electricity to meet demand.|$|E

50|$|The two {{islands are}} {{geographically}} different - the South Island is 33% {{larger than the}} North Island in land area (151,000 km2 vs 114,000 km2), but the North Island has over three times {{the population of the}} South Island (3.39 million vs 1.04 million). As a consequence, the North Island has a substantially larger energy demand. However, the South Island uses more electricity per capita due to its cooler climate (according to the 2006 Census, 75% of New Zealand households use electricity to heat at least part of their home) and the presence of the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, which at a peak demand of 640 MW is New Zealand's largest single electricity user, and the second largest <b>load</b> <b>centre</b> after the city of Auckland. In 2011, around 37.1% of the total electricity generated was consumed in the South Island, while 62.9% was consumed in the North Island. South Island generation accounted for 40.9% of the nation's electricity in 2011, nearly all (97%) from hydroelectricity, while the North Island generated the remaining 59.1% from a mixture of mainly hydroelectric, natural gas and geothermal generation, plus smaller amount of coal and wind generation.|$|E
