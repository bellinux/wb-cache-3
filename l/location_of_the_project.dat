2500|$|Uncertain {{national}} economic conditions in 1907 delayed the official start of construction until August 1, 1908. The project {{was divided into}} seven sections, one for each contracting company. [...] Sections 3-6 were [...] each; Sections 1-2 and 7 were of varying lengths. (Theoretically, to divide the [...] line evenly, the seven sections should have been just over four miles each, {{but that would have}} placed the Pequest Fill entirely within Section 3 and the two viaducts within Section 7.) [...] The amount of work per mile varied; the largest share apparently went to David W. Flickwir, whose Section 3 included Roseville Tunnel and the eastern half of the Pequest Fill.
