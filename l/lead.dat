5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute <b>lead</b> poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood <b>lead</b> levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of <b>lead</b> poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood <b>lead</b> levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of <b>lead.</b> Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood <b>lead</b> levels return to premorbid levels. When <b>lead</b> exposure has taken place over a long period, blood <b>lead</b> levels may rise after chelation is stopped because <b>lead</b> is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence <b>lead</b> compound. <b>Lead</b> dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to <b>lead</b> monoxide, <b>lead</b> dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. <b>Lead</b> disulfide and <b>lead</b> diselenide are only stable at high pressures. <b>Lead</b> tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. <b>Lead</b> tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at room temperature, <b>lead</b> tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} <b>lead</b> tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E
5|$|In {{this process}} <b>lead</b> bullion and slag is {{obtained}} directly from <b>lead</b> concentrates. The <b>lead</b> sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming <b>lead</b> monoxide. Carbon (coke or coal gas) {{is added to}} the molten charge along with fluxing agents. The <b>lead</b> monoxide is thereby reduced to metallic <b>lead,</b> {{in the midst of a}} slag rich in <b>lead</b> monoxide.|$|E

5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} <b>lead,</b> such {{as small}} <b>lead</b> fishing lures, increases blood <b>lead</b> levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains <b>lead,</b> and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains <b>lead.</b> When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing <b>lead</b> may be present. People who eat animals hunted with <b>lead</b> bullets {{may be at risk}} for <b>lead</b> exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of <b>lead,</b> but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release <b>lead</b> into the body over time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant.

In August 2009, parents rioted in China after <b>lead</b> poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. <b>Lead</b> exposure can occur from contact with <b>lead</b> in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in <b>lead</b> pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made <b>lead</b> pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. <b>Lead</b> pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E

40|$|Using {{appropriate}} yeast strains and exogenous acceptors, we {{have devised}} specific assays for four mannosyltransferase activities involved in biosynthesis of the carbohydrate outer chain of yeast mannoproteins.

The multiglycosyltransferase system from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was solubilized in Triton X- 100 and urea and purified 100 -fold. Free mannose is an acceptor for the alpha 1 <b>leads</b> to 2 -mannosyltransferase, the major product being alpha[14 C]Man <b>leads</b> to 2 Man. The alpha 1 <b>leads</b> to 6 -mannooligosaccharides serve as acceptors for both the alpha 1 <b>leads</b> to 2 - and alpha 1 <b>leads</b> to 6 -transferases, but the tetrasaccharide alphaMan <b>leads</b> to 3 alphsMan <b>leads</b> to 2 alphaMan is a specific acceptor for the latter enzyme and yields (see article).
