5000|$|The primary {{is thought}} to be a {{standard}} implosion method fission bomb, though likely with a core boosted by small amounts of fusion fuel (usually 50/50% deuterium/tritium gas) for extra efficiency; the fusion fuel releases excess neutrons when heated and compressed, inducing additional fission. Generally, a research program with the capacity to create a thermonuclear bomb has already mastered the ability to engineer boosted fission. When fired, the plutonium-239 (Pu-239) or uranium-235 (U-235) core would be compressed to a smaller sphere by special layers of conventional high explosives arranged around it in an explosive <b>lens</b> <b>pattern,</b> initiating the nuclear chain reaction that powers the conventional [...] "atomic bomb".|$|E

40|$|The 3 Ocelli of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala, grouped close {{together}} {{on the top of}} the head (Fig. 1), have large, extensively overlapping visual fields. Together they view the entire upper hemisphere of the surroundings plus part of the lower hemisphere (Fig. 5, 7). It is shown for the lateral ocelli that despite the underfocussing of the ocellar <b>lens</b> large <b>patterns</b> are imaged on the receptor mosaic. Because of the astigmatism of the <b>lens,</b> <b>patterns</b> in longitudinal orientations are more accurately represented than in others (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, an artifical horizon rotated around the long axis of the animal does not elicit head roll. Likewise, changes of overall brightness in the visual field of the median and one lateral ocellus elicit only weak phasic-tonic "dorsal light responses" of the animal which supplement the tonic dorsal light responses mediated by the compound eyes (Figs. 9, 10).

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of immunolocalization of two oxygen-binding proteins, neuroglobin (Ngb) and cytoglobin (Cygb), in the anterior segment of healthy human and canine eyes. Specific antibodies against Ngb and Cygb were used to examine their distribution patterns in anterior segment structures including the cornea, iris, trabecular meshwork, canal of Schlemm, ciliary body, and <b>lens.</b> <b>Patterns</b> of immunoreactivity (IR) were imaged with confocal scanning laser and conventional microscopy. Analysis of sectioned human and canine eyes showed Ngb and Cygb IR in the corneal epithelium and endothelium. In the iris, Ngb and Cygb IR was localized to the anterior border and the stroma, iridal sphincter, and dilator muscle. In the iridocorneal angle, Ngb and Cygb were detected in endothelial cells of the trabecular meshwork and canal of Schlemm in human. In the ciliary body, Ngb and Cygb IR was localized to the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium of the pars plana and pars plicata and in ciliary body musculature. Ngb and Cygb distribution was similar and colocalized within the same structures of healthy human and canine anterior eye segments. Based on their immunolocalization and previously reported biochemical features, we hypothesize that Ngb and Cygb may function as scavengers of reactive oxygen species.

40|$|Freshwater {{fish have}} been model hosts {{in the study}} of the {{community}} and evolutionary ecology of parasites for decades. Most studies have dealt only with adult parasites, although larval stages often dominate fish parasite communities. In addition, few studies include replicates of both host species and sampling localities. For this thesis, both larval and adult parasites were surveyed in six fish species (Notemigonus crysoleucas, Pimephales notatus, Perca flavescens, Etheostoma nigrum, Lepomis gibbosus, Ambloplites rupestris) collected from six localities in the St. Lawrence River and molecular techniques were used to distinguish species of strigeid metacercariae (Platyhelminthes: Trematoda). Novel primers were developed to sequence the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene and sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA were also obtained. Both markers indicated unexpectedly high numbers of species in strigeid metacercariae, but resolution between species was clearer with COI than with ITS sequences. Strigeid species inhabiting the lens of the eye of fish were significantly less host specific than species inhabiting other tissues, possibly due to limited immune activity in the <b>lens.</b> <b>Patterns</b> of host specificity were consistent across the separate fish communities, which included fish species that are ecologically distinctive but closely related. Together, these findings suggest that physiological incompatibility between host and parasite is a more important determinant of host specificity than the ecological availability of host species to parasites in strigeid metacercariae. The high host specificity of most strigeid species had important effects on the parasite communities as a whole. Closely related fish species showed a significant tendency to have similar parasite communities that was much stronger than the tendency of parasite communities in spatially proximate fish to be similar. Geographic distance was strongly associated with parasite community similarity only when comparisons were limited to fish of the same species. Host taxonomy explained much more structure in parasite communities than spatial categories, suggesting that host phylogeny is more important than habitat in determining parasite community composition and abundance...|$|R

At 25 weeks of age, interocular differences (OD-OS) of the experimental group were significantly greater than interocular differences of age-matched normal monkeys for both axial length (P < 0. 05) and refractive error (P < 0. 02). In addition, while the treated eyes were significantly different from normal eyes for both axial length measurements (P < 0. 01) and refractive error (P < 0. 01), {{there were no significant differences}} between the untreated fellow eyes and normal eyes.

30|$|A metal nanoslit-array lens can {{be viewed}} as a {{discrete}} version of conventional glass lens [23]: an incident light transmits through each nanoslit and subsequently reradiates into its characteristic radiation pattern; the wavelets then constructively interfere to the zero-order diffraction direction, similar to the case of conventional dielectric interface described above. However, an important difference should be noted here: in metal <b>lenses</b> the radiation <b>pattern</b> of nanoaperture transmission can be easily altered for the benefit of enhancing the glancing-angle propagation components.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that only approximately 5 % of U. S. beef cattle have documented chronological ages. Several methods for determining or predicting cattle age exist, including vertebra ossification, lean color, and dentition.

Upon exposure to UV light having a wavelength of above 300 nm, multifunctional coumarin-PDMSs are transformed into covalent networks via [2 + 2] photocycloaddition of two coumarin moieties forming a cyclobutane ring.
