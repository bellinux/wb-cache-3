25|$|The {{painting}} {{is thought to}} be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. Recent academic work suggests that {{it would not have been}} started before 1513. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris since 1797.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why {{does the}} <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> hold its {{branches}} {{straight up in}} the air like that, when all the other poplars hold theirs out or hang them down?" [...] interjected Peter, who had been gazing intently at the slender spire showing darkly against the fine blue eastern sky.|$|E
60|$|A little {{back from}} the {{buildings}} were gardens and several acres of plantation--both shade and fruit trees. Viewed from the outside, it all looked like an immense poplar grove, {{on account of the}} double rows of tall <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> trees at the borders. The whole ground, including the buildings, was surrounded by an immense ditch or moat.|$|E
6000|$|Talking on quietly the {{two young}} men walked out of the village into a lane bordered with <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars.</b> Harold threw himself down on the grass beneath them and said: ...|$|R
50|$|A {{reforestation}} {{program had}} been under way in Spain since 1940. The aims of the program included meeting market demand for forest products, controlling erosion, and providing seasonal employment in rural areas. Eucalyptus trees, <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars,</b> {{and a variety of}} conifers were emphasized because of their fast growth.|$|R
50|$|In May 2011, a {{green area}} in Block 8-a was named Lukićev gaj (Lukić's grove) {{after one of}} the most famous Serbian children's poet, Dragan Lukić, who lived nearby and died in 2006. Area was reconstructed and new <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> were planted. Mini park covers and area of 500 m2.|$|R
60|$|Out in the berry patch {{he talked}} over the {{neighborhood}} affairs and picked berries and killed mosquitoes, while the wind wandered by with rustling {{steps on the}} <b>lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> leaves. The locusts sang and the grasshoppers snapped their shining wings. It was a blessed relief to his troubled older self, for he slipped back into the more tranquil life of his boyhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{exciting}} {{has happened}} for ever so long," [...] said the Story Girl discontentedly, one late May evening, as we lingered under the wonderful white bloom of the cherry trees. There {{was a long}} row {{of them in the}} orchard, with a <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> at either end, and a hedge of lilacs behind. When the wind blew over them all the spicy breezes of Ceylon's isle were never sweeter.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{tone was}} so bitterly hopeless that the great, jolly face of Mrs. Councill {{stiffened}} into {{a look of}} horror such as she had not known for years. The children, in two separate groups, could be heard rioting. Bees were humming around the clover in the grass, and the kingbird chattered ceaselessly from the <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> tip. Both women felt all this peace and beauty of the morning dimly, and it disturbed Mrs. Councill because the other was so impassive under it all. At last, after a long and thoughtful pause, Mrs. Councill asked a question whose answer she knew would decide it all--asked it very kindly and softly: ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{probable}} that Thomas Jefferson was the first influential person who {{took an interest in}} cleaning up the brush that covered the land. By 1810, some rows of <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> had been planted, however, the avenue itself [...] "was too much of a morass" [...] to be traversed on horseback.|$|R
50|$|The Green Cathedral or De Groene Kathedraal {{located near}} Almere Netherlands, is an artistic {{planting}} of <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> (Populus nigra italica) that mimics {{the size and}} shape of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims, France. The Green Cathedral is 150 m long and 75 m wide, and the mature poplar trees are approximately 30 m tall.|$|R
60|$|We {{went out}} to the garden in the scented moist air of a {{maritime}} spring evening. Behind the garden was a cloudy pine wood; the house closed it in on the left, while in front and on the right a row of tall <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> stood out in stately purple silhouette against the sunset sky.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew every}} foot of this farm. I had traversed it scores {{of times in}} every direction, {{following}} the plow, the harrow, or the seeder. With a great lumber wagon at my side I had husked corn from every acre of it, and now I was leaving it with no intention of returning. My action, like that of my father, was final. As I looked back up the lane at the tall <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> trees bent like sabres in the warm western wind, the landscape I was leaving seemed suddenly very beautiful, and the old home very peaceful and very desirable. Nevertheless I went on.|$|E
60|$|The {{early seventies}} were years of swift {{change on the}} Middle Border. Day by day the {{settlement}} thickened. Section by section the prairie was blackened by the plow. Month by month the sweet wild meadows were fenced and pastured and so at last the colts and cows all came into captivity, and our horseback riding ceased, cut short as if by some imperial decree. Lanes of barbed wire replaced the winding wagon trails, our saddles gathered dust in the grain-sheds, and groves of <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> and European larch replaced the tow-heads of aspen and hazel through which we had pursued the wolf and fox.|$|E
60|$|Not so: on the Twentieth {{morning of}} June, a large Tree of Liberty, <b>Lombardy</b> <b>Poplar</b> by kind, lies visibly tied on its car, in the Suburb-Antoine. Suburb Saint-Marceau too, in the uttermost South-East, {{and all that}} remote Oriental region, Pikemen and Pikewomen, National Guards, and the unarmed curious are gathering,--with the peaceablest {{intentions}} in the world. A tricolor Municipal arrives; speaks. Tush, it is all peaceable, we tell thee, {{in the way of}} Law: are not Petitions allowable, and the Patriotism of Mais? The tricolor Municipal returns without effect: your Sansculottic rills continue flowing, combining into brooks: towards noontide, led by tall Santerre in blue uniform, by tall Saint-Huruge in white hat, it moves Westward, a respectable river, or complication of still-swelling rivers.|$|E
5000|$|Cornish's {{choice of}} plants was {{influenced}} by their symbolic meanings, selecting five Populus nigra [...] "Italica" [...] (<b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars)</b> to represent the five women of the Pioneer Women’s Memorial Trust; Quercus ilex (holly oak) and Myrtus communis (myrtle) for protection and love; Lonicera (honeysuckle) for love, generosity and devotion; and Syringa vulgaris (lilac) to symbolize memory, protection, youth and tenderness. Here the designer carefully selected plants for their metaphorical meanings.|$|R

50|$|Magra is {{just over}} the hill from New Norfolk. It {{consists}} mainly of dwelling houses and farmland. Accommodation is also available as the area is popular with tourists. Notable features of Magra itself include the surrounding hills and the plantation of <b>Lombardy</b> <b>Poplars.</b> The site of the grave of Betty King, {{believed to be the}} first European white woman to set foot on Australian soil, is located in the vicinity of Magra.|$|R
60|$|On {{all this}} visible earth {{there were no}} fences, and no trees {{excepting}} those which had been planted at the old estancia houses, and these being far apart the groves and plantations looked like small islands of trees, or mounds, blue in the distance, on the great plain or pampa. They were mostly shade trees, the commonest being the <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar,</b> which of all trees is the easiest one to grow in that land. And these trees at the estancias or cattle-ranches were, at the time I am writing about, almost invariably aged and in many instances in an advanced state of decay. It is interesting to know how these old groves and plantations ever came into existence in a land where at that time there was practically no tree-planting.|$|E
60|$|In {{a former}} chapter on {{the aspects of}} the plain I {{described}} the groves and plantations, which marked the sites of the estancia houses, as appearing like banks or islands of trees, blue in the distance, on the vast flat sea-like plain. Some of these were many miles away and were but faintly visible on the horizon, others nearer, and the nearest of all was but two miles from us, on the hither side of that shallow river to which my first long walk was taken, where I was amazed and enchanted with my first sight of flamingoes. This place was called Los Alamos, or The Poplars, a name which would have suited {{a large majority of}} the estancia houses with trees growing about them, seeing that the tall <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> was almost always there in long rows towering high above all other trees and a landmark in the district. It is about the people dwelling at Los Alamos I have now to write.|$|E
60|$|Imagine an orchard of nut-trees, {{with very}} large long leaves. Each tree is trained {{to a single}} stem. Among them, {{especially}} near the path, grow plants of the common hothouse Datura, its long white flowers perfuming all the air. They have been planted as landmarks, to prevent the young Cacao-trees being cut over when the weeds are cleared. Among them, too, at some twenty yards apart, are the stems of a tree looking much like an ash, save that it is inclined to throw out broad spurs, like a Ceiba. You look up, and {{see that they are}} Bois immortelles, {126} fifty or sixty feet high, one blaze of vermilion against the blue sky. Those who have stood under a <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> in early spring, and looked up at its buds and twigs, showing like pink coral against the blue sky, and have felt the beauty of the sight, can imagine faintly--but only faintly--the beauty of these Madres de Cacao (Cacao-mothers), as they call them here, because their shade is supposed to shelter the Cacao-trees, while the dew collected by their leaves keeps the ground below always damp.|$|E
50|$|The undulating site is {{landscaped}} {{and includes}} walkways, woodland areas {{and a large}} pond on the north-western side. The pond has an island with a large weeping willow and pond-side plants, {{some of which were}} taken from surplus stock at Blackheath's's Hare and Billet pond during restoration in 1994. Other tree specimens include <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> and a group of sycamores. The park supports a diverse range of flora and fauna for its size and location.|$|R
60|$|The tall <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> {{were the}} most {{numerous}} of the older trees, and grew in double rows, forming walks or avenues, on three sides of the entire enclosed ground. There was also a cross-row of poplars dividing the gardens and buildings from the plantation, and these were the favourite nesting-trees of two of our best-loved birds--the beautiful little goldfinch or Argentine siskin, and the bird called firewood-gatherer by the natives {{on account of the}} enormous collection of sticks which formed the nest.|$|R
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a discourse, or the joy with which I became gradually convinced that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman (whom I soon recognized as my neighbor Windenough) was, in fact, the identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with my wife. Time, place, and circumstances rendered it a matter beyond question. I did not at least during the long {{period in which the}} inventor of <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> continued to favor me with his explanations.|$|R
6000|$|In fact, Quebec is {{a little}} painful in this and other confusions of the South and North, and one never quite reconciles himself to them. The Frenchmen, who {{expected}} to find there the climate of their native land, and ripen her wines in as kindly a sun, have perpetuated the image of home in so many things, that {{it goes to the}} heart with a painful emotion to find the sad, oblique light of the North upon them. As you ponder some characteristic aspect of Quebec,--a bit of street with heavy stone houses opening upon a stretch of the city wall, with a <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> rising slim against it,--you say, to your satisfied soul, [...] "Yes, it is the real thing!" [...] and then all at once a sense of that Northern sky strikes in upon you, and makes the reality a mere picture. The sky is blue, the sun is often fiercely hot; you could not perhaps prove that the pathetic radiance is not an efflux of your own consciousness that summer is but hanging over the land, briefly poising on wings which flit at the first dash of rain, and will soon vanish in long retreat before the snow. But somehow, from without or from within, that light of the North is there.|$|E
6000|$|In {{manner of}} growth, we have weeping or {{pendulous}} varieties of the willow, ash, elm, oak, and yew, and other trees; and this weeping habit is sometimes inherited, {{though in a}} singularly capricious manner. In the <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar,</b> and in certain fastigiate or pyramidal varieties of thorns, junipers, oaks, etc., we have an opposite kind of growth. The Hessian oak (10/147. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1842 page 36.), which is famous from its fastigiate habit and size, bears hardly any resemblance in general appearance to a common oak; [...] "its acorns are not sure to produce plants of the same habit; some, however, turn out {{the same as the}} parent-tree." [...] Another fastigiate oak {{is said to have been}} found wild in the Pyrenees, and this is a surprising circumstance; it generally comes so true by seed, that De Candolle considered it as specifically distinct. (10/148. Loudon's 'Arboretum et Fruticetum' volume 3 page 1731.) The fastigiate Juniper (J. suecica) likewise transmits its character by seed. (10/149. Ibid volume 4 page 2489.) Dr. Falconer informs me that in the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta the great heat caused apple-trees to become fastigiate; and we thus see the same result following from the effects of climate and from some unknown cause. (10/150. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 91 describes four varieties of Robinia remarkable from their manner of growth.) ...|$|E
60|$|When {{one talks}} of the 'the limit of trees' on a {{mountain}} side, however, {{it must be remembered}} that the phrase is used in a strictly human or Pickwickian sense, and that it is only the size, not the type, of the vegetation that is really in question. For trees exist even on the highest hill-tops: only they have accommodated themselves to the exigencies of the situation. Smaller and ever smaller species have been developed by natural selection to suit the peculiarities of these inclement spots. Take, for example, the willow and poplar group. Nobody would deny that a weeping willow by an English river, or a <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplar</b> in an Italian avenue, was as much of a true tree as an oak or a chestnut. But as one mounts towards the bare and wind-swept mountain heights one finds that the willows begin to grow downward gradually. The 'netted willow' of the Alps and Pyrenees, which shelters itself under the lee of little jutting rocks, attains the height of only a few inches; while the 'herbaceous willow,' common on all very high mountains in Western Europe, is a tiny creeping weed, which nobody would ever take for a forest tree by origin at all, unless he happened to see it in the catkin-bearing stage, when its true nature and history would become at once apparent to him.|$|E
50|$|Pioneer {{handicrafts}} {{were inspired}} by the many cultures that came together in Utah. Handicrafts were initially a necessity, and pioneers developed techniques to adapt their skills to the materials on hand. Later, the Relief Society promoted handicrafts as improving mental health. Along with quilting and needlework, pioneers also made hair flowers and silk thread. Towns in the Mormon regional area have a unique combination of features, including unpainted barns, irrigation ditches, wooden moveable hay derricks, and <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> as wind breaks. Tombstones in this area commonly depict clasped hands or a Mormon temple.|$|R
60|$|Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, {{situated}} on a sloping lawn. It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and {{like every other}} place of {{the same degree of}} importance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them altogether, interspersed with tall <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars,</b> shut out the offices.|$|R
60|$|Therford was one {{of those}} old places where the church is as near as {{possible}} to the manor house, standing on a little elevation above it, and with a long avenue of <b>Lombardy</b> <b>poplars</b> leading from the south porch, the family entrance, to {{the front door of the}} house, so this was that pretty thing, a walking, instead of a carriage, wedding. As one of the procession, I could not see, but the red and white must have made it very pretty, and the Northchester paper was quite poetical in its raptures.|$|R
