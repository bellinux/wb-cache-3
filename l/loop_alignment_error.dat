40|$|Reduced fetal {{movement}} {{is an important}} parameter to assess fetal distress. Currently, no suitable methods are available that can objectively assess fetal movement during pregnancy. Fetal vectorcardiographic (VCG) <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> could be such a method. In general, the goal of VCG <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> is to correct for motion-induced changes in the VCGs of (multiple) consecutive heartbeats. However, the parameters used for <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> also provide information to assess fetal movement. Unfortunately, current methods for VCG <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> are not robust against low-quality VCG signals. In this paper, a more robust method for VCG <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> is developed that includes a priori information on the <b>loop</b> <b>alignment,</b> yielding a maximum a posteriori <b>loop</b> <b>alignment.</b> Classification, based on movement parameters extracted from the alignment, is subsequently performed using support vector machines, resulting in correct classification of (absence of) fetal movement in about 75 % of cases. After additional validation and optimization, this method can possibly be employed for continuous fetal movement monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{analysis of}} electrocardiographic (ECG) signals {{is complicated by}} morphological variability in the ECG due to movement of the heart. By aligning vectorcardiographic loops, movement-induced ECG variations can be partly corrected for. Existing methods for <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> can account for loop rotation, scaling, and time delays, but they lack the possibility to include a priori information {{on any of these}} transformations, and they are unreliable in case of low-quality signals, such as fetal ECG signals. The inclusion of a priori information might aid in the robustness of <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> and is, hence, proposed in this paper. We provide a generic Bayesian framework to derive our <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> method. In this framework, existing methods can be readily derived as well, as a simplification of our method. The <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> is evaluated by comparing its performance in <b>loop</b> <b>alignment</b> to two existing methods, for both adult and fetal ECG recordings. For the adult ECG recordings, a quantitative performance assessment shows that the developed method outperforms the existing method in terms of robustness. For the fetal ECG recordings, it is demonstrated that the developed method can be used to correct ECG signals for movement-induced morphology changes (enabling diagnostics) and that the method is capable of classifying recorded ECG signals to periods of fetal movement or rest (...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{strategies}} and a prototype for large optical surfaces testing with subaperture stitching. The kinematics model with {{six degrees of}} freedom is built to determine the initial configuration of each subaperture, according to the records of nulling motion. <b>Alignment</b> <b>error</b> model based on wavefront aberrations is established for compensation and error separation. Subapertures are primarily stitched by homogeneous coordinate transformation, least square method and Zernike polynomial fitting. Then an error-separation matrix of stitching model is developed to analysis the characteristics and effects of <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> on test results. The expressions of the <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> for aspheric surface testing are built based on motion structure and wavefront aberrations theory. So the <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> can be separated and compensated efficiently. Subapertures are then simultaneously stitched by minimizing deviations among the overlapping region, as well as deviations from the nominal surface. As a result, precise prior knowledge of the nulling and alignment motion, which is of {{six degrees of freedom}}, is no longer required. Simulations and experiments are given to verify the validity and precision of the proposed algorithm. The result shows that the proposed method with alignment compensation is quite efficient.

40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> for each axis. Once <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the adjustment amount must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or calibrate the altitude and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star offset position to make the mount adjustment. The star offset position is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called “star offset positioning ” and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis <b>Alignment</b> <b>Error</b> [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> If the mount were designed with encoders on the altitude and azimuth adjustment axes, or if these were calibrated with an accurate visual scale, the adjustment to th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{studied for}} decades, {{effective}} face recognition remains difficult to accomplish {{on account of}} occlusions and pose and illumination variations. Pose variance is a particular challenge in face recognition. Effective local descriptors have been proposed for frontal face recognition. When these descriptors are directly applied to cross-pose face recognition, the performance significantly decreases. To improve the descriptor performance for cross-pose face recognition, we propose a face recognition algorithm based on multiple virtual views and <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> First, warps between poses are learned using the Lucas–Kanade algorithm. Based on these warps, multiple virtual profile views are generated from a single frontal face, which enables non-frontal faces to be matched using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. Furthermore, warps indicate the correspondence between patches of two faces. A two-phase <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> is proposed to obtain accurate warps, which contain pose alignment and individual alignment. Correlations between patches are considered to calculate the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> of two faces. Finally, a hybrid similarity between two faces is calculated; it combines the number of matched keypoints from SIFT and the <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better recognition accuracy than existing algorithms, even when the pose difference angle was greater than 30 °...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{currently}} {{no way to}} verify {{the quality of a}} multiple sequence alignment that is independent of the assumptions used to build it. Sequence alignments are typically evaluated by a number of established criteria: sequence conservation, the number of aligned residues, the frequency of gaps, and the probable correct gap placement. Covariation analysis is used to find putatively important residue pairs in a sequence alignment. Different alignments of the same protein family give different results demonstrating that covariation depends {{on the quality of the}} sequence alignment. We thus hypothesized that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses as systematic sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> are present even in hand-curated structure-based alignment datasets like those from the Conserved Domain Database. We show that current non-parametric covariation statistics are sensitive to sequence misalignments and that this sensitivity can be used to identify systematic <b>alignment</b> <b>errors.</b> We demonstrate that removing <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> due to 1) improper structure alignment, 2) the presence of paralogous sequences, and 3) partial or otherwise erroneous sequences, improves contact prediction by covariation analysis. Finally we describe two non-parametric covariation statistics that are less sensitive to sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> than those described previously in the literature. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Protein <b>alignments</b> with <b>errors</b> lead to false positive and false negative conclusions (incorrect assignment of covariation and conservation, respectively). Covariation analysis can provide a verification step, independent of traditional criteria, to identify systematic misalignments in protein alignments. Two non-parametric statistics are shown to be somewhat insensitive to misalignment errors, providing increased confidence in contact prediction when analyzing alignments with erroneous regions because of an emphasis on they emphasize pairwise covariation over group covariation...|$|R

Since a loop intermixes loads and stores, compiler often allocates an array to temporarily hold the result. Because these extra temporary arrays can cause performance problems in cache, many techniques {{have been developed to}} avoid their use or minimize their size.

The aim {{of the work is}} i) to build a deterministic expression of the positioning error, starting from independent measurements of linear and angular errors for each independent axis, and ii) to investigate the precision enhancement, which may eventually be achieved by implementing such deterministic error-prediction into the numerical control of the boring machine. The six components of the end-effector positioning error are expressed {{on the basis of a}} symbolic analysis of the kinematic linkages, which represents the machine layout.
