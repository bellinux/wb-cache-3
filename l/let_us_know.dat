25|$|In 464, Remismund, an {{ambassador}} who had travelled between Galicia and Gaul on several occasions, became King. Remismund {{was able to}} unite the factions of Suevi under his rule, {{and at the same}} time restore peace. He was also recognized, perhaps even approved of, by Theodoric, who sent him gifts and weapons along with a wife. Under the leadership of Remismund, the Suevi would again raid the nearby countries, plundering the lands of Lusitania and the Conventus Asturicense, whilst still fighting Galician tribes like the Aunonenses, who refused to submit to Remismund. In 468 they managed to destroy part of the walls of Conimbriga, in Lusitania, which was sacked and then mostly abandoned after the inhabitants fled or were taken back to the north as slaves. Next year they even managed to capture Lisbon, which was surrendered by its leader, Lusidio. He later became ambassador of the Suevi to the Emperor. The end of the chronicle of Hydatius in 468 doesn't <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> the later fate of Remismund.|$|E

She picketed with signs outside of the organization's Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida. Scientology representatives in Clearwater complained to police in November 2000 about the picketing, and Christman and Minton were fined US$100. On February 21, 2001, Judge Thomas E.

[...] This experience was a defining period for Christman, as she was concerned that her former church would attempt to characterize her as a criminal.

500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> that it was him.

[...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly felt the video was [...] "very fitting" [...] for the song's vibe, and felt it presented [...] "a distinct level of Mimi fabulosity." [...] A reporter from the Daily Mail called the visuals [...] "sizzling", and complimented the singers moments on the golden stage as [...] "glittering" [...] and [...] "fabulous". The Hollywood Reporters David Lipshutz described the video as a [...] "glitzy clip". Additionally, he outed its final segment of [...] "Carey singing while confetti rain down" [...] as the video's highlight. While noting the video's [...] "classic Mimi fashions", MTV's Jocelyn Vena expressed how Carey's ringside singing during the finale truly tied in with the song's message of [...] "overcoming adversity". Marc Hogan of Spin noted it as [...] "expensive-looking and cinematic", while a writer from CNN described the singer as [...] "glamorous as ever." ...|$|E

AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song as a [...] "top pick" [...] from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, while Amos Barshad of The New York Times listed it as the fifth top song of the summer. In contrast, [...] "Obsessed" [...] received a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times writer, Todd Martens, who wrote that although [...] "its feistier Mimi than 're used to", she ultimately [...] "has been molded to fit current trends" [...] and that the single [...] "again sells out the songbird to her producers."

500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E
