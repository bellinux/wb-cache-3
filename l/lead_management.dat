Owners usually react to this situation by offering a deal fee to the management team if a certain price threshold is reached. Financial sponsors usually react to this again by offering to compensate the management team for a lost deal fee if the purchase price is low. Another mechanisms to handle this problem are earn-outs (purchase price being contingent on reaching certain future profitabilities).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis is to explore a satisfying <b>lead</b> time <b>management</b> for companies that implement a Make-to-Order production system in a global supply chain network. A huge lead time waste caused by early arrival of parts dominates total inventory losses and accounts for 54 % in entire process according to some statistical data. In the present thesis, a new theory named the Key-Part Based <b>Lead</b> Time <b>Management</b> (KPBLTM) was proposed to reduce non-value added waste. The contents of this thesis consist by constructing objective functions, proposing a practical methodology, comparing the satisfying solution with the optimal solution, proving the sufficient conditions of existence of the key part, demonstrating the robustness of the key part, applying to analyze the other production patterns, and building {{a connection between the}} Key-Part Based <b>Lead</b> Time <b>Management</b> and MRP system. A managerial solution derived from the Key-Part Based <b>Lead</b> Time <b>Management</b> is depicted as: once receiving orders from customers, Make-to-Order companies schedule the arrival of the purchased parts based on the lead time of the key part. Finally, the total inventory loss including the holding costs and the customer penalty will be dramatically reduced...|$|R
