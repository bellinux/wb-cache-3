5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical <b>law</b> <b>from</b> the concept of duty.

The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E
