5|$|Bowman then {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Bowman argued that the Monsanto <b>license</b> <b>agreement</b> allowed the sale of second-generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused the patent rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc. Monsanto argued that the <b>license</b> <b>agreement</b> specifically prohibited the use of second-generation seeds for planting. The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court's decision in favor of Monsanto.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{technologies}} became more complex which increased {{the degree of}} uncertainty in R&D. To overcome the uncertainty, firms frequently engage in R&D collaborations, e. g., Research Joint Ventures (RJVs), and <b>licensing</b> <b>agreements.</b> While RJVs are well explored in the literature, very {{little is known about}} the use of <b>licensing</b> <b>agreements.</b> Building on a novel database which includes <b>licensing</b> <b>agreements</b> in the semiconductor industry between 1989 and 1999, we estimate a bivariate probit model with self-selection. Our estimation results highlight the fact that firms' relatedness in technology and product markets determine their choices to engage in ex ante and ex post <b>licensing</b> <b>agreements.</b> Our study provides evidence that the decision to engage in ex ante and ex post licensing is formulated with regard to uncertainty in R&D. While ex ante <b>licensing</b> <b>agreements</b> serve as a useful mechanism to insure against uncertainty in R&D, ex post <b>licensing</b> <b>agreements</b> rather serve as an instrument to resolve uncertainty in R&D. Hence, <b>licensing</b> <b>agreements</b> are appropriate instruments to lessen R&D uncertainty...|$|R

5|$|A case {{in which}} {{developer}} control was asserted involved Blizzard Entertainment's action against Tristan Pope's Not Just Another Love Story. Blizzard's community managers encouraged users to post game movies and screenshots, but viewers complained that Pope's suggestion of sexual actions through creative camera and character positioning was pornographic. Citing the user <b>license</b> <b>agreement,</b> Blizzard closed discussion threads about the film and prohibited links to it. Although Pope accepted Blizzard's right to some control, he remained concerned about censorship of material that already existed in-game in some form. Discussion ensued about boundaries between MMORPG player and developer control. Lowood asserted that this controversy demonstrated that machinima could be a medium of negotiation for players.|$|E
5|$|As {{a highly}} popular video game series {{with a large}} and active fan base, the Halo trilogy {{has given rise to}} an array of video {{productions}} in an emerging entertainment medium, machinima. Virtually all machinima footage based around the Halo games is taken from the multiplayer modes of the main trilogy games. Most productions are set outside Halo canon, while others are based on fan fiction closely relating to the official story. Halo 3 includes a saved film function that allows camera angles not possible in previous games, and other features that simplify production. The game {{has become one of the}} most popular tools for generating machinima, and Microsoft updated its user <b>license</b> <b>agreement</b> to allow noncommercial distribution of such films.|$|E

5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a <b>license</b> <b>agreement</b> promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 2010, at a press-only Korean event, Blizzard {{announced}} that Korean players {{would be able}} to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription. In PC bangs, or other cybercafés, players can play the game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won (approx. $.50 to $1.50) per hour. Other options include a 30-day subscription for ₩9900 (approx. $8), a 24 hours play-time ticket for ₩2000 (approx. $1.50), and unlimited access for ₩69,000 (approx. $56). The end-user <b>license</b> <b>agreement</b> (EULA) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants the buyer a license to play, while the game itself remains the property of Blizzard. Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well, giving Blizzard greater control over how the game is used. Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge over how the altered EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by Blizzard.|$|E
