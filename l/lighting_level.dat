50|$|In stage lighting, a fade is {{a gradual}} {{increase}} or decrease of the intensity of light projected onto the stage. The term fade-in refers to gradually changing the <b>lighting</b> <b>level</b> from complete darkness to a predetermined <b>lighting</b> <b>level.</b> A fade-out (also known as fade-to-black) refers to gradually decreasing the intensity of light until none is shining on the stage. A crossfade is when lighting levels are gradually altered from one setting to another. A fade-in is sometimes called a build, and where this terminology is used, a fade is understood to be a fade-out.|$|E
50|$|Daylight {{harvesting}} {{systems are}} typically designed {{to maintain a}} minimum recommended <b>light</b> <b>level.</b> This <b>light</b> <b>level</b> will {{vary according to the}} needs and use of the space; for example, the commonly recommended <b>light</b> <b>level</b> for offices is 500 Lux (or around 50 footcandles) on the desktop.|$|R

40|$|In the 1987 Georgia Institutional Conservation Program ICP), {{recommendations}} for installation of reflectors in fluorescent fixtures accompanied by delamping totaled $ 5. 4 million. Concerned with that {{effects of these}} recommendations on <b>light</b> <b>levels,</b> the Governor's Office to Energy Resources asked the Georgia Tech Research Institute to quantify the change in <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> This paper summarizes the study and its findings, and suggests what conditions favor the use of reflectors. The study found that installing specular reflectors in fluorescent fixtures accompanied by 50 percent delamping resulted in reduced <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> of 60 to 80 percent of design <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> The continuous row fixtures in the study showed the greatest variation in <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> raging from 52 percent between rows to 80 percent under rows {{for an average of}} nearly 70 percent. <b>Light</b> <b>levels</b> in rooms with fixtures on an even grid spacing ranged from 73 percent between fixtures to 86 percent under fixtures for room averages of 75 to 80 percent. Reflectors in rooms with higher ceilings gave more uniform light distributions but resulted in slightly lower average <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> The study concluded that fluorescent fixture reflectors accompanied by delamping is a viable means to reduce lighting energy consumption if a reduction in design <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> is acceptable...|$|R

40|$|A {{study is}} {{reported}} of human binocular rivalry and fusion over {{a range of}} luminances from scotopic to photopic. At scotopic <b>light</b> <b>levels,</b> rivalry alternations were very slow and complete. Suppression spread over much larger areas of the visual field than at photopic <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> As luminances decreased from photopic to scoptopic levels there was a rod-cone break for binocular rivalry. Mean suppression durations became abruptly greater as <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> dropped below those allowing the cones to be active. Horizontal disparities allowing fusion were 4 to 6 times greater at scotopic than at photopic <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> Binocular vision at scotopic luminances was sluggish and of low resolution. It is as though connections to, and within, binocular vision are changed when <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> allow only rod input...|$|R

5000|$|Proper cockpit {{lighting}} is paramount in reducing fatigue since it inhibits {{the production of}} melatonin.

To have a different <b>light</b> <b>level</b> in a particular area, for example, a new sector must be created for that area with a different <b>light</b> <b>level.</b> One-sided linedefs therefore represent solid walls, while two-sided linedefs represent bridge lines between sectors.|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} the character level cap, character progression shifts to improving their [...] "Light" [...] level by acquiring {{new and better}} equipment. This equipment can be gained {{through a variety of}} sources, including [...] "strikes", raids, and in-game events. Prior to The Taken King, all legendary and exotic armor, and some rare, contained an attribute called Light. Once players reached level 20, they no longer earned experience to level up; EXP earned after level 20 went towards upgrading weapons and armor, and creating Motes of Light, an in-game currency. Players could only go beyond level 20 by obtaining armor with <b>Light,</b> and these <b>levels</b> were referred to as <b>Light</b> <b>levels.</b> The initial <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> cap was 30, which increased to 32 with The Dark Below and 34 with the House of Wolves. Update patch 2.0, released in preparation for The Taken King, made the character's experience <b>level</b> and <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> separate: level 34 is now the experience level cap for all players; level 40 for players who own The Taken King and Rise of Iron. A higher character level allows for better equipment to be equipped. A character's <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> is now an average of the attack and defense of all equipped gear. For example, if all equipped gear has 170 Light each, the character's <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> will be 170. A higher <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> improves damage output and defense. The highest obtainable <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> was 320 for players who owned The Taken King; the expansion's [...] increased it to 335. Rise of Iron increased the highest obtainable <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> to 400.|$|R
40|$|This report used 11 {{years of}} data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS 1987 - 1997) to {{investigate}} the sensitivity to <b>light</b> <b>level</b> in three crash scenarios in which various forms of adaptive headlighting might have safety benefits. The scenarios included fatal pedestrian crashes at intersections, on dark roads, and single-vehicle run-off-road crashes on dark, curved roads. Each scenario’s sensitivity to <b>light</b> <b>level</b> was evaluated in two ways. In the first method, the seasonal pattern of crashes throughout the year was compared to the seasonal pattern of <b>light</b> <b>level</b> in three daily time periods (twilight, daylight, and nighttime), applying the same twilightzone logic as Owens and Sivak (1993). Both of the fatal crash scenarios that involve pedestrians tracked the seasonal fluctuation in <b>light</b> <b>level</b> during this period, showing a decline in crashes during the twilight periods {{in the spring and}} summer, and an increase in crashes during the fall and winter. The daylight and nighttime control periods, in which <b>light</b> <b>level</b> is fixed, showed no similar trend. In contrast, the single-vehicle run-off-road scenario failed to show any influence of <b>light</b> <b>level,</b> and seems to be significantly associated with alcohol use. In the second method, the number of fatal crashes was compared across the changes to and from daylight savings time, within time periods in which an abrupt change in <b>light</b> <b>level</b> occurs relative to official clock time. Once again, scenarios involving pedestrians were most sensitive to <b>light</b> <b>level,</b> while single-vehicle run-off-road crashes showed little effect of <b>light</b> <b>level.</b> The results suggest that adaptive lighting may produce the greatest measurable safety benefit when it addresses the problem of pedestrian vulnerability in darkness...|$|R

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [41076049, 41276077]Combined {{effects of}} {{intertidal}} elevation and <b>light</b> <b>level</b> on two-month-old seedlings of Avicennia marina were studied at Zengying, Xiamen of China. Leaf number, {{area and thickness}} were promoted by decreasing elevation or elevating <b>light</b> <b>level.</b> Stem height differed little between <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> but was significantly stimulated by moderate waterlogging. Expansion of stem basal diameter was promoted by high <b>light</b> <b>level</b> but not affected by elevation. Total biomass showed highest at the middle elevation and was promoted by high <b>light</b> <b>level.</b> Seedlings in the gaps generally had higher root weight ratio (RWR) and stem weight ratio (SWR) but lower leaf weight ratio (LWR) than those under the canopy. Leaf pigment contents in the gaps were significantly stimulated by low elevations, while a reverse tendency occurred under the canopy. Both roots and leaves increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities to defend prolonged waterlogging. High <b>light</b> <b>level</b> resulted in high SOD and POD activities in roots but not in leaves. Malonaldehyde (MDA) contents changed little between <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> but were significantly promoted by prolonged waterlogging. These growth and physiological responses suggested that A. marina seedlings had strong tolerance to prolonged waterlogging but not to canopy shade. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examined whether {{provision of}} information on the environmental impact of street lighting affects the acceptability and perceived social safety of reduced street <b>lighting</b> <b>levels.</b> We argued that such information should particularly affect acceptability and safety judgements of individuals who value these environmental benefits, that is, those with strong biospheric values. Participants viewed virtual representations of a residential street where street <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> were varied. As expected, low <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> were seen as more acceptable, while high <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> were seen as less acceptable when information on the environmental impact of street lighting was provided to individuals that strongly endorsed biospheric values. Support for the expectation that these increases in acceptability of lower <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> would trigger a process of rationalisation leading individuals with strong biospheric values to downplay consequences opposing value-driven views was mixed. Stronger effects were found when participants could compare different <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> directly. The study suggests that value-congruent information on the environmental benefits of reduced street lighting can increase acceptability of reduced street lighting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Stomatal conductances of {{normally}} oriented and inverted {{leaves were}} measured as <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> (photosynthetic photon flux densities) were increased {{to determine whether}} abaxial stomata of Vicia faba leaves were more sensitive to light than adaxial stomata. <b>Light</b> <b>levels</b> were increased over uniform populations of leaves of plants grown in an environmental chamber. Adaxial stomata of inverted leaves reached maximum water vapor conductances at a <b>light</b> <b>level</b> of 60 micromoles per square meter per second, the same <b>light</b> <b>level</b> at which abaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves reached maximum conductances. Abaxial stomata of inverted leaves reached maximum conductances at a <b>light</b> <b>level</b> of 500 micromoles per square meter per second, the same <b>light</b> <b>level</b> at which adaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves reached maximum conductances. Maximum conductances in both normally oriented and inverted leaves were about 200 millimoles per square meter per second for adaxial stomata and 330 millimoles per square meter per second for abaxial stomata. Regardless of whether leaves were normally oriented or inverted, when <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> were increased to values high enough that upper leaf surfaces reached maximum conductances (about 500 micromoles per square meter per second), <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> incident on lower, shaded leaf surfaces were just sufficient (about 60 micromoles per square meter per second) for stomata of those surfaces to reach maximum conductances. This `coordinated' stomatal opening on the separate epidermes resulted in total leaf conductances for normally oriented and inverted leaves that were the same at any given <b>light</b> <b>level.</b> We conclude that stomata in abaxial epidermes of intact Vicia leaves are not more sensitive to light than those in adaxial epidermes, and that stomata in leaves of this plant {{do not respond to}} light alone. Additional factors in bulk leaf tissue probably produce coordinated stomatal opening on upper and lower leaf epidermes to optimally meet photosynthetic requirements of the whole leaf for CO 2...|$|R
