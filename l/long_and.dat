5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb <b>long</b> <b>and</b> has 37 genes.

Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb <b>long</b> <b>and</b> has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E
