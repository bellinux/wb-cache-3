40|$|In Switzerland, <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> hold an {{important}} position, {{which is a}} particularity of the Swiss judicial system. <b>Law</b> <b>clerks</b> have {{a wide range of}} tasks. For instance, they are involved in the instruction of the cases, {{as well as in the}} decision-making process. The number of <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> is continuously increasing, which is namely due to the growing caseload. Nowadays, at many courts in Switzerland there are more <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> than judges. The result of this development is that judges have a different role than in the past. Despite the crucial role of <b>law</b> <b>clerks,</b> science has paid little attention to their function. This article aims to describe the important role of <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> from a legal point of view. It also enumerates concerns connected to the position of <b>law</b> <b>clerks.</b> Methodologically, the paper is based on a document analysis and on the results of a quantitative survey. Specifically, the article will discuss the following question: Is the Swiss legal system – where <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> are key-players – a reasonable solution in order to cope with the increasing caseload in an efficient way? The paper is divided into six parts: 1. Introduction 2. The Swiss judicial system 3. Definition and function of <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> 4. Development and legal issues 5.

There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife and children to the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.|$|E

After two months, Barkley accepted an offer to clerk for Judge William Sutton Bishop and former congressman John Kerr Hendrick, who paid him $15 per month.

5|$|Following {{news of his}} father's {{premature}} death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and he withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal over a year, living {{at the home of}} his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a <b>law</b> <b>clerk</b> in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fiancée's family opposed her involvement with a Métis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant, and by early 1866 he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends said later that he worked odd jobs in Chicago, Illinois, while staying with poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine; also that he was then for a time employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River Settlement on 26 July 1868.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black <b>law</b> <b>clerk,</b> an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E
