40|$|In 1990, Congress enacted an {{amendment}} to the Clean Air Act that required reductions in NOx emissions through the application of <b>low</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>burner</b> systems on fossil fueled utility steam generators. For most of the existing steam generator population, the original burning equipment incorporated highly turbulent burners that created significant in-furnace flame interaction. Thus, the measurement and control of air flow to the individual burners was much less critical than in recent years with <b>low</b> <b>NOx</b> combustion systems. With <b>low</b> <b>NOx</b> sys-tems, the reduction of NOx emissions, as well as minimizing flyash unburned carbon levels, is very much dependent on the ability to control the relative ratios of air and fuel on a per-burner basis and their rate of mixing, particularly in the near burner zones. AMC Power (AMC) and DB Riley, Inc. (DBR), and a large Midwestern electric utility have successfully developed and applied AMC’s equipment to <b>low</b> <b>NOx</b> coal <b>burners</b> in order to enhance NOx control combustion systems. The results have improved burner optimization and provided real time continuous air flow balancing capability and the control of individual burner stoichiometries.

50|$|When {{fossil fuels}} are burned, Nitric oxide and Nitrogen dioxide are produced. These {{pollutants}} initiate reactions which result in production of ozone and acid rain.

Currently large deviations in PF and air flow distribution exist throughout coal fired plant due to pneumatic transport and distribution drawbacks. In the design of PF distribution systems empirical correlations are applied. These {{can also be used to}} investigate pneumatic conveying problems causing mal-distribution. PF settling was identified as a primary contributor to mal-distribution. Three different methods of determining the settling velocity were investigated. A sensitivity analysis was done and the applicability of different correlations on PF was evaluated. The Rizk (1976) correlation was found to be most applicable to PF, due to its stability across a wide particle size range. Settling velocities of current plant design were compared to recommended settling velocities predicted with the Rizk correlation. It was found that most of the current plant operates below the recommended minimum. A full scale, dense poly- and mono-dispersed multi-phase flow CFD analyses in conjunction with plant measurements was also carried out. The industrial geometry was fitted with various instruments to evaluate the flow properties for comparison with the CFD results. Dense multi-phase flow CFD modelling was found to be a helpful tool in analysing the flow behaviour of complex multi-phase mixtures such as PF and air. The CFD results showed similar mass flow and pressure fluctuations at the distribution box outlets as what was measured on site.

40|$|The team of TIAX LLC, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, and Callidus Technologies, LLC {{conducted}} a six-year program {{to develop an}} ultra-low emission process heater burner and an advanced high efficiency heater design. This project addresses the critical need of process heater operators for reliable, economical emission reduction technologies to comply with stringent emission regulations, and for heater design alternatives that reduce process heater energy requirements without significant cost increase. The key project targets were NOx emissions of 10 ppm (@ 3 % O 2), and a heater thermal efficiency of 95 percent. The ultra <b>low</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>burner</b> was developed {{through a series of}} pilot-scale and field tests combined with computational fluid dynamic modeling to arrive at simultaneous low emissions and suitable flame shape and stability. Pilot scale tests were run at TIAX, at the 2 MMBtu/hr scale, and at Callidus at 8 MMBtu/hr. The full scale burner was installed on a 14 burner atmospheric pipestill furnace at an ExxonMobil refinery. A variety of burner configurations, gas tips and flame stabilizers were tested to determine the lowest emissions with acceptable flame shape and stability. The resulting NOx emissions were 22 ppm on average. Starting in 2001, Callidus commercialized the original ultra <b>low</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>burner</b> and made subsequent design improvements in a series of commercial burners evolving from the original concept and/or development. Emissions in the field with the ultra low-NOx burner over a broad spectrum of heater applications have varied from 5 ppm to 30 ppm depending on heater geometry, heater service, fuel and firing capacity. To date, 1550 of the original burners, and 2500 of subsequent generation burners have been sold by Callidus. The advanced heater design was developed by parametric evaluations of a variety of furnace and combustion air preheater configurations and technologies for enhancing convective and radiative heat transfer.

The project involved combining Gas Reburning with <b>Low</b> <b>NOX</b> <b>Burners</b> (GR-LNB) on a coal-fired electric utility boiler to determine if high levels of NO, reduction (70 VO) could be achieved. Sponsors of the project included the U. S. Depatiment of Energy, the Gas Research Institute, Public Service Company of Colorado, Colorado Interstate Gas, Electric Power Research Institute, and the Energy and Environmental Research Corporation. The GR-LNB demonstration was petformed on Public Service Company of Colorado's (PSCO) Cherokee Unit # 3, located in Denver, Colorado. This unit is a 172 MW~ wall-fired boiler that uses Colorado bituminous, low-sulfur coal. It had a baseline NO, emission level of 0. 73 lb/ 1 OG Btu using conventional burners. <b>Low</b> <b>NOX</b> <b>burners</b> are designed to yield lower NOX emissions than conventional burners. However, the NOX control achieved with this technique is limited to 30 - 50 Y 0. Also, with LNBs, CO emissions can increase to above acceptable standards. Gas Reburning (GR) is designed to reduce NO, in the flue gas by staged fuel combustion. This technology involves the introduction of' natural gas into the hot furnace flue gas stream. When combined, GR and LNBs minimize NOX emissions and maintain acceptable levels of CO emissions. A comprehensive test program was completed, operating over a wide range of boiler conditions. Over 4, 000 hours of operation were achieved, providing substantial data. Measurements were taken to quantify reductions in NOX emissions, the impact on boiler equipment and operability and factors influencing costs.

40|$|This paper reports part of {{the results}} of the campaigns {{performed}} on a <b>low</b> <b>NO(x)</b> <b>burner,</b> firing natural gas in oxy-fuel conditions. The results of combustion tests on burning natural gas with different flue gas recycle rates are presented, with a particular emphasis on NO(x) production that might affect retrofitting of oxy-fuel technology in conventional boilers. The process and flame characterisation performed on natural gas provides a valuable set of experimental data for the technological development of oxy-combustion burner technology with recycled flue gas, especially in retrofitting scenarios. The data can be used to develop a better understanding of the chemical and physical phenomena involved in oxy-fuel combustion and can provide modellers with a valuable hint for the development of specific sub-models for oxy-combustion simulation. Since is seems technologically unfeasible to reduce down to zero the presence of nitrogen in recycled flue gases, due to air in-leakages, the presence of relatively small amounts of nitrogen in crucial location in the burner provides a thermal NO(x) source, depending on local levels of temperature and oxygen concentration.
