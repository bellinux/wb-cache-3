5|$|A {{compulsory}} {{and free}} {{primary and secondary}} public education for every Virginia child {{is the focus of}} Article VIII. The General Assembly is empowered to determine the funding for the educational system and apportion the cost between state and local government. A state Board of Education is established to create school divisions and effectuate the overall educational policies. Supervision of the individual schools is delegated to <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards,</b> provided for in §7.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{there was a}} school for poor children, which moved in a {{four-year}} cycle between Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys, Bryncroes and Y Rhiw. The Elementary Education Act 1870 provided for <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards,</b> but was opposed by the established church. The process of establishing boards was lengthy, and the government had to enforce the regulations in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw; the national school opened at Y Rhiw in 1877 and had 74 pupils on its register; it closed in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Industrialisation, {{urbanisation}} and the Disruption of 1843 all {{undermined the}} tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards.</b> The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing {{the educational needs of}} youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class. The University of St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|McCreary {{was not as}} {{successful}} in securing reforms during the 1914 legislative session. He advocated a comprehensive workmen's compensation law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures, {{but the majority of}} legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, from whence it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying at the capitol – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed responsiveness to McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, school attendance for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> in adopting textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} 19th century, {{schooling}} in England {{was provided}} either on a fee-paying basis or by the Church. To ensure that all children had access to elementary education, the Forster Act 1870 set up <b>Local</b> <b>School</b> <b>Boards</b> to provide elementary schools for all children aged 5 to 10. From 1880, schooling became compulsory for that age group. The Education Act 1902 consolidated these boards into local education authorities and allowed them to subsidise schools with money raised from local rate-payers. Alongside a grammar school for boys, a private school for girls and a mixed National School, Sleaford had four elementary schools in 1905: two Wesleyan (one was for infants), one Catholic and one other infants school. The construction of the Bass maltings (1901–06) and the Rauceby Asylum (1897–1902) led {{to an increase in}} the town's population and school inspectors found that the four schools could not accommodate every child in the town. The indebted Wesleyan schools could not afford any enlargements so the town's elementary school managers opted for Kesteven County Council to take responsibility under the 1902 Act. The Council built a schoolhouse on Church Lane at the cost of £11,500, which opened as Sleaford Council School on 4 May 1908. The staff and pupils at the Wesleyan schools were transferred there; its first headmaster was H. H. Godfrey, who had been master at the Wesleyan school. Built with a capacity of 600 pupils, 280 were on roll when teaching commenced.|$|E

25|$|Soon after this, Congress {{passed the}} {{landmark}} Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975; this completed a 15-year period of federal policy reform {{with regard to}} American Indian tribes. The legislation authorized processes by which tribes could negotiate contracts with the BIA to manage directly more of their education and social service programs. In addition, it provided direct grants to help tribes develop plans for assuming such responsibility. It also provided for Indian parents' participation on <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|E
25|$|The AFT {{was one of}} {{the first}} trade unions to allow African-Americans and {{minorities}} to become full members of their trade union. In 1918, the AFT called for equal pay for African-American teachers, the election of African Americans to <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> and compulsory school attendance for African-American children. In 1919, the AFT called for equal educational opportunities for African-American children, and in 1928 called for the social, political, economic, and cultural contributions of African Americans to be taught in the public schools.|$|E

25|$|Except for {{the eastern}} panhandle the Kanawha Valley had {{the highest number of}} black residents. When the Bureau visited the area in 1867 it {{discovered}} five schools already established by black citizens, several of them by the Rev. Lewis Rice. The Bureau found the quality of teaching to be good but the physical structures very poor. <b>Local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> refused or sometimes delayed appropriating funds for new buildings. In Brook's Hollow the Bureau provided $300 and black residents $323 for a new schoolhouse.|$|E
25|$|Virginia built {{many schools}} after World War I and again after World War II, but such barely {{kept up with}} {{population}} growth. Virginia had among the lowest tax rates in the nation, so <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> often scrimped on school construction. Before $45 million in appropriations during the administration of Governor John S. Battle, per pupil expenditures and teacher salaries both remained below national averages, and the state ranked last nationally in percentage of high school age children actually attending high school, and next-to-last in college age children going to college.|$|E
25|$|During the 2007 provincial election, education, and {{specifically}} {{the funding of}} religious schools, was a central issue. GPO policy calls {{for an end to}} the publicly funded Catholic school system, a merger that it claimed would save millions of dollars in duplicate administrative costs. Other items include giving <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> a say in funding allocation, ending standardized testing of students, and encouraging programmes such as physical education, environmental education, and a mandatory course in world religions. At the post-secondary level, the GPO proposes a tuition cap of $3 000 per year for university studies and $700 per year for college and increased funding for apprenticeship programmes.|$|E

25|$|In March 2013, Governor Steve Beshear {{signed a}} bill into law that {{ultimately}} led to the mandatory school age for the entire state rising to 18 from its then-current 16. Under the new law, <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> {{had the power to}} decide whether to increase their dropout age. If more than 55% of the state's districts (96 out of 174 {{at the time of the}} bill's passage) did so, the change would become mandatory statewide within four years of the threshold being met. By mid-July 2013, the required number of districts had raised their dropout ages, meaning that all districts had to do the same no later than 2017–18.|$|E
25|$|His {{position}} on public schools was also added to article 8 of the constitution. The state's literacy rate had dropped from 90% in 1840, to 80% in 1850, and having {{served on the}} board of Indiana College between 1841 and 1868, he became aware of the poor condition of public education in the state. His proposals guaranteed equal opportunity for women in public education, something unknown in most of the nation. He also strengthened the free common school cause by requiring the state to fund the public school system, while allowing <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> to maintain control of their districts' curriculum, hiring, and school arrangements.|$|E
25|$|ID {{originated}} as a re-branding {{of creation}} science {{in an attempt}} to avoid a series of court decisions ruling out the teaching of creationism in American public schools, and the Discovery Institute has run a series of campaigns to change school curricula. In Australia, where curricula are under the control of state governments rather than <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards,</b> there was a public outcry when the notion of ID being taught in science classes was raised by the Federal Education Minister Brendan Nelson; the minister quickly conceded that the correct forum for ID, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.|$|E

25|$|Bloomberg's first mayoralty {{coincided with}} a major shift of {{authority}} over the city's public school system from the state government to the city government in 2002. From 1968 until 2000, New York City's schools were managed by the Board of Education, which had seven members. Only two of the seven were appointed by the mayor, which meant the City had a minority of representatives {{on the board and}} the mayor's ability to shape education policy was greatly diminished. In addition to the Board, 25 <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> also played a part in running the system. In 2000, the local boards and Board of Education were abolished and replaced with a new mayoral agency, the Department of Education.|$|E
25|$|The {{amendments}} {{allowed for}} a less arduous method of certification for religious teachers {{in which they would}} still have to complete examinations but would not have to attend Normal School classes. The determination of textbook content would be made in consultation with the churches, with passages offensive to the church excised. Church-owned school buildings would be permitted to be used, pending the decision by local school trustees to lease them from the church, and religious instruction could occur in such buildings if the regular school day was not shortened for the purpose. The effect of the arrangements regarding church buildings and religious schooling was to limit Catholic education to urban centres and to move further argument back down {{to the level of the}} <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Elementary Education Act 1870, {{commonly}} known as Forster's Education Act, set the framework for schooling of all {{children between the ages}} of 5 and 13 in England and Wales and established <b>local</b> <b>School</b> <b>Boards.</b> The main function of these bodies was to use local rates (taxes) to finance the building of schools in cases where the range of existing establishments was inadequate. A driving force behind the Act was a perceived need for Britain to remain competitive in the world by being at the forefront of manufacture and improvement. The only existing formal education until this time had been in Church schools and some ragged schools for the poor. Between 1870 and 1880, 3,0004,000 schools were started or taken over by school boards.|$|E
