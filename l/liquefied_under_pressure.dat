5000|$|However a few gases are vapors {{that can}} be {{liquefied}} at ambient temperature under pressure alone, so {{they can also be}} supplied as a liquid in an appropriate container. This phase change also makes these gases useful as ambient refrigerants and the most significant industrial gases with this property are ammonia (R717), propane (R290), butane (R600), and sulfur dioxide (R764). Chlorine also has this property but is too toxic, corrosive and reactive to ever have been used as a refrigerant. Some other gases exhibit this phase change if the ambient temperature is low enough; this includes ethylene (R1150), carbon dioxide (R744), ethane (R170), nitrous oxide (R744A), and sulfur hexafluoride; however, these can only be <b>liquefied</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> if kept below their critical temperatures which are 9 °C for C2H4 31 °C for CO2 32 °C for C2H6 36 °C for N2O 45 °C for SF6.|$|E
30|$|There {{are three}} {{well-known}} methods {{to extract the}} oil from algae: (1) mechanical expeller/press, (2) solvent extraction with hexane, and (3) supercritical fluid extraction. A simple process {{is to use a}} press to extract a large percentage (70 – 75 %) of the oils out of algae. However, this method requires large volumes of samples. Algal oil can be extracted using chemicals. The most popular chemical for solvent extraction is hexane, which is relatively inexpensive. To be successful, any extracting solvent must be able to (1) penetrate through the matrix enclosing the lipid material, (2) physically contact the lipid material, and (3) solvate the lipid. As such the development of any extraction process must also account {{for the fact that the}} tissue structure and cell walls may present formidable barriers to solvent access. This generally requires that the native structure of the biomass must be disrupted prior to extraction [169]. Supercritical fluid extraction is far more efficient than traditional solvent separation methods. Supercritical fluids are selective, thus providing the high purity and product concentrations. This can extract almost 100 % of the oils all by itself. In the supercritical fluid carbon dioxide (CO 2) extraction, CO 2 is <b>liquefied</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> and heated to the point that it has the properties of both a liquid and gas. This liquefied fluid then acts as the solvent in extracting the oil [170].|$|E

50|$|The main theme {{revolves}} around hard science, particularly the physics and thermodynamics of mixtures. While water {{should be in}} the form of ice at all times on Dhrawn, the effect of ammonia in the atmosphere is to cause it to become a liquid under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, because of the formation of a eutectic mixture which melts and freezes at a much lower temperature than water. Although the scientists on the satellite attempt to supply weather forecasts for the Mesklinites, they are using tools designed for Earth's weather to predict conditions in a two-component water/ammonia system instead of Earth's one-component system. Even local effects, such as liberation of latent heat from mixtures undergoing freezing or condensation, can produce drastic changes in conditions. Seemingly solid surfaces can <b>liquefy</b> <b>under</b> the <b>pressure</b> of the land cruisers, even as individual Mesklinites can walk on them in complete safety.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{response}} of a sandy seabed under wave loading is investigated {{on the basis}} of numerical modeling using a multi-scale approach. To that aim, the discrete element method is coupled to a finite volume method specially enhanced to describe compressible fluid flow. Both solid and fluid phase mechanics are upscaled from considerations established at the pore level. Model’s predictions are validated against poroelasticity theory and discussed in comparison with experiments where a sediment analog is subjected to wave action in a flume. Special emphasis is put on the mechanisms leading the seabed to <b>liquefy</b> <b>under</b> wave-induced <b>pressure</b> variation on its surface. Liquefaction is observed in both dilative and compactive regimes. It is shown that the instability can be triggered for a well-identified range of hydraulic conditions. Particularly, the results confirm that the gas content, together with the permeability of the medium are key parameters affecting the transmission of pressure inside the soil...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{exposure}} of tanks {{used for the}} storage and transportation of <b>liquefied</b> gases <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> may cause complex heat- and mass-transfer phenomena that may contribute to compromise {{the integrity of the}} vessels in accident scenarios. Heat transfer through vessel lading results in the heat-up of the internal fluid and the increase of vessel internal pressure. However, local temperature gradients in the liquid phase cause liquid stratification phenomena that result in a more rapid vaporization and pressure build-up in the liquid phase. These fundamental phenomena were analyzed by a computational fluid dynamic model. The model was specifically focused on the early steps of vessel heat-up, when liquid stratification plays a relevant role in determining the vessel internal pressure. A two-dimensional transient simulation was set up using ANSYS FLUENT in order to predict the evolution of the liquid and vapor phases during the tank heat up. The model was validated against large scale experimental data available for liquefied petroleum gas vessels exposed to hydrocarbon fires, and was applied to case studies derived from recent accidental events in order to assess the expected time of pressure build-up in different fire scenarios...|$|R

Alkanes {{with more than}} 16 carbon atoms can be refined into fuel oil and lubricating oil. At the heavier end of the range, paraffin wax is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while asphalt has 35 and up, although these are usually cracked by modern refineries into more valuable products.

40|$|Within {{the work}} {{packages}} I+II {{of the development}} of a big inland going sea ship, the preliminary design for a container vessel / general cargo ship and for a liquefied-gas carrier was worked out. With a draught of 3, 5 m respectively 3, 0 m both units have higher dead-weight than existing Rhine - sea - ships. The container vessel has a length less than 100 m and a breadth of 17, 20 m. The stowage of 6 containers in width is possible. The total container capacity amounts 256 TEUs in 4 layers (2 layers on deck). Due to the relatively large breadth the ship was designed as twin-screw vessel. The gas carrier has nearly the recently approved maximum length of 135 m for the river Rhine. The ship was designed as gas carrier for <b>liquefied</b> gas <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> in separate pressure tanks. The two ships have relatively high stability. Sufficient ballast water capacity is available, in order to improve the seaworthiness under worse weather conditions. A numerical optimisation of the hull-form was carried out for the container vessel. Principally it could be shown, that shifting the centre of buoyancy ahead maintaining the same blockcoefficient, that means a slender aft ship in connection with a fuller fore body, results in a decrease of wave resistance.

40|$|The present work {{is aimed}} at {{analyzing}} the evolution of accidental scenarios deriving from the release of toxic materials inside a tunnel. This scenario, compared to the more frequently investigated cases of fire, followed by smoke dispersion, may involve a large variety of common products characterized by widely differing physical properties; nonetheless it has been analysed in the literature less than expected. The present study compares the dispersion of two common toxic chemicals (chlorine and ammonia), in order to derive some preliminary information {{about the influence of}} the physical properties and the release rate. A reference road tunnel geometry is assumed, while the release occurs from ground level, at the centre of one lane {{and in the middle of}} the tunnel. Two study cases involving a road tanker, transporting the product as <b>liquefied</b> gas <b>under</b> <b>pressure,</b> were considered: a catastrophic release, from a 220 mm hole, emptying the tanker in a few tens seconds (case A), and a continuous release, from a much smaller hole (15 mm), lasting 5 min (case B). For the sake of simplicity, the release is assumed to be in gaseous phase; the dispersion of the toxic is simulated for the 5 min period following the start of the release using a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis, according to an RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) approach with the standard k-epsilon turbulence model, assuming no ventilation conditions. Structured curvilinear grids with hexaedric cells, refined according to the local concentration gradient, are used. For case A scenarios, especially for the whole release duration, dispersion is mainly governed by the "plug-flow" effect caused by the large volume of toxic entering the tunnel in a rather short time; then, the role of diffusivity and gravity becomes more important Chlorine, heavier than air and with lower diffusivity than ammonia, progressively accumulates towards the floor; the dispersion of ammonia, which is lighter than air, appears more influenced by diffusivity than by gravity, since a limited stratification is observed. These trends are more evident for case B scenarios, where the toxic flow rates are much lower. It is expected the results will give some useful insight into the dispersion phenomenon within highly confined spaces and maybe also provide some suggestion about ventilation systems design and emergency procedures.
