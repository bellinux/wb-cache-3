A pilot landslide-mapping project was conducted {{in the vicinity of}} Atchison, Kansas, to inventory existing <b>landslides</b> and determine the factors that caused them. <b>Landslides</b> are generally controlled by the slope morphology, geology, soils, and moisture conditions. For this study, <b>landslides</b> were divided into recent and older <b>landslides</b> (including earth slides and earth flows) and rock-fall hazards (including rock falls and rock topples). Recent <b>landslides</b> are associated with shale members of the Pennsylvanian Lawrence Formation, Oread Limestone, Kanwaka Shale, and Tecumseh Shale. Limestone layers that occur between these shale members were incorporated into recent and older <b>landslides.</b> Recent <b>landslides</b> occurred on slopes with an average angle of 22 degrees. Recent <b>landslides</b> were also observed in glacial drift, loess, and alluvium. Rockfall hazards occurred in areas of nearly vertical slopes along streams, river bluffs, highways, and quarries, where limestone members of the Pennsylvanian Oread, Lecompton, and Deer Creek Limestones are exposed. Troublesome rock-fall hazards occurred where weak shale layers are eroding underneath resistant limestone layers...|$|R
40|$|The Shiretoko Peninsula {{in eastern}} Hokkaido {{is known for}} its {{abundance}} of <b>landslides.</b> 　In this region，a total of 606 <b>landslides</b> were identified in aerial photographs of which 97 were large-scale <b>landslides</b> (more than 500 m wide or 20 ha in area). The characteristics of large-scale <b>landslides</b> in the Shiretoko Peninsula are summarized as follows : 1) Large-scale <b>landslides</b> are mostly found along the margins of Pliocene to Quaternary subaerial andesitic lavas overlying Miocene volcaniclastic and clastic rocks. One of the geological factors for large-scale <b>landslides</b> is cap rock structures composed of subaerial lavas and underlying Miocene strata， which are susceptible to small-scale <b>landsliding.</b> 2) Most large-scale <b>landslides</b> are of rock-slump-type shape or debris-avalanche-type shape，the latter of which is characterized by a main scarp with large relative elevation, sliding mass under the scarp, and sliding/flowing debris of several hundreds meters in length. Moreover，also recognized were debris flows forming the waste-filled valleys of 400 to 500 meters wide and 3 to 4 kilometers long. 3) Moving and depositional areas in large-scale <b>landslides</b> were mostly enlarged by the repeated occurrence of <b>landslides</b> and flows of sliding mass， and the new sliding occured on the back-slope of the main scarp. 4) In order to understand the mechanism of large-scale sliding， the relationships of the Rausudake active faults and the destruction of the dome-like volcaro to the Onnebetsudake large-scale <b>landslides</b> should be further investigated in detail...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{movement}} can {{be activated}} by earthquakes, rapid snowmelt, or intense rainstorms {{in conjunction with}} gravity. Whereas mass movement {{plays a major role}} in the evolution of a hillslope by modifying slope morphology and transporting material from the slope to the valley, it is also a potential natural hazard. Determining the morphology of the mountain slopes and the relationships of frequency and magnitude of <b>landslides</b> are fundamental to understanding the role of <b>landslides</b> in the study of landscape evolution, and hazard assessment. Characteristics of the geomorphic zones in a periglacial landscape were evaluated by plotting local slopes and the drainage areas in Paonia-McClure Pass area of western Colorado. The study suggested that the steepness and concavity of mountain slopes and stream channels in the study area are related by an exponential equation. Seven hundred and thirty five shallow <b>landslides</b> (< 160, 000 m 2) from the same study area were mapped to determine the frequency-magnitude relationships of shallow <b>landslides</b> and to develop an optimum model of mapping susceptibility to <b>landslides.</b> This study suggests that the frequency-magnitude of the <b>landslides</b> in Paonia-McClure Pass area are related by a double pareto equation with values ?= 1. 1, and ? = 1. 9 for the exponents. The total area of <b>landslides</b> is 4. 8 x 10 ? m? and the total volume of the <b>landslides</b> is 1. 4 x 10 ? m?. The areas (A) and the volumes (V) of <b>landslides</b> are related by V = 0. 0254 xA^ 1. 45. The frequency-magnitude analysis shows that <b>landslides</b> with areas ranging in size from 1, 600 m 2 - 20, 000 m 2 are the most hazardous <b>landslides</b> in the study area. These <b>landslides</b> are the most frequent and also do a significant amount of geomorphic work. Three quantitative approaches: weight of evidence; fuzzy logic; and logistic regression; were employed to develop models of mapping <b>landslides</b> in western Colorado. The weight of evidence approach predicted 78 percent of the observed <b>landslides,</b> the fuzzy-logic approach also predicted 78 percent of the observed <b>landslides,</b> and the logistic regression approach predicted 86 percent of the observed <b>landslides...</b>|$|R

40|$|Coastal and subaqueous <b>landslides</b> {{can be very}} {{dangerous}} phenomena since they are characterised by the additional risk of induced tsunamis, unlike their completely-subaerial counterparts. Numerical modelling of <b>landslides</b> propagation is a key step in forecasting the consequences of <b>landslides.</b> In this paper, a novel approach named Equivalent Fluid/Equivalent Medium (EFEM) has been developed. It adapts common numerical models and software that were originally designed for subaerial <b>landslides</b> in order to simulate the propagation of combined subaerial-subaqueous and completely-subaqueous <b>landslides.</b> Drag and buoyancy forces, the loss of energy at the landslide-water impact and peculiar mechanisms like hydroplaning can be suitably simulated by this approach; furthermore, the change in properties of the <b>landslide's</b> mass, which is encountered at {{the transition from the}} subaerial to the submerged environment, can be taken into account. The approach has been tested by modelling two documented coastal <b>landslides</b> (a debris flow and a rock slide at Lake Albano) using the DAN-W code. The results, which were achieved from the back-analyses, demonstrate the efficacy of the approach to simulate the propagation of different types of coastal <b>landslides...</b>|$|R
