25|$|Komarov. Kamanin, as {{the state}} {{commissioner}} for the Soyuz 1 launch, was present at Baikonur throughout <b>launch</b> <b>preparation</b> that began 6 April 1967. Once the rocket lifted off on 23 April Kamanin {{took charge of the}} first mission control shift. Vladimir Komarov, on his second orbit, reported failure in solar panels - one of them failed to deploy. So far, the situation was manageable, and Kamanin dispatched Gagarin to the second mission control station in Yevpatoria. On the 13th orbit, state commission realized imminent danger and decided to land Komarov and cancel Soyuz 2. 6:45 AM, 24 April while Komarov was still alive, Kamanin boarded the plane departing to the landing area. In the air, Kamanin received the first (incorrect) news of Soyuz descending with a fully deployed parachute. He was not aware of disaster until meeting General Artamonov on the Orsk airfield. Kamanin lost an hour and half travelling to the crash site, only to see the capsule still on fire. Later, the Soyuz 1 parachute failure was linked to an insufficient pilot chute that failed to drag the main parachute from its container.|$|E

[...] Unlike previous Chinese ballistic missiles, the DF-11 use solid fuel, which greatly reduces <b>launch</b> <b>preparation</b> time to around 15–30 minutes, while liquid-fuelled missiles such as the DF-5 require up to 2 hours of pre-launch preparation. [...] The DF-11 has a range of 300km and an 800kg payload. [...] An improved DF-11A version has increased range of >825km. The range of the M-11 does not violate the limits set by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Estimates {{on the number of}} DF-11s in service vary between 500 and 600.|$|E

50|$|Accidents {{can occur}} on the ground during <b>launch,</b> <b>preparation,</b> or in flight, due to {{equipment}} malfunction or the naturally hostile environment of space itself.
