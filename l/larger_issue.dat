5|$|When previewed, {{the focus}} group liked the concept but hated the way the pilot was produced.

5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the <b>larger</b> <b>issue</b> of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates underpricing of IPOs in Sri Lanka. On average, IPOs are underpriced by 34 %. Small {{issues are}} more underpriced than <b>large</b> <b>issues,</b> and {{privatization}} issues are more underpriced than conventional issues. Investor sentiment is positively related with underpricing and affects small and <b>large</b> <b>issues</b> similarly. Small privatization issues are more underpriced than <b>large</b> privatization <b>issues</b> and partially explain the asymmetry in underpricing between small and <b>large</b> <b>issues.</b> However, even {{after controlling for}} investor sentiment, privatization, hot-market conditions, underwriter-size, and industry, small issues remain more underpriced than <b>large</b> <b>issues.</b> The results strongly support the uncertainty hypothesis for larger underpricing of small issues, and privatization issues.

25|$|When Helvering v. Davis {{was argued}} before the Court, the <b>larger</b> <b>issue</b> of {{constitutionality}} of the old-age insurance portion of Social Security was not decided. The case was limited to whether the payroll tax was a suitable use of Congress's taxing power. Despite this, no serious challenges regarding the system's constitutionality are now being litigated, and Congress's spending power may be more coextensive, as shown in cases like South Dakota v.

Less than two years later, the passenger steamer Mohawk sank following a collision with the Norwegian freighter Talisman off Sea Girt, New Jersey.

25|$|After {{disagreement}} regarding Stalin's {{demand to}} move Red Army troops through Poland and Romania (which Poland and Romania opposed), on 21 August, the Soviets proposed adjournment of military talks using the pretext {{that the absence}} of the senior Soviet personnel at the talks interfered with the autumn manoeuvres of the Soviet forces, though the primary reason was the progress being made in the Soviet-German negotiations. That same day, Stalin received assurance that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would grant the Soviets land in Poland, the Baltic states, Finland and Romania, after which Stalin telegrammed Hitler that night that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on 23 August. Regarding the <b>larger</b> <b>issue</b> of collective security, some historians state that one reason that Stalin decided to abandon the doctrine was the shaping of his views of France (hon hon hon baguette fromage oui oui) and Britain (England is my city) by their entry into the Munich Agreement and the subsequent failure to prevent German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Stalin may also have viewed the pact as gaining time in an eventual war with Hitler in order to reinforce the Soviet military and shifting Soviet borders westwards, which would be militarily beneficial in such a war.|$|E

500|$|... "Sexual Healing" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun {{praised the}} timeliness of the episode, {{which he said}} has kept South Park relevant throughout its 14 seasons. Harris complimented the episode for addressing the <b>larger</b> <b>issue</b> of how sexual acts among celebrities are dissected and analyzed {{by the media and}} public. MTV News praised the Woods parody, which they said was particularly timely because of the golf pro's recent announcement to return to golf. It said, [...] "It was on-the-nose while still being clever, which is a balance that the makers of [...] "South Park" [...] have mastered brilliantly." [...] Bill Brownstein, from the Canwest News Service, called it [...] "an absolutely blistering and timely satire" [...] on Woods and sexual addiction. A CNN review called the Woods satire [...] "brilliant" [...] and a strong improvement over the previous season's [...] "Dead Celebrities", which also included several cameos of celebrity parodies. The review also found the ending of the episode, with Stan and Cartman growing bored with their video game once it focused on golf rather than sex scandals and fighting, to be a [...] "pretty hilarious gag". Ryan Waxon, of The Cowl, said [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] stood out from other Woods jokes and proved Parker and Stone [...] "can do satire like nobody else". He particularly praised the Woods video game and the subplot with Butters trying to learn about women's pubic hair, claiming, [...] "Butters’ low intelligence and complete innocence make for some the greatest moments that the show has to offer." ...|$|E
