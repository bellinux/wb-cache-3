40|$|Intercropping {{of maize}} (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L). Merr) is {{becoming}} a common practice among smallholder farmers but soybean is sensitive to shading resulting in yield decline. A research study to evaluate the adaptability of soybean varieties to intercropping under leaf stripped and detasselled maize was conducted at the University of Zimbabwe Farm (Thornpark Farm) during the 2006 / 2007 rainy season. The experiment was laid out as a 3 x 3 x 2 factorial with controls in a Randomized Complete Block Design. The three factors were; cropping system (sole maize, maize-soybean intercrop, sole soybean), soybean variety (Storm, Solitaire and Magoye) <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling (intact maize, four bottom leaves removed and tassel removed). In the intercrop, two soybean rows were planted between maize rows. <b>Leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling was done at 50 % silking. Weed counts were taken at 6 and 9 weeks after crop emergence (WACE) and at physiological maturity. Yield and yield components were determined at harvesting. There were significant differences (P < 0. 05) {{in the performance of}} the soybean varieties, Storm had the highest yield (1770 kg/ha) which was not significantly different from Solitaire (1496 kg /ha), but Magoye gave the lowest yield (837 kg/ha), which was different from either Storm or Solitaire. There was a significant difference in performance of soybean varieties under different cropping systems (P < 0. 05). The soybean varieties performed better as sole crop (1838 kg/ha) than under intercropping (maize (intact) -soybean: 868 kg/ha), maize (leaf stripped and detasselled: 950 kg/ha). <b>Leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling and cropping system had no significant effect on 1000 -grain weight and grain yield of maize. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) values of the various intercropping systems were all greater than 1 indicating the advantages of intercropping. Cropping system, soybean variety and <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling had no significant effect on total weed biomass at 6 and 9 WACE but had significant effect on total weed biomass at physiological maturity. Results suggest that intercropping reduces the yield of soybean but there is an advantage of intercropping since the LER values were greater than 1. The soybean crop can be considered as a bonus crop from which a farmer can reap additional financial and nutritional benefits as well as residual soil fertility. The stripped leaves from the maize can be fed to livestock. Magoye is not adaptable to intercropping...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: Intercropping, narrow planting, precise {{fertilizer}} placement, radiation interception, <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping,</b> detasselling, Land Equivalent Ratio, maize, pumpkin, dry beans, reduced herbicide dosages In the tropics, weeds {{cause more}} crop losses and farmers spend {{more of their}} time weeding crops {{than in any other}} part of the world. Weeds form a major factor which contributes to the miserable quality of life of smallholder farmers, especially of women and children, in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The effects of maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercropping and, narrow row planting and precise basal fertilizer placement in monocrop maize, on crop and weed radiation interception (RI), crop yields, weed emergence, growth and fecundity were investigated in this study. The effects of <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> (removal of the lowest 2 - 6 leaves) and detasselling maize at anthesis on the radiant environment and crop yields in a maize monocrop and maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercrops were also studied to determine the impact of these interventions on yield of component crops. The aim of the studies was to generate technologies that could be integrated into the production practices of smallholder farmers to suppress weeds and alleviate the severe weeding burden faced by these farmers while ensuring high crop productivity. Maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercropping reduced weed biomass by 50 - 66 % when established at a density of 12, 300 plants ha - 1 for pumpkins equivalent to 33 % of the maize density (37, 000 plants ha - 1), and 222, 000 plants ha - 1 for beans. Lower densities of pumpkins than 33 % of the maize density failed to reduce weed biomass more than that achieved by sole maize. Sole maize crops were weeded twice or thrice to achieve the same weed biomass as intercrops weeded once showed that intercropping could reduce the weeding requirements of maize by 33 to 67 %. Maize grain yield was reduced by 20 % in one out of four seasons in the first study on maize-pumpkin intercropping. Maize grain yield was not reduced in three seasons when the maize-pumpkin intercropping treatments were leaf stripped and/or detasselled and the trend of <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling alleviating the effects of companion crop competition on maize grain was shown in the maize-bean intercrop experiments as well. Intercrop productivity increased with <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling as a result of greater penetration of radiation to the companion crop and their effects of increasing dry matter distributed to the maize cob (indicated by 1000 -grain weight, cob weight, and kernel weight cob - 1). <b>Leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> maize at anthesis focused on the removal of leaves that were beginning to senesce. If they would remain on the plant they would compete with the cob for assimilates as they senesce further, until necrosis. Detasselling is known to remove apical dominance and to increase radiation penetration to the middle leaves on the maize plant that produce most assimilates destined for the cob. <b>Leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> did not affect the ability of the intercrop to suppress weed growth and seed production. In maize monocrops more weed biomass and weed seeds were produced with <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and detasselling. Maize grain yield decreased with an increase in maize density from 30, 000 plants ha - 1 to 36, 000 and 42, 000 plants ha - 1 and weed growth suppression increased with an increase in maize density in a semi arid location in Zimbabwe. Planting maize using narrow row (60 cm × 45 cm) and (75 cm × 36 cm) spatial arrangements increased radiation interception by maize plants by 16 to 24 % and maize grain yields by 15 to 26 % compared to wide row (90 cm × 30 cm) spatial arrangement commonly used by smallholder farmers. Weed biomass was reduced by 20 to 80 %, dependent on weed species, in narrow row spatial arrangements compared to normal farmer planting patterns. The duration of the weed free period required to attain maximum yield increased from 6 weeks after emergence (WAE) in the 60 cm × 45 cm spatial arrangement to 9 WAE in the wider row spatial arrangements. It is, therefore, risky for smallholder farmers to increase maize density to suppress weeds as this will lead to maize grain yield reductions. The use of narrow rows proved to be a better option. Precise fertilizer placement (banding and spot placement) resulted in higher rates of early growth and by 4 WAE these treatments intercepted 20 % more of the incoming radiation than a broadcast placement method. Weed emergence, growth and seed production was higher in the broadcast placement treatment as a result of weeds intercepting more incoming radiation and greater access to applied fertilizer nutrients. High fertilizer rates of 225 kg ha - 1 of a compound fertilizer (8 % N, 14 % K 2 O, 7 % P 2 O 5), reduced maize grain yield by 15 % compared to 150 kg ha - 1 in a season characterized by drought. It was hypothesized that high concentrations of fertilizer around the root zone predisposed the maize plants to more severe effects of drought than lower fertilizer application rates. Reduced dosages of atrazine and nicosulfuron (25 % of the Label Recommended Dosages, LRDs) protected maize from weeds as well as the full LRDs of each herbicide. The reduced dosages suppressed weed competition during the critical period for weed control in maize. However, the tolerant weed species Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn., Setaria verticillata (L.) Beauv., Setaria homonyma (Stead.) Chiov. for atrazine and E. indica, Galinsoga parviflora Cav. and Portulaca oleracea L. for nicosulfuron, tended to escape the herbicide effects and survive as dosages were reduced. Reduced dosages of these herbicides have to be combined with hoe weeding or ox-cultivation to prevent the inadvertent selection of these species by the reduced dose strategy. Recalcitrant species recovering from tillage were shown to be more vulnerable to reduced herbicide toxicity in a greenhouse experiment. It was concluded that cultural weed management techniques that enhance radiation capture by the crop were effective in suppressing weed growth and seed production and increasing crop yields and should be incorporated into smallholder farmer's production practices in a systematic manner as part of Integrated Weed Management and cropping system design...|$|E
40|$|Boreal forest {{vegetation}} {{is likely to}} change in response to warming and associated changes in disturbance regimes. Recently, high severity fires have caused a shift from pre-fire mature black spruce stands to early assemblages of broadleaf trees. However, interactions between plants and animals may modify the outcomes of early forest succession. Selective herbivory by mammalian herbivores can alter the relative dominance of forest canopy species and influence successional pathways. However, woody plants have evolved multiple strategies to maximize chances of survival and long-term fitness after herbivory. In this thesis, I explore the dynamics of moose-tree interactions and their consequences for early succession in boreal forests of interior Alaska. I assessed the interaction of moose browsing and fire severity on tree growth and canopy composition and found that moose slow the rate of trembling aspen growth, but only in severely burned areas. Black spruce showed no direct or indirect growth responses to moose browsing, indicating that moose browsing on aspen did not alter the initial trajectory to an aspen-dominated canopy within my study area. In lightly burned areas, moose may benefit from longer durations of forage availability and accelerate {{the development of a}} mixed spruce-aspen canopy. Alaskan paper birch is the other dominant broadleaf species colonizing early post-fire forests and I determined saplings’ ability to tolerate simulated summer <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> by moose. I found decreases in woody growth and carbon-based defenses while individual leaf area increased in response to simulated <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping.</b> My results are consistent with the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis suggesting that the loss of growing points during <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> decreased competition for nutrients, which were then available for leaf regrowth. Birch saplings have the potential to compensate for herbivory, but resilience of individuals will depend on the intensity, season, and frequency of herbivory. I set up long-term exclosures to test if mammalian herbivores can alter patterns of canopy succession in early post-fire sites that ranged in broadleaf dominance. Removal of natural moose herbivory inside exclosures led to species-specific responses after two years. Alaskan paper birch (dominant broadleaf species) grew larger when safe from herbivores while the opposite was true for black spruce. However, impacts of natural moose browsing on the dominant birch were insufficient to eliminate the competitive hierarchies that supported birch dominance of the canopy and suppressed growth of black spruce in the understory. I conclude that even with the negative impacts of moose on broadleaf species growth, their tolerance to browse damage enables their persistence as the dominant canopy species after large and severe fires in the boreal forest of Alaska...|$|E

40|$|Elevation of leaf auxin (indole- 3 -acetic acid; IAA) {{levels in}} intact plants has been {{consistently}} found to inhibit leaf expansion whereas excised <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> grow faster when treated with IAA. Here we test two hypothetical explanations for this difference in growth sensitivity to IAA by expanding leaf tissues in vivo versus in vitro. We asked if, in Arabidopsis, IAA-induced growth of excised <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> results from the wounding required to excise tissue and/or results from detachment from the plant and thus loss of some shoot or root derived growth controlling factors. We tested {{the effect of a}} range of exogenous IAA concentrations on the growth of intact attached, wounded attached, detached intact, detached wounded as well as excised <b>leaf</b> <b>strips.</b> After 24 h, the growth of intact attached, wounded attached, and detached intact leaves was inhibited by IAA concentrations as little as 1 µM in some experiments.

40|$|Drying {{tea tree}} leaf on the stem {{increased}} the oil content from 5. 8 % to 7. 4 % yield v/dw. This increase {{is not a}} result of changing moisture content but appears {{to be due to}} an active form of postharvest oil uptake or production. The value to oil producers of drying and storing leaf prior to distillation is a more efficient distillation system. At present, distillation occurs {{as close as possible to}} foliage harvest with the aim of reducing any chance of oil volatilization. These results show that the need for immediate distillation of cut foliage is unnecessary, as the delay would actually improve the yield rather than reduce it. For the industry these results could change the accepted methods of production. To date each producer had to have their own distillation plant as a way of avoiding distillation delays and the need for carting wet leaf material. Since drying leaves on the stems of the tree increases the oil yield and since the removal of leaves from the stem is easily accomplished when the leaves are dried, producers need only have storage and <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> facilities. This would enable pure leaf to be transferred cheaply to a central distillery when a sufficient load is achieved...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on earlier}} {{findings}} showing {{the effectiveness of}} preflowering leaf removal at reducing yield in several Vitis vinifera L. genotypes, a 3 -year study was carried out on Sangiovese vines to evaluate how the technique also affects vegetative growth, wood carbohydrates reserves, and specific physiological traits such as intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) and leaf chlorophyll fluorescence. Early defoliation (D) applied before flowering with elimination of similar to 80 % of the leaf area as compared with a non-defoliated control (C) was confirmed as quite effective in limiting yield per vine, cluster weight, cluster compactness and rot incidence, and berry set and mass in two of three seasons. Defoliation also markedly improved relative berry skin mass regardless of season. Vine vigor (pruning weight, cane diameter, and main leaf area) was significantly reduced in D vines (2008 - 2009 data), whereas vine capacity as total leaf area per vine was not. The leaf-to-fruit ratio dropped dramatically after defoliation to I m(2) /kg in D vines, which recovered thereafter and had a higher ratio from veraison onward. Intrinsic WUE and tolerance to photoinhibition increased in D vines for both main and lateral leaves, which were formed after <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and which had reached full maturity by the time measurements were made.

40|$|Hurricanes {{have been}} assumed {{to reduce the}} {{reproduction}} of plants, either directly by <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> and stress or indirectly by reducing pollinators. I examined the pollination and fruit set of a common shrub, Bourreria succulenta, after hurricanes on San Salvador island, Bahamas. Contrary to the assumption of resource limitation, B. succulenta showed unusually prolific flowering after Hurricane Lili stripped leaves {{from most of the}} plants in October 1996. I predicted that the abundant flowering would saturate pollinators and that fruit set would be pollination-limited. Fruit set was strongly pollination-limited by 71 percent. Butterflies are probably the major pollinators and were present at the site, but they rarely visited B. succulenta flowers even though flowers were brimming with nectar. Nectarivorous birds (Bananaquits and Bahama Wbodstars) visit B. succulenta flowers, but their populations were decimated by Hurricane Lili and they rarely visited flowers during this time. Fruit set was also severely predation-limited; a moth caterpillar (Gelechiidae) was extremely abundant and ate buds, flowers, and fruits, causing a further 68 percent reduction in fruit set. Together, pollination limitation and predation limitation reduced fruit set to only 7 percent or less. Predation was also intense in 1999 after Hurricane Floyd and resulted in 11 percent fruit set or less. Whether or not hurricanes were the cause of limited pollinators or abundant predators, the resulting low fruit set could have population effects because hurricanes can provide opportunities for the recruitment of new plants. These results emphasize that understanding plant–animal interactions may be necessary for predicting the effects of hurricanes on plant reproductive success, which may affect subsequent recruitment. Species on small islands like San Salvador (150 km 2) with relatively few species may be especially vulnerable to environmental disturbances such as hurricanes...|$|E

40|$|In Europe it is {{estimated}} a viticulture surface of approximately 3 millions hectares {{and a number of}} sprayers used to apply pesticides in vineyards of more than 700000. Most of spray application techniques currently used in vineyards are still not optimised and this imply negative effects in terms of efficacy, environmental pollution and operator safety. Several studies (Balsari et al. 2008, Cerruto 2007, Da Silva et al. 2001; Pergher et al. 1997) have estimated that the pesticide deposited on the target is not more than 55 % of the volume sprayed and in several cases this value is only 20 % of total amount applied. Main causes of these high pesticide losses are the bad sprayers performances and the not correct choice of the operating parameters. To solve the first problem it is necessary to renew the sprayers (in several EU countries the average vineyard sprayers age is more than 15 years), to establish a mandatory certification of the performance of sprayers before they’re put on the market, as intended in the proposal of amendment of EU Machinery Directive, and to periodically inspect the functionality of sprayers in use (see EU Directive on Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides). More complex is the choice of the correct sprayer operating parameters, due also to the large number (more than 1000) of vineyard training systems in Europe. Several research results are reported, aimed at providing indications concerning the correct choice of fan air volume, nozzles flow rate and sprayer forward speed. It is also reported the advantage of <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> technique in increasing the spray penetration into the canopy and in the bunches and the results obtained using a leaf-stripping machine able to apply pesticides at the same time.

40|$|Abstract Background Interspecific {{hybridisation}} {{is common}} between many plant species and causes rapid {{changes in a}} variety of plant characters. This may pose problems for herbivores because changes in recognition characters may be poorly correlated with changes in quality characters. Many studies have examined different systems of hybrids and herbivores in attempts to understand the role of hybridisation in the evolution of plant resistance. The results from different systems are variable. Studies of hybrids between Salix caprea (L., Salicaceae) and S. repens show that they are intermediate between the two parental species in most resistence characters. However, a plants herbivore resistence depends also on its biotic and abiotic environment. Important biotic factors that may influence plant growth and plant chemistry include the interactions between different herbivores that occur through their exploitation of common host plants. Although the effects on plants of previous herbivory are likely to be strongly affected by environmental conditions, they are also species-specific. Damage may therefore have different effects on hybrids than on their parental species, and this could influence the performance of herbivores on pure and hybrid species of plants. To evaluate the effects of hybridisation on insect performance, the development and survival rates of Phratora vitellinae (L. 1758, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) larvae on pure S. repens, pure S. caprea and Fl hybrids of the two species was monitored. Further, to examine the effect of herbivorous mammals on the performance of the larvae, plants were damaged to simulate winter foraging by voles or spring <b>leaf</b> <b>stripping</b> by moose. Results The results show that development rates were highest on S. repens and equally low on S. caprea and the Fl hybrid. In addition, development of the plants treated to simulate mammalian herbivore damage was slower than that of corresponding controls. Conclusions The results of this experiment suggest that P. vitellinae has a higher development rate, and thus probably higher performance, on species with high concentrations of phenolic glucosides. Therefore, it would be of adaptive benefit for P. vitellinae females to have an ovipositional preference for S. repens, compared to S. caprea and intermediate preference for Fl hybrids. The faster development observed on S. repens supports the hypothesis that P. vitellinae obtains additional adaptive benefits from phenolic glucosides beyond protection against predators. Therefore, {{it is important to consider}} further factors, such as damage caused by other herbivores, when studying this hybrid complex. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt was {{previously}} {{shown that the}} tobacco Ext 1. 4 extensin gene is expressed in cells proliferating under hormone control and during lateral root initiation. Now, the regulation of expression of the Ext 1. 4 gene family is analysed {{in response to the}} auxins 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and 1 naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). On the one hand, it is shown that there is no accumulation of Ext 1. 4 mRNAs after short periods of incubation of roots or <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> in the presence of either 2, 4 -D or NAA. On the other hand, germination of transgenic seeds carrying the (1331 /+ 46) Ext 1. 4 /ß-GUS construct on a 2, 4 -D containing-medium does not lead to ectopic expression of the chimeric gene. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the genes in Ext 1. 4 family are not early auxin-responsive genes. They may be late auxin-responsive genes or their induction in proliferating cells may be the consequence of a higher requirement of structural proteins for the formation of their particular cell walls...|$|R

40|$|Protoplasts were {{isolated}} from {{leaves of the}} aquatic angiosperm Potamogeton lucens L. The leaves utilize bicarbonate as a carbon source for photosynthesis, and show polarity; that is, acidification of the periplasmic space of the lower, and alkalinization of the space near the upper leaf side. At present there are two models under consideration for this photosynthetic bicarbonate utilization process: conversion of bicarbonate into free carbon dioxide {{as a result of}} acidification and, second, a bicarbonate-proton symport across the plasma membrane. Carbon fixation of protoplasts was studied at different pH values and compared with that in <b>leaf</b> <b>strips.</b> Using the isotopic disequilibrium technique, it was established that carbon dioxide and not bicarbonate was the form in which DIC actually crossed the plasma membrane. It is concluded that there is probably no true bicarbonate transport system at the plasma membrane of these cells and that bicarbonate utilization in this species apparently rests on the conversion of bicarbonate into carbon dioxide. Experiments with acetazolamide, an inhibitor of periplasmic carbonic anhydrase, and direct measurements of carbonic anhydrase activity in intact leaves indicate that in this species the role of this enzyme for periplasmic conversion of bicarbonate into carbon dioxide is insignificant...|$|R
50|$|When closely {{arranged}} on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri-zasa (切り笹). These dividers prevent {{the flavors of}} neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the Aspidistra elatior (葉蘭 haran) and Sasa veitchii (熊笹 kuma-zasa) plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had {{the added benefit of}} releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi. Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.|$|R
40|$|Wounding initiates {{a strong}} and largely jasmonate-dependent remodelling of the {{transcriptome}} in the leaf blades of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). How much control do jasmonates exert on wound-induced protein repatterning in leaves? Replicated shotgun proteomic analyses of 2. 5 -mm-wide <b>leaf</b> <b>strips</b> adjacent to wounds revealed 106 differentially regulated proteins. Many of these gene products have not emerged as being wound regulated in transcriptomic studies. From experiments using the jasmonic acid (JA) -deficient allene oxide synthase mutant we estimated that approximately 95 % of wound-stimulated changes in protein levels were deregulated {{in the absence of}} JA. The levels of two tonoplast proteins already implicated in defense response regulation, TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1 and the calcium-V-ATPase ACA 4 increased on wounding, but their transcripts were not wound inducible. The data suggest new roles for jasmonate in controlling the levels of calcium-regulated pumps and transporters, proteins involved in targeted proteolysis, a putative bacterial virulence factor target, a light-dependent catalyst, and a key redox-controlled enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Extending the latter observation we found that wounding increased the proportion of oxidized glutathione in leaves, but only in plants able to synthesize JA. The oxidizing conditions generated through JA signaling near wounds help to define the cellular environment in which proteome remodelling occurs...|$|R
