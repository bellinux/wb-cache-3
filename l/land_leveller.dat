40|$|Intensification of {{agricultural}} production remains the {{major threat to}} the ecology of agro-ecosystems impairing the state of soil, water and air and reducing biological diversity in agricultural landscapes. This production is a complex process where cultivation plays an important role. Land degradation induced by large-scale equipment is of growing concern causing damage to the subsoil structure and may lead to harmful soil compaction. It is necessary to apply measures which can preserve or improve physical-mechanical, technological and microbiological properties as well as nutritive potential of soil, being {{at the same time}} environmental friendly. The machinery and tools that are often used in plant production in Republic of Serbia are the following: vibrating subsoiler VR- 5 / 7, universal self-propelled machine for soil arrangement USM- 5, draining plough DP- 4 and universal scraper <b>land</b> <b>leveller.</b> Those machines are tested on Marsh soil type. A description of the machines, tools and technologies necessary for soil preparation, with special note on preservation of soil properties, together with techniques based on decrease of the power energy necessary for the process of soil preparation is presented.

40|$|The GAEC {{standard}} <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> under {{authorization of}} cross compliance prohibits farmers from <b>levelling</b> <b>land</b> through bulldozing without a specific permission {{issued by the}} proper territorial authority. The aim of the standard is to ensure the protection of soil from accelerated erosion that almost always occurs when <b>land</b> is <b>levelled</b> without conservative criteria. <b>Land</b> <b>levelling</b> prior to planting or replanting specialized crops, especially orchards, is indicated by agronomists as essential to the full mechanization of cultivation and harvesting operations {{and the success of}} economic investment. <b>Land</b> <b>levelling</b> leads to a deep modification of the hill slopes, so it may produce serious damage to the environment if carried out {{in the absence of a}} carefully planned design. In other words, a design that takes the aspects of soil conservation into account, especially for steep hill slopes where the insite and offsite environmental impacts of soil erosion may be more pronounced. With regard to the areas involved, <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> plays a key role on a national scale, one only needs to think of the vineyards planted on the country’s hill slopes, which in 1970 covered an area of 793, 000 hectares. Moreover, despite the continued reduction in areas planted with vines, from 1990 to 2002 the area devoted to DOC and DOCG wines increased by about 29 % and the average size of vineyards has also increased. This is a clear sign of the current trend, with the transition from the family model to the industrial model of orchard management, with extensive use of machinery and thus the use of bulldozers for levelling. The authorization topic, on which the standard of compliance is based, is analysed in detail. In summary we can say that, according to law, the permit required by the GAEC standard is currently mandatory only for those areas subject to the Hydrogeological constraint (Royal decree 30 December 1923 No. 3267) and for parks or other areas for which the regional regulations are more rigorous. <b>Land</b> <b>levelling</b> in other agricultural areas is excluded from the requirement to obtain prior authorization. Owners are only required to submit a DIA (statement of commencement of activity) to the Public Authority. However, permission is granted by law, in the event of lack of ruling by the Authority (implicit consent principle). This GAEC standard assumes that permission (where due) granted by the local authorities responsible for territorial governance is sufficient to avoid the damage that could be caused by <b>land</b> <b>levelling.</b> In other words, the standard does not dictate the agronomic rules to be followed in carrying out <b>land</b> <b>levelling,</b> but refers to already existing local rules and assumes that the authorization is granted on the basis of a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). At the present time, only a few local governments take <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> into consideration in their territorial governance legislation. In general, there is no rule requiring that the application for authorization be accompanied by a project containing the items considered necessary, in the present study, to enable the authorities to express well-pondered judgment. In addition, local territorial rules do not require the execution of <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> and subsequent approval of the finished work to be carried out under the supervision of a geologist or a pedologist. At present, the GAEC standard is very weak, due to the lack of coordination between the provisions of cross compliance and territorial governance legislation focused on <b>land</b> <b>levelling.</b> It is common practice for the landowner, after obtaining permission, to assign the work to an earthmoving company with no expertise in soil protection and which possibly also has an interest in moving large volumes of earth. This may contribute to an increase in severe environmental damage. <b>Land</b> <b>levelling,</b> undertaken by virtue of a simple DIA and lacking environmental expertise, is very risky and can cause severe damage to soil resources and the landscape. This is particularly true in areas prone to hydrogeological risk or where the soil is thin or fragile in relation to some of its qualities or environmental functions. The results of some researchers on Italian case studies have shown the extent to which <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> undertaken disregarding the rules of environmental protection can cause serious disturbance to the soil resource, resulting in impressive truncation or burial of the original soil profile, with severe reduction in land capability, even to the extent of desertification. Results showed that there was a drop in production, especially in excavation areas. Furthermore, changes in the quality of products and a general decay in the vegetative state of plants and water stress were observed. In one case study, <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> performed before planting a vineyard determined excavation and accumulation thicknesses respectively up to 19 and 16 metres. In another case study soil erosion after <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> reached values of over 300 Mg ha- 1 (classified as catastrophic erosion). This value is far from the limits of a tolerable erosion of 6 - 11 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 currently internationally accepted. The proposals to update the GAEC standard are as follows: i) extension of the <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> under authorization rule to include also land remodelling (light bulldozing following the removal of an old plantation, to prepare the land for a new plantation); ii) obligation to submit a geological and pedological feasibility study in order to obtain authorization...|$|R

To demonstrate the potential economic benefits of CSA practices, we conducted a study with smallholder farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India. Among the CSA practices and technologies including use of improved crop varieties, laser <b>land</b> <b>levelling,</b> zero tillage, residue management, site specific nutrient management, and crop diversification, a majority of the farmers prefer to use improved crop varieties, crop diversification, laser <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> and zero tillage practice. We estimated the cost of adoption, change in yields and income for the implementation of three major CSA practices in rice- wheat system. The average cost of adoption were + 1, 402, + 3, 037 and - 1, 577 INR ha- 1 for the use of improved crop varieties, laser <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> and zero tillage respectively.

50|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} reclamation, the {{engineers}} did not understand enough about {{the ecology of the}} fens. The drying of the land caused the peat to shrink greatly, lowering the remaining land below the height of the drainage channels and rivers.

This continued until the development of steam-powered pumps in the early 19th century. The drop in the <b>land</b> <b>level</b> can be seen at the pumps near Ramsey Forty Foot, where animal-powered pumps, steam pumps and now fossil-fuel pumps are all co-located, at different heights.

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>levelling</b> is an {{important}} process of the agriculutral land consolidation projects. The <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> process starts by determining the appropriate levels of the terrain and solves the earthwork allocation for the predetermined terrain levels. The recent attempt, reported in the literature, to find an optimal process is a GIS-based approach which solves the transportation problem by determing the designed terrain level and optimal hauling distances that result in the lowest hauling cost. In this study, the Vogel approximation method (VAM) was adopted in initializing {{the solution to the}} transportation problems, and the optimizaion of the solutions obtained by the VAM was examined using the modified distribution method (MODI). To verify the reliability of this combined method, a case study was carried out based on the proposed land livelling project at the Lixian District of Beijing, China. The results show that the optimal average hauling distance calculated from the proposed linear programming model is 79. 53 m shorter than that estimated using the empirical method, and the unit cost calculated from the linear programming model is 33. 4 % lower than the experienced cost. The improvements in the optimization of the hauling distance show that the cost of the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>levelling</b> can be efficiently lowered if an appropriate linear programming model is used...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1970 s and 1980 s, the {{vineyard}} {{areas in the}} Mediterranean region of north east Spain have undergone profound transformation to allow greater mechanization.
