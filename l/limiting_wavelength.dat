40|$|Abstract. Line-driven winds, e. g., of OB stars, {{are subject}} to a strong {{hydrodynamic}} instability. As a corollary to the comprehensive linear stability analysis performed by Owocki & Rybicki (1984), we present here a simplified derivation of the growth rates from applying a second order Sobolev approximation. This is applicable for perturbation wavelengths larger than the Sobolev length, and covers the physically most interesting regime of perturbations which can develop into strong reverse shocks, and heat the gas to X-ray temperatures. Since the usual WKB approximation is not applied, we furthermore find {{the existence of a}} <b>limiting</b> <b>wavelength</b> beyond which perturbances do not grow, but instead decay.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the radio-astronomy field is given, and prospects ready for construction at NASA are presented. A very-long-baseline array consisting of ten 25 m antennas, with a <b>limiting</b> <b>wavelength</b> of 7 mm and an angular resolution at that wavelength of 2 x 10 to the 4 th arcsec is discussed. Eighty percent of the phase information will be obtained by closure around the 36 independent triangles, and high quality aperture-synthesis maps will be produced at all wavelengths. The 25 m telescope will be capable of several applications including the discovery of new molecules in our galaxy (in particular, the envelope of the evolved carbon star IRC + 10216), the detection of CO to distances of perhaps 100 million light years, and {{the understanding of the}} events which occur as stars are formed from molecular clouds, and as energy is fed back into the molecular gas by new stars.

40|$|FALCON {{airborne}} {{gravity gradient}} {{data can be}} converted to vertical gravity via direct integration techniques (Gunn, 1975) or equivalent source methods (Dampney, 1969), and hence compared with conventional gravimetry data. Either conversion process amplifies long wavelength features from the gravity gradient data and therefore makes regional scale features vulnerable to distortion. Recent FALCON surveys over areas with pre-existing ground gravity have allowed proper assessment of when conversion problems may arise. Comparison of FALCON and ground data from three different areas indicated that derived vertical gravity is very good at wavelengths less than the minimum survey dimension, spectral analysis showing errors are typically 0. 1 mGal / km for wavelengths below this limit. A similar analysis by Bruton et al. (2001), of profile gravity data from three airborne gravimetry systems, showed error of spectral character different to that achievable via FALCON, with steadily decreasing contribution to the total error from longer wavelengths. This independent analysis of the airborne gravity systems indicated that the <b>limiting</b> <b>wavelength,</b> beyond which airborne gravimetry profiles becomes more accurate than a detailed FALCON gradiometry survey data, is in the range 10 - 20 km. Regional-scale gravity databases, sparse marine track data, or satellite-derived gravity can be used to conform the FALCON gravity to the regional data beyond a certain wavelength. This overcomes the limitation of FALCON gravity at long wavelengths. Given typical survey dimensions of 10 - 100 km, and provided that the reliable range of wavelengths in the FALCON and regional data overlap sufficiently, it is possible to derive gravity data having errors of approximately 0. 1 mGal / km and sampling all features with wavelengths greater than 300 m...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We analyze <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> {{translation}} in all-optical, wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) wraparound mesh networks, where upto W wavelengths, each {{of which}} can carry one circuit, are multiplexed onto a network link. All-optical wavelength translators with a limited translation range permit an incoming wavelength to be switched only to a small subset of the outgoing wavelengths. Although more restrictive than full wavelength translation (which permits an incoming wavelength to be switched to any outgoing <b>wavelength),</b> <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> translation is a topic of recent study, since current practical wavelength translators are capable only of limited translation. We consider the case where an incoming wavelength can be switched to one of k (k = 2, 3) outgoing wavelengths (called the feasible wavelength set), and we obtain the prob-ability that a session arriving at a node at a random time successfully establishes a connection from its source node to its destination node. Our analysis captures the state of a feasible wavelength set at a network node, which allows us to obtain the probability of successfully establishing the circuit. Based on this probability y, we quantify the benefits of <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> translation by demonstrating that in mesh networks, it can obtain most of the performance advantages of full translation {{at a fraction of}} the cost. Our work is the first to analyze <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> translation for mesh networks under a probabilistic model, and accurately predicts the network performance over a wider range of network loads than previous works.

40|$|Aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) on synthetic opal was explored as a {{model system}} to understand the growth of ALD films on photonic crystals. Al 2 O 3 ALD was used to coat the silica spheres in synthetic opal with conformal Al 2 O 3 films. Using Al 2 O 3 ALD to modify the interstices of the opal allowed for the tuning of the position and intensity of the Bragg reflection from the opal structure. Numerical transfer matrix method (TMM) simulations were used to predict the optical effects from the modified photonic crystal. The TMM simulations assumed an ideal face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure with conformal Al 2 O 3 ALD on all surfaces. The experimental Bragg wavelengths from the Al 2 O 3 -coated photonic crystals were observed to shift to longer wavelength versus Al 2 O 3 ALD thickness before asymptotically reaching a <b>limiting</b> <b>wavelength.</b> This red shift was attributed to the higher effective refractive index produced when Al 2 O 3 ALD coats the SiO 2 spheres in the opal structure. The experimental and predicted Bragg wavelengths showed excellent agreement for thin Al 2 O 3 ALD films. This agreement indicated that the Al 2 O 3 ALD inside of the opal structure occurs conformally as assumed by the model. Differences between experiment and simulation were observed for high filling fractions of the opal structure. These discrepancies were attributed to a higher free volume in the opal structure than the free volume predicted by the fcc geometry. The reflectance of the Bragg peak also decreased versus Al 2 O 3 ALD thickness. This reduction in intensity was attributed to the decrease in the refractive index difference between the SiO 2 spheres and their surroundings. I...|$|E
40|$|Rossby {{waves are}} the slow {{atmospheric}} waves that propagate thousands of kilometres {{on the time}} scale of days and are associated with weather. The small amplitude linear theory of Rossby waves on the sphere goes back over two centuries to Laplace’s tidal equations and is today considered thoroughly understood. However, with a more realistic background flow that includes both the tropical trade winds and the midlatitude jetstream, the global wave theory has not been fully established. To study this problem, this thesis uses the rotating shallow water (RSW) equations on the sphere {{as a model for}} Earth’s atmosphere. The spectrum of the RSW equations is numerically computed using a Galerkin method. It is found that the Rossby spectrum of this global model consists of two parts that naturally correspond respectively to local tropical and midlatitude theories. The first part of the spectrum is the countably infinite set of discrete eigenmodes with arbitrarily small wavelength near the equator, consistent with the local tropical β-plane theory. These discrete modes however achieve only a finite <b>limiting</b> <b>wavelength</b> in the midlatitudes. To account for smaller scales in the midlatitudes, it is necessary to consider the continuous spectrum that results from regular singular points in the RSW operator arising from shear in the background flow. The regular singular points correspond to critical latitudes, which prevent wave propagation from the midlatitudes into the tropics. The numerical results are complemented by small wavelength asymptotics of ray theory and Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) analysis to gain an understanding of the local wave- length, amplitude and group velocity for Rossby waves. The global understanding of Rossby waves presented in this thesis is used to provide some explanation of the small number of Rossby modes found in long-term climatological observations of theatmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface of}} Titan {{represents}} the largest surface {{area in the}} solar system essentially unexplored, although recent observations from Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics have given perhaps the first low-resolution indications of its nature. Whilst early models citing global oceans have been all but abandoned, substantial bodies of liquid up to several hundred kilometers in extent are not precluded. if such reservoirs do exist then in the presence of any surface winds it is expected that wind-driven surface waves will be generated. As on Earth, gravity remains the dominant controlling factor for such waves, with surface tension and viscous effects only becoming significant below wavelengths of several centimeters, Empirical models used for terre strial wind-driven sea waves are adapted to investigate the properties of such waves on Titan using predicted parameters for Titan's liquids. Significant wave height, peak period, wavelength, phase speed, and wave steepness are predicted as a function of wind speed and liquid body extent. It is found that waves will grow to a limiting height, <b>limiting</b> <b>wavelength</b> and limiting period which are all inversely proportional to gravity. The limiting significant wave height under the action of a 1 m s(- 1) Titan wind over 50 km, for example, is predicted to be 0. 2 m compared to 0. 02 m On Earth under similar circumstances, More interesting, however, is the wave growth prior to this limiting value. A useful visualization is that surface waves on a Titan sea arising fi om surface wind speeds of 0. 3 and 1 m s(- 1) will resemble in scale waves on Earth generated by terrestrial winds of 1 and 3 m s(- 1) respectively. These particular Titan waves will have nearly 3 times the period and travel almost 3 times slower than the terrestrial waves, however. The wave parameters predicted in this work have potential surface mission implications for the European Space Agency's Huygens Probe which will land on Titan in 2004. Conversely, their measurement by instruments on board Huygens and NASA's Cassini spacecraft could yield important planetological information...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{performance}} comparison of resolution policies specific to optical burst switching is presented. A framework, based on a reduced-load approximation, is developed to estimate path blocking probabilities in an optical burst switched network of arbitrary topology, in which any combination of the following resolution policies is applied in a specific order: <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> conversion, burst deflection and burst segmentation. Our framework is used to compare the relative performance of each resolution policy for two sets of ingress and egress router pairs defined on the NSF network. With respect to the assumptions considered, it is shown that <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> conversion is more effective in reducing blocking relative to burst deflection if the maximum wavelength conversion radius is sufficiently large, otherwise burst deflection is more effective. Furthermore, <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> conversion or burst deflection are more effective in reducing blocking relative to burst segmentation. Burst segmentation is justified as a stand alone resolution policy; however, using burst segmentation to complement another resolution policy offers only a marginal reduction in blocking. Both just-in-time and just-enough-time scheduling is analyzed. Simulations are implemented to corroborate the accuracy of our framework and extensions...|$|R

40|$|Eolian saltation, the {{transport}} of sand by the wind, involves a variety of physical processes. A fundamental understanding of saltation requires an analysis starting from {{the level of the}} individual sand grain. The complexity of this nonlinear dynamical system compels us to divide the problem into more easily handled decoupled components: the saltating grain-bed impact process, the force of the wind on individual grains, the determination of the wind profile from the spatially averaged force of the moving grains on the air, and the formation of small-scale bedforms: ripples. The impact of a moving sand grain with a bed of sand is studied with two-dimensional dynamical computer simulations and an experiment propelling single grains onto a sand bed. We find that the result of the impact may be described in terms of the rebound of the incident particle and the ejection of bed grains. The bed grain ejections originate from a localized area around the impact point, and at steps in the surface (elevation changes of one grain diameter) which are more widely distributed; these surface steps we term brinks (downstream-facing) and anti-brinks (upstream-facing). A model for steady-state saltation is proposed which incorporates both aerodynamics and the mechanics of the grain-bed impacts, and balances the losses of saltating particles on impact with the bed by gains due to impact generated bed grain ejections. This model does not require data on blowing sand. Results are obtained which qualitatively agree with existing data. Quantitative tests will require new experiments. We argue that grain-bed impacts, not fluid stresses, are the means for entraining grains in steady-state eolian saltation. The development of sand surface topography is viewed as a result of surface grain transport (reptation) driven by the impact of high-energy saltating grains onto the bed. The collision and merger of small collections of sand, proto-ripples, lead to the asymptotic development of uniform ripples from an initially smoothed surface. The <b>limiting</b> <b>wavelength</b> is pictured as being determined by statistical fluctuations in the saltating impact flux and/or the shortening of the saltation shadow zone below the mean reptation length during a collision between two ripples. Field observations of developing ripple cross-sectional shapes confirm these ideas qualitatively, and rough calculations of limiting wavelengths agree with existing data. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Presented herein is a {{scalable}} {{framework for}} estimating path blocking probabilities in optical burst switched (OBS) networks where <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> conversion is possible. Although presented {{under the guise}} of OBS, it is pertinent to a broader class of optical networks based on the principle of bufferless unacknowledged switching. By applying the framework to the NSFNET topology, it is shown that even the most limited conversion range may reduce path blocking probabilities by several orders of magnitude, compared to no wavelength conversion. Moreover, counter to previous results derived for all-optical non-OBS networks with acknowledgement, OBS with full wavelength conversion achieves significantly lower blocking probabilities than OBS with <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> conversion when the conversion range is small. Underpinning the framework is a generalization of the classical reduced load approximation. Assuming links evolve independently of each other allows decoupling of the network into its constituent links. A set of fixed-point equations describing the evolution of each conversion range are then solved by successive substitution to estimate link blocking probabilities. Having these link blocking probabilities, path blocking probabilities are evaluated. The complexity of the framework is dominated by the wavelength conversion range and is independent of the number of wavelengths per link under certain symmetry conditions.

40|$|In the {{previous}} 20 years, wavelength conversion {{has received a}} considerable attention due to its strong influence on the blocking performance of wavelength-routed WDM networks. In a wavelength-routed WDM network, end users {{communicate with one another}} via all-optical WDM channels. In all-optical WDM channels optical fibre is used. Optical fibre is a single, hair-fine filament drawn from molten silica glass. These fibre are replacing metal wire as the transmission medium in high-speed, high-capacity communications systems that convert information into light, which is then transmitted via fibre optic cable. Wavelength converters help to reduce the blocking probability of the network and enhance the fibre utilization. Most of the related works focus on only one aspect of wavelength conversion, i. e., sparse or partial or <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> conversion. This paper will recommend the use of sparse-partial-limited wavelength conversion (SPLWC) integrating all approaches i. e. sparse or partial or <b>limited</b> <b>wavelength</b> conversion.
