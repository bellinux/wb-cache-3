After the amendment only a simple majority of participants in favour was required for the referendum to pass, while still having the requirement for turnout to be over 50%. To help reach the turnout requirement, the voting hours were extended, postal voting was allowed for 11 days before the referendum, and a second voting day was added. Parliament then set the date for EU referendum to be the 10–11 May and set the question for the vote.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} its {{tenure as}} a Soviet Socialist Republic, Lithuania's {{administrative}} divisions consisted of 44 regions, 12 cities, 80 towns, 19 settlements, and 426 rural districts. The reform of this system was an immediate concern for the new government. The Constitution of Lithuania, ratified in 1992, delegated the power of establishing future administrative units to the <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>Parliament</b> (Seimas). Accordingly, the Seimas passed two fundamental laws: a 1993 law on government representation and a 1994 law specifying the territorial-administrative units and their boundaries. The current system of a set of municipalities under 10 counties was codified by 1995. Several changes were made in 2000, resulting in 60 municipalities. Ordinary municipal councilors are elected every four years from electoral lists using proportional representation. The mayor, {{who is a member of}} the council, is elected directly by the residents in a majority vote. [...] Before 2015, the mayors were elected by the municipal councils.|$|E
500|$|Since Lithuania regained {{independence}} from the Soviet Union in 1991, the debate over Lithuanian participation in the Holocaust has been fraught with difficulty. Modern Lithuanian nationalists stress anti-Soviet resistance, but some Lithuanian partisans, seen in Lithuania as heroes {{in the struggle against}} Soviet occupation, were also Nazi collaborators who had cooperated in the murder of Lithuanian Jewry. The post-Soviet Lithuanian government has {{on a number of occasions}} stated a commitment to commemorating the Holocaust, combating antisemitism, and bringing Nazi-era war criminals to justice. The National Coalition Supporting Soviet Jewry have said [...] "Lithuania has made slow but significant progress in the prosecution of suspected Lithuanian collaborators in the Nazi genocide". Lithuania was the first of the newly independent post-Soviet states to legislate for the protection and marking of Holocaust-related sites. In 1995, president of Lithuania Algirdas Brazauskas speaking before the Israeli Knesset, offered a public apology to the Jewish people for the Lithuanian participation in the Holocaust. On 20 September 2001, to mark the 60th anniversary of the Holocaust in Lithuania, the Seimas (<b>Lithuanian</b> <b>parliament)</b> held a session during which Alfonsas Eidintas, the historian nominated as the Republic's next ambassador to Israel, delivered an address accounting for the annihilation of Lithuania's Jews.|$|E

5000|$|VLIK {{positioned}} {{itself as}} the <b>Lithuanian</b> Seimas (the <b>parliament)</b> and claimed that its executives were equivalent of a cabinet.
