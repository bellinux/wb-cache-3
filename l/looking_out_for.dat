At this point, Las Casas' fleet was caught in a sudden storm and wrecked upon the Honduran coast, killing some of Las Casas' men. The survivors were captured by Olid.|$|E
5|$|Robert rewarded Ranulf for {{his advice}} during the {{invasion}} by entrusting {{him with the}} administration of the see of Lisieux. After Robert's defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106, the bishop {{was among the first to}} make his peace with Henry, and returned to Durham. He retired from political life. Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf's time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> his own interests and those of his family.|$|E

On the January21 episode of Impact!, it was {{announced}} that Styles would face Joe for the title at Against All Odds. In the same telecast, Daniels accused Styles of trying to take his spot as the contender for the championship due to Styles having thrown in the towel for Daniels. Styles argued that he was instead <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Daniels' health in the storyline. The following week on the January28 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that the three would compete in a Three Way match for the title at the show. Joe retained the title at the spectacle.|$|E

Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
5|$|Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman) {{gave birth}} to Fenmore prematurely, and {{he was forced to}} remain in the {{hospital}} for a short time. Shortly after his birth, he was kidnapped, along with Phyllis Summers Newman (Michelle Stafford) and her daughter, Summer Newman, by Sheila Carter, who had had cosmetic surgery to look like Phyllis. All are rescued when Lauren tracked down Sheila and shot her. In 2012, Fenmore was sent to stay with his half-brother, Scotty Grainger, in Canada due to Lauren's fear that Daisy Carter (Yvonne Zima), Sheila's daughter, would end up harming him. Months later, Fenmore returns a moody teenager, kindling a friendship with a teenaged Summer. They became close and later began a relationship. When Summer began harassing a boy named Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo) online, Fenmore was against the idea, but when his father, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), began <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Jamie, he became jealous and took over the bullying by sending him harassing text messages from a disposable cell phone. Fenmore's jealously continued when Michael and Lauren had Jamie move in with them temporarily. He attempted to frame Jamie for stealing his mother's expensive decoration, and attempted to take pictures of him with the decoration on a rooftop. The boys struggled and Jamie was found face down in the snow below. He accused Fenmore of pushing him, Michael believed Jamie over his own son and he was arrested. However, Jamie later confessed that Fenmore did not push him and he was exonerated. Michael and Lauren's marriage suffered due to the bullying ordeal.|$|E

25|$|Virginians were {{intensely}} individualistic at this point, {{weakening the}} small new communities. According to Breen (1979) their horizon was {{limited by the}} present or near future. They believed that the environment could and {{should be forced to}} yield quick financial returns. Thus everyone was <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> number one {{at the expense of the}} cooperative ventures. Farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed. This extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the Indians, resulting in two massacres.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with general}} {{information}} on life for young men, Leykis's 101 advice mostly consists of his principles of <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> oneself. He {{argues that the}} institution of marriage is flawed and that family court systems are often corrupt because DNA testing after childbirth is not mandatory to prevent paternity fraud, and because courts have forced men to pay child support even after DNA testing has established that a man was not actually a child's father. Other examples of Leykis 101 guidelines include never dating single mothers or co-workers; never cohabiting with a woman; using birth control during each sexual encounter; and immediately ending a relationship if a woman issues an ultimatum.|$|E

In those days, marriages were performed while the bride and groom were very young, and Shamshad's parents were already <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a suitable alliance for her. Their efforts {{were on the verge of}} bearing fruit in 1934 when Ganpat Lal Batto and Shamshad made the decision to marry each other. In 1934, despite strenuous opposition from both their families due to religious differences, 15-year-old Shamshad got married to Ganpat Lal Batto. The couple were blessed with only a single child, a daughter named Usha, who in due course married a Hindu gentleman, Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Ratra, an officer in the Indian Army.|$|E
25|$|After the {{box office}} {{disaster}} of Kashyap's No Smoking, it was rumoured that United Television (UTV) had {{backed out of the}} director's next project, Dev.D, starring Abhay Deol. But, according to sources, UTV had signed Abhay for three projects and the actor had blocked dates from November 2007 to March 2008 for Kashyap's film, as the idea was to wrap up the film in one schedule. When Dev.D hit initial snags and was stalled, it was rumoured that UTV had backed out. At that time, the director denied these rumours. He explained the delay by saying that he was still <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> his Chandramukhi and had locked in Abhay and newcomer Mahi Gill. It was further delayed as he took more time to find an actress suitable for the role of Chandramukhi, which he eventually found with Kalki Koechlin, {{who was one of the}} last to be auditioned.|$|E

As a pleasant distraction, Carrisford and Ram Dass buy warm blankets, comfortable furniture, food, and other gifts, and secretly leave them in Sara's room when she is asleep or out. Sara's spirits and health improve due to the gifts she receives from her mysterious benefactor, whose identity she does not know; nor are Ram Dass and Carrisford aware that she is Crewe's lost daughter.

25|$|Snape first {{appears in}} Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, shortly after Harry arrives at Hogwarts. He is the school's Potions Master, {{though he is}} widely rumoured to covet the Defence Against the Dark Arts post. Snape himself {{confirms}} the rumour in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Snape is a sinister and malicious teacher who makes frequent snide and disparaging remarks at Harry's expense. He quickly becomes the primary antagonist of the book, as Harry suspects him of plotting to steal the philosopher's stone, and of attempting to kill him. Only {{the climax of the}} book reveals that Professor Quirrell, in league with Lord Voldemort, is the real enemy; Snape, suspicious of Quirrell, had been <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Harry throughout the book. In the final chapter, Dumbledore suggests that because Harry's father James had saved Snape's life when they were both students, even though the two detested each other, Snape felt responsible for Harry in return. As the final book reveals, this is not the full story. In any case, even after Quirrell's true role is revealed, Harry retains feelings of suspicion and resentment towards Snape, and their relationship remains tense. Snape's behaviour and attitude towards Harry also remain unchanged.|$|E

Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artist's final years, and he {{expressed}} dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only [...] "curiosities". While the poet Zhukovsky appreciated Friedrich's psychological themes, Dahl praised the descriptive quality of Friedrich's landscapes, commenting that [...] "artists and connoisseurs saw in Friedrich's art only a kind of mystic, because they themselves were only <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the mystic...
