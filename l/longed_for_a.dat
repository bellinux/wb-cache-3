25|$|From 1863 onwards, {{although}} Armstrong {{remained the}} head of his company, he became less involved in its day-to-day running. He appointed several very able men to senior positions and they continued his work. When he married, he acquired a house called Jesmond Dean (sic), which is now demolished, and {{not to be confused with}} the nearby Jesmond Dene House. Armstrong's house was to the west of Jesmond Dene, Newcastle, and thus not far from his birthplace, and he began to landscape and improve land that he bought within the Dene. In 1860 he paid local architect John Dobson to design a Banqueting Hall overlooking the Dene, which still survives. His house close to Newcastle was convenient for his practice as a solicitor and his work as an industrialist, but when he had more spare time he <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> house in the country.|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{have noted}} Andersen was {{attracted}} to {{both men and women}} during his middle years. Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager observes, [...] "Andersen's diaries leave no doubt that he {{was attracted to}} both sexes; that at times he <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> physical relationship with a woman and that other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men." [...] Andersen biographer Alison Prince comments, [...] "It is obvious that Andersen struggled throughout his life with a painful sense of greatness and of being different from others. This was partly due to the suppressed homosexuality which set him apart in loneliness and forced him to take refuge in the safer and more conventional image of the talented and hypersensitive poet..." [...] Both believe [...] "The Snowman" [...] has its source and inspiration in Andersen's relationship with a young male ballet dancer associated with the Royal Theater in Copenhagen.|$|E

Bartolomei decided to leave the soap in 2008, saying, [...] "It was a very difficult decision, from an actor's point of view it's not very often that you have the security that a job like Shortland Street provides. But after {{four and a half years}} I <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> degree of anonymity again. I'm a very private person, and given what I do for a job, the spectre of Shortland Street will invariably take that away from you." [...] The character was killed off in a dramatic gang storyline, something which producers at first thought would be [...] "unforgivable" [...] but which, due to Bartolomei's iinsistence on leaving, they went through with. Bartolomei said of the storyline, [...] "It's all a bit of fun and it's nice to see the characters away from the normal hospital setting and involved in something a little bit different," [...] and of the conclusion to Sarah and Craig's romance, [...] "That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way. There is a great deal of resolution at the end for everyone concerned." ...|$|E
