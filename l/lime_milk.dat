If such is the case, however, it is also possible and maybe even probable that Sally adapted the recipe already created by local sponge fishermen. Sponge fishermen spent many contiguous days on their boats, and stored their food on board, including nutritional basics such as canned milk (which would not spoil without refrigeration), limes and eggs.

40|$|The authors {{studied the}} effect of the process {{parameters}} (pH, concentration of Ca 2 +) on precipitation of humic acids contained in the filtrate of solid waste in the process of its decontamination using lime. The content of contaminants in the filtrate was monitored through the employment of well-known methodologies using methods of optical molecular and atomic spectroscopy; pH values were monitored through the employment of the potentiometric method. In some cases, chemical oxygen demand was measured to identify changes of the content of organic substances in the solution. Concentration of humic substances was identified by measuring the absorption spectra in the UV and in the visible range and by applying the calibration curve. Samples of humic and fulvic acids produced by Ecoanalitika Open Joint Stock Company were used for benchmarking purposes. The optimal amount of <b>lime</b> <b>milk</b> for the purpose of precipitation of humic substances in the filtrate is equal to 24 g/l. It is proven that any further increase of the <b>lime</b> <b>milk</b> flow is limited by the increase of the residual calcium concentration in the purified solution. Consumption of <b>lime</b> <b>milk</b> in the course of clarification of filtrates may be reduced by sharing it with calcium salts.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} develop a new, complex pig manure {{treatment}} and filtration process. The final scheme, called the AMAK process, comprised the following successive steps: mineralization with mineral acids, alkalization with <b>lime</b> <b>milk,</b> superphosphate addition, a second alkalization, thermal treatment, and pressure filtration. The proposed method produced a filtrate with 95 %, 80 %, and 96 % reductions in chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen content, and phosphorus content, respectively. An advantage of the proposed method was that it incorporated a crystalline phase into the solid organic part of the manure, which enabled high filtration rates (> 1000  kg m− 2  h− 1) and efficient separation. The process also eliminated odor emissions from the filtrate and sediment.

Increased dilution of the manure resulted in a reduced raw materials consumption ratio and improved filtration process efficiency, which ranged from 408 to 3765 kg/m 2 /h. The highest filtration efficiency was achieved using manure containing 3 % dry mass, while the lowest efficiency was observed in manure at 10 % dry mass. The increase in liquid manure dilution also reduced chemical oxygen demand in the filtrate, which ranged from 15 062 to 3656 mg/l.

40|$|Organic {{matter is}} an {{essential}} factor in controlling soil structure. To avoid the infection of soil with resistent germs {{it is necessary to}} sanitise the organic material before spreading on land. Most pathogens in the raw sewage are concentrated into the sewage sludge. They can be separated into four categories: viruses, bacteria, protozoa and larger parasites such as human roundworms, tapeworms and liver flukes. Such micro-organisms can cause disease in humans, the transmission occurring in several ways e. g. by inhaling sludge aerosols or dust, by eating vegetables or fruits contaminated by sludge, drinking water contaminated by run-off or by eating meat from livestock infected whilst grazing pastures fertilised with sludge. The presence of helminth eggs in urban sludge may constitute a sanitary risk when used as agricultural fertilizer. To avoid any contamination, the efficiency of a certain number of sludge sanitisation processes must be tested. One of these involves decontamination with quicklime.
