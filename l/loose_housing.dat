50|$|A key {{component}} of animal welfare is freedom to perform their innate (natural) behavior, and this is stated {{in one of the}} basic principles of organic agriculture. Also, there are other aspects of animal welfare to be considered - such as freedom from hunger, thirst, discomfort, injury, fear, distress, disease and pain. Because organic standards require <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> systems, adequate bedding, restrictions on the area of slatted floors, a minimum forage proportion in the ruminant diets, and tend to limit stocking densities both on pasture and in housing for dairy cows, they potentially promote good foot and hoof health. Some studies show lower incidence of placenta retention, milk fever, abomasums displacement and other diseases in organic than in conventional dairy herds. However, the level of infections by parasites in organically managed herds is generally higher than in conventional herds.|$|E
50|$|Bowden cables can {{cease to}} {{function}} smoothly, particularly if water or contaminants {{get into the}} housing. (Modern lined and stainless steel cables are less prone to these problems; unlined housings should be lubricated with a light machine oil.) In cold climates Bowden cable mechanisms are prone to malfunction due to water freezing. Cables also wear through use over a long time, and can be damaged through kinking or raveling. A common failure occurs on bicycles {{at the point where}} the housing enters a barrel adjuster; <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> ends tend to fray the housing, making adjustments uncertain. Fraying due to fatigue is most likely if the cable passes over a pulley, which on bicycles is often below the recommended diameter, or where the cable is bent repeatedly where it attaches to the brake lever or caliper. A cable passing around a sharp bend tend to furrow the inner cable sleeve, leading to contact with the outer housing and rub fraying. A frayed cable can suddenly break when force is applied strongly, e.g. during emergency braking.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} which elements that functioned in a positive way on the natural behaviors of dairy cattle among KRAV certificated and conventional farms. The study was based on reading of earlier research and completed by interviews with farmers, animal health inspectors and consumers. The results showed us that the KRAV certificated farms used only <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> barns and that the cattle were allowed a pasturetime of five months, or more, in one year. Our interviews with the consumers confirmed that KRAV was a well known trademark. The conventional farms were more flexible in their choice of housing systems, and used both <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> barns and barns with the cattle tethered. For those animals the pasturetime in one year were kept down to three to five months. During the interviews with the animal health inspectors it came to our knowledge that they valued elements as long pasturetime and <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> barns to support the natural behaviors of the animals. These factors also stood well in line with our own conclusions about what would function in a positive way on the natural behaviors of dairy cattle. This was confirmed not only by interviews but also by earlier research.

40|$|Abstract Background Newly weaned {{horses in}} Finland are often moved to {{unheated}} <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> systems {{in which the}} weanlings have free access to a paddock and a shelter. This practice {{is considered to be}} good for the development of young horses. The daily temperatures can stay below −  20  °C in Finland for several consecutive weeks during the winter season. However, the effect of unheated housing in a cold climatic environment on the respiratory health of weanlings under field conditions has not been studied before. This investigation was an observational field-study comprising 60 weanlings among 11 different voluntary participant rearing farms in Finland. Weanlings were either kept in unheated <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> systems (n =  36) or in stables (n =  24) and were clinically examined on two separate occasions 58  days apart in cold winter conditions. Results The odds of clinical respiratory disease were lower in the older foals (loge days); OR =  0. 009, P =  0. 044). The plasma fibrinogen concentration was higher when the available space (m 2 /weanling) in the sleeping hall was smaller (P =  0. 014) and it was lower when the sleeping hall was not insulated (P =  0. 010). The plasma fibrinogen concentrations at the second examination were lower with a body condition score above 3 (P =  0. 070). Standardbreds kept in <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> systems had a lower body condition score than Finnhorses or Standardbreds kept in stables at both examinations (P =  0. 026 and P =  0. 007, respectively).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} {{of some of the}} problems of uncertainty associated with the selection of farm dairy building in eastern Nebraska. Farm buildings are the second largest and the most long lasting investment made by farmers. Since such structures are built only infrequently, a wide general knowledge of the economics of farm building does not develop at the farm level. When construction errors, usually costly, occur, farmers may have to live with their mistakes for a considerable time before correction is economically feasible. Although risk and uncertainty surround the decisions regarding all farm enterprises, few require the long-term amortization period that buildings do. Adoption of loose walk-thru housing has become commonplace among dairymen in eastern Nebraska. A survey by the University of Nebraska in January 1959 indicated that 37 percent had already adopted the <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> barn and that by 1960 86 percent will use this type of building. This thesis is addressed to the problems associated with investing in a <b>loose</b> <b>housing</b> walk-thru barn. The analysis will be limited to consideration of the following objectives: 1.

40|$|In many countries, {{freedom of}} {{movement}} for animals outdoors in the summertime is important for animal welfare and grazing {{is a part of}} the concept in many cases. The Swedish Farm Animal Welfare Ordinance (SJVFS, 1988) stipulates that heifers and dairy cows shall be on pasture during the summer season. It further stipulates that the daily outdoor period shall include the hours between two milkings at the minimum. The ordinance is aimed at animal health and welfare, but ethical considerations and public opinion played important roles when the ordinance was instituted. Pasture offers an opportunity for animals to exercise, to strengthen hoofs and legs and to manifest a natural feed-searching and feed intake behaviour. Due to tradition, climatic conditions and herd structure, grazing of cows differs greatly throughout the world. It has been shown that exercise has a favourable effect on animal health. In a long-term experiment with tethered cows, exercise decreased the number of veterinary treatments and the occurrence of non-infectious hoof and leg disorders (Gustafson, 1993). Although it is difficult to compare the effects in a tethered system with a <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> system, it seems probable that there is a favourable effect of extra exercise also in a <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> system.

40|$|The {{number of}} suckler cows in Sweden has {{increased}} from 60 000 in the mideighties to 165 000 1995. By tradition {{the majority of the}} suckler cows are tied up in former milking cow barns during the winter season. These barns are insulated and ventilated, not very well maintained and very labour consuming. The interest and need for development of simple, rational and cheap systems of production systems for suckler cow has increased. This study comprises both a literature review and a field study. The literature review concerns the economy in suckler cow production as well as the origin of the cattle, ethology and their behaviour. It emphasizes the role of natural behaviour, because suckler cow production in more simple production systems and housing, to be successful, has {{to take advantage of the}} natural behaviour patterns in cattle at a great degree. The last and main part of the literature review concerns climate and ambient environment and the effect on cattle heat balance, possibilities for adjustment to cold and need for extra energy when the animals are exposed to low outside temperatures as well as wind and snow or rain. The literature review concludes that housing cattle outside or in simple sheds, results in a slightly higher feed consumption because of decreased digestibility of feed and because of demand of extra feed to maintain heat balance during cold periods. The literature review also shows that the suckler cow is well adjusted to stay outside or in simple sheds during the winter in Sweden if provided with sufficient feed. The field study includes material from visits at 50 suckler cow herds with different types of housing including insulated buildings with tied up cattle, different types of <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> systems, (cubicles, deep litter straw bedding etc) and even ranch systems without buildings. Geographically the herds are sited from Stockholm region to the southernmost province, Skåne. The herd size varied from 15 to 1000 suckler cows. Most of the herds had between 30 and 60 dams. The critical period in suckler cow production is the cold season combined with calving Then the demand on the thermal environment and intensity of labour is at its maximum. The question is how the producer can coop with these critical situations in an optimum way considering the animal and human wellfare. In the field study different aspects of this, such as technical, labour and animal environment, investment and feed costs, health and productivity where looked at. The results of the field study shows that suckler cow production under Swedish climatic and soil conditions can, maintained in low cost buildings with little input of labour and economic resources, still be far better than production in the traditional way in insulated houses and with tied up cows. In the field study, the following conclusions have been drawn: - Dividing the dams into groups, are at all forms of <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> systems important so that younger and weaker individuals do not loose weight and condition. The most suitable groups are pregnant heifers in one group, first time calvers and cows in bad condition in one group and older cows in good condition in one group. - Date of calving is not a factor that excludes simple non- insulated barns. Early calving is performed with good result except when calving outside especially when there is wet snow, which can cause loss of new-born calves. - Calving difficulties are much less in <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> systems compared to tied up systems. - There should be sufficient of calving boxes, preferably one box per 8 - 10 heifers and one per 15 - 20 cows. In tied up system the need for calving boxes are even bigger. - Calf cribs are well used by the calves. It should be placed in such a way that it provides the calves with a sheltered resting place and the space must be sufficient, at least 0, 6 m 2 per calf or bigger, It should also be placed near the cows, be easy to reach for the calves and free from draught. - Calf health is better in <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> systems where there are less animals per m 2 and the air volume per beast is greater than in tied up systems. - The working hours are more in a tied up system during the wintertime, 15 - 20 hours per cow compared to 8 - 14 hours per cow in a <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> system. - The need for checking and looking alter the cows and calves during the calving period is much greater in a tied up system than it is in a <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> system, but there is a greater demand in the stockman’s ability to take notice in his or her cattle in a <b>loose</b> <b>house</b> system. - When using existing buildings such as barns, one must be aware of the needs of reinforcement, particularly in the walls from animals and bedding. - When using straw bedding, the experience often is that the need of straw is very large and the work with the straw takes a great deal of time. There are great differences in the amount of straw that is needed depending on how many animals per m 2 there are, type of feed stuff, the quality of the straw and if there is an exercise yard connected to the bam. - Straw should, if possible, be kept under roof. It decreases the need of straw and makes it easier to use. The conclusion of this study throughout both literature and field studies, is that there are good possibilities in Sweden, to develop the more simple forms of housing with maintained or more likely enhanced health and well-being in the suckler cows and their calves, To be able to take in use more simple forms of housing for the suckler cows and by this lowering the costs, means greater possibilities for the suckler cow production to survive in the long run. Today there is no margin in the suckler cow production for any expensive investments...|$|R
