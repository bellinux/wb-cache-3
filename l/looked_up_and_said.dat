500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
2500|$|Accompanied by Waterbury police, four NYPD detectives {{arrived at}} Metesky's {{home with a}} search warrant shortly before midnight on Monday, January 21, 1957. [...] They asked him for a {{handwriting}} sample, {{and to make a}} letter G. [...] He made the G, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I know why you fellows are here. You think I'm the Mad Bomber." [...] The detectives asked what [...] "F.P." [...] stood for, and he responded, [...] "F.P. stands for Fair Play." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{influenced}} so greatly by {{a television show}} in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was Perry Mason … In one of the episodes, {{at the end of}} the episode … Perry said to the prosecutor, [...] "It must cause you some pain having expended all that effort in your case to have the charges dismissed." [...] And the prosecutor <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No. My job as a prosecutor is do justice and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and when an innocent man is not." [...] And I thought to myself that's quite amazing to be able to serve that role … ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Edmonstone was reluctant, but Amy <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> earnestly <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Yes, dear mamma, I {{should like}} to be alone a little while.' ...|$|R
6000|$|At the breakfast-table, {{when there}} came opportunity, she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> serenely <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Father, {{on second thought}} I will go the Bend, thank you!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "At 6:30 {{we arrived}} {{close to the}} beach. We could not quite get into the beach because of the {{obstacles}} that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> {{we are not going}} out that door; everybody over the side." [...] Unfortunately, the landing craft had stopped in water {{over the heads of the}} soldiers, most of whom were burdened down by packs and equipment. [...] Only by cutting loose their equipment and then swimming to shore could most of them avoid drowning.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you." [...] He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride.|$|E
2500|$|Towards evening a hawker named Gloster camped, as usual, at the station. When {{he went to}} {{the kitchen}} with his assistant, a station hand told him that the Kellys were there, to which Gloster replied, [...] "I wish they were, it would be £2,000 in my pocket." [...] Kelly <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "What is that you say?" [...] Gloster, without waiting to give an explanation, rushed towards the wagon, and Kelly and Joe Byrne {{followed}}. McCauley was worried for the safety of Gloster and followed them. Upon reaching his wagon, the hawker searched for his revolver, but was [...] "covered" [...] by the bushrangers, and McCauley threatened, [...] "Look out Gloster, you will be shot", at the same time appealing to Kelly not to shoot him. Gloster turned and said, [...] "Who are you?" [...] Kelly replied, [...] "I am Ned Kelly, son of Red Kelly, as good a blood as any in the land, and for two pins I would put a match to your wagon and burn it." [...] The stationhands, Gloster, and Beecroft were all placed in the storeroom, under guard. The Kellys stole new suits and a revolver from Gloster's stock as they wanted to look presentable at the bank. They offered the hawker money for them to which he refused. After sunset the hostages were allowed some fresh air. Time passed quietly until two o'clock in the morning, and at that hour the outlaws gave a peculiar whistle, and Steve Hart and Joe Byrne rushed from the building. [...] McCauley was surrounded by the bushrangers and Kelly said, [...] "You are armed, we have found a lot of ammunition in the house." [...] After this episode the outlaws retired to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a leading}} {{question}} which somewhat staggered me, but I said not a word; when, feeling of my calves, he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> incomprehensibly <b>said,</b> [...] "I am afraid you are not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I don't understand." [...] Mrs. Pendyce {{dropped her}} eyes, a flush {{came into her}} white cheeks; she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again <b>and</b> <b>said</b> quickly: [...] "George, I should like just a little bet on your horse--a real bet, say about a sovereign." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dan's {{eyes had}} been on the floor, and his hands nervously picking at the bit of wood he had been whittling as Mr. Bhaer came in, but when he heard the kind voice ask that question, he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> quickly, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in a more respectful tone than he had ever used before, ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped. The girl sat very quiet, with downcast eyes. As he kept {{silence for}} some time, she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> thoughtfully: ...|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel, {{wanting to}} finish his Times in peace, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with the gracious tone he always used to his brother's wife—- ...|$|E
6000|$|Still Lady Annabel {{continued}} sighing deeply: {{at length}} she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Does she love me? Do you think, after all, she loves me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my Leo, now indeed we are 'clad with splendour for a robe,' and now our fate draws near to its accomplishment. Then perchance {{will come}} the down-rushing of the night;" [...] <b>and</b> she sighed, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> tenderly <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "See, I am talking to thee in Arabic. Hast thou {{forgotten}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay," [...] said Mrs. Tucker, as {{the ringing}} of spurs and clatter of hoofs came from the corral. [...] "One moment." [...] She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> suddenly, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "How long had he known her?" [...] But before he could reply there was {{a step in the}} doorway, and the figure of Don Jose Santierra emerged from the archway.|$|R
6000|$|When Ronald {{had said}} his say, Lady Le Breton <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at last <b>and</b> <b>said</b> simply, with a pretended yawn, 'Now, Ronald, {{will you go}} to your own room?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom {{was silent}} a few moments, looking {{on the ground}} and frowning, with his hands in his pockets. At last he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> coldly,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the fifth}} head which had popped in during the last half-hour; but Mrs. Jo was used to it, so she <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> briskly, ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brooke <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> quickly, [...] "Young {{ladies in}} America love {{independence}} {{as much as}} their ancestors did, and are admired and respected for supporting themselves." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would have}} been much nicer if Kate would have <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> readily, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} kind <b>and</b> friendly; but the fit of awkwardness had come over her again, and with it a thought so selfish, that it can hardly be called otherwise than naughty--namely, that grown-up people in trouble were very tiresome, and never let young ones have any fun.|$|R
6000|$|When {{she entered}} the library Osborn was {{studying}} some documents. He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> impatiently, <b>and</b> she <b>said,</b> [...] "I was at Mireside. Railton's no better and is much disturbed about his lease." ...|$|R
6000|$|She read it half aloud, {{mingled with}} commentary, as she proceeded, and {{once or twice}} came to a pause over an {{illegible}} word, on which occasions her visitor helped her to the word without looking at the letter. This circumstance struck her at last as somewhat singular, for she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> suddenly, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You appear, sir, {{to be familiar with}} the contents of my letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I CAN do that," [...] she said. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> {{a little}} breathlessly, [...] "I'm sorry, aunt, but I don't think I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After a bit he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I {{had promised}} myself never again to {{interfere}} in Lady Harry Norland's affairs. You wish me to read this document, Mrs. Vimpany?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{in a rich}} {{low voice}} {{that in some way}} {{reminded}} me of honey being poured from a jar, perhaps because it was thick with strangled sobs: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{seemed to}} be pausing over the record of his sister's birth and marriage, {{as if it were}} {{suggesting}} new thoughts to him; then he suddenly <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at Tom, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in a sharp tone of alarm: ...|$|R
6000|$|We sat {{over the}} fire in the evening, and talked a little of surface things, but that died away, and after {{a quarter of an hour}} or so, he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at me <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "And what next?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Frank {{was silent}} for a few minutes as he sat with downcast eyes, absorbed in meditation. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> suddenly, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Joe, I'll give you a {{definite}} answer to that question to-morrow morning. To-night I will think over it and make arrangements. Meanwhile, let it suffice that I have made up my mind to go to the diggings, and if you remain in the same mind to-morrow, come here all ready for a start." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Englishman {{listened with}} downcast looks, {{as one who}} doubted, yet was not unwilling to receive conviction. At length he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "May I see your sick squire, fair sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For God's sake, don't let us {{have that}} story, man! I heard enough of it at Plymouth!" [...] said Amyas, in so {{disturbed}} a tone that mine host <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to himself-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It was Gabriel's turn to {{hesitate}} {{and look at}} his companion. But Jack was gazing into the street below. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We must go on now, Gabriel,--for--for they've got a ladder!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{this state}} she was {{conveyed}} to Black's cottage {{and handed over}} to Jean, whom every one seemed intuitively to regard as her natural comforter. The poor child led her into her own room, sat down {{beside her on the}} bed, laid the aged head on her sympathetic bosom and sobbed as if her heart was breaking. But no response came from the old woman, save that once or twice she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> feebly <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Jean, dear, what ails ye?" ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{evening when}} we were thus promenading, and I was trying {{to look like a}} prize St. Bernard, and the old man was trying to look like he wouldn't have murdered the first organ-grinder he heard play Mendelssohn's wedding-march, I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at him <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in my way: ...|$|R
6000|$|And just then, to Kate's great wonder, in came Lady Jane, {{though it}} was full half an hour earlier than she usually left her room; <b>and</b> Lady Barbara <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to her, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> quite as if excusing herself, [...] "Indeed, Jane, I have not been angry with her." ...|$|R
