50|$|In 1736, Ann {{petitioned the}} General Assembly <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island, seeking {{printing}} work {{in order to}} support her family. She was awarded the contract, becoming the General Assembly's official printer to the colony, a position she held until she died. In this official capacity, she printed the colony's charter granted by Charles II of England. To supplement her income, she printed sermons for ministers, advertisements for merchants, as well as popular British novels. Ann's most notable work was compiling and publishing five editions <b>of</b> the <b>Rhode</b> Island Almanack, for the years 1737-1741. In 1741, she began selling her brother-in-law Benjamin's alamanac, Poor Richard's Alamanac, and in 1745, she printed 500 copies of the Acts and <b>Laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island as a folio edition, her largest commission.|$|R

In 1900, the laws having been altered and amended, she revised the pamphlet, and it was published by the Rhode Island State Federation of Women's Clubs under the title, [...] "Legal Status <b>of</b> Women in <b>Rhode</b> Island, 1900," [...] with a preface concerning the sweeping legislation for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island wives.|$|R

50|$|In 2003, Lincoln Park and two {{executives}} were indicted on federal charges {{related to an}} alleged scheme in 2000 and 2001 to pay up to $4 million to the <b>law</b> firm <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island House Speaker John Harwood to gain support for {{an expansion of the}} track's slot parlor, and to block a rival casino proposed by the Narragansett Indian Tribe. In the wake of the accusations, Governor Donald Carcieri demanded that the track be sold to new owners before negotiations could continue on the proposed expansion. A bidding war for Wembley ensued between MGM Mirage and BLB Investors (a partnership of the Waterford Group, Kerzner International, and Starwood Capital). BLB made the winning offer of $553 million in May 2004, but withdrew from the deal just two months later due to concerns about potential competition from the Narragansett casino. A new agreement was later reached for BLB to buy Wembley's five American race tracks, including Lincoln, for a total of $455 million, and the sale closed in July 2005.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, Beverly Hodgson '70 was {{acclaimed}} by {{the press}} as [...] "First Woman Editor of Ivy League Daily" [...] (and coincidentally later married the nephew of Audrey Mishel, the woman editor of the Herald-Record of World War II), and with her managing editor, another woman, Laura Hersh '70, got The Herald out from its new offices at 195 Angell Street. In 1973, The Brown Daily Herald Voluntary Publishing Association, which took in outside printing jobs as well as publishing The Herald, was facing financial difficulties after purchasing typesetting equipment. The solution was the founding of Fresh Fruit, a college-oriented tabloid with distribution to eight college campuses {{and the potential for}} generating advertising income. Its first appearance was in The Brown Daily Herald of February 15, 1973. In February 1975, an editorial staff separate from that of The Herald took over the publication of Fresh Fruit. The Herald, still in debt after a 1974 operating loss of $10,000, began an alumni subscription drive, filed claims against its creditors, and sought incorporation under the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island. With the Commencement issue of 1975, The Brown Daily Herald Voluntary Publishing Association became The Brown Daily Herald, Inc. In 1985, The Herald entered into a contract with the Undergraduate Council of Students, in which UCS agreed to purchase 5,500 subscriptions at five dollars each for every member of the student body, though UCS later cancelled this contract and The Herald has been free since. A weekend insert called Good Clean Fun was added in 1986. In September 1989, a new supplement, intended to be monthly, appeared under the title, In Depth. Editor-in-chief of The Herald Amy Bach expressed the hope that the new supplement would serve as a forum for the thorough exploration of one topic each month. The first issue was devoted to articles on depression, the second to Providence's neighborhoods. On November 2, 1991, The Brown Daily Herald held a one-hundredth anniversary celebration, at which William Kovach was the keynote speaker.|$|R

40|$|Roger Williams is {{generally}} {{recognized as the}} founder <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island. Although his settlement of Providence in 1636 {{was not the first}} or only settlement in the area, he was able to open the whole region to English settlement. Due to his friendship with local Indians and knowledge of their language he obtained land from the Indians and assisted other settlers in doing the same. When Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 because of his rejection of Puritanism, his friend, Governor John Winthrop, suggested that he start a new settlement at Narragansett Bay. Founders of other early settlements also migrated from the Massachusetts colony seeking religious freedom. Rhode Island began as four separate towns, which were not incorporated until a joint government was formed in 1647, under the “Incorporation of Providence Plantations,” or Charter of 1644. Until the granting <b>of</b> that charter, <b>Rhode</b> Island had no authority to exist as an English colony. The official name of the state remains today “Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. ” Rhode Island refers to Aquidneck Island, the location of the present-day towns of Portsmouth, Middletown, and Newport. According to Howard Chapin’s Documentary History <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island, “the earliest appearance <b>of</b> the name <b>Rhode</b> Island as the designation of the island of Aquidneck is in a letter from Roger Williams to Deputy Governor John Winthrop [...] . which from its context was evidently written in the spring of 1637. ” As described below, the Island {{was one of the first}} areas in the Colony to be settled. Providence Plantations refers to early settlements at the northern end of the Narragansett Bay, in Providence and the surrounding area. The word plantation has the meaning of a settlement in a new country or region: colony. Parts II, III, and IV of this paper consist of bibliographic essays covering three main periods in the early development of the Colonial government and legal institutions <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island: 1636 - 1647, the formation of the four original towns and their consolidation under a Parliamentary Patent, or Charter; 1647 - 1663, government under the Code of 1647 and the issuance of a Royal Charter; and 1663 - 1776, governance under the Royal Charter and the deterioration of relations with the monarchy leading to a declaration of independence. While the history <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island is fascinating, only the bare essentials are provided in this article, sufficient to explain the background and context in which legal institutions developed in the Colony. Part V deals with legislative documents and includes a bibliographic listing of important legislative documents of the colonial period. Part VI addresses the early development <b>of</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island’s court system, and includes a bibliographic listing of both primary and secondary sources on the history of the courts. The conclusion provides a list of additional sources for researching the history, government, and <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> colonial <b>Rhode</b> Island, including archival collections in the state...|$|R
