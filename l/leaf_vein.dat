5000|$|In plant {{anatomy and}} {{evolution}} a microphyll {{is a type}} of plant leaf with one single, unbranched <b>leaf</b> <b>vein.</b> [...] Plants with microphyll leaves occur early in the fossil record, and few such plants exist today. In the classical concept of a microphyll, the <b>leaf</b> <b>vein</b> emerges from the [...] protostele without leaving a leaf gap. Leaf gaps are small areas above the node of some leaves where there is no vascular tissue, as it has all been diverted to the leaf. Megaphylls, in contrast, have multiple veins within the leaf and leaf gaps above them in the stem.|$|E
50|$|Acarodomatia (singular Acarodomatium) (Latin: Acari - mites, domus - dwelling), are tussocks of hairs or nonglandular trichomes {{located in}} pits {{situated}} in major <b>leaf</b> <b>vein</b> axes of many plant species, occupied and caused by predatory and mycophagous mites.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondria were {{prepared}} from roots, stalks, leaves, and <b>leaf</b> <b>veins</b> of spinach. The mitochondrial preparations were examined {{for their ability}} to oxidize glycine via the respiratory chain. It is shown that the glycine-oxidizing capacity is restricted to photosynthetically active tissue. The activity is present in mitochondria from the green parts of the leaves, but not in mitochondria from roots, stalks, or <b>leaf</b> <b>veins...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>veins</b> prominent, {{raised and}} evident {{on both sides}} of the <b>leaf.</b> Net <b>veins</b> {{attractive}} in pattern and shape near the leaf edge. 8 to 10 lateral veins, creamy green at around 60 degrees to the mid vein.|$|R
50|$|Leaf venation {{includes}} a looping intermarginal vein, well {{removed from the}} leaf's edge. A second intermarginal <b>leaf</b> <b>vein</b> is present, closer to the leaf edge. The midrib vein is sunken on the lower surface, but slightly raised above.|$|E
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} reared on Smilax tamnoides. They skeletonize the {{underside}} of a leaf of their host plant from within a black, frass-covered silken tube.placed alongside a <b>leaf</b> <b>vein.</b> The larvae are pale green with a pale brownish-yellow head.|$|E

50|$|Halberd willow and Barclay willow {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} and distribution, and misidentifications {{have been reported in}} some cases in Alaska; the two species can be distinguished by the presence of sparse reddish hairs on the main <b>leaf</b> <b>vein</b> of Halberd willow. These two species of willow can also form natural hybrids with each other.|$|E
50|$|An intra-marginal <b>leaf</b> <b>vein</b> {{is usually}} absent. Leaves are without toothed edges and have only 5 to 8 lateral veins, only {{visible on the}} underside. Gossia acmenoides and Gossia bidwillii have 15 to 20 lateral veins. Regeneration is {{difficult}} from seed, and cuttings seldom strike. The former habitat is now mostly destroyed for housing and agriculture.|$|E

50|$|Leaves are stalked (with petiole), narrow-lanceolate to lanceolate, to 14 x 1.8 cm, concolorous, dull, {{light green}} or slate grey. The intramarginal vein (obvious on most {{eucalypt}} leaves as the <b>leaf</b> <b>vein</b> that lies {{close to the}} leaf margin in a circumferential way) is markedly distant from the leaf margin in this species. This occurs in both adult and juvenile leaves.|$|E
50|$|The base of {{the leaf}} is often oblique, that is of being of unequal length {{on either side of}} the leaf stem. Leaf venation is more evident under the leaf. An {{identifying}} feature is the intramarginal <b>leaf</b> <b>vein,</b> which starts at the leaf base and travels on either edge of the leaf. Of a distance of a quarter to a half of the length of the leaf.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Convolvulaceae species, {{including}} Ipomoea batatas, Convolvulus arvensis, Merremia quinquefolia and Ipomoea aquatica. First instar larvae {{create a}} tunnel of silk along the <b>leaf</b> <b>vein</b> and feeds underneath {{on the surface}} tissue. The second instar larvae move to the upper leaf surface and fold the leaf, feeding within the fold until the green tissues are consumed, when it moves to another leaf.|$|E

50|$|Leaves are ovate to {{elliptic}} in shape. 4 to 10 cm long, and 1.2 to 4.5 cm wide. Opposite on the stem, {{with smooth}} edges. Thick, not glossy and hairless. Paler below {{with a short}} leaf tip. Leaf stems 5 to 15 mm long. The main <b>leaf</b> <b>vein,</b> the mid rib is raised on the top side with a noticeable channel.

Toothed or without teeth, 4 to 9 cm long, and 1 to 2.5 cm wide. The main midrib {{of the leaf}} is raised on both sides, as are the many lateral veins. Domatia often occur where the main <b>leaf</b> <b>vein</b> meets the lateral veins. This distinguishes this species from Cupaniopsis serrata and Cupaniopsis flagelliformis.|$|E
