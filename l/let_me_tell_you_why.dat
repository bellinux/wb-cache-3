60|$|I {{bought a}} house in a hurry in the city of Oakland some time ago. I do not live in it. I sleep in it half a dozen times a year. I do not love the house. I am hurt every time I look at it. No drunken rowdy or {{political}} enemy can insult me so deeply as that house does. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why.</b> It is an ordinary two-storey frame house. After it was built, the criminal that constructed it nailed on, at the corners perpendicularly, some two-inch fluted planks. These planks rise the height of the house, and to a drunken man have the appearance of fluted columns. To complete the illusion {{in the eyes of the}} drunken man, the planks are topped with wooden Ionic capitals, nailed on, and in, I may say, bas-relief.|$|E

He was rich, she poor and proud; ambition made her wicked, and she did it after being warned that, though he might escape, his children were sure to inherit the curse, for when one generation goes free it falls more heavily upon the rest. She knew it all, and yet she married him. I have her to thank for all I suffer, and I cannot love her though she is my mother. It may be wrong to say these things, but they are true; they burn in my heart, and I must speak out; for I tell you {{there comes a time}} when children judge their parents as men and women, in spite of filial duty, and woe to those whose actions change affection and respect to hatred or contempt." ...|$|E

You would have looked in the glass when you were alone; you would have looked at your shapely hands and feet, and the shadows would have crossed your pretty face. [...] "Yes," [...] you would have said to yourself--"John is a dear, kind fellow, and I love him very much, and all that, but--" [...] and the old dreams, dreamt in the old low-ceilinged kitchen before the dying fire, would have come back to you, and you would have been discontented then as now, only in a {{different}} way. Oh yes, you would, Cinderella, though you gravely shake your gold-crowned head. And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why.</b> It is because you are a woman, and the fate of all us, men and women alike, is to be for ever wanting what we have not, and to be finding, when we have it, that it is not what we wanted. That is the law of life, dear. Do you think as you lie upon the floor with your head upon your arms, that you are the only woman whose tears are soaking into the hearthrug at that moment? My dear Princess, if you could creep unseen about your City, peeping at will through the curtain-shielded windows, you would come to think that all the world was little else than a big nursery full of crying children with none to comfort them. The doll is broken: no longer it sweetly squeaks in answer to our pressure, [...] "I love you, kiss me." [...] The drum lies silent with the drumstick inside; no longer do we make a brave noise in the nursery. The box of tea-things we have clumsily put our foot upon; {{there will be no more}} merry parties around the three-legged stool. The tin trumpet will not play the note we want to sound; the wooden bricks keep falling down; the toy cannon has exploded and burnt our fingers. Never mind, little man, little woman, we will try and mend things tomorrow.|$|E

(Barnett 2003) The invasion of Iraq by the US and UK {{was the subject of}} a seemingly unending stream of official justifications. Careening through the media like so many crash-test dummies, they ranged from narrowly nationalist calls for self-defense to apocalyptically universalist speeches about ridding the world of evil. Giving coherence to these trial-and-error efforts at legitimation was a freshly explicit American unilateralism that unsettled global business elites as much as it inspired an emergent global peace movement. Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, apparently upset many of the secular evangelists of globalization at the World Economic Forum by appearing as a newly authoritarian and US-centric incarnation of “Davos Man ” (Landler 2003).

40|$|Hollywood—that {{seller of}} dreams—has filled our heads with an American-exceptionalism-esque {{belief that we}} are entitled, even obligated, to strive and {{ultimately}} triumph when we are clearly outmanned, outgunned, and outclassed. Melanie Griffith lands her dream job in Working Girl. The Pretty Woman is rescued by a (metaphorical) knight on a white horse. The nerds of Tri-Lambs get their revenge and defeat the other fraternity. Sure, Rocky, the Bad News Bears, and the Spartans all lose but what we remember is how hard they tried. Hollywood has successfully promulgated the values of having heart and dreaming big, not only for Americans or even the West, but ultimately for everyone. If we use that cultural framing, {{maybe some of the}} things that the design communities are spending time on would make more sense. By “design communities ” I’m referring to the software and product people—industrial designers, user experience designers, interaction designers, information architects, content strategists, and what have you. I’ll even throw my tribes in there: user researchers, ethnographers, and strategists. Lately, these folks—us—are taking on audaciously challenging problems. The sexiest endeavors are those tackling the systemic “wicked problems ” in government, healthcare, education, homelessness, civic life, and beyond. Of course the genuine passion and compassion is to be commended, but I’m feeling worried. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why.</b> Copyright © 2012 - 2013, Usability Professionals ’ Association and the authors.

40|$|Are {{there any}} new facts in Neurosciences that would compel a {{reasonable}} fellow like Socrates {{to accept the}} theory which says that as the strings of the lyre produce the sounds of music, so does his brain produce his joy at the (defunct {{if he were to}} accept the theory) possibility of going, once again, after sunset, to join his god?” I am re-stating the question as it stands in the opening page of this symposium because I think that particular phrasing reflects some of the interesting problems associated with the theme of consciousness. I see at least two, and possibly three, separate questions within it: (1) are there any facts in Neuroscience that would support the view that the brain causes consciousness? (2) is it likely that Socrates will be convinced by them? (3) if he were convinced, would this affect his experience of joy? In complying with the request to remain within the scope of the question, I will only address the first two and leave the third for later, if at all. To save you the suspense however, the short answers are 'yes', 'probably not', and 'definitely not'. The reason I have slightly reformulated the question is because I suspect the view -on the relationship between brain and consciousness - {{has little to do with}} the 'brave new world of neuroscientific facts', or any other world of facts for that matter. It seems to me that one's position on the graded continuum of opinions about consciousness (as for other controversial and emotionally charged issues such as politics, euthanasia, environmental ethics, abortion, animal rights, etc) is not based on strictly rational arguments or proven facts, but rather stems from a set of beliefs that each one of us have, a set of beliefs which has evolved through nothing more specific than having lived a life, read certain books, conversed with certain people and a range of other factors, most of us would be hard-pressed to identify. The arguments exist of course, but they come later. This view that the brain generates consciousness (as already indicated in the introductory statement) has existed at least since Hippocrates and has been endorsed by varying and altogether probably small proportions of the general public. What's new in our time is that science in general, and neuroscience in particular, is in the position to provide further and stronger arguments to support that view. Science, because it increasingly takes for its legitimate topic of study, mysteries of nature that were previously considered approachable only by philosophy or religion. Neuroscience, because of the ever-increasing wealth of empirical findings on the amazing and wonderful things that brains, or even their isolated parts, are capable of. And also partly because of the emergence of new techniques of literally 'looking into' a living, working, human brain. A final (and hopefully unnecessary) clarifying point: Having such beliefs is more or less inevitable, is part of the human condition, and does by no means imply we can not engage in rational discourse, put our beliefs to the test, be scientific in our method of inquiry, or change our minds as new facts comes along. It does however mean that it is rather unlikely that someone will alter their set of beliefs on the basis of non-factual arguments, however convincing these may seem to the converted. The same 'evidence' will be corroborating for some and irrelevant to others. So to return to the theme of the Symposium, if the question we have been invited to debate is “are there any neuroscientific facts (the way that 'DNA -> RNA -> protein', or 'neurotransmitter binds to receptor and causes synaptic transmission' are facts) that would prove unequivocally that subjective experiences are caused by the brain”, the answer is easy and obvious: No. End of story. But since I do believe that this is most likely to be the case, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why.</b> I will discuss the relevant arguments in 3 sections: those that are based on facts that neuroscience has taught us, those that are more general (some might call them philosophical), and those that are based on the history of science...|$|E
