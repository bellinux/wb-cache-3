5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style {{to be much more}} open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear <b>line</b> <b>style.</b> Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique with a lot of character.|$|E
5|$|As with {{at least}} 4% of Méliès's output (including major films such as The Kingdom of the Fairies, The Impossible Voyage, and The Barber of Seville), some prints of A Trip to the Moon were {{individually}} hand-colored by Elisabeth Thuillier's coloring lab in Paris. Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified. Each worker was assigned a different color in assembly <b>line</b> <b>style,</b> with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. On average, Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of a film.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale, production-line {{manufacturing}} {{of affordable}} cars {{was started by}} Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly <b>line</b> <b>style</b> of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U.S. by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world's first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.|$|E

25|$|By {{assuming}} {{only one}} {{program would be}} running at a time, the engineers were able to ignore the concept of reentrancy; the ability for a program (or library) to be stopped at any point, asked to do something else, {{and then return to}} the original task. In the case of QuickDraw for example, this means the system can store state information internally, like the current location of the window or the <b>line</b> <b>style,</b> knowing it would only change under control of the running program. Taking this one step further, the engineers left most of this state inside the application rather than in QuickDraw, thus eliminating the need to copy this data between the application and library.|$|E
