This article describes the rules under US law for <b>lobbying</b> by nonprofit organizations. The 2 most common kinds of non-profits working to improve the public's health are "public charities" and "social welfare organizations. " Although social welfare organizations may engage in relatively unlimited <b>lobbying,</b> public charities may not engage in "substantial" <b>lobbying.</b> <b>Lobbying</b> is divided into 2 main categories. Direct <b>lobbying</b> refers to communications with law-makers that take a position on specific legislation, and grassroots <b>lobbying</b> includes attempts to persuade members of the general public to take action regarding legislation. Even public charities may engage in some direct <b>lobbying</b> and a smaller amount of grassroots <b>lobbying.</b> Much public health advocacy, however, is not <b>lobbying,</b> since there are several important exceptions to the <b>lobbying</b> rules. These exceptions include "non-partisan analysis, study, or research" and discussions of broad social problems. <b>Lobbying</b> with federal or earmarked foundation funds is generally prohibited...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} citizen-candidate model of {{representative}} democracy with endogenous <b>lobbying.</b> We find that <b>lobbying</b> induces policy compromise and always affects equilibrium policy outcomes. In particular, even though the policy preferences of <b>lobbies</b> are relatively extreme, <b>lobbying</b> biases {{the outcome of the}} political process toward the centre of the policy space, and extreme policies cannot emerge in equilibrium. Moreover, in equilibrium, not all <b>lobbies</b> participate in the policy-making process. Endogenous <b>lobbying,</b> citizen-candidate model, representative democracy. ...|$|R

We determine the <b>lobbying</b> equilibrium and discuss the resulting emission level. In many cases, a higher effectiveness of private <b>lobbying</b> is detrimental for firms and beneficial for environmental quality, as it induces firms to turn towards excessive amounts of relatively unproductive private <b>lobbying.</b> environmental regulation, pollution standards, interest groups, <b>lobbying,</b> policy making...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the general-equilibrium effects of declining import prices on import and export industries’ <b>lobbying.</b> Different {{from the existing}} literature, our model endogenizes the emergence of <b>lobbying</b> groups, as <b>lobbying</b> requires both money to “buy access” to policymakers and management time to utilize it. A decline in the import good’s world price leads to an immediate rise in <b>lobbying</b> by the import industry. Over time, however, this initial <b>lobbying</b> surge diminishes and <b>lobbying</b> might become less than before the price fall. The export industry <b>lobbies</b> more over time in spite of benefiting from a higher relative price. ...|$|R

When regional <b>lobbies</b> have conflicting interests, then <b>lobbying</b> is less damaging for social welfare under centralization than under decentralization. On the contrary, when regional <b>lobbies</b> have aligned interests, then <b>lobbying</b> is less damaging for social welfare under decentralization, provided that policy spillovers on the non-organized groups are not too strong.

40|$|Effective {{functioning}} of the <b>lobbying</b> phenomenon facilitates economic development for every country. However this form of political participation can weaken economic growth {{if it is not}} properly controlled. In order to do that the Polish Parliament passed the Law on <b>lobbying.</b> This act introduced new legal terms (<b>lobbying</b> activity, professional <b>lobbying</b> activity) and new institutions (the Polish <b>Lobbying</b> Register, the Legislative Work Programme, a public hearing). It turned out that this statute had been a total failure in practice. Although many entities entered into the Polish <b>Lobbying</b> Register, there were few professional <b>lobbying</b> activities exercised in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, the Ministries, the Sejm and the Senate between 2006 and 2010.

40|$|We {{investigate}} policy {{reform in}} a model {{in which there are}} both rent seeking and <b>lobbying</b> activities.

As a result, any analysis of the role of <b>lobbying</b> in migration should not focus on PAC contributions alone. Comparing <b>lobbying</b> on migration and trade, we find that substantially more resources are spent on the latter than on the former.
