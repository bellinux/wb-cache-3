5|$|After it {{fell into}} disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left {{a series of}} runic {{inscriptions}} on the stone walls of the chamber, {{some of which were}} <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> group of crusaders in the winter of 115354. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with {{their backs to the}} river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish army, led by Francisco Verdugo, with Lieutenant-Colonel Johann Baptista von Taxis {{as second}} in command, was {{deployed}} before {{the village of}} Noordhorn and behind broken ground with only one access point that was covered by a wide ravine and flanked on its <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of muddy ditches. Aiming to create a trap for Norreys' army, the Spanish had smoothed the ground on their right in order to funnel English units and draw Norrey's troops into an engagement area where a crossfire effect could be created. Verdugo himself drove two stakes into the ground to mark the point that his cavalry was to charge upon the English vanguard.|$|E

5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E
5|$|The initial Russian position, which {{stretched}} {{south of}} the new Smolensk Highway (Napoleon's expected route of advance), was anchored on its <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pentagonal earthwork redoubt erected on a mound {{near the village of}} Shevardino. The Russian generals soon realized that their left wing was too exposed and vulnerable. So the Russian line was moved back from this position, but the Redoubt remained manned, Kutuzov stating that the fortification was manned simply to delay the advance of the French forces. Historian Dmitry Buturlin reports that it was used as an observation point to determine the course of the French advance. Historians Witner and Ratch, and many others, reported it was used as a fortification to threaten the French right flank, despite being beyond effective reach of guns of the period.|$|E
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back {{was written by}} Josh Mancell from Mutato Muzika, while the sound effects were created by Universal Sound Studios (consisting of Mike Gollom, Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears). The {{characters}} were designed by Charles Zembillas of American Exitus, Incorporated. Clancy Brown provided the voice of Doctor Neo Cortex, while Brendan O'Brien voiced the dual role of Crash Bandicoot, Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nitrus Brio and Vicki Winters voiced Coco Bandicoot. The game was unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia in June 1997 to a positive response from the game industry. The game went into the alpha stage in August 1997. Around that time, Dan Arey, the lead designer of , joined Naughty Dog and streamlined the level design. A death animation in which Crash is squashed into a stunned head and feet was altered for the Japanese version of the game due to its resemblance to the severed head and shoes <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> serial killer loose in Japan at the time.|$|E

5|$|Vann {{wanted to}} use a C-47 flare plane to {{illuminate}} the rice fields on the eastern flank of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. He wanted to hit the Viet Cong with 500 rounds of artillery and destroy them as they retreated. Cao would not approve the use of flares because it could expose the airborne battalion's night defensive positions, and instead ordered 100 rounds of artillery to be fired {{at a rate of}} four shells per hour. At 22:00, Viet Cong commander Hoang led his two companies out of Ap Tan Thoi and headed for their base camp in the Plain of Reeds, while the local force units <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> different route for their hideouts in the local area. The 1st Company, 261st Battalion, led the column, followed by litter carriers carrying the dead and wounded. The 1st Company, 514th Battalion, covered the tail of the formation, with one of their platoons acting as a rear guard. The wounded Viet Cong soldiers were transferred onto sampans at the canal {{on the east side of}} Ap Tan Thoi, while the rest of the formation marched on. At 07:00 on 3 January, Hoang's men successfully reached their destination without being detected.|$|E
5|$|With 19 minutes left, Arsenal finally scored. A poor {{clearance}} by Westerveld fell to Grimandi, {{who passed}} {{the ball to}} Pirès. Ljungberg received it and rounded the goalkeeper to score, much to Wenger's delight. Henry missed a chance to give Arsenal a two-goal lead in the 74th minute, as his shot was point-blank saved by Westerveld and on the follow up cleared by Hyypiä. Both managers made changes in the final period of the game; Ray Parlour came on for Wiltord {{in order to protect}} Arsenal's lead, whereas Liverpool made an attacking double substitution – Fowler and Berger on for Šmicer and Murphy. Liverpool survived the onslaught and found a foothold in the game when Owen equalised with eight minutes left. Arsenal failed to clear substitute McAllister's free-kick, and Owen pounced with a right-foot finish past Seaman from eight yards. Liverpool's comeback was completed five minutes later in the 88th minute, with extra time looming; Owen was released down the <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> weighted long ball pass from Berger, with the type of vision which had been earlier missing from their play, and he outpaced both Tony Adams and Dixon before shooting low and accurately past Seaman, beating him at the far post. Liverpool held on to their lead for the few minutes remaining to win the final.|$|E

Lockwood is convinced that what he saw was real. Heathcliff, believing Lockwood to be right, examines the window and opens it, hoping to allow Catherine's spirit to enter. When nothing happens, Heathcliff shows Lockwood to his own bedroom and returns to keep watch at the window.|$|E
25|$|Males of Heteropoda venatoria, {{one of the}} huntsman spiders {{that seems}} to easily find its way around the world, have {{recently}} been found to deliberately make a substrate-borne sound when they detect a chemical (pheromone) <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> nearby female of their species. The males anchor themselves firmly to the surface onto which they have crawled and then use their legs to transmit vibrations from their bodies to the surface. Most of the sound emitted is produced by strong vibrations of the abdomen. The characteristic frequency of vibration and the pattern of bursts of sound identify them to females of their species, who will approach if {{they are interested in}} mating.|$|E
25|$|Water mite eyes cannot form images, so Proctor {{suggests}} that males benefit from females reorientation and clutching to detect {{when he is}} {{directly in front of}} the female and should deposit spermatophores; it may also prevent males depositing spermatophores responding to residual chemical stimuli <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> female on a now empty perch (trembling was observed at recently deserted perches but never spermatophore deposition). The fanning of water over the spermatophores towards the female probably serves to move pheromones from the male to the female - this phenomenon is known in many other non-copulating arthropods, and Proctor observed that females only cease predatory behaviours and initiate courtship behaviours after receiving the chemical signals.|$|E

25|$|Beneath {{the drift}} {{deposits}} of the Vale of York lie Triassic sandstone and mudstone, and lower Jurassic mudstone {{but these are}} completely masked by the surface deposits. These deposits include glacial till, sand and gravel and both terminal and recessional moraines left by receding ice sheets {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The Escrick moraine extends across the vale from west to east and the York moraine, 8 miles further north, forms a similar curving ridge from York eastwards to Sand Hutton. To the north of these ridges are deposits of clay, sand and gravel <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> glacial lake. There are also areas of river alluvium consisting of clay, silt and sand deposited by the main rivers and streams.|$|E
25|$|Named after John Tyndall, Tyndallization is an {{obsolete}} and lengthy process {{designed to}} reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, then repeating the process {{a total of three}} to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic wolf {{population}} {{also began}} to decrease as human populations became more dense in certain areas. In east Greenland the Arctic wolf was exterminated completely by Danish and Norwegian hunters. In 1979, they began to repopulate the area and successfully establish a new population of wolves. The first wolf was spotted in April 1978 in eastern north Greenland. During the year of 1980, several wolf pairs were reported throughout eastern Greenland by military patrols. Wolves could not recover during the years between 1939–1978 in east Greenland due to factors such as geography and limited resources. Prey was insufficient and a dispersal corridor was hidden at 79 degrees north, thus restricting access to east Greenland. Also inadvertently, human mediated transport {{may have contributed to}} their repopulation in east Greenland. There are studies showing invading wolves of 1979 coming from the north, following tracks <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> military sled patrol.|$|E
