5000|$|Perpendicular {{recording}} {{can deliver}} {{more than three}} times the storage density of traditional <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording.</b> Perpendicular recording was first used by Toshiba in 3.5" [...] floppy disks in 1989 to permit 2.88 MB of capacity (ED or extra-high density), but they failed to succeed in the marketplace. Since about 2005 the technology has come into use for hard disk drives. Hard disk technology with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording</b> has an estimated limit of 100 to 200 gigabit per square inch due to the superparamagnetic effect, though this estimate is constantly changing. Perpendicular recording is predicted to allow information densities of up to around 1 Tbit/sq. inch (1000 Gbit/sq. inch). [...] drives with densities of 667 Gb/inch2 were available commercially, and there have been perpendicular recording demonstrations of 800-900Gb/in2.|$|E

[...] BCE gave the world's first demonstration of a videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by John T. Mullin and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device gave what were described as [...] "blurred and indistinct" [...] images, using a modified Ampex 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (0.6 cm) audio tape moving at 360 inches (9.1 m) per second. [...] A year later, an improved version, using one-inch (2.6 cm) magnetic tape, was shown to the press, who reportedly expressed amazement at {{the quality of the}} images, although they had a [...] "persistent grainy quality that looked like a worn motion picture". Overall, the picture quality was still considered inferior to the best kinescope recordings on film. Bing Crosby Enterprises hoped to have a commercial version available in 1954, but none came forth.

As envisioned by the industry and academia leaders, perpendicular recording is the most likely candidate for the technology implemented in the next generations of hard drives. The most competitive virtue of this technology is the fact that while being technically the closest alternative to conventional <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording,</b> it is capable of extending the (superparamagnetic) density limit [6] beyond what is achievable with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording.</b> It is widely believed that perpendicular magnetic recording paradigm will enable to sustain the current great strides in technological advances for the next several generations of magnetic storage solutions...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} new {{generalized}} partial response (GPR) targets for perpendicular recording whose transition response is modeled as an error function, and compare their performance with the partial response (PR) targets {{both in the}} presence {{and in the absence}} of jitter noise. Regardless of any jitter noise amount, results indicate that the GPR targets outperform the PR targets, especially at high linear recording densities. We also determine that the dominant error sequence for this perpendicular recording is the same for all targets when jitter noise is low. The system performance can therefore be further improved by designing and using codes to avoid this dominant error sequence. Another signiÞcant point is the fact that the dominant error sequence of perpendicular recording is different from <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording,</b> thus requiring design of different types of codes than the ones used for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording.</b> Finally, we show that the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be equivalently used instead of the bit-error-rate (BER) as a measure to compare the performance of different targets...|$|E

40|$|A common {{justification}} for state-sponsored merit scholarships like Georgia’s HOPE {{program is to}} promote academic achievement. However, grade-based retention rules encourage other behavioral responses. Using <b>longitudinal</b> <b>records</b> of enrolled undergraduates at the University of Georgia between 1989 and 1997, we estimate the effects of HOPE on course-taking, treating nonresidents as a control group. First, we find that HOPE decreased full-load enrollments and increased course withdrawals among resident freshmen. Second, the scholarship’s influence on course-taking behavior is concentrated on students whose predicted freshmen GPAs place them on or below the scholarship-retention margin. Third, HOPE substantially increased summer school credits. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper reviews a major disk-drive product {{development}} effort in IBM during the 1950 s, {{one that was}} originally based on perpendicular recording. The goal of the project, identified as the Advanced Disk File (ADF), was to develop the successor to the first disk drive, the Random Access Method of Accounting and Control (RAMAC) 350. The ADF eventually became the IBM 1301, the first disk drive to use a flying head per surface. Whereas the RAMAC used <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording,</b> the ADF project chose perpendicular recording as the mainstream recording technology for magnetic disk data storage and continued on this path {{for a period of}} five years. A crisis arose in the later stages of prototype testing due to unacceptable failure rates; one decision made was to change the recording method from perpendicular back to longitudinal. The reasons for the original selection of perpendicular and the subsequent return to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording</b> are described and address technology, product, and business issues. General observations on factors influencing the choices made and the final outcome are offered as well as the long-term impact of these events on the disk-drive industry.

40|$|We propose and {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} an FSE (oversampled) system in longitudinal and perpendicular recording channels. Results show that the proposed system outperforms the conventional (symbol rate) one whenever there is excess bandwidth, like in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording.</b> System Model The readback signal r(t) in Fig. 1 can be written as ∑ bk g(t − kT + ∆tk r (t) n(t), (1) k where bk = ak- ak- 1 takes on values {- 2, 0, 2 }, ak ∈ {± 1 } is a binary input sequence, and n(t) denotes the AWGN with power σ 2. The transition response, g(t), for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>recording</b> is g(t) = 1 /(1 +(2 t/PW 50) 2), where PW 50 is the width of g(t) at half its maximum, while that for perpendicular recording is g(t) = erf (ln 16 t/PW 50) [1] where erf(.) is an error function and PW 50 is {{the width of the}} derivative of g(t) at half its maximum. The jitter noise ∆tk is modeled with a truncated Gaussian probability distribution function with zero mean and variance 2 j σ. The readback signal is filtered by a low-pass filter whose cutoff frequency is at N/(2 T), and then sampled assuming perfect synchronization (As shown in Fig. 1, N = 1 corresponds to symbol rate). The received sequence, zm, is equalized by a T/N-spaced equalizer (N = 1 corresponds to a T-spaced equalizer (TSE)) such that yk resembles dk. Finally, the VD performs Viterbi detection. n(t) a...|$|E

We find that the retirement patterns based on the two approaches are similar but differ, often substantially, from single-period patterns.

Focusing on differential wage impacts by immigrant origin, we find that immigrant inflows from the neighboring Nordic countries have more negative wage effects than inflows from developing countries. The pattern is consistent with factor demand theory if natives and other Nordic citizens are close substitutes. We also find that impact estimates, particularly for inflows from nearby countries, are sensitive to accounting for selective native attrition and within-skill group variation in demand and supply conditions. ...|$|R
