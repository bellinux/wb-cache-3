25|$|The Dauphinoise {{school of}} the 19th century reached a level that justifies the {{prominence}} it holds in the museum. If a large room displays these small paintings it is above all this <b>landscape</b> <b>format</b> that gives them their soul.

Even before President Nixon's formal naming of the Roosevelt Room a tradition existed of Democratic administrations hanging Alfred Jonniaux's portrait of FDR over the mantel with Theodore Roosevelt's equestrian portrait by Tade Styka titled Rough Rider hung on the south wall. Republican administrations would, in turn, hang Teddy Roosevelt's painting above the mantel and move FDR's portrait to the south wall. Bill Clinton decided to keep the <b>landscape</b> <b>formatted</b> Teddy Roosevelt portrait above the mantel and FDR's portrait on the south wall.|$|R

2500|$|The 1917–20 {{series was}} {{perforated}} 11 and included all the denominations {{found in the}} two preceding series, but added three new Franklin-heads of 13-cents, 2 and 5-dollars. The two higher denominations appeared late in this issue as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was busy replacing worn printing plates and dealing with various experiments and innovations that delayed production of the 2 & 5 dollar plates. Perhaps to identify these stamps as luxury items, they were printed in two tones, with the vignette head in black and the frame in color. They were further distinguished from lower values by their use of <b>landscape</b> <b>format</b> rather than the normal portrait orientation. Because the 2 & 5 dollar Franklin-head stamps were the two largest denominations they are often referred to by collectors as the 'Big Bens'. The 2-dollar Franklin {{was intended to be}} printed in carmine-red and black, but somehow the color of the printing ink from the particular lot that was used turned out to have a distinct orange tone. [...] in printing ink is somewhat common in stamp production, but the variance in this case ventured into a different color completely—orange. By the time this acute color variance was {{brought to the attention of}} officials a good number of sheets had already been distributed among the various post offices and were most likely already in circulation. In 1920 a second printing of the 2-dollar Franklin was issued, this time with the colors that were originally intended, carmine-red and black. These were printed and remained in use for some 3 to 4 years and therefore quantities of the red and black variety out number the orange and black approximately 15 to 1. Quantities issued are, for 2-dollar orange and black, 47,700 (470 sheets of 100), and 2-dollar carmine-red and black, 743,600 (7,436 sheets of 100).|$|E

Produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, it features seven [...] "video paintings" [...] of actress and photographer Christine Alicino, a friend of Eno's, and has a running time of 82 minutes. It was filmed in [...] "vertical format," [...] which necessitated the viewer either lie on their side or turn the television on its side, which often proved impractical for many viewers, and in most affected the picture tube's color purity adjustments.

Tracing its origins to the birth of video art in the 1970s, it has increased in popularity as digital video production technology has become more readily accessible. Today, video installation is ubiquitous and visible in a range of environments—from galleries and museums to an expanded field that includes site-specific work in urban or industrial <b>landscapes.</b> Popular <b>formats</b> include monitor work, projection, and performance. The only requirements are electricity and darkness.|$|R

50|$|Known {{for large}} <b>format</b> <b>landscapes,</b> Cordsen {{produces}} ethereal and ambiguous images that evoke ideas of fragmented memories and temporality.

She often combines 19th century chemical methods with traditional film and digital technologies. Kate Cordsen's landscapes are a hybrid study of both photography and painting. The final result is that her pieces possess a certain aesthetic that seems attainable only through the act of painting.|$|R
