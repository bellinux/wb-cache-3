The philatelist counts the single stamps horizontally from left to right, but the post counts them vertically from top to bottom. Accordingly, the third stamp in the sixth row of a sheet of 10 x 10 would be the 53rd <b>stamp</b> <b>of</b> the sheet for the collector, but the 26th stamp for the post.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel, generic framework for information segmentation in document images. A document image contains {{different types of}} information, for instance, text (machine printed/handwritten), graphics, signatures, and stamps. It is necessary to segment information in documents so that to process such segmented information only when required in automatic document processing workflows. The main contribution of this thesis is the conceptualization and implementation of an information segmentation framework {{that is based on}} part-based features. The generic nature of the presented framework makes it applicable to a variety of documents (technical drawings, magazines, administrative, scientific, and academic documents) digitized using different methods (scanners, RGB cameras, and hyper-spectral imaging (HSI) devices). A highlight of the presented framework {{is that it does not}} require large training sets, rather a few training samples (for instance, four pages) lead to high performance, i. e., better than previously existing methods. In addition, the presented framework is simple and can be adapted quickly to new problem domains. This thesis is divided into three major parts on the basis of document digitization method (scanned, hyper-spectral imaging, and camera captured) used. In the area of scanned document images, three specific contributions have been realized. The first of them is in the domain of signature segmentation in administrative documents. In some workflows, it is very important to check the document authenticity before processing the actual content. This can be done based on the available seal of authenticity, e. g., signatures. However, signature verification systems expect pre-segmented signature image, while signatures are usually a part of document. To use signature verification systems on document images, it is necessary to first segment signatures in documents. This thesis shows that the presented framework can be used to segment signatures in administrative documents. The system based on the presented framework is tested on a publicly available dataset where it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and successfully segmented all signatures, while less than half of the found signatures are false positives. This shows that it can be applied for practical use. The second contribution in the area of scanned document images is segmentation <b>of</b> <b>stamps</b> in administrative documents. A stamp also serves as a seal for documents authenticity. However, the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>stamp</b> on the document can be more arbitrary than a signature depending on the person sealing the document. This thesis shows that a system based on our generic framework is able to extract <b>stamps</b> <b>of</b> any arbitrary shape and color. The evaluation of the presented system on a publicly available dataset shows that it is also able to segment black stamps (that were not addressed in the past) with a recall and precision of 83...|$|R
