5|$|In October 2015, {{the city}} of Buenos Aires {{together}} with the Inter-American Development Bank presented a 150-page plan for the Underground called the Strategic and Technical Plan for the Expansion of the Subterranean Network (Plan Estratégico y Técnico para la Expansión de la Red de Subtes, or PETERS), highlighting past expansion efforts {{and the need to}} adapt plans to the current needs of the city. In this version of the Underground, <b>Line</b> <b>I</b> is cancelled while Line G takes a different route through the centre of the city terminating at Constitucion railway station after going through the neighbourhood of San Telmo, rather than at Retiro railway station. Other changes include a Retiro Norte node where lines F and H terminate, rather than at Plaza Italia and Retiro respectively, while Line E is extended to Plaza Italia from Retiro – a segment which in the original plan was part of Line F. In these plans, Line C is extended both northwards in a loop to Retiro bus station and southwards to the Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station minor terminal.|$|E
500|$|<b>Line</b> <b>I</b> {{will run}} Parque Chacabuco to Ciudad Universitaria with 18 new stations. The route length is 12.6km. The {{future of this}} line (which had the lowest {{priority}} in the expansion plans) is currently uncertain since it has been proposed that a Metrobus line be built instead, which would follow the same trajectory as the line.|$|E

500|$|Van Morrison {{regarded}} Street Choir poorly, {{as he told}} biographer Ritchie Yorke in 1973: [...] "Somewhere {{along the}} <b>line</b> <b>I</b> lost control of that album. I'd rather not think about that album because it doesn't mean much {{in terms of where}} I was at... the album didn't sell very well and I'm glad."

[...] In naming Schulz to his All-America team, Walter Camp said: [...] "He is well over six feet in height, yet a fast, powerful man who gets well over the field and makes more tackles in a game than any other man on his team. [...] In addition he is an accurate passer and feeds the ball well to his backs either for kicks or runs".|$|E

500|$|Grace Dent of The Guardian {{commented on}} the realism of Zoe's storyline {{involving}} Adrian stating: [...] "hapless Zoe failed her exams after refusing to shag dismal tutor Adrian. Predatory lecturers taking advantage of gullible women? Actually, that's a plot <b>line</b> <b>I</b> can get my head around. The problem with being an academic perv these days is that one day sooner or later, the truth will out." [...] Lesbian culture website AfterEllen.com opined [...] "she doesn't seem like the type of woman to give up without a fight" [...] where Sarah and Mike are concerned. They also branded her storyline [...] "scandalous" [...] and said [...] "It appears that in the UK, some television writers actually {{pay attention to what}} their actors want." [...] This was in response to Lister suggesting the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Heisman {{recalled}} that, when Strupper {{first arrived}} from Riverside Military Academy, Heisman {{could not imagine}} Strupper playing on the football team: [...] "Too light for the <b>line,</b> <b>I</b> didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't {{be able to get}} the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." [...] He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{opposite}} Sacha Parkinson, {{who plays}} Sian Powers, Thompson filmed his first screen kiss. He {{said of the}} experience, [...] "It was bizarre because Sacha had done one before and I hadn't. I knew the <b>line</b> <b>I</b> had to say and then kiss her. I knew it every time, and every time I said it I was shaking." [...] He continued, [...] "Oh it was dreadful. I mean I don't get nervous when I go on stage or anything like that, {{but it was just}} bizarre. It {{was one of those things}} that I got really nervous about." [...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle. In May 2012, it was confirmed that Ryan would be recast and played by Sol Heras, because Thompson chose not to return.|$|E

500|$|Julia Pistor, the film's co-producer, {{said that}} {{although}} Nickelodeon (which owns the SpongeBob trademark) wanted to sell character-themed backpacks, lunch boxes and wristwatches it respected Hillenburg's integrity and gave him control of merchandising. Hillenburg {{had no problem with}} candy and ice cream tie-ins, Pistor said (because of the treats' simplicity), but he had issues with fast food tie-ins; according to him, the latter was [...] "full of hidden additives." [...] Pistor said, [...] "The trouble is that you can't go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in People don't take you seriously." [...] Hillenburg replied, [...] "Yeah, well, my take on that is that we shouldn't do that We didn't want to suddenly become the people serving up food that's not that good for you - especially kids. We work with Burger King, and they make toys and watches. But to actually take the step of pushing the food, that's crossing the <b>line.</b> <b>I</b> don't want to be the Pied Piper of fast food." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the <b>line</b> <b>I</b> fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} {{to me that}} they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there {{is likely to be a}} fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing <b>line.</b> <b>I</b> know my representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in and stick it out... dig, dig, dig until you are safe". The survivors had to fight on alone until 28 April when four battalions of the Royal Naval Division were attached to the corps.|$|E

500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a <b>line</b> <b>I</b> said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best. That's what I meant to say. That's the whole message of the record." ...|$|E
500|$|The Paris {{delegation}}, led by Bertrand Delanoë, {{argued that}} Tony Blair and the London delegation {{had broken the}} IOC rules. On 11 July 2005, Delanoë stated: [...] "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not {{say that they were}} flirting with the yellow <b>line,</b> <b>I</b> say that they crossed the yellow line". A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a [...] "bidding war". Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street. It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: [...] "I made it very clear that, in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out". Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party of the Council of Paris, stated: [...] "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{said she}} took a moment before agreeing, as she had just wrapped up work on Gaga's Monster Ball HBO special {{but she could not}} resist in the end. [...] "It's a phenomenal video: really powerful, really impactful. She's such a strong, {{committed}} artist. Her loyalty to me is something I will be forever grateful for. We're spiritually connected. We need each other ... and 'Judas' is ultimately a representation of our true bond," [...] she added. With The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem. The shock value in the video was purposefully added, but ultimately the story was about oppression; and about following one's heart and the glory of being free. With NME magazine Gaga revealed that the video involved motorbikes and a death sequence. She also described the portrayal of her character as being [...] "beyond repentance", which evolved from the continuous media accusations towards her that [...] " [...] trashy. or pretentious or this and that. [...] is my way of saying 'I've crossed the <b>line,</b> <b>I</b> won't even try to repent. Nor should I'." [...] Forgiveness and destiny also played a part in the video, and Gaga wanted to portray a Federico Fellini-esque story with apostles being revolutionaries in a modern-day Jerusalem. They are led to Jesus, by Gaga as Magdalene. Although initially reported to be premiered during an episode of the tenth season of American Idol, the music video premiered on May 5, 2011, on E! News at 7 pm.|$|E

2500|$|Reserve sophomore {{running back}} Mikell Simpson racked up 119 yards rushing and two TDs {{to go along}} with 152 {{receiving}} yards, for 271 all-purpose yards, as 19th-ranked Virginia came from behind to defeat Maryland. The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "I saw the ball come out on the goal <b>line.</b> <b>I</b> saw it and I don't think he had possession." [...] Simpson himself stated, [...] "It crossed the <b>line.</b> <b>I</b> knew I scored because I looked down and saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [...] they hit it out." [...] With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row {{for the first time since}} 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949. That season, Virginia won an NCAA record of five games by two points or less, with the other edged teams being North Carolina, Middle Tennessee State, Connecticut, and Wake Forest.|$|E
