5|$|Peter wakes in the hospital, {{learning}} from Olivia {{that they saw}} a man safely cross the bridge and taken by Newton. When Walter arrives to see Peter, Peter tells him he has realized the truth: because he, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> on the bridge, was not affected by the same shockwave that killed the FBI agent, he must be from the parallel universe. Walter is unable to deny Peter's accusations. The next day, Walter is devastated to learn that Peter has discharged himself and has disappeared.|$|E

John Rosselli concluded after writing his biography that [...] "I do {{not very much}} <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> Verdi, in particular the autocratic -cum-estate owner, part-time composer, and seemingly full-time grumbler and reactionary critic of the later years", yet admits that like other writers, he must [...] "admire him, warts and all...a deep integrity runs beneath his life, and can be felt even when he is being unreasonable or wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Among Boulton's most {{successful}} products were mounts for small Wedgwood {{products such as}} plaques, cameo brooches and buttons in the distinctive ceramics, notably jasper ware, for which Wedgwood's firm remains well known. The mounts of these articles, {{many of which have}} survived, were made of ormolu or cut steel, which had a jewel-like gleam. Boulton and Wedgwood were friends, alternately co-operating and competing, and Wedgwood wrote of Boulton, [...] "It doubles my courage to have the first Manufacturer in England to encounter with—The match likes me well—I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man,</b> I like his spirit." ...|$|E

500|$|The Times, {{generally}} pro-Conservative, {{had backed}} Butler, {{and called it}} [...] "prodigal" [...] of the party to pass over his many talents. The paper praised Home as [...] "an outstandingly successful Foreign Secretary", but doubted his grasp of domestic affairs, his modernising instincts and his suitability [...] "to carry the Conservative Party through a fierce and probably dirty campaign" [...] at the general election due within a year. The Guardian, liberal in its political outlook, remarked that Home [...] "does not look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> to impart force and purpose to his Cabinet and the country" [...] and suggested that he seemed too frail politically to be even a stop-gap. The Observer, another liberal-minded paper, said, [...] "The overwhelming– and damaging– impression left {{by the events of}} the last two weeks is that the Tories have been forced to settle for a second-best.... The calmness and steadiness [...] which made him a good Foreign Secretary, particularly at times of crisis like Berlin and Cuba, may also be a liability." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1893, Mamie Baxter, a fourteen-year-old girl in Denmark, Barnwell County, {{alleged that}} an African American unknown to her had {{attempted}} to attack her. About twenty black men were detained and paraded before her; she stated that Henry Williams looked something <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> she had seen. Placed on what passed for a trial by the mob that took him from the jail, Williams produced several respected white men to support his alibi. A majority of the mob voted against killing him, and Williams was returned to jail. More searches were made for Baxter's attacker. A suspect in the case, John Peterson, appealed to Tillman for protection, fearing he would be lynched if taken to Denmark, and stating he could prove his innocence. Tillman sent Peterson to Denmark with a single guard. He {{was taken by the}} mob, put on [...] "trial", and after the mob found him guilty, was murdered. There was widespread outrage among both races across the country, both at the actions of the lynchers and at what Tillman had done. The governor said, in response, that he had assumed that, as the mob had been convinced by Williams' defense, it would allow Peterson to prove his innocence as well. He thereafter ignored the issue of the Denmark lynching.|$|E

2500|$|Alexander [...] "Alec" [...] Coxon (18 January 1916 – 22 January 2006) was an English cricketer {{who played}} for Yorkshire. He also played one Test match for England in 1948. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman stated, [...] "Coxon's Test career was abrupt – much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> himself.

These machines are always just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> in the room: they understand nothing and don't speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: [...] "I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing." ...|$|E

These people were turning their {{heads back to}} see what was happening and when they saw these men had guns in their hands they put their hands up.

2500|$|Music critic Dave Marsh {{also wrote}} that these {{compositions}} [...] "define a world unto themselves more completely {{than any other}} body of work in pop music". Orbison's music, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> himself, {{has been described as}} timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird. New York Times writer Peter Watrous declared in a concert review: [...] "He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity".|$|E

The caption for the page reads, [...] "Ted has a tricycle, so very small, He cannot ride it, because he's so tall.

2500|$|The {{story begins}} with the Cassini Saturn {{spacecraft}} releasing the Huygens Titan probe. The scene is then transposed to Earth, where a 12-year-old girl, Jeana (Voiced by Abigail Breslin), places a sun filter over a telescope to view sun spots. She asks her mentor, a Professor [...] "Why is the Sun so bright?" [...] This leads the professor to launch into a scientific explanation about fusion. The little girl laughs, having played this trick on her mentor many times, she says [...] "No I meant bright, bright like happy. In most drawings the sun has a big smile. Is he good, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> in the moon." [...] Knowing this means she wants a story, the mentor begins to spin a tale, but as a mentor, this one, while entertaining, is also educational.|$|E

Her family and background is never mentioned in the musical, although in the original books she has an uncle Albert Wigg, and a cousin, Arthur. She also claims to be cousins with inanimate things <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> in the Moon, and a King cobra at the zoo. In one story in the original book, she briefly mentions her mother.
