40|$|In this study, it {{was shown}} that {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} continuously cast steel billets, similar to those which can be achieved by electromagnetic stirring (EMS) of the liquid pool during solidification, can be obtained if casting superheats can be consistently controlled at low levels. A lack of casting temperature control is not only detrimental {{to the quality of the}} cast product, but also to a shop's overall productivity. The important variables for temperature control in the ladle, tundish and mould were quantified and possible methods of controlling these variables were proposed. The thermal state of the <b>ladle</b> <b>lining</b> is one of the major contributors to the variability in casting temperature. It was shown that by reducing energy losses from the refractory <b>ladle</b> <b>lining,</b> by way of incorporating an insulating refractory tile between the ladle shell and the safety lining and by using a ladle lid throughout the cycle of the ladle, temperature losses from the liquid steel can be substantially decreased.

40|$|Abstract. In this experiment, {{preparation}} of samples were based on original ratio of bauxite matrix Al 2 O 3 -SiC-C castable for iron tap channel, and partial bauxites of size 8 - 5 mm, 5 - 3 mm, 3 - 1 mm and < 0. 074 mm were replaced by recycling materials {{of the same size}} granular from spent Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C ladle bricks, respectively. Effects of recycling <b>ladle</b> <b>lining</b> materials on phase composition and microstructure of Al 2 O 3 -SiC-C castable for iron runner were investigated by XRD, SEM and EDS. The results showed that new phases SiO 2 and (Mg 0. 804 Ca 0. 196) 3 Al 2 (SiO 4) 3 were formed in the castable at 1450 o C in air atmosphere, and the spherical (Mg 0. 804 Ca 0. 196) 3 Al 2 (SiO 4) 3 was formed on external surface of recycling Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C particle. thereinto, SiC oxidation to formed SiO 2 with flow pattern character was key element of the phase (Mg 0. 804 Ca 0. 196) 3 Al 2 (SiO 4) 3 formation. The more fine and uniform of recycling Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C particles, the more spherical (Mg 0. 804 Ca 0. 196) 3 Al 2 (SiO 4) 3 was formed in recycling Al 2 O 3 -SiC-C castable.

40|$|Heating of the ladle {{is carried}} out to reduce the heat loss of the molten metal and prevent the {{destruction}} of the <b>ladle</b> <b>lining,</b> that arises from the sharp temperature gradient in the initial period of the melt outlet. Thermal preparation of ladles {{is carried out}} in the plants for drying and high-temperature heating. The temperature conditions and duration of heating are set empirically depending on the physical properties of lining materials. To control the ladle preparation process the operation conditions must provide for predetermined temperature profile across the lining with minimum possible specific expenditure of fuel under the conditions of variable efficiency of the unit. To control thermal preparation of the ladle it is necessary to predict the temperature distribution in the <b>ladle</b> <b>lining.</b> On the strength of the analysis of the heating technology and the design of the 120 -ton ladle the computer model of the thermal state based on the finite element method was developed. As a result of the simulation the temperature distribution across the layers of the lining during 24 hours was obtained. The simulation model {{can be used as a}} predictor in the development of ACS in the preparation of the ladles. The model of the thermal state of the lining can be used not only for the selection of the optimum heating but also for the evaluation of technical solutions to improve the design of the ladles and other metallurgical unit...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} drying and heating the metallurgical ladles. The ladle heating parameters significantly affect the metallurgical processes. The heating process target of the ceramic <b>ladle</b> <b>lining</b> can reduce the steel temperature in the furnace. It resulted in reduction of energy consumption what is an economic benefit. Adopted drying and heating rate of the ladle depends on the ladle refractory lining - an alkaline or an aluminosilicate. The temperature field uniformity of ceramic lining is a basic technological requirement. The presented industrial research shows {{the way of the}} ladle heating where the self-recuperative burner was used. The recuperative burner application gives the rapid increasing of the preheated air temperature what has resulted in the reduction of fuel consumption for the same thermal power. The examinations of the two ladles heating process were presented and the energy efficiency of that process was identified...|$|E
40|$|During the {{production}} of steel the oxide inclusion content partly depends on {{the reaction of the}} melt with the furnace lining, the <b>ladle</b> <b>lining</b> and the pouring system. The refractory material may be eroded by the molten steel and slag as well as corroded through chemical reactions with the slag and molten steel and the deoxidation products. In this report the effects of revolution speed, temperature and steel composition on the rate of dissolution of commercial MgO-C refractory samples into Al-deoxidised molten steel and CaOAl 2 O 3 - SiO 2 -MgO slag were examined by the rotating cylinder method. The study also includes tests with slag were doloma refractory samples are examined by the same method. Cylinders of MgO-C refractory material were immersed in to steel that was deoxidised by adding metallic aluminium. This was carried out in the temperature range of 1873 to 1973 CÂ° and at rotational speeds of 100 to 800 rpm for different holding times. The experimental results show that the rate of dissolution of MgO-C refractory materials increased with the temperature, rotational speed and immersion time. This supports the assumption that the diffusion of magnesium through the slag boundary layer formed around the refractory samples would be the rate-determining step. Mass transfer coefficients calculated on the basis of experimental results are in good agreement with earlier published results for pure ceramics. A formation of a thin oxide layer at the interface was found. It is due the reaction between magnesium vapour and the CO generated by the reaction MgO and C in the refractory walls. The oxide inclusions formed in the steel have been shown to mainly consist of MgO, Al 2 O 3 and a mixture of them. The rate of dissolution of solid MgO-C into liquid CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO slag at different temperatures was studied under conditions of forced convection by rotating cylindrical refractory specimens in a stationary crucible containing the molten slag similar to the MgO-C refractory/steel experiments. The corrosion rate was calculated from the change in diameter of the cylindrical specimens. The specimens were rotated for 15 to 120 minutes at speeds of 100 to 400 rpm in the molten slag. The rate of corrosion increased with temperature and with rotating speed of the rod and decreased when the slag was nearly saturated with MgO. The experimental results confirm the assumption that the diffusion of magnesium oxide through the slag phase boundary layer controls the corrosion process. The corrosion mechanism seems to be the dissolution of elements in the refractory materials into the slag, followed by penetration into the pores and grain boundaries. Finally, grains are loosened from the refractory into the slag. The investigation of doloma and doloma-carbon showed that the dissolution of magnesia into the slag was determining the corrosion rate. As for the other experiments, steel/MgO-C refractory and slag/MgO-C refractory, the corrosion rate was calculated from the change in diameter of the cylindrical specimens. The specimens were rotated for 15 to 120 minutes at speeds of 100 to 400 rpm in the molten slag. The results from the study showed that refractory materials that were impregnated with carbon had a much better slag resistance than the refractory that contained no carbon. This is due to the higher wetting angle between carbon and slag. Corrosion of MgO-C refractories in different gas atmospheres consisting of air, Ar, CO or Ar/CO was also studied. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range 1173 K to 1773 K and for holding times between 2 to 120 min. The reaction rate of the MgO-C material was determined from measurements of the weight loss of the samples. The results showed that the refractory weight loss increased with an increased temperature or an increased holding time. The thermodynamic conditions and the experimental results show that magnesium gas and carbon monoxide gas should form during ladle refining of steel when the refractory material consists of MgO-C.
