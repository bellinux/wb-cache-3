50|$|The Little Giant was a {{vertical}} model which could accurately perform tension, transversality, and compressive stress tests {{with just one}} instrument housed in a single frame. The device was relatively cheap, compact, and simple to operate. Forces were applied to a test specimen from both above and below. Upper and <b>lower</b> loading <b>cross</b> <b>heads</b> contained grips which held the specimen and crushed it, or pulled it apart as the operator turned a handle attached {{to a system of}} gears. In 1880, Olsen started the Tinius Olsen Testing Machine Company to produce the device.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>head</b> - A movable <b>cross</b> <b>head</b> (crosshead) is {{controlled}} {{to move up}} or down. Usually this is at a constant speed: sometimes called a constant rate of extension (CRE) machine. Some machines can program the crosshead speed or conduct cyclical testing, testing at constant force, testing at constant deformation, etc. Electromechanical, servo-hydraulic, linear drive, and resonance drive are used.|$|R

Each of the ceramic vanes has an end slot of bow tie configuration including flared end segments and a center slot therebetween. Each of the vane drive shafts has a <b>cross</b> <b>head</b> with ends thereof spaced with respect to the sides of the end slot to define clearance for free expansion of the <b>cross</b> <b>head</b> with respect to the vane and the <b>cross</b> <b>head</b> being configured to uniformly distribute drive loads across bearing surfaces of the vane slot...|$|R

5000|$|As the spade moves forward, {{it pushes}} the {{projectile}} and powder case into the chamber. The spade's time of travel, {{from the rear}} of the tray to the breech, is one second. As it approaches breech, the <b>Cross</b> <b>Head</b> pushes through a spring latch that locks it there. At the same time, the <b>Cross</b> <b>Head</b> trips another lever connected to the Rammer Controller, and the Controller releases the hydraulic pressure to the Ram Cylinder.|$|R

Equations relevant to tension and stress relaxation tests carried out under <b>cross</b> <b>head</b> speed control, and to creep testing under constant load, are described. For the first two cases, the implications of not using gauge length extensometry but relying upon <b>cross</b> <b>head</b> displacement for inferring specimen extension, and the role of uncertainty in machine stiffness are also examined. The final section touches upon the extension of the present scheme to account for specimen anelasticity...|$|R

40|$|Title: The Occurrence of <b>Lower</b> <b>Crossed</b> Syndrome in Sprinters and the Possibilities of Influencing it in Physiotherapy Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>lower</b> <b>crossed</b> syndrome in specific group of sprinters and compare it with control group. To compare occurrence especially in {{men and women in}} sprint. Methods: To obtain informations from the research were used clinical tests- muscle test by Janda for testing muscle strength of m. rectus abdominis (trunk flexion test), m. gluteus maximus (test of extension in hip with contemporary flexion in knee), m. gluteus medius et minimus (test of abduction in the hip joint) and examination of frequently shortened muscle groups by Janda for examination shortening of the hip flexor muscles (m. iliopsoas, m. rectus femoris and m. tensor fascia latae) m. quadratus lumborum- lateral variant and paravertebral back muscles. To select probands into research and control groups was created nonstandard questionnaire with open and closed questions. In the research there were 40 probands. Results: The results show that the <b>lower</b> <b>crossed</b> syndrome by Janda is more common in sports recreationally individuals than sprinters. Furthermore the <b>lower</b> <b>crossed</b> syndrome by Janda is more common in sprinters- men than in sprinters- women, but here the results are not so clear [...] . ...|$|R
