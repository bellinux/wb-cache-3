Excellent preservation of the sclerites, absence of epibionts, and minimal internal sedi-ment with in the ‘‘pockets’ ’ suggest rapid accumulation.

The unit varies considerably in thickness (0. 3 m- 0. 9 m) and contains a variety of sedimentary structures and fossils indicative of a warm, shallow marine environment subject to wave action. Dominant fossils within the unit include echinoderms, cephalopods, bryozoans, abraded mollusks, gastropods, brachiopods, and trilobites. Less-common fossil organisms within the unit include ostracodes, foraminifera, algae, and stromatoporoids. Mollusk chambers are commonly filled with micrite that contain traces of microbial life, including cement in the shape of bacterial filaments and micropeloids. Samples of the cephalopod marker bed were taken in a vertical sequence at two locations and from several locations along a north-south transect.

Fossil abundance and diversity increases from the bottom {{to the top of the}} sequence and lateral variations within the top two, most-fossiliferous layers were also observed. Petrographic analysis of the cephalopod marker bed revealed that on average, bioclasts represent ~ 75 % of the rock volume, cement is the next most-abundant constituent, and dolomite composes ~ 9 % of the the rock volume.

Hydrocarbon generation/expulsion scenarios, drawn in the latest intensive exploration phases, tend to overestimate maturation levels when compared with brand new data acquired after recent drillings. We tested an integrated workflow to correlate published and original thermal maturity datasets for the Paleozoic to Jurassic successions cropping out in the Holy Cross Mountains. These successions, when preserved in subsurface, host the major source rocks in the area. The application of the workflow allowed us to highlight the burial and thermal evolutionary scenarios of the two tectono-stratigraphic blocks of the Holy Cross Mountains (Łysogory and Kielce blocks) and to propose this approach {{as a tool for}} reducing levels of uncertainty in thermal maturity assessment of Paleozoic successions worldwide. In particular, published datasets including colour alteration indexes of Paleozoic microfossils (conodont, acritarchs) and vitrinite and graptolite reflectance data, show differences in levels of thermal maturity for the Łysogory (mid mature to overmature) and Kielce (immature to late mature) blocks. Original data, derived from optical analysis, pyrolysis, and Raman spectroscopy on kerogen, and X-Ray diffraction on fine grained sediments, mostly confirm and integrate published data distribution. 1 D thermal models, constrained by these data, show burial and exhumation events of different magnitude, during the Late Cretaceous, for the Łysogory (maximum burial depths of 9 km) and Kielce (burial depths of 6 km) blocks that have been related to the Holy Cross Fault polyphase activity.

40|$|The Brassfield Formation is {{an early}} Silurian (Aeronian, <b>Llandoverian)</b> unit of {{limestone}} and dolostone with excellent preservation of early reef communities and a diverse invertebrate fauna. A well-preserved outcrop occurs in southwestern Ohio at the Oakes Quarry Park in Fairborn; it contains abundant corals and stromatoporoids that are co-dominant in reef and reef-affected settings. This research provided an enhanced perspective of the Brassfield Formation to better reconstruct its paleoenvironment and better understand its diagenetic features. 	 	The depositional and diagenetic features of the Brassfield are described and interpreted using histologic methods and light microscopy. Selected thin sections were treated with carbonate stains to reveal the mineral interactions and possible microbial influence {{that led to the}} dolomitization present. These stains also revealed banding patterns that may indicate seasonal events. 	 	Features visible in the thin sections provided evidence for dolomite crystallization mediated by microbial activity and for both oxic and anoxic environments. Oxic environments are indicated by increased hematite precipitate and little organic carbon. Anoxic environments are indicated by increased pyrite precipitate and micritic or microbial associations. Dolomite associated with oxic characteristics appears unstable, with patches of dedolomitization. Dolomite associated with anoxic characteristics appears more intact, with larger mosaics and with larger crystal size. 	 	Growth patterns for all coral specimens have detectable high density (HD) and low density (LD) banding, most have growth interruption bands, and some have absent or breakage bands. Patterns indicate seasonal events (HD banding) that led to disruption of the coral viability, increased internal sedimentation, increased carbonate accumulations, and increased precipitates (namely pyrite and dolomite). Some events were marked by sediment infills and breakage bands at the probable point of organism death, suggesting a period of major environmental stress on the coral. Periods between events (LD banding) showed marked cementation, porosity, ferrous precipitation, and dolomite instability. 	 	This research suggested an important link between reducing environments and dolomite formation. Additionally, a relationship is probable between increased organic content, pyrite precipitation, and dolomite nucleation. Given that microbial evidence has been detected in past research examining carbonate and pyrite deposits, a link between microbial activity and dolomite formation is likely. Continued research into the geologic record may prove that indicators for specific microbial forms are marked by distinct phases of dolomite formation and degradation...|$|E
40|$|A {{distinctive}} Late Ordovician volcano-sedimentary terrane, {{embracing the}} Carriers Well Formation and Everetts Creek Volcanics and dismembered slivers now structurally intercalated {{in the adjoining}} Wairuna Formation, is located within the Broken River Province of the northern Tasmanides. It abuts a basement of mafic–ultramafic rocks (Gray Creek Complex) and overlying Early Ordovician deep marine sedimentary and volcanic strata (Judea Formation) which host tonalitic plutons. The terrane lies at the western, inboard-margin of the Camel Creek Subprovince, a broad tract of multiply deformed mid-Paleozoic turbidites with minor basalt and chert variously interpreted as the infill of a backarc basin or an accretionary wedge. U–Pb dates from detrital zircon indicate a maximum Late Silurian age for siliciclastic rocks from the previously undated Wairuna Formation. Geochemistry of volcanic rocks from the volcano-sedimentary terrane show them to be largely of mafic to intermediate compositions of calc-alkaline affinity, comparable with broadly coeval Macquarie Arc volcanic suites of the southern Tasmanides. Trace-element systematics identify a subduction relationship for the volcanic suite and V/Ti employed as a discrimination tool identifies the terrane as representing an oceanic island arc, consistent with its sedimentary facies which include volcaniclastic mass flow deposits, limestone, and radiolarian chert. Continent-derived sandstone in the sedimentary assemblage, confirmed by the ages of detrital zircon from a sandstone sample from the Carriers Well Formation, indicates that the oceanic island arc developed proximal to the Late Ordovician continental margin of East Gondwana. Its nature and location bear on the tectonic setting of the entire Camel Creek Subprovince, for which interpretation as an Early Silurian–Early Devonian accretionary wedge is favoured. Collision of the island arc with the continental margin, and associated deformation of part the intervening oceanic crustal tract, now represented by the Gray Creek Complex and its sedimentary cover (Judea Formation) registers the initiation of subduction accretion in late Early Silurian (<b>Llandoverian)</b> time. It marks early-stage orogenesis in the Broken River Province, accurately timed by stratigraphic relationships in the basinal succession developed in the Graveyard Creek Subprovince immediately {{to the west of}} the arc assemblage. Tectonism was regionally developed in north Queensland at this time, coeval with the Benambran Orogeny of the Lachlan Orogen in which the Macquarie Arc was likewise accreted to the East Gondwana margin.

40|$|The New World Island Complex {{consists}} of chaotically mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks in a 1 km wide belt that extends 30 km southwestward from Cobbs Arm, on eastern New World Island, centrally {{located in the}} Dunnage Zone of the Newfoundland Appalachians. The complex comprises four lithic units, locally preserved in partial stratigraphic sections: Squid Cove Volcanics - basalts (non-orogenic tholeiites), autoclastic breccias, red shale, limestone, pyroclastic breccias and tuffs (Arenigian to Llandeilian); Cobbs Arm Limestone (Llandeilian); Rodgers Cove Shale - interbedded black shale and chert (Caradocian); and Muddy Cove Clastics - quartzitic greywackes, shales, polymictic conglomerates, and shaly conglomeratic breccias (Ashgillian to <b>Llandoverian).</b> [...] Imbricated slices of competent volcanic rocks over 3 km long are separated by mylonitic and clastic shear zones. Intervening sedimentary slices contain boudinaged interbeds (1 cm to 100 m across) and tight fold hinges. These pass laterally into melange with discrete blocks of volcanic rocks, sandstones, and locally black shale in a sedimentary matrix. The blocks have sheared margins in places, and one large slab of Ordovician limestone is deeply penetrated by Silurian shale. Angular fragments in shaly conglomeratic breccias include black shale and limestone derived from the local stratigraphic section in adjacent fault blocks; one limestone clast is inhomogeneously deformed. [...] The New World Island Complex is followed to the northwest by sandstones and conglomerates (Crow Head Formation) of Upper Ordovician to Silurian age. These are locally continuous with Caradocian black shale and older rocks in the complex.

40|$|In {{order to}} model highly {{deformed}} sedimentary basins, structural balancing must {{be carried out}} prior to 2 D reverse basin and 2 D stratigraphic forward modelling. This study investigates the Southern Cantabrian Basin, which is the Variscan foreland fold-and-thrust belt of NW Spain. Structural balancing offers approximations of predeformational, spatial relationships between measured cross-sections. It provides information about minimal basin shortening and Late Devonian basin geometry. Three different structural domains can be distinguished along the synthetic, 18 km long Bernesga Transect. The style of structural deformation defines the amount of shortening calculated for each domain. The Pedrosa domain has the highest values of up to 65 %, followed by the northern Bodón (41 %) and the southern Alba (25 %) domains. Thrusting and folding each cause approximately the same amount of shortening. At basin scale, the amount of total shortening of the deformed basin infill is 54 % at minimum, excluding small-scale faulting and folding. 2 D numerical reverse basin modelling is used to estimate the basin architecture development and to establish thermo-tectonic subsidence rates as initial numerical input for the subsequent 2 D stratigraphic forward modelling. Six major subsidence trends within the total subsidence rates and its components (thermo-tectonic, flexural-induced and compaction-induced) can be distinguished between 560 Ma and 313 Ma. These trends reflect a complex evolution from a rift stage, to a post-rift stage (passive continental margin) and finally to a foreland basin, governed by the approach of the Variscan Orogen in the Lower Carboniferous. The rift stage is characterised by decreasing thermo-tectonic subsidence rates until the Middle Cambrian. The time that follows (Late Cambrian until Late Ordovician) is marked by periods of tectonic quiescence and activity, until the passive continental margin established in the Silurian. The post-rift stage is represented by two second-order encroachment subcycles with durations of 20 Ma and 41 Ma respectively. They result from subsidence patterns and basinward shifts of regional onlap. Maximum marine flooding was reached during Early <b>Llandoverian.</b> The Variscan foredeep stage is characterised by a highly subsiding depocenter, which moves from S to N in time (present day coordinates). This movement reflects the propagation of the Variscan Orogen, with velocities ranging between 4 and 12 km/Ma. 2 D stratigraphic forward modelling visualises the predicted depositional history along the synthetic Bernesga Transect and quantifies the physical factors determining deposition. From the latest Neoproterozoic to the Early Ordovician the Southern Cantabrian Basin is dominated by a considerable flux of siliciclastic sediments (2600 to 4600 m^ 2 /ka). Following a substantial drop in siliciclastic input by more than 65 % at the end of Silurian, significant carbonate production started in the Early Devonian. The Devonian is marked by alternating periods of considerable siliciclastic flux rates (2500 to 4600 m^ 2 /ka) and prolific carbonate production. Three Devonian carbonate factories (Abelgas, Santa Lucía and Portilla formations) display decompacted carbonate production rates from 90 to 780 m/Ma, each depending on (i) amount of siliciclastic input, (ii) accommodation space available and (iii) palaeogeographic position of the depositional area. The production and destruction of accommodation space is governed by differential thermo-tectonic and flexural-induced subsidence, along with fluctuating eustatic sea-level and sediment flux. Due to increased siliciclastic influx and diminishing accommodation space, the decompacted carbonate production rates of the Portilla Fm. dropped by 81 % in comparison to the Santa Lucía Fm...|$|E
