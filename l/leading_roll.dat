40|$|Having {{founded the}} rasbiologiska institutet in Uppsala under the {{leadership}} of Herman Lundborg in the 1920 s, Sweden took over a <b>leading</b> <b>roll</b> in eugenic discourse. Lundborg’s concept of population policy aimed at measuring the racial value of the Swedish population and {{to reduce the number of}} “inferior population elements”. Only a couple of years later, Alva and Gunnar Myrdal assessed the decline in the Swedish birthrate to be a “population crisis”, thus turning the once volkish-conservatively coloured discourse on population policy into a part of social democratic agitation. In spite of obvious ideological and political differences between the concepts of Lundborg and the Myrdals, some continuity in the premises of their argumentation can be pointed out. In both cases the argument of “population quality” justifies the subordination of individual interests and needs to the collective of the race or the folkhemmet (the people’s home) respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe National Dialogue in the COOL project {{aimed at}} {{developing}} insights {{and recommendations for}} Dutch long term climate policy, both on content and process. The dialogue {{was carried out in}} four dialogue groups, which addressed four sectors of the Dutch economy: housing & construction, industry & energy, agriculture & nutrition and traffic & transport. Forquestion: What is needed to realise reductions up to 80 % by 2050 (as compared to 1990 levels) for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in The Netherlands? The general picture that comes from the stakeholder dialogue was that emission reductions up to - 80 % by 2050 are imaginable. Not all dialogue participants are (equally) optimistic on the feasibility of such reductions, though. There is considerable doubt as to whether these reductions will be possible without causing or aggravating other problems than climate change here or elsewhere. This leads to the conclusion that - 80 % may come in reach for The Netherlands in a socially acceptable manner if, next to overcoming many social, institutional and psychological barriers, in specific areas major technological breakthroughs will be realised. European and Dutch governments are supposed to take a <b>leading</b> <b>roll</b> in this respect, but it is doubted if they can do this. This conclusion indicates on the one hand to a mild optimism, on the other hand to persistent doubts and concerns related to the desirability of certain options and the capabilities of government...|$|E

40|$|For every mill {{the ideal}} roll can be {{considered}} as one {{that can be used in}} a mill stand indefinitely. Unfortunately for the roll user, such ideal rolls do not exist. One major reason for work roll changes (planned or unplanned) is "wear". In the context of cold rolling and temper rolling, "wear" primarily refers to loss of roughness and/or surface texture. Another limitation to roll performance is the fact that mill incidents - minor as well as major incidents - inflict damage on the work rolls, requiring redressing in the roll shop. If a major defect is present in a forged roll, e. g. due to a mill incident, catastrophic roll failure may occur in a violent, explosive manner. Improvement of the value-in-use of a work roll implies a superior wear resistance, a superior damage resistance, and elimination of the safety risks associated with explosive roll failures. In order to deal with this in a concerted R&D approach, a consortium of two roll users in the steel industry, a <b>leading</b> <b>roll</b> manufacturer, a high-tech supplier of roll damage detection equipment, and specialised research institutes have joined forces. Cold rolling trials have been performed, using pilot mills as well as industrial mills, with both novel forged HSS work rolls and conventional forged 3 - 5 %Cr steel work rolls. Separate trials have been designed to focus on either the aspect of roughness evolution or damage resistance. Complementary data from various laboratory tests and industrial mill and roll shop data have been collected. Models have been developed for damage evolution in a roll, and for roughness evolution of the roll surface. In addition, novel non-destructive detection systems and sensors have been designed and tested. This paper provides a concise overview of the results achieved. © EDP Sciences...|$|E
40|$|Engineering heat {{transfer}} problems are very often {{of a complex}} nature and most often no analytical solutions exist. One way to create solutions to such problems is to apply numerical methods. This study concerns {{heat transfer}} problems with coupled conduction, convection and thermal radiation. Five important but different engineering problems are considered: 1) The transient temperature distribution in a rotating cylinder which is exposed to a time varying incident heat flux, e. g. a nuclear burst, is determined. The cylinder is cooled by mixed convection and thermal radiation. The effects of the leading parameters, such as rotation speed, the cooling parameters and the physical properties of the shell are studied. 2) The cooling of a roll system which is transporting/casting a thin hot plastic film. The <b>leading</b> <b>roll</b> is heated by the hot film, cooled at the interior by forced convection and on the outside by forced convection, thermal radiation and contact with a support roll. The influence of the cooling parameters and the rotation are studied. 3) The heat and mass diffusion in pre-insulated district heating/cooling pipes. The task {{is to determine the}} effects of the gas mass transport through the casing of the pipes on the thermal behaviour and the effects of condensed water due to the mass diffusion of water vapour. The importance of the density of the casing, the wall thickness of the casing, the thickness of the insulation and the surrounding temperature is revealed. 4) The development of a cooling system for an electrical unit in which a time dependent heat is generated due to the Joule effect. 5) The heat transfer from a rectangular fin in a confined space. The fin is cooled by turbulent forced convection. The turbulence model applied is a low Reynolds k-e-model. Predicted results are compared with experimental ones, and a correlation for the Nusselt number is proposed. The effects of thermal radiation for non-participating as well as participating media are considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} Prompt Gamma-ray Activation Analysis (PGAA) {{in a broad}} range of applications is evident, and has been emphasized at many meetings related to this topic (e. g., Technical Consultants' Meeting, Use of neutron beams for low- and medium-fluxresearch reactors: radiography and materials characterizations, IAEA Vienna, 4 - 7 May 1993, IAEA-TECDOC- 837, 1993). Furthermore, an Advisory Group Meeting (AGM) for the Coordination of the Nuclear Structure and Decay Data Evaluators Network has stated {{that there is a need}} for a complete and consistent library of cold- and thermal neutron capture gammaray and cross-section data (AGM held at Budapest, 14 - 18 October 1996, INDC(NDS) - 363); this AGM also recommended the organization of an IAEA CRP on the subject. The International Nuclear Data Committee (INDC) is the primary advisory body to the IAEA Nuclear Data Section on their nuclear data programmes. At a biennial meeting in 1997, the INDC strongly recommended that the Nuclear Data Section support new measurements andupdate the database on Neutron-induced Prompt Gamma-ray Activation Analysis (21 st INDC meeting, INDC/P(97) - 20). As a consequence of the various recommendations, a CRP on "Development of a Database for Prompt Gamma-ray Neutron Activation Analysis (PGAA) " was initiated in 1999. Prior to this project, several consultants had defined the scope, objectives and tasks, as approved subsequently by the IAEA. Each CRP participant assumed responsibility for the execution of specific tasks. The results of their and other research work were discussed and approved by the participants in research co-ordination meetings (see Summary reports: INDC(NDS) - 411, 2000; INDC(NDS) - 424, 2001; and INDC(NDS) - 443, 200). PGAA is a non-destructive radioanalytical method, capable of rapid or simultaneous "in-situ" multi-element analyses across the entire Periodic Table, from hydrogen to uranium. However, inaccurate and incomplete data were a significant hindrance in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of complicated capture-gamma spectra by means of PGAA. Therefore, the main goal of the CRP was to improve the quality and quantity of the required data in order to make possible the reliable application of PGAA in fields such as materials science, chemistry, geology, mining, archaeology, environment, food analysis and medicine. This aim wasachieved thanks to the dedicated work and effort of the participants. The CD-ROM included with this publication contains the database, the retrieval system, the three CRM reports, and other important electronic documents related to the CRP. The IAEA wishes to thanks all CRP participants who contributed to the success of the CRP and the formulation of this publication. Special thanks are due to R. B. Firestone for his <b>leading</b> <b>roll</b> in the development of this CRP and his comprehensive compilation, analysis and provision of the adopted database, and to V. Zerkin for the software developments associatedwith the retrieval system. An essential component of this data compilation is the extensive sets of new measurements of capture gamma-ray energies and intensities undertaken at Budapest by Zs. Revay under the direction of G. L. Molnar. The extensive participation and assistance of H. D. Choi is also greatly appreciated. Other participants in this CRP were: R. M. Lindstrom, S. M. Mughabghab, A. V. R. Reddy, V. H. Tan and C. M. Zhou. Thanks are also due to S. C. Frankle and M. A. Lone for their active participation as consultants at some of the meetings. Finally, the participants wish to thank R. Paviotti-Corcuera (Nuclear Data Section, Division of Physical and Chemical Sciences), who was the IAEA responsible officer for the CRP, this publication and the resulting database. The participants are grateful to D. L. Muir and A. L. Nichols, successive Heads of the Nuclear Data Section, for their active and enthusiastic encouragement in furthering the work of the CRP...|$|E
