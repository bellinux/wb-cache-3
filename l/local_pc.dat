25|$|Mulroney had {{not been}} {{involved}} in politics at any level prior to entering St. Francis Xavier University {{in the fall of}} 1955 as a 16-year-old freshman. His political life began when he was recruited to the campus Progressive Conservative group by Lowell Murray and others, early in his first year. Murray would become a close friend, mentor, and adviser who was appointed to the Canadian Senate in 1979. Other important, lasting friendships made there by Mulroney included Gerald Doucet, Fred Doucet, Sam Wakim, and Patrick MacAdam. Mulroney enthusiastically embraced political organization, and assisted the <b>local</b> <b>PC</b> candidate in his successful 1956 Nova Scotia provincial election campaign; the PCs, led provincially by Robert Stanfield, swept to a surprise victory.|$|E

30|$|We {{utilized}} {{two kinds}} of voice recognition engines (Julius [39] on <b>local</b> <b>PCs</b> and Google Cloud Speech API on cloud) to accelerate the processing speed and provide a quick response. The voice is processed on <b>local</b> <b>PCs</b> at first and, if necessary, transfered to the cloud engine and processed accurately. More concretely, once a user speaks, the voice recognition engine on <b>local</b> <b>PCs</b> starts to recognize the sentence by Julius. If the PCs recognize the wake word “ROS-TMS”, the PC, which can send a fastest response among all PCs, replies with a boozer, and listens and transfers the following sentence to the cloud engine. From the cloud engine, the string of speech content is obtained and morphological analysis is performed to recognize {{the contents of the}} instruction. In this system, we utilize the morphological analysis library, “janome”, running on Python. After the morphological analysis, the string of speech content is divided into nouns and verbs. Next, by querying TMS_DB with the obtained nouns and verbs, the corresponding information about objects and tasks is obtained. Figure 11 shows the table stored in TMS_DB.|$|R

Brocade does not require installation of specific clients on the user’s desktop. Installation of software on <b>local</b> <b>PC’s</b> is kept to a strict minimum: a PDF reader and an application called Localweb which caters for ticket printing and provides basic circulation operations when the network fails.|$|R

25|$|On June 8, 2006, AOL {{offered a}} new program called AOL Active Security Monitor, a {{diagnostic}} tool which checked the <b>local</b> <b>PC's</b> security status, and recommended additional security software from AOL or Download.com. The program rated the computer {{on a variety of}} different areas of security and general computer health. Two months later, AOL released AOL Active Virus Shield. This software was developed by Kaspersky Lab. Active Virus Shield software was free and did not require an AOL account, only an internet email address. The ISP side of AOL UK was bought by The Carphone Warehouse in October 2006 to take advantage of their 100,000 LLU customers, making The Carphone Warehouse the biggest LLU provider in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Black {{joined the}} Ontario Liberal Party in 1985. He {{was elected to}} the Ontario {{legislature}} in the 1987 provincial election defeating Progressive Conservative candidate George Beatty in Muskoka-Georgian Bay, a new riding created by redistribution. Previously the area was represented by the riding of Muskoka which had been held by former Progressive Conservative premier Frank Miller until 1987, and the PCs were historically the dominant party in the area. Black was considered a strong candidate, however, and his victory was not entirely unexpected. Black credited his victory to a strong campaign team, popular satisfaction with Liberal leader David Peterson, and the fact that some <b>local</b> <b>PCs</b> were unhappy with party leader Larry Grossman.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Desktop Cloud {{can enhance}} {{business}} agility {{and reduce the}} total-cost-of-ownership, it introduces long network latencies {{and the power of}} <b>local</b> <b>PCs</b> cannot be utilized fully. This paper presents a light-weight mode for desktop cloud, which stores legacy desktop software in the cloud storage while streaming and running them on the user’s PC locally. In details, based on the light-weight virtualization, software can be converted into portable counterparts and stored in the cloud. Moreover, a run-time system is implemented, including a user-space file-system for cloud, to stream and run the remote software on local machines. Local cache and data pre-fetch mechanisms are also adjusted to suit the file-access-pattern of software. This prototype has been implemented and tests show it is practical for much daily-used software. Keywords- Cloud computing; user-space file system; OS-level virtualization I...|$|R

In addition to online multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from <b>local</b> <b>PCs.</b> Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera.

Silent Hunter 5 was first reported to have been compromised within 24 hours of release, but users of the cracked version soon found out that only early parts of the game were playable. The Uplay system works by having the installed game on the <b>local</b> <b>PCs</b> incomplete and then continuously downloading parts of the game-code from Ubisoft's servers as the game progresses. It {{was more than a}} month after the PC release {{in the first week of}} April that software was released that could bypass Ubisoft's DRM in Assassin's Creed II. The software did this by emulating a Ubisoft server for the game. Later that month, a real crack was released that was able to remove the connection requirement altogether.|$|R
30|$|<b>Local</b> {{nighttime}} <b>Pc</b> 3 s can {{be generated}} under moderate solar wind speed, and they are probably generated by a source inside the magnetosphere. Our analysis of auroral activity for the days when nighttime Pc 3 s are registered at middle latitudes has shown that a fraction of intervals with high (AE> 1000 nT) auroral activity for <b>local</b> night <b>Pc</b> 3 pulsations (Pc 3 n_L) exceeds that for night Pc 3 of day origin (Pc 3 n_D) and for the general sample. However, night Pc 3 pulsations occur at any AE level beginning with very low AE values. We have found that local geomagnetic disturbances that do not contribute to AE index {{may also be a}} source of night Pc 3 pulsations. This conclusion is confirmed by the local nature of correlation between geomagnetic activity with timescales of 30 – 50  min and the Pc 3 n_L occurrence rate.|$|R
50|$|Remote Utilities is {{a remote}} desktop {{software}} for Microsoft Windows that provides remote access from one PC to another PC over a LAN or via the Internet.

5000|$|Probably the {{thinnest}} clients (sometimes called [...] "Ultra Thin") are remote desktop applications, {{for example the}} X Window System, Citrix products and Microsoft's Terminal Services, which effectively allow applications to run on a centrally-hosted virtual PC and copy keystrokes and screen images between the <b>local</b> <b>PC</b> and the virtual PC.

40|$|A {{globally}} linear model, as {{implied by}} conventional Principal Component Analysis (PCA), may be insufficient to represent multivariate data in many situations. It {{has been known}} for some time that a combination of several "local " PCA's can provide a suitable approach in such cases [1, 2]. An important question is then how to find an appropriate partitioning of the data space together with a proper choice of the local numbers of principal components (PC's). In this contribution we address both problems within a density estimation framework and propose a probabilistic approach which is based on a mixture of subspace-constrained Gaussians. Thereby the number of <b>local</b> <b>PC's</b> depends on a global resolution parameter, which represents the assumed noise level and determines the degree of smoothing imposed by the model. As a consequence the model leads to an automatic resolution-dependent adjustment of the optimal principal subspace dimensionalities, which may vary among the different mixture co [...] ...|$|R
