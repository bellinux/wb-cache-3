5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology fell away, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of}} the age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row {{were sold}} to Springdale {{businessmen}} Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small section standing.|$|E
5|$|In Chinese {{development}} of Lhasa, Barkhor Square was encroached when the walkway around the temple was destroyed.

5|$|On July 2, 1962, SH-132 was {{extended}} to the south, reaching its present-day southern terminus. A minor realignment to the highway occurred in southern Grant County on January 7, 1963, the final change to SH-132's route. By 1963, the portion of highway in Grant County south of US-64 was paved, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> section extending from north of Nash to SH-11 as unpaved. This section was paved by 1967.|$|E
5|$|Stela 68 {{was found}} at the {{southeast}} corner of Mound61A on Terrace5. This stela was broken in two and the remaining fragments appear to belong to two separate monuments. The stela, or stelae, once bore early Maya sculpture but this appears to have been deliberately destroyed, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few sculptured symbols.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day {{was spent in}} launching airstrikes and a heavy artillery bombardment against the hilltop, totally denuding it of cover. On 23 November, 2-503 and 4-503 were ordered to renew their assault while the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry assaulted 875 from the south. This time the Americans gained the crest, but the North Vietnamese had already abandoned their positions, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few dozen charred bodies and weapons.|$|E

5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage. Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the stone facing has been robbed, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> rubble and mud core. This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the Commonwealth, 1649–60, {{wholesale}} iconoclasm was wrought on all the pictorial elements of Christian buildings. Most of England’s medieval stained glass was smashed. The majority of England’s medieval statues were smashed or defaced <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few isolated examples intact. Medieval paintings almost disappeared. Vestments embroidered in the famous style known as Opus Anglicanum were burnt. Those medieval Communion vessels that had escaped the Dissolution were melted down so that only about 50 items of pre-Reformation church plate remain.|$|E
5|$|Hernan {{continued}} to intensify {{and became the}} first major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherof the season on August 9. After reaching major hurricane status, Hernan steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane. The weakening continued, and Hernan was further downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11. As Hernan moved over cold waters, the convection associated with the storm dissipated, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> swirl of clouds. By the morning of August 12, almost all of the convection associated with Hernan had dissipated and the system was declared a remnant low-pressure area. The remnants of the hurricane caused light rain to Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October, Stalin {{ordered the}} {{evacuation}} of the Communist Party, the General Staff and various civil government offices from Moscow to Kuibyshev (now Samara), <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> limited number of officials behind. The evacuation caused panic among Muscovites. On 16–17 October, much of the civilian population tried to flee, mobbing the available trains and jamming the roads from the city. Despite all this, Stalin publicly remained in the Soviet capital, somewhat calming the fear and pandemonium.|$|E
5|$|Raetia {{maintained}} its Roman traditions {{longer than the}} rest of Switzerland, but most of it was eventually assimilated as well, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small territory where a Vulgar Latin dialect, Romansh, is spoken to this day. The assassination of Aetius in 454 and the subsequent retreat of Roman forces to the south of the Alps marked the definitive end of Roman power in Switzerland, {{and the beginning of the}} transition to the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> butterfly-shaped ring that she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his {{backyard}} where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping {{her for the first}} time he left her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E

5|$|Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his {{assistant}} Louise, {{the woman who had}} disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Ferdinand VII {{refused to}} renew the Spanish Constitution of 1812, {{returning}} the Empire to an absolutist method of government. Consequently, Ramírez contacted some of his allies in Philadelphia and commissioned the production of banknotes in denominations of 3 and 5 reales. The issues were printed by Murray, Draper, Fairman & Company and featured the signatures of treasurer José Bacener and Ramírez. The designs featured the Spanish Crown and Ferdinand VII's profile in the two varieties and were numbered manually. No official documentation, letter or decree from the Spanish Crown related {{to the creation of}} these notes have surfaced. These issues were collected and destroyed with extreme efficacy in 1866, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few dozen intact.|$|E
5|$|In Evansville, Indiana, Mission Broadcasting {{acquired}} then-independent station WTVW (now a CW affiliate) in 2011 {{with its}} former owner Nexstar Broadcasting retaining operational duties under an SSA. WTVW consolidated news operations with ABC affiliate WEHT, for which Nexstar traded WTVW to Mission {{in exchange for}} acquiring WEHT from Gilmore Broadcasting Corporation, and had its newscast output reduced through the reductions of its weekday morning newscast from four hours to two and its 6:00p.m. newscast – except on Sundays, where it remained one hour – from one hour to 30 minutes (<b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> two-hour morning newscast, half-hour noon and 6:30p.m. newscasts and an hour-long newscast at 9:00p.m.). Both stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as Eyewitness News.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{storage in}} the Pushkar Lake {{has been reduced}} alarmingly, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the {{situation}} became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks {{near one of the}} upper ghats, fed by tube wells from ground water sources. While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake.|$|E
5|$|The 17th Infantry Brigade was {{the last}} to land in Greece, {{arriving}} at Piraeus on 12April. Savige was placed in charge of Savige Force, consisting of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/11thInfantry Battalions, with armour, artillery, engineer and other support. He was given the mission of covering the Allied flank around Kalabaka. On 17April, Savige received orders to withdraw from Kalabaka, <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> rearguard behind. The road behind him, however, was packed with vehicles, and a crucial bridge on the only reasonably good road back had accidentally been demolished. Savige elected to disregard his orders and hold his position until the road was clear. He then managed to withdraw, although his driver's foot was broken in an air raid. Savige arrived back in Palestine on 1May 1941 and began the task of rebuilding his brigade. For the campaign in Greece, he received his fourth mention in despatches.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{badly damaged}} the {{remaining}} duck industry in Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and <b>leaving</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few large farms. Disruption {{caused by the}} Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although {{there is only one}} surviving flock of pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.|$|E
