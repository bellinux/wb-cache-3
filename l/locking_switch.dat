5000|$|An unusual {{interior}} change {{placed the}} power window switches {{flat against the}} door panel, whereas the window switches for the first generation and third generation extended from the door panels and were oriented in a horizontal position and were located underneath the drivers or occupants hands for easy location and use, and integrated into the door pull and armrest. The express up feature for the driver's window was also removed, leaving express down only. The power door <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> design was upgraded to a more conventional door <b>lock</b> <b>switch,</b> installed next to the power window switches, with a secondary power <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> installed for the front passenger. This approach was also used on the 1990-1993 Honda Integra ...|$|R

50|$|Compulsive {{checking}} {{can include}} compulsively checking {{items such as}} <b>locks,</b> <b>switches,</b> and appliances. This type of compulsion usually deals with checking whether harm to oneself or others is possible. Usually, most checking behaviors occur due to wanting to keep others and the individual safe.|$|R
50|$|The {{gauge cluster}} {{includes}} three basic gauges. The cluster is in a diamond formation, with the start key and pop-out <b>locking</b> <b>switch</b> {{is on the}} left point. The top of the cluster holds the gas gauge, which directly connects into the gas tank, behind the dashboard. The right point holds the amp gauge, which shows the charge rate of the generator. The bottom of the dash holds the speedometer and odometer. Additional gauges can be mounted below the cluster if desired.|$|E
50|$|For 1991 and onwards, the M30 {{received}} only minor improvements. If the exterior driver's side door {{handle of the}} coupe was pulled while the doors were locked, the keyhole would illuminate and the interior dome light would come on. There was also an available central <b>locking</b> <b>switch</b> placed next to the Sonar Suspension II adjuster, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a standard feature or option for 1991-1992 models. Main gauge cluster text was changed to match the rest of the Infiniti lineup, and engine oil temperature and fuel gauges were switched around. The speedometer was also changed to an electric-type, as opposed to the cable-type used on the 1990 model.|$|E
5000|$|Moving parts do {{not include}} any moving fluids, such as fuel, coolant or {{hydraulic}} fluid.

50|$|A larger radiator, {{heater core}} inlets and hoses were new, for {{improved}} coolant flow and heater performance. Door lock cylinders and ignition <b>lock</b> <b>switches</b> were also revised for greater theft protection. The standard 6.6 L (400 cid) V8 engine got a slight detuning for better fuel economy, while the 7.5 L V8 soldiered on {{for one more}} year.|$|R
50|$|The Door Control Unit is {{responsible}} for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles {{have more than one}} door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately. A DCU associated with the driver's door has some additional functionalities. This additional features are the result of complex functions like <b>locking,</b> driver door <b>switch</b> pad, child <b>lock</b> <b>switches,</b> etc., which are associated with the driver's door. In most of the cases driver door module acts as a master and others act as slaves in communication protocols.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), {{also called}} 7 TM receptors, form a huge {{superfamily}} of membrane proteins that, upon activation by extracellular agonists, pass {{the signal to}} the cell interior. Ligands can bind either to extracellular N-terminus and loops (e. g. glutamate receptors) or to the binding site within transmembrane helices (Rhodopsin-like family). They are all activated by agonists although a spontaneous auto-activation of an empty receptor can also be observed. Biochemical and crystallographic methods together with molecular dynamics simulations and other theoretical techniques provided models of the receptor activation based on the action of so-called “molecular switches ” buried in the receptor structure. They are changed by agonists but also by inverse agonists evoking an ensemble of activation states leading toward different activation pathways. Switches discovered so far include the ionic <b>lock</b> <b>switch,</b> the 3 - 7 <b>lock</b> <b>switch,</b> the tyrosine toggle switch linked with the nPxxy motif in TM 7, and the transmission switch. The latter one was proposed instead of the tryptophan rotamer toggle switch because no change of the rotamer was observed in structures of activated receptors. The global toggle switch suggested earlier consisting of a vertical rigid motion of TM 6, seems also to be implausible based on the recent crystal structures of GPCRs with agonists. Theoretical and experimental methods (crystallography, NMR, specific spectroscopic methods like FRET/BRET but also single-molecule-force-spectroscopy) are currently used to study the effect of ligands on the receptor structure, location of stable structural segments/domains of GPCRs, and to answer the still open question on how ligands are binding: either via ensemble of conformational receptor states or rather via induced fit mechanisms.

50|$|The {{primary safety}} {{concerns}} with dark territory {{stems from the}} lack of any form of direct or indirect train detection along the route. Train detection systems such as track circuits not only alert other trains to the presence of a potential hazard, but can also alert dispatchers or other monitoring systems to the same. Dark territory also lacks the ability to control or <b>lock</b> <b>switches</b> onto the main track, detect misaligned switches, broken rails or runaway rail cars. In most cases these drawbacks are mitigated by the light traffic and low speed of the trains in dark territory, but a runaway train (such as the crude oil unit train in 2013's Lac-Mégantic derailment) will not respect limits on speed and is not detectable by rail traffic controllers on a line with no signals or track circuits.|$|R

5000|$|Contemporary {{with the}} Scandinavian padlock, were the [...] "cast heart" [...] locks, so called {{because of their}} shape. A {{significantly}} stronger lock than the smokehouse and much more resistant to corrosion than the Scandinavian, the hearts had a lock body sand cast from brass or bronze and a more secure lever mechanism. Heart locks had two prominent characteristics: one was a spring-loaded cover that pivoted over the keyhole to keep dirt and insects out of the lock that was called a [...] "drop". The other was a point formed {{at the bottom of}} the lock so a chain could be attached to the lock body to prevent the lock from getting lost or stolen. Cast heart locks were very popular with railroads for <b>locking</b> <b>switches</b> and cars because of their economical cost and excellent ability to open reliably in dirty, moist, and frozen environments.|$|R
