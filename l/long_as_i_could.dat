Now try to play detached tones for twenty seconds and do you do it? Well I found {{that something was wrong}} because I couldn't play half, not even a fourth as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold a tone. When you play you must let only the amount of air pass the lips that is needed to produce the tone—no more. I went to work on this and now I can play an air or an allegro exercise as long as I can hold a tone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burge {{was born}} in Kangaroo Point, Queensland into a cricketing family. His father Thomas John [...] "Jack" [...] Burge was a {{salesman}} who rose to be a departmental manager of D. & W. Murray, a retail outlet, before becoming a state representative for Nile Industries, a textile firm. Jack Burge represented Eastern Suburbs in Brisbane's grade cricket competition and later became a cricket administrator. The elder Burge served on the Queensland Cricket Association executive from 1945 {{until his death in}} 1957. He also represented Queensland on the Australian Board of Control from 1952 until 1957, and was a state selector from 1944 until 1949. Peter recalled [...] "My dad was the best frustrated Test cricketer I ever knew. He always wanted to play, was involved in it for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first film}} {{to be based}} upon Moore's work was From Hell in 2001, which was {{directed}} by the Hughes Brothers. The film {{made a number of}} radical differences from the original comic, altering the main character from an older, conservative detective to a young character played by Johnny Depp. This was followed in 2003 with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a film that departed radically from the books, changing the ending from a mob war over the skies of London to the infiltration of a secret base in Tibet. For these two works, Moore was content to allow the filmmakers to do whatever they wished and removed himself from the process entirely. [...] "As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> distance myself by not seeing them," [...] he said, he could profit from the films while leaving the original comics untouched, [...] "assured no one would confuse the two. This was probably naïve on my part." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "When I was in {{high school}} I always planned to be a doctor and come back to Nacogdoches. The {{baseball}} was an accidental success, something I happened to be good at and so my plan was I'd do it <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always go back to being a doctor." [...] -Eddy Furniss Furniss graduated LSU with an academic major in zoology on a pre-medical track, and grade point averages above 3.5 in each of his last three years. He took his laboratory courses during the fall semester, so they did not distract from the baseball season in the spring semester.|$|R
2500|$|Simpson was a {{good student}} as a child but was also [...] "a clown" [...] and [...] "a smart aleck who used to make jokes in class. I did get in trouble a lot when I was older and then I didn't like school so much anymore." [...] She {{attended}} Beverly Hills High School and received a scholarship to attend University of California, Berkeley where she studied poetry:"I stuck with poetry as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> — {{as far as my}} talent would take me." [...] After she finished her B.A. at Berkeley, she worked at a job during the days and worked as a journalist during the nights and on the weekends. She enjoyed journalism and hoped for a position with the Richmond Independent Gazette but did not receive it. She then attended graduate school at Columbia University and received her M.F.A from there. While a student at Columbia, she was an editor for Paris Review.|$|E
2500|$|After all of Watchman Nee’s close {{co-workers}} {{were arrested}} on January 29, 1956, Tang and Ren were elected as elders, {{not by the}} congregation {{of the church in}} Shanghai, but by the [...] "Believers’ Political Re-education Committee," [...] which had been formed to oversee the political indoctrination of the church’s members. Tang and Ren cooperated in the PRC’s campaign to denounce Watchman Nee as a counterrevolutionary. Tang had earlier {{been a member of the}} Three-Self Standing Committee but withdrew from this position due to criticism by church members that he had betrayed the church in Shanghai. After his cooperation in denouncing Watchman Nee, Tang was reinstated and made a TSPM Vice Chairman. Under the leadership of Tang and Ren the Nanyang Road meeting hall built under Watchman Nee’s oversight for the church in Shanghai was given to the TSPM in 1958 and any semblance of the church in Shanghai’s meetings ceased. After undergoing re-education in a reform-through-labor (laogai) camp during the Cultural Revolution, Tang was reinstated as a Vice Chairman in the newly re-established TSPM and made a member of the standing committee of the China Christian Council, which was established by the TSPM in 1980. In July 1981 Tang issued a statement titled [...] "Pouring Out My Heart to the Party," [...] in which he said, [...] "I made a decision: anything that was expedient to the Party and our country, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it, I would do it and would do it well." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is <b>as</b> <b>I</b> thought," [...] Walter said; [...] "it is Sir James Carnegie, a recreant and villain {{knight and}} foul enemy of mine, {{a disgrace to}} his name and rank, but a brave man. So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> he lived <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never say that my life was safe from his machinations. Thank God, there is an end {{of him and his}} evil doings!" ...|$|R

Yesterday the scar itched, and after fifty years I recalled how it was dealt and the face of him who dealt it; dwelling a little in illusion. Followed that which thou didst see--strife and stupidity. Just is the Wheel! The idolater's blow fell upon the scar. Then I was shaken in my soul: my soul was darkened, and the boat of my soul rocked upon the waters of illusion. Not till I came to Shamlegh <b>could</b> <b>I</b> meditate upon the Cause of Things, or trace the running grass-roots of Evil. I strove all the long night.' ...|$|R
5000|$|I urged Mr. Johnson {{to accept}} my resignation. He refused and I was then {{elected to the}} office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors. I also urged Mr. Johnson to stop my salary of $25,000.00 per year, which they had kept up all during my illness, but Mr. Johnson replied that if the Victor Co. paid me that amount <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> lived they <b>could</b> not pay for what I had done for them. Twice, in the early days, by my action alone, I had saved the Victor Co. from going out of business.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! My dear! It {{would have}} looked so particular; {{and you know how}} I abhor doing that. <b>I</b> refused him <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{possibly}} <b>could,</b> but he would take no denial. You have no idea how he pressed me. I begged him to excuse me, and get some other partner--but no, not he; after aspiring to my hand, there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance, he wanted to be with me. Oh! Such nonsense! I told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches and compliments; and so--and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him, might take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening. I am so glad it is over! My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye was upon us." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was in {{the evening}} that we cast aside the cares and distractions {{of the day and}} really lived. Cards were thought to be too {{frivolous}} and empty a way of passing the time, so most of them played what they called a book game. You went out into the hall--to get an inspiration, I suppose--then you came in again with a muffler tied round your neck and looked silly, and the others were supposed to guess that you were [...] "Wee MacGreegor." [...] I held out against the inanity <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> decently <b>could,</b> but at last, in a lapse of good-nature, I consented to masquerade as a book, only I warned them that it would take some time to carry out. They waited for the best part of forty minutes, while I went and played wineglass skittles with the page-boy in the pantry; you play it with a champagne cork, you know, and the one who knocks down the most glasses without breaking them wins. I won, with four unbroken out of seven; I think William suffered from over-anxiousness. They were rather mad in the drawing-room at my not having come back, and they weren't a bit pacified when I told them afterwards that I was [...] "At the end of the passage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, I {{know you}} are ready to do anything, lad, and it is not your fault that you are not in harness; but, in the first place, I found it hard to spare you, and in the next, I wanted you to stick to your books <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> you <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> grant there are many {{officers}} even in His Majesty’s service who are as rough as if they had come in through the hawse-hole, but it tells against them. However, as you are past fifteen, I think now that you will do; and as you have been working steadily with me for the past four years, you have got a lot into your head that will give you an advantage over boys sent to sea two years younger.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I don't mind ownin' to {{you that}} they did; but not one in the gang knew it. I was bound to stick as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> an' a big lot of bluff helped me through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear their noise; {{but they}} are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good. Little Charles does not mind a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|After all my {{suffering}} {{upon this}} deeply interesting subject, here I am, wholly, unexpectedly, completely, {{out of the}} [...] "scrape"; and now I {{want to know if}} you can guess how I got out of it----out, clear, in every sense of the term; no violation of word, honor, or conscience. I don't believe you can guess, and so <b>I</b> might <b>as</b> well tell you at once. As the lawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had delayed the matter <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> in honor do (which, by the way, had brought me round into the last fall), I concluded <b>I</b> might <b>as</b> well bring it to a consummation without further delay; and so I mustered my resolution, and made the proposal to her direct; but, shocking to relate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her under the peculiar circumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the charge, I found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I tried it again and again but with the same success, or rather with the same want of success.|$|R
60|$|Now, on {{the right}} hand side of the Narrows as you go out, the land is quite high; and {{on the top of}} a fine cliff is a great castle or fort, all in ruins, and with the trees growing round it. It was built by Governor Tompkins in the time of the last war with England, but was never used, I believe, and so they left it to decay. I had visited the place once when we lived in New York, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> ago almost <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> remember, with my father, and an uncle of mine, an old sea-captain, with white hair, who used to sail to a place called Archangel in Russia, and who used to tell me that he was with Captain Langsdorff, when Captain Langsdorff crossed over by land from the sea of Okotsk in Asia to St. Petersburgh, drawn by large dogs in a sled. I mention this of my uncle, because he was the very first sea-captain I had ever seen, and his white hair and fine {{handsome}} florid face made so strong an impression upon me, that I have never forgotten him, though I only saw him during this one visit of his to New York, for he was lost in the White Sea some years after.|$|R

And I'm better pleased in a way than if he had come back rich. He might have wanted to take me away or build a fine house, and I'm {{too old to be}} making changes. And then he wouldn't have needed me. I'd have been of no use to him. As it is, it's just me he needs to look after him and coddle him. Oh, it's fine to have {{somebody}} to do things for, somebody that belongs to you. I was just dreading the loneliness of the winter, and now it's going to be such a happy winter. I declare last night Ralph and I sat up till morning talking over everything. He's had a hard life of it. Bad luck and illness right along. And last winter in the lumber woods he got his leg broke. But now he's come home and we're never going to be parted again <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> we live. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sing for joy, Jacob." ...|$|R
