50|$|After {{seeing the}} entire island (and {{traversing}} a shaky bridge {{known as the}} Shake-Shake Bridge), Thomas discovers a <b>logging</b> <b>station</b> which the Logging Locos are traversing around. He decides {{he wants to go}} back to Sodor and uses the Misty Island Tunnel, a tunnel that connects Misty Island to Sodor. However, as they are nearly halfway through the tunnel, the tunnel caves in on both sides causing them to get stuck. At the same time, the Logging Locos run out of oil. Thomas finds a hole in the ceiling of the cave which gives him an idea: he can puff smoke out through the hole and alert his friends of his location. The smoke soon alerts the rest of the gang of Thomas's location, convincing Percy and Whiff to go into the tunnel. Percy alerts Thomas of his presence, convincing Thomas he should break through the caved-in rocks himself. However, Whiff sternly corrects Thomas, saying he knows the tunnel more than he does. Thomas is soon convinced, allowing Percy and Whiff to break through. The three then haul the Logging Locos out of the tunnel and take them to be fixed up. However, Sir Topham Hatt, Edward, James and Gordon have all sailed to Misty Island in order to find Thomas, so Thomas rushes back to Misty Island and finds them just in time. Once he does, the Logging Locos are all welcomed to Sodor and there is a big celebration for the opening of the Sodor Search and Rescue Center.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A Clinical Log was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a medical student learning portfolio, aiming to develop a habit of critical reflection while learning was taking place, and provide feedback to students and the institution on learning progress. It was designed as a longitudinal self-directed structured record of student learning events, with reflection on these for personal and professional development, and actions planned or taken for learning. As incentive was needed to encourage student engagement, an innovative Clinical <b>Log</b> <b>station</b> {{was introduced}} in the OSCE, an assessment format with established acceptance at the School. This study questions: How does an OSCE Clinical <b>Log</b> <b>station</b> influence <b>Log</b> use by students? METHODS: The <b>Log</b> <b>station</b> was introduced into the formative, and subsequent summative, OSCEs with careful attention to student and assessor training, marking rubrics and the standard setting procedure. The scoring process sought evidence of educational use of the log, and an ability to present and reflect on key learning issues in a concise and coherent manner. RESULTS: Analysis of the first cohort's Log use over the four-year course (quantified as number of patient visits entered by all students) revealed limited initial use. Usage was stimulated after introduction of the <b>Log</b> <b>station</b> early in third year, with some improvement during the subsequent year-long integrated community-based clerkship. Student reflection, quantified by the mean number of characters in the 'reflection' fields per entry, peaked just prior to the final OSCE (mid-Year 4). Following this, very few students continued to enter and reflect on clinical experience using the Log. CONCLUSION: While the current study suggested that we can't assume students will self-reflect unless such an activity is included in an assessment, ongoing work has focused on building learner and faculty confidence in the value of self-reflection as part of being a competent physician.

40|$|An OSCE {{clinical}} log station: driving {{reflection on}} clinical competence development Hudson JN, Rienits H, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Wollongong Background: An electronic clinical log was introduced at an Australian 4 -year graduate entry medical {{school with the}} first intake of students in 2007. While some students embraced this log to record and reflect on their early clinical experiences, initial uptake of the log was low. Among the strategies used to encourage student use of this learning resource was the introduction of an innovative clinical <b>log</b> OSCE <b>station.</b> What was done: The clinical <b>log</b> <b>station</b> aimed to foster longitudinal recording and reflection on clinical experience and identification of significant learning issues in relation to patient and self-care, health promotion, teamwork and quality and safety. The scoring process sought evidence of educational use of the log. Demonstration of the marking sheet and standard setting procedure will illustrate how assessors scored performance using the following 3 main criteria: quantity and diversity of recorded experiences; case presentation; and reflection on development issues {{in relation to the}} presentation. Evaluation Findings: Student log use increased following introduction of the OSCE <b>log</b> <b>station,</b> but decreased following the final examinations. Student performance increased with experience of station expectations. Conclusions: While student ‘logging’ of clinical experience is important for quality assurance and to facilitate support of individual student development, assessment of this activity appears crucial to drive student engagement...|$|R
40|$|High {{throughput}} {{production of}} DNA profiles {{has now become}} routine by coupling multiplex amplification of STR loci with automated fluorescence-based detection of the PCR products during electrophoresis. However, to maximise the efficiency of production {{it is necessary to}} consider the streamlining, and automation of sample and data handling at all stages of the DNA profiling process. This issue has been addressed within the UK National DNA Database Unit by developing a microtitre plate-based robotic process for the manipulation of samples prior to electrophoresis. Buccal scrapes submitted to the unit for analysis are entered into the system using a custom built sample <b>logging</b> <b>station,</b> and DNA extraction is subsequently performed in deep-well microtitre plates. Automated quantification, dilution and PCR set-up are undertaken by a fully integrated robotic system comprising a 9 channel pipetting station, an articulated robotic arm on a linear 3 metre track, plate hotels, and a fluorimeter for DNA quantification using a PicoGreen-based assay. Following amplification, the PCR products are aliquotted by a second pipetting station and then loaded into an automated DNA sequencer by multi-channel pipette. Sample tracking and all data flow throughout the process are controlled by system supervisory software integrated with a bespoke laboratory information management system. This approach, coupled with newly developed expert systems for analysis of the output data, enables very high throughput of samples to be achieved, together with a significant reduction in manpower requirements and processing costs...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{a product}} with lower {{expenses}} is a situation that every farmer {{wants to be in}} and monitoring is an important tool used to provide understanding and a record of performance of a process. This project provides a way to monitor and log information about the performance of an irrigation pumping unit {{over an extended period of}} time, thereby allowing the farmer to use this data to make informed decisions on maintenance and overall efficiency of a pumping unit. The system consists of two main elements: a user configurable data <b>logging</b> <b>station</b> and a second element that controls the interaction between the user and the first element. Furthermore, each of these elements has an extended set of features as follows: The data logging element is able to log data from a set of separate sensors with outputs ranging from a 0 - 5 V analogue voltage through to a pulsed signal output. It also is able to communicate with a PC so that the information that is logged can be downloaded to a comma-separated-variable file for further analysis in a standard spread sheeting package such as Microsoft Excel. The interfacing element is made up of a numerical key pad for input of information into the system and a two by sixteen character liquid crystal display that presents the user with current readings from the sensors. There is a system of software procedures that allows these two components be independent and still communicate with each other thus allowing the input and display element to be in a separate location to that of the sensors and the data logging element. Currently, the system is able to read inputs from four separate sensors and store data for over two months, however, these limits are both easily upgradeable to eight or more sensor inputs and enough memory to last for over twelve months of data...|$|E

40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{in the area of}} optical scanning have made sophisticated equipment such as three-dimensional (3 D) log scanners available to the sawmill industry. In a typical Swedish sawmill, the measurements obtained from the 3 D log scanner placed at the <b>log</b> sorting <b>station</b> is used exclusively for scaling and sorting the sawlogs. In the same way, the information obtained from the 3 D log scanner placed at the saw intake is used exclusively for optimal positioning of the sawlog into the headrig. Meanwhile, large knowledge gaps regarding the flow and the origin of the sawlogs persist in the sawmill's daily routine. For the Swedish sawmills performing presorting of sawlogs, the most critical information gap exists between the <b>log</b> sorting <b>station</b> and the saw intake, where the forest log batch identity disappears, and the logs are mixed according to various sorting criteria. This study attempts to use the data generated by 3 D log scanners together with advanced recognition algorithms to develop a traceability system, marking/reading free, between the <b>log</b> sorting <b>station</b> and the saw intake when working with debarked logs. The originality of the fingerprint approach rests on the hypothesis that logs are separate entities with individual features. Measuring these features with the same type of measuring device at both the <b>log</b> sorting <b>station</b> and at the saw intake and then connecting the data to a common database will permit each individual sawlog to be tracked within the sawmill and will thus make it possible to develop an advanced raw material flow control.

The fingerprint approach is a traceability concept that in earlier studies has shown good potential for tracing logs between the <b>log</b> sorting <b>station</b> and the saw intake. In these studies, bark has been identified as a large source of measurement inaccuracy. This study was set out to investigate whether the fingerprint recognition rate could be improved when compensating for bark with traditional bark functions or a new automatic bark assessment based on the tracheid effect. The results show that the fingerprint recognition rate can be improved by using more sophisticated bark compensation. Compared to no bark compensation, improvements can be made by using the existing bark functions, and even further improvements can be made by using automatic bark assessment based on the tracheid effect. The results further show that the butt-end reducer between the <b>log</b> sorting <b>station</b> and the saw intake has a very negative effect on the fingerprint recognition rate, but that significant improvements in the recognition rate can be achieved by excluding the section of the log's butt end that is affected by the butt-end reduction.
