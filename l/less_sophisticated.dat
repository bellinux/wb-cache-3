5|$|The public {{remained}} mostly {{unaware of}} mass burials {{on the site}} until the 1990s, until the Sankofa Society conducted a well-publicized blessing ceremony in 1991. Kolkana refused to sell or donate the land {{back to the city}} of West Palm Beach, but halted any plans for construction on the property. In 1992, city work crews located human remains on the property using a backhoe. The bones were reburied, but their locations were marked. Resident Robert Hazard established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition in 1999 as a non-profit organization used to reacquire the land and solicit donations for a memorial complex. The complex was originally intended to include an educational center and a museum about African American pioneers and migrant farm workers, at a cost of approximately $6.1million. Organizations such as the Sankofa Society proposed a <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> plan of erecting an information wall and a large marble headstone, at a far less expensive cost of about $43,000.|$|E

We use a model of vertical product differentiation in order to claim that technologically- advanced EU firms (residing in high-income member countries) prefer a mutual market-opening with <b>less</b> technologically <b>sophisticated</b> countries than multilateral liberalization, which would necessarily involve the reciprocal opening of markets with other technologically-advanced countries. By the same token, <b>less</b> technologically <b>sophisticated</b> firms residing in low-income member countries would prefer an enlargement that is directed towards high-income countries.

The book's approach to narrative is generally realistic, and Cigarettes is ultimately moving in a way that none of his previous books attempted to be.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{differential}} {{effects of exposure}} and attention to news and of interpersonal communication on change in public opinion under the condition of onesided or two-sided information flows. Based on Zaller’s theory of public opinion dynamics, for <b>less</b> politically <b>sophisticated</b> individuals, we expected media to influence changes in opinion under the condition of a one-sided message flow. We further expected politically sophisticated individuals to rely more on cues for opinion change stemming from interpersonal communication. The study draws on two-wave panel surveys and media content analyses of television news and national newspapers. The results confirmed our hypotheses and showed media effects for <b>less</b> politically <b>sophisticated</b> individuals under the condition of a one-sided message flow and effects of interpersonal communication for politically sophisticated individuals. Media had no effect under the condition of a two-sided message flow. The study concludes {{with a discussion of}} the conditionality of media effects and the moderating role of political sophistication...|$|R

25|$|A {{major focus}} of Galactic Civilizations II is the {{artificial}} intelligence of its opponents, {{due in part to}} the deliberate omission of multiplayer in favor of the single player experience. The game offers 12 levels of AI intelligence for opponent civilizations. Full AI capability is granted at the 7th level ("intelligent"). Levels 1 through 6 implement <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> strategies/counter-strategies and (except for level 6) are hindered by economic handicaps. Levels 8 through 12 are aided by economic advantages and other bonuses.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary purpose}} is to measure both the {{amplitude}} and frequency of the aggregate reflected signal from multiple distances. This is used with weather radar to measure radial wind velocity and precipitation rate in each different volume of air. This is linked with computing systems to produce a real-time electronic weather map. Aircraft safety depends upon continuous access to accurate weather radar information {{that is used to}} prevent injuries and accidents. Weather radar uses a low PRF. Coherency requirements are not as strict as those for military systems because individual signals ordinarily {{do not need to be}} separated. <b>Less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> filtering is required, and range ambiguity processing is not normally needed with weather radar in comparison with military radar intended to track air vehicles.|$|E

Possible explanations include less careful underwriting on the part of brokers relative to banks when originating loans with multiple risk factors including prepayment penalties, and a greater propensity on the part of brokers to originate loans with prepayment penalties in locales with <b>less</b> financially <b>sophisticated</b> borrowers. State anti-predatory lending law provisions restricting the use of prepayment penalties eliminate the elevated foreclosure risk of broker originations relative to bank originations...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{political}} impact of entertainment television in Italy exploiting the staggered introduction of Berlusconi's commercial TV network, Mediaset, {{in the early}} 1980 s. We find that individuals with early access to Mediaset all-entertainment content {{were more likely to}} vote for Berlusconi's party in 1994, when he first ran for office. The effect persists for five elections and is driven by heavy TV viewers, namely the very young and the elders. Regarding possible mechanisms, we find that individuals exposed to entertainment TV as children were <b>less</b> cognitively <b>sophisticated</b> and civicminded as adults, and ultimately more vulnerable to Berlusconi's populist rhetoric...|$|R
5000|$|In older {{anthropology}} {{texts and}} discussions, the term [...] "primitive culture" [...] {{refers to a}} society believed to lack cultural, technological, or economic sophistication or development. For instance, a culture that lacks a written language might be considered <b>less</b> culturally <b>sophisticated</b> than cultures with writing systems; or a hunter-gatherer society might be considered less developed than an industrial capitalist society. Some Western authors, such as anthropologists and historians, used it to describe pre-industrial indigenous cultures, although such usage has become politically incorrect.

This work is at the document level. One can also classify a document's polarity on a multi-way scale, which was attempted by Pang and Snyder among others: Pang and Lee expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a 3- or a 4-star scale, while Snyder performed an in-depth analysis of restaurant reviews, predicting ratings for {{various aspects of the}} given restaurant, such as the food and atmosphere (on a five-star scale).|$|E
25|$|Instrument {{operator}} Ilya Usyskin (born 1910), {{son of a}} Jewish blacksmith from Vitebsk, {{studied at}} Moscow Technical University and Abram Ioffe's Physical-Technical Institute in Leningrad. At the age of 20 he published his first peer-reviewed articles on biophysical experiments suggested by Ioffe, although he himself leaned to nuclear physics. In 1932–1933 Usyskin designed portable, lightweight scientific instruments for stratospheric balloons, and was a natural choice for the Osoaviakhim-1 crew. At first Fedoseenko disliked Usyskin's personality but later changed his mind, assuring Ioffe of his full trust in Usyskin. According to the Mezheninov commission report, Usyskin considered {{his role in the}} January flight unnecessary, because it turned out that his portable cloud chambers were unsuitable for high-altitude experiments in winter and had to be replaced with <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> instruments.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is a brewed drink {{prepared}} from {{roasted coffee}} beans, {{which are the}} seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exported from Africa to {{countries around the world}} and coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> but stronger and more hardy robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.|$|E
40|$|The {{import of}} {{underground}} facilities in military {{strategy in the}} US grew exponentially after the Gulf War. The success of precision—guided conventional missiles meant that any above ground building or complex could be accurately targeted and destroyed, thus driving states with <b>less</b> <b>sophisticate</b> weapons to go underground to secure space for covert weapons development {{and the protection of}} command and control centers for military and governmental functions. Underground facilities have thus become the main challenge to objects of detection and targeting practices for US military research and development. This article provides a meditation on the underground in relation to military planning and technology, the limits of aerial visual control of terrain, the plans by the US military to counter underground defensive moves, the efficacy of teletechnologies to detect and destroy such installations at-a-distance, and an oblique genealogy of aerial and subterrestrial strategies in relation to technologies to overcome the limitations of each. In so doing, the paper argues a deeply connected relationship between the imaginary and the material in attempts to realize a mastery of space and populations essential to military operations, thus posing questions about sensory perception, the status of the subject with regard to agency and control, and the prosthetic outfitting of the subject that both supports and blunts agency and control.

Evidence also indicates that non-banks price prepayment penalties less favorably to borrowers than banks do, and non-banks originate disproportionately more loans with prepayment penalties in locales with <b>less</b> financially <b>sophisticated</b> borrowers. State anti-predatory lending law provisions restricting the use of prepayment penalties eliminate the elevated default risk of non-bank originations relative to bank originations. These findings are consistent with incentives generated by non-bank compensation via yield spread premiums on loans with prepayment penalties. foreclosure; prepayment penalties; mortgage brokers; financial regulation; anti-predatory lending laws. ...|$|R

A more detailed and accurate picture of the risk of investing in life annuities emerges, enabling prospective annuitants to differentiate among products that may appear seemingly uniform in terms of money’s worth, but vary widely in terms of their risk attributes...|$|R
25|$|Relative dating {{techniques}} (based on {{a presumption}} that technology progresses over time) suggest that Acheulean tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, {{but there is}} considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian, as well. It is therefore important not to see the Acheulean as a neatly defined period or one that happened {{as part of a}} clear sequence but as one tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of Acheulean techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term Acheulean does not represent a common culture in the modern sense, rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.|$|E
