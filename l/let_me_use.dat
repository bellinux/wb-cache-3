"Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] {{incorporated}} {{the use of}} the Electronic LinnDrum machine, {{and was one of the}} first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument. LinnDrum had been used sparingly in their previous single [...] "Do Your Dance", but in [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] its use was more spontaneous, which Dave Thompson, author of Funk noted as if [...] "it virtually duetted with Dickey, creating one of the most distinctive records of the year—and one of the most imitated of the age." [...] The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco's house, where Rose Royce lead singer Gwen Dickey was present during the recording. Buckmaster recalled: [...] "I was over at [...] place almost every day with Norman, and some days I stayed away to write, or to mix the music. Gene had given me the keys to his apartment, and also <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>use</b> the piano to record the song. I didn't want to work on at Miles' because his piano was falling to bits." ...|$|E

Lee said in an {{interview}} in 2005, [...] "all they do is write a story and try and fit the character in somewhere, which is very clear when you see the films. They gave me nothing to do! I pleaded with Hammer to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>use</b> some of the lines that Bram Stoker had written. Occasionally, I sneaked one in." [...] Although Lee may not have liked what Hammer was doing with the character, worldwide audiences embraced the films, which were all commercially successful.|$|E
