In the Palestinian culture, coffee and tea is traditionally served to adults during a visit or gathering, while juice is served to everyone. Drinks such as tamar hind or qamar deen are served during special occasions to everyone. Tamar hind, originally from Africa is a <b>liquorice</b> drink made by soaking or infusing <b>liquorice</b> sticks, and adding lemon juice. Qamar deen is traditionally served to break the Ramadan fast (as is water), and is an iced drink made from a dry sheet of apricots soaked in water, and mixed with lemon juice or syrup.|$|E

The {{results indicated that}} <b>liquorices</b> were easily to be ignited, the minimum ignition heat flux intensity theoretically can be speculated at 5. 8822 kW • m- 2;during the early time of the ignition of <b>liquorices,</b> {{in view of the}} thick carbonized layer formed on the surface of samples, which delayed the pyrolysis of <b>liquorices,</b> the peak heat release rate was greater under lower heat flux than other conditions, and the average heat release rate increased with the growth of heat flux; during the early time of the ignition of <b>liquorices,</b> specific extinction area and CO yield was higher; with the increase of heat flux, specific extinction area and CO yield decreased. Hence, the fire risk of <b>liquorices</b> can’t be ignored...|$|R

5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and <b>liquorice</b> milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E

The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). <b>Liquorice</b> milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} simple, rapid, and {{effective}} method for simultaneous detection of cartap (Ca), thiocyclam (Th), and tebufenozide (Te) in Chinese herbal medicines including Radix Angelicae Dahuricae and <b>Liquorices</b> using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) coupled with partial least squares regression (PLSR). The proposed method {{can handle the}} intrinsic interferences of herbal samples; satisfactory average recoveries attained from near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) PLSR models were 99. 0 ± 10. 8 and 100. 2 ± 1. 0 % for Ca, 100. 2 ± 6. 9 and 99. 7 ± 2. 5 % for Th, and 99. 1 ± 6. 3 and 99. 6 ± 1. 0 % for Te, respectively. Furthermore, some statistical parameters and figures of merit are fully investigated to evaluate {{the performance of the}} two models. It was found that both models could give accurate results and only the performance of MIR-PLSR was slightly better than that of NIR-PLSR in the cases suffering from herbal matrix interferences. In conclusion, FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with PLSR has been demonstrated for its application in rapid screening and quantitative analysis of multipesticide residues in Chinese herbal medicines without physical or chemical separation pretreatment step and any spectral processing, which also implies other potential applications such as food and drug safety, herbal plants quality, and environmental evaluation, due to its advantages of nontoxic and nondestructive analysis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: The {{side effects}} of drug {{consumption}} and also HSV resistance to drugs have been the factors attracting the researchers to herbal drugs. The major aim of the present research was in vitro assessment of possible anti-herpetic activity of glycyrrhiza gla-bra (<b>liquorices</b> root) methanolic extract in more details by performing Tissue Culture Infec-tive Dose fifty percent (TCID 50) method. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study Vero cells were incubated with different con-centrations of methanolic extracts of glycyrrhiza glabra. Neutral red assay was performed in order to consider the appropriate concentration of the extract. Pre-treatment of Vero cells with glycyrrhiza glabra extract before viral infection, incubation of HSV- 1 with glycyrrhiza glabra extract and treatment of vero cells with extract 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after viral in-fection, were exerted. TCID 50 was performed {{in order to assess}} the antiviral activity of the extract. The results were analyzed after performing the experiments at least three times. Results: Pre-treatment of Vero cells with methanolic extract for two hours and incubation of virus with extract for one and two hours prior to viral infection resulted in remarkable drop in TCID 50 amount by significant difference (P < 0. 001). Treatment of Vero cells with extract 1, 8 and 12 hours post-infection demonstrated significant changes in TCID 50. We observed significant fluctuations and different efficacy of the extract between different incubation time at 1 h & 4 h, 1 h & 24 h, 4 h & 8 h, 4 h & 12 h, 8 h & 24 h, 12 h & 24 h. Conclusion: The current study resulted in more novel findings of anti herpetic activity of gly-cyrrhiza glabra extract. Time course of extract treatment with virus- infected cells was an ef-ficient factor. In addition, the pretreatment of virus and also Vero cells with glycyrrhiza gla-bra extract in our experiment had important effects on the anti-viral activity of the extract.

40|$|The Sushruta Samhita, Charaka samhita and Astanga sangraha are the tri compendia of Ayurveda {{encompassing}} all {{the aspects}} of Ayurveda. Plastic surgery (Sandhana karma) is a very old branch of surgery described since Vedic era. Almost all the Samhitas described about the methods of Sandhana Karma (Plastic and reconstructive surgery). Now a day the world recognizes the pioneering nature of Sushruta’s {{plastic and reconstructive surgery}} and Sushruta is regarded as Father of Plastic surgery. The plastic operations of ear (otoplasty) and Rhinoplasty (Plastic Surgery of nose) are described in the 16 th Chapter of first book (Sutrasthan) of the compendium. First methods are described for piercing the earlobes of an infant which still is a widespread practice in India. Sushruta has described 15 methods of joining these cup-up ear lobes. For this plastic operation called karna bedha, a piece of skin was taken from the cheek, turned back, and suitably stitches the lobules. Sushruta has also described Rhinoplasty (Nasa Sandhana). Portion of the nose to be covered should be first measured with a leaf. Then a piece of skin of the required size should be dissected from the living skin of the cheek and turned back to cover the nose, keeping a small pedicle attaches to the cheek. The part of nose to which the skin is to be attached should be made raw by cutting of the nasal stump with a knife. The surgeon then should place the skin on the nose and stitch the two parts swiftly, keeping the skin properly elevated by inserting two tubes of eranda (castor oil plant) in each part of nostril so that the new nose gets proper shape. It should then be sprinkled with a powder composed of <b>liquorices,</b> red sandalwood, and barberry plant. Finally it should be covered with cotton and clean sesame oil should be constantly applied to it. Sushruta also mentioned the reconstruction of the broken lip and hare-lip (ostha Sandhana). These descriptions are brief in nature in comparison to Karnasandha (Plastic surgery of ear).

25|$|The MR is {{stimulated by}} both {{aldosterone}} and cortisol, but a mechanism protects {{the body from}} excess aldosterone receptor stimulation by glucocorticoids (such as cortisol), which happen to be present at much higher concentrations than mineralocorticoids in the healthy individual.

This enzyme co-localizes with intracellular adrenal steroid receptors and converts cortisol into cortisone, a relatively inactive metabolite with little affinity for the MR. <b>Liquorice,</b> which contains glycyrrhetinic acid, can inhibit 11β-HSD and lead to a mineralocorticoid excess syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Abruzzo's {{industrial}} sector expanded rapidly, especially in mechanical engineering, transportation equipment and telecommunications. The structure of {{production in the}} region reflects {{the transformation of the}} economy from agriculture to industry and services. Although industry has developed strongly, it retains weak points due to the existence of only a few large businesses alongside a huge fabric of small and medium-sized businesses. Both pure and applied research are carried out in the region, where there are major institutes and factories involved in research in the fields of pharmaceutics, biomedicine, electronics, aerospace and nuclear physics. The industrial infrastructure is spread throughout the region in industrial zones which have already been mentioned, the most important of which are Val Pescara, Val Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino. A further activity worthy of note is seaside and mountain tourism, which is of considerable importance to the economy of the region. Agriculture, involving small holdings, has succeeded in modernising and offering high-quality products. The mostly small, agricultural holdings produce wine, cereals, sugar beet, potatoes, olives, vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Traditional products are saffron and <b>liquorice.</b> Most famous in the world is Abruzzo's wine Montepulciano d'Abruzzo; in the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as being {{one of the most widely}} exported DOC classed wine in Italy.|$|E
