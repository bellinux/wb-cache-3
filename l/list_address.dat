5000|$|By contrast, {{the terms}} {{remailing}} or redistribution can sometimes mean re-sending {{the message and}} also rewriting the [...] "envelope sender" [...] field.

50|$|Elimination of VouchingVouching is the {{practice}} of allowing a voter with proper identification to vouch for the identity of another individual that lives in the same polling area. This allows for circumstances in which someone may have moved shortly before an election and not yet have identification showing the new address, or {{people who do not}} have driver's licenses. Approximately 120,000 voters in the last election used vouching. While there have been issues noted with the record keeping on vouching, there is no record of vouching resulting in someone voting improperly. While some challenged the need for eliminating vouching, the Conservatives pointed out that Elections Canada recognizes 39 types of identification. The amendments to the bill proposed by the Conservatives on April 25 modified this provision to allow a voter with identification to sign a written oath of his or her residence and have that co-signed by another voter with fully proven ID. This process, for example, allows an aboriginal with a status Indian card, which does not <b>list</b> <b>address,</b> to use that ID and sign an oath regarding his or her residency. Exempting fundraising costs related to previous donorsThe bill exempted from campaign spending limits the costs of fundraising efforts directed at people who had donated $20 or more in the previous five years. This would have allowed parties to spend unlimited funds on soliciting renewal of support from past supporters. A concern was this would provide additional benefit to the party with the largest current support base, which is currently the Conservatives. The amendments announced by the Conservatives on April 25 removed this provision.|$|E

50|$|Fan mail {{may be in}} {{the form}} of letters, cards, artworks, gifts, {{comments}} on social media accounts, and so on. People send fan mail to various public entertainers and public figures such as politicians, athletes, actors, artists, writers, singers, bands, coaches of sport teams, bloggers, and social media stars. Responses can take {{a great deal of time}} to come or never come at all. Since a major celebrity or public figure may receive thousands of pieces of fan mail every day, it is usually impossible for him/her to reply to or read them all and as a result his/her managers, or management team, often have the duty of canvassing the incoming mail. Normally fan mail should be sent to the office of the celebrity's management as there are websites such as FanMail.Biz and FanMail that will provide and <b>list</b> <b>addresses</b> for fans. <b>Addresses</b> <b>listed</b> are often those of the public figures management and representative team within the Hollywood business.
