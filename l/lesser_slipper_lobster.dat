50|$|Scyllarus arctus is {{a species}} of slipper lobster which lives in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic Ocean.

50|$|Scyllarides haanii, the Aesop <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster,</b> is {{a marine}} decapod crustean {{in the family}} Scyllaridae. Other common names include the humpbacked <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> and the ridgeback <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster.</b>|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{catch and}} effort data were {{fit to the}} Leslie model to {{estimate}} preexploitation abundance and the catchability coefficient of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster,</b> Scyllarides squammosus, in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). A single vessel fished for 34 consecutive days {{in the vicinity of}} Laysan Island and caught 126, 127 total <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> in 36, 170 trap hauls. Adjusted catch of legal <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> dropped from a high of 3. 70 to 1. 16 lobster per trap haul. Preexploitation abundance at Laysan Island was an estimated 204, 000 legal <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster,</b> which was extrapolated to yield an estimate of 1. 2 X 106 to 3. 8 X 106 lobster for the entire NWHI <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery...|$|R

50|$|Cancrinos differs most {{markedly}} {{from other}} related animals by {{the form of}} the second antennae, which are flattened towards the end, approaching the state seen in living <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Unlike living <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters,</b> however, the flattened, distal parts of the antennae retain the ancestral state of comprising many segments, rather than being reduced to a single element.|$|R
50|$|Palibacus praecursor is {{a fossil}} species of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster,</b> the only {{species in the}} genus Palibacus. It was found in Cenomanian (Cretaceous) {{deposits}} at Hakel, Lebanon and described in 1886 by the German palaeontologist W. Dames. Its similarity to modern <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> demonstrates that the main features of that group had already evolved by the mid-Cretaceous.|$|R

The methods used for catching <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> varies depending on the species' ecology. Those that prefer soft substrates, such as Thenus and Ibacus, are often caught by trawling, while those that prefer crevices, caves and reefs (including Scyllarides, Arctides and Parribacus species) are usually caught by scuba divers.|$|R

Although previously considered a family in their own right (Synaxidae Spence Bate, 1881), the furry lobsters were subsumed into the family Palinuridae in 1990, and molecular phylogenies support the inclusion of the furry lobsters in the family Palinuridae.
