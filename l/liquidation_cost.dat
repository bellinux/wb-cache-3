30|$|Section  5.1 {{analyzes}} {{a variation}} of the model where supervisory responsibilities increase the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> by an amount Δ > 0, in which case hierarchical supervision entails a positive <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> for the central supervisor.|$|E
30|$|To formalize this idea, {{suppose that}} δ _c= 0 and δ _l> 0 are the {{liquidation}} {{costs for the}} central and the local supervisor, respectively, {{in the absence of}} supervisory responsibilities, and that such responsibilities add Δ to these costs. Thus, the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> of the local supervisor will be δ _l+Δ under decentralized supervision and δ _l under hierarchical supervision, whereas the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> of the central supervisor will be Δ under both centralized and hierarchical supervision.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{framework}} for modeling portfolio risk which integrates market risk with <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> which may arise in stress scenarios. Our model provides a systematic method for computing liquidation-adjusted risk measures for a portfolio. Calculation of Liquidation-adjusted VaR (LVaR) for sample portfolios reveals a substantial impact of <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> on portfolio risk for portfolios with large concentrated positions...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relation}} between the portfolio decisions that financial intermediaries make to avoid bank runs and the <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> of capital investment. This relation also influences economic growth. This paper shows that if financial intermediaries avoid runs, there exist three regions of <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs.</b> Changes in liquidity costs in each region have different effects on economic growth in a simple endogenous growth model. We also examine portfolio decisions in an economy without financial intermediaries. This reveals the significance of financial sector for economic growth. (JEL G 11, E 13, D 82, E 44...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how expected <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> affect a firm's investment and financing decisions. We hypothesise that comovement of firm and industry sales measures such costs, which create {{a premium on}} external finance and make investment {{more sensitive to the}} availability of internal funds. Supportive evidence for this conjecture is obtained from the investment behaviour of a sample of 206 large Dutch manufacturing firms observed during the period 1983 - 1996. We also demonstrate that our measure of expected <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> does not convey the same information that other proxies for the premium on external finance - like leverage, retention practice or firm size - already contain.

30|$|I {{would like}} to {{conclude}} with a few remarks. First, the model assumes that the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> is fully driven by capture. However, {{it may be the}} case that (at least part of) the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> is also a social cost, that is internalized by the local supervisor but not by the central supervisor. In this case, having a more biased (local) supervisor could be better than having a less biased (central) supervisor, so the region in the parameter space where decentralized supervision dominates becomes larger.|$|E
30|$|In {{this figure}} {{the cost of}} effort {{parameters}} are γ _c= 0.001 and γ _l= 0.00075, and the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> parameters are δ _c= 0 and δ _l= 0.025.|$|E
30|$|Two {{extensions}} of the model are discussed. The first one examines {{what happens when the}} supervisory bias is linked to being responsible for the liquidation decision. This means that moving from decentralized to hierarchical supervision implies a reduction in the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> of the local supervisor and an increase in the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> of the central supervisor. In this case, the results show that there will be an increase in the (cheaper) effort of the local supervisor that will compensate the reduction in the effort of the central supervisor, so hierarchical supervision is more likely to dominate.|$|E
30|$|One notable recent {{adjustment}} to VaR {{has been proposed}} in the paper Risk management for whales (Cont and Wagalath, 2016) and it involves the inclusion of <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> in the risk management model for financial portfolios. The paper explicitly refers to the famous 2012 ‘London whale’ incident, in which JP Morgan lost USD 6.2 billion in <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> while trying to reduce its risk-weighted assets. The liquidation component of the model is designed to capture the price impact of large sales. They show that a standard model that neglects liquidity issues would have estimated a VaR five times lower than their LVaR. A warning on the riskiness of liquidating a large portfolio might suggest to a bank to revise their exit strategy.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{macroeconomic}} {{effects of}} financial shocks {{through the lens}} of delayed capital liquidation and reallocation among firms. I develop a model in which firms face idiosyncratic productivity risks, financial constraints, and random <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs.</b> <b>Liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> generate an option value of staying and a liquidation delay for unproductive firms. A novel feature arising from the delay is that unproductive firms have a higher debt-to-asset ratio than productive ones. I find that adverse financial shocks that tighten financial constraints can raise the option value. The financial shocks also have general equilibrium effects that further raise the option value and delay capital liquidation. Capital is thus persistently misallocated, leading to a long-lasting economic contraction. Using U. S. data from 1971 - 2015, I show that financial shocks can explain almost 67...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the debt {{capacity of a}} risky asset when debt is being rolled over {{and there is a}} <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> in case of default. We show that debt capacity depends on how information {{about the quality of the}} asset is revealed. When the information structure is based on “optimistic” expectations, the arrival of no news about the asset is good news; under this structure, debt capacity does not depend upon rollovers and <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost,</b> and is simply equal to expected cash flows from the asset. In contrast, when the information structure is based on “pessimistic” expectations, no news about the asset is bad news; under this structure, debt capacity of the asset is decreasing in the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> and frequency of rollovers. In the limit, as the number of rollovers becomes unbounded, the debt capacity goes to zero even for an arbitrarily small default risk. Our model explains why markets for rollover debt, such as asset-backed commercial paper, may experience sudden freezes. The model also provides an explicit formula for the haircut in secured borrowing or repo transactions. asset-backed commercial paper; credit risk; haircut; liquidation cost; repo; secured borrowing...|$|E
3000|$|The intuition is as follows. Consider {{the effect}} of {{introducing}} the additional cost Δ on a point in Fig.  8 on the original boundary between Regions D and H. By our comparative statics results in Sect.  3, this {{will lead to a}} shift {{to the left of the}} reaction function of the central supervisor (due to the increase in its <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> by Δ [...]) and a shift upwards of the reaction function of the local supervisor (due to the equivalent reduction in its <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> by Δ), leading to a reduction in the equilibrium effort e_c^* of the central supervisor and an increase in the (cheaper) equilibrium effort e_l^* of the local supervisor, which explains that the original boundary point is now inside Region H.|$|E
30|$|Figure  8 {{shows the}} results. 24 The {{assumption}} {{that part of}} the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> incurred by the supervisors is linked to whether they are responsible for the liquidation decision expands Region H where hierarchical supervision is optimal at the expense of Regions D and C where decentralized and centralized supervision are optimal.|$|E
40|$|We analyze optimal risk {{management}} strategies {{of a bank}} financed with deposits and equity in a one period model. The bank's motivation for {{risk management}} comes from deposits {{which can lead to}} bank runs. In the event of such a run, <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> arise. The hedging strategy that maximizes the value of equity is derived. We identify conditions under which well known results such as complete hedging, maximal speculation or irrelevance of the hedging decision are obtained. The initial debt ratio, the size of the <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs,</b> regulatory restrictions, the volatility of the risky asset and the spread between the riskless interest rate and the deposit rate are shown to be the important parameters that drive the bank's hedging decision. We further extend this basic model to include counterparty risk constraints on the forward contract used for hedging...|$|R
40|$|Titman (1984) is {{the first}} to argue that {{non-financial}} stakeholders (customers, suppliers and employees) pass on their expected <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> to the firm. In his framework, firms can influence the probability of liquidation by choosing an appropriate capital structure. Other studies have reasoned that the bargaining power of non-financial stakeholders (NFS) may also impact on financing decisions. This paper investigates these ideas in a sample of first-time business start-ups, where ex-ante failure risk is high and NFS have to make relationship-specific investments. We find that the size of NFS <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> significantly reduces leverage and the proportion of bank loans. These effects are strengthened when suppliers have strong bargaining power. Finally, start-ups reduce their reliance on bank loans when customers and suppliers are in a powerful bargaining position.

In particular, it shows that supervisory effort e is decreasing {{in the cost of}} effort parameter γ and in the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> δ incurred by the supervisor.

30|$|These {{comparative}} static {{results are}} in line with the ones obtained in the model with a single supervisor, where supervisory effort is decreasing in the cost of effort γ, the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> δ, and the expected return R, and is increasing in the standard deviation σ. But in the game between the two supervisors the first two changes lead to an increase in the equilibrium effort of the supervisor not affected by the parameter changes.|$|E

Market exit and shutdown are sometimes separate events. The decision whether to shut down or operate is not affected by exit barriers.

This increase, which does not obtain under centralized supervision, explains that the original boundary point is now inside Region H.|$|E
40|$|A risk-neutral {{producer}} faces liquidity constraint {{that forces}} him to liquidate real assets in imperfect markets if he cannot meet his cash obligation, entailing a fixed <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost.</b> Under this risk of liquidation, the risk-neutral producer {{is shown to}} refuse to undertake a risky project with positive expected excess return, exhibiting first-order risk aversion. The optimal output level of the producer is piecewise linear in wealth; it decreases or increases {{depending on whether the}} expected excess return is positive or negative. The producer's apparent utility function exhibits an S-shaped curve when the initial liquid assets are affected by a background risk that is normally distributed.

40|$|Credit {{derivatives}} allow creditors {{to transfer}} debt cash flow rights to other market participants while retaining control rights. Theory predicts that this transfer can create empty creditors {{that do not}} fully internalize <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> and liquidate borrowers excessively often. This empty creditor problem is concentrated in firms whose creditors would face powerful shareholders in distressed debt renegotiations. Consistent with this prediction, we show that (1) creditors buy more CDS protection when facing strong shareholders, and that (2) CDS trading reduces the distance-to-default, investment, and value of firms with powerful shareholders.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model to study how {{conditional}} lending and immediate liquidity provision affect incentives for fiscal adjustment in a country facing the risk of sovereign default. Conditional lending provides explicit incentives for fiscal adjustment but immediate liquidity provision is more effective in reducing <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs.</b> For some parameters, immediate liquidity provision induces fiscal adjustment and debt repayment, while conditional lending does not (and vice-versa). Incentives for fiscal adjustment are concave in the fraction of lending provided under conditionalities. A large cost of tight fiscal policy shifts the balance towards immediate liquidity provision. ...|$|R

The same is true for changes in the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> and the term premium.

40|$|We derive {{the optimal}} dynamic {{contract}} in a continuous-time principal-agent setting, and implement {{it with a}} capital structure (credit line, long-term debt, and equity) over which the agent controls the payout policy. While the project's volatility and <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> have little impact on the firm's total debt capacity, they increase the use of credit versus debt. Leverage is nonstationary, and declines with past profitability. The firm may hold a compensating cash balance while borrowing (at a higher rate) through the credit line.

3000|$|The {{comparison}} between these institutional arrangements focusses on [...] two key {{parameters of the}} model: the cost of effort of the central supervisor, captured by parameter γ _c, which is higher than parameter γ _l corresponding to the local supervisor, and the <b>liquidation</b> <b>cost</b> of the local supervisor, captured by parameter δ _l, which is higher than parameter δ _c= 0 corresponding to the central supervisor. As noted above, the first assumption may be justified by reference to geographical as well as cultural distance between the central supervisor and the local bank, while the second may be justified by reference to the looser connections between the central supervisor and local lobbies and pressure groups.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the toughness of bankruptcy law on the number of liquidations in a simple model of borrowing and lending with asymmetric information, where the creditor cannot credibly commit to liquidate the firm if the default occurs.

We find that there is an interval of the bankruptcy law, where the number of liquidations decreases in the toughness of the bankruptcy law.

This paper models a "dark side" of wholesale funding. In an environment with a costless but noisy public signal on bank project quality, short-term wholesale financiers have lower incentives to conduct costly monitoring, and instead may withdraw based on negative public signals, triggering inefficient liquidations. Comparative statics suggest that such distortions of incentives are smaller when public signals are less relevant and project <b>liquidation</b> <b>costs</b> are higher, e. g., when banks hold mostly relationship-based small business loans. ...|$|R
