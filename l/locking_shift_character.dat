50|$|Sometimes {{it may be}} {{used for}} Arabic {{language}} as well, but the Eastern digits (encoded here in their Persian-Hindu variant) won't be used in that case because standard Arabic prefer its traditional Eastern Arabic digits, and will frequently be replaced by Western Arabic digits (encoded in the <b>locking</b> <b>shift</b> <b>character</b> set in column 0x30) which are also used now frequently in Urdu as well. However, in India, phones recognizing the Arabic language indication may substitute the Persian-Hindu variants of the Eastern Arabic digits by the traditional Eastern Arabic digits.|$|E
50|$|The {{figure shift}} (FIGS) and letter <b>shift</b> (LETRS) <b>characters</b> {{determined}} how {{the receiving end}} interpreted the string of characters up to the next <b>shift</b> <b>character.</b> Because {{of the danger of}} a <b>shift</b> <b>character</b> being corrupted, some operators would type a pair of <b>shift</b> <b>characters</b> when changing from letters to numbers or vice versa. So they would type 55M88 to represent a full stop. Such doubling of characters was very helpful for the statistical cryptanalysis used at Bletchley Park. After encipherment, <b>shift</b> <b>characters</b> had no special meaning.|$|R

5000|$|Due to the {{stateful}} {{nature of}} ISO/IEC 2022, an identical and equivalent character may be encoded in different character sets, {{which may be}} delegated to any of G0 through G3, which may be accessed using single shifts or by using <b>locking</b> <b>shifts</b> to GL or GR. Consequently, characters can be represented in multiple ways, meaning that two visually identical and equivalent strings can not be reliably compared for equality.|$|R

50|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout used, holding down the shift key while Caps Lock is already on is either ignored (because all keys are already shifted), will also shift keys which are not being <b>shifted</b> by Caps <b>Lock</b> alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>shifts</b> all keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where Caps <b>Lock</b> only <b>shifts</b> alphabet keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where Shift will temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if Caps Lock is currently active or not. The inverting behaviour of the Shift key {{is the most common}} variant on English keyboards.|$|R

50|$|In practice, {{the escape}} {{sequences}} declaring the national character sets may be absent if context or convention dictates {{that a certain}} national character set is to be used. For example, ISO-8859-1 states that no defining escape sequence is needed and RFC 1922, which defines ISO-2022-CN, allows ISO-2022 <b>SHIFT</b> <b>characters</b> to be used without explicit use of escape sequences.|$|R

50|$|A key {{providing}} one of {{the functions}} Capitals lock (usually called “Caps Lock”), Level 2 lock (i. e. “Shift lock”), or Generalized lock shall be present, occupying the position C00. (The function “Generalized lock” is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series). It is to {{be noted that the}} specific way the Caps <b>Lock</b> or <b>Shift</b> <b>Lock</b> works (i. e. swapping the lock state by hitting the key, as it is usually implemented) is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series. Thus, solutions avoiding the status dependency as well as the problem of inadvertent hitting (e.g., the lock key pressed together with <b>Shift</b> turns <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> on, together with AltGr turns Caps Lock on, pressed alone switches off any lock status but has no effect when no lock status is activated) would not prevent compliance to the standard.|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} above, the Caps Lock behaviour in most QWERTY keyboard layouts {{differs from}} the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> behaviour in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the Commodore 64, had a <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> but no Caps Lock; others, such as the BBC Micro, had both, only one {{of which could be}} enabled at a time.|$|R
2500|$|On modern keyboards, the {{exclamation point}} is the <b>shifted</b> <b>character</b> on the 1 key, {{a direct result of}} the {{historical}} fact that these were the last characters to become [...] "standard" [...] on keyboards.

50|$|Instead of {{directing}} equivalent sp3 orbitals towards {{all four}} substituents, <b>shifting</b> s <b>character</b> towards the C-H bonds will stabilize those bonds greatly {{because of the}} increased electron density near the carbon, while <b>shifting</b> s <b>character</b> away from the C-F bond will increase its energy by a lesser amount because that bond's electron density is further from the carbon. The atomic s character on the carbon atom has been directed toward the more electropositive hydrogen substituents {{and away from the}} electronegative fluorine, which is exactly what Bent's rule suggests.|$|R
50|$|Sociologists {{representing}} {{symbolic interactionism}} argue that social rules are created through {{the interaction between}} the members of a society. The focus on active interaction highlights the fluid, <b>shifting</b> <b>character</b> of social rules. These are specific to the social context, a context that varies through time and place. That means a social rule changes over time within the same society. What was acceptable in the past may no longer be the case. Similarly, rules differ across space: what is acceptable in one society may not be so in another.|$|R
50|$|The Kermit {{protocol}} supports {{text and}} binary file transfers on both full-duplex and half-duplex 8 bit and 7-bit serial connections in a system- and medium-independent fashion, and is implemented {{on hundreds of}} different computer and operating system platforms. On full-duplex connections, a Sliding Window Protocol is used with selective retransmission which provides excellent performance and error recovery characteristics. On 7-bit connections, <b>locking</b> <b>shifts</b> provide efficient transfer of 8-bit data. When properly implemented, as in the Columbia University Kermit Software collection, its authors claim performance is equal to or better than other protocols such as ZMODEM, YMODEM, and XMODEM, especially on poor connections. On connections over RS-232 Statistical Multiplexers where some control characters cannot be transmitted, Kermit can be configured to work, unlike protocols like XMODEM that require the connection to be transparent (i.e. all 256 possible values of a byte to be transferable).|$|R
