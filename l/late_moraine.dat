40|$|International audienceSurface {{exposure}} dating (SED) is {{an innovative}} tool already being widely applied for moraine dating and for Late Quaternary glacier and climate reconstruction. Here we present exposure ages of 28 boulders from the Cordillera Real and the Cordillera Cochabamba, Bolivia. Our {{results indicate that}} the local Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Eastern Cordilleras occurred at ~ 22 ? 25 ka and was thus synchronous to the global temperature minimum. We were also able to date several <b>Late</b> Glacial <b>moraines</b> to ~ 11 ? 13 ka, which likely document lower temperatures and increased precipitation ("Coipasa" humid phase). Additionally, we recognize the existence of older <b>Late</b> Glacial <b>moraines</b> re-calculated to ~ 15 ka from published cosmogenic nuclide data. Those may coincide with the cold Heinrich 1 event in the North Atlantic region and the pronounced "Tauca" humid phase. We conclude that (i) exposure ages in the tropical Andes may have been overestimated so far due to methodological uncertainties, and (ii) although precipitation plays an important role for glacier mass balances in the tropical Andes, it becomes the dominant forcing for glaciation only in the drier and thus more precipitation-sensitive regions farther west and south...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the potential of the}} Schmidt hammer for relative age dating of <b>Late</b> Pleistocene <b>moraines</b> and rock glaciers, rebound (R) values were collected at 38 sites in two formerly glaciated valleys in the Western Tatras in northern Slovakia. A large statistical population of measurements obtained from moraine and rock glacier surfaces was used to analyze the variability of mean R-values in the same lithology and overall southern valley exposition. Four separate sets of glacial/periglacial morphosystems are present at different positions in the Western Tatras starting from valley outlets to the highest cirques, which represent successive phases of deglaciation. R-value means and 95 % confidence intervals for selected Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and Late Glacial (LG- 1, LG- 2 and LG- 3) stages (respectively, 40. 1 ± 1. 1, 46 ± 0. 5, 53. 5 ± 1. 0 and 60. 5 ± 0. 3) are significantly statistically different and values for each age category are comparable for the two analyzed valleys. The results of weathering indexes used in conjunction with geomorphological relationships were taken together to reconstruct the pattern of deglaciation on southern Tatra slopes. It is stated that the Schmidt hammer technique may be successfully used as a relative age dating tool for Late Pleistocene glacial and periglacial deposits, and with this method, it is possible to differentiate between <b>Late</b> Glacial <b>moraines</b> and rock glacier systems of different age...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{modification}} processes {{leading to}} large debris accumulations in high-relief mountain areas {{are important for}} understanding landscape evolution, especially in some of Earth’s most active orogens. The Arroumd rock avalanche {{at the foot of}} the NW face of Mount Aksoual (3912 m above sea level [masl]) in the Jebel Toubkal area of the High Atlas, Morocco, represents one of the largest mass movement landforms in North Africa. The age and origin of this extensive feature have been contested for over a century. <b>Late</b> Pleistocene <b>moraines</b> are also present in the same valley, adjacent to the avalanche debris. The mean of six 10 Be cosmogenic exposure ages shows that a series of catastrophic rock slope failures occurred at 4. 5 ± 0. 5 ka, while a set of eight exposure ages from two of the three mapped moraines has a far larger spread from 1. 5 to 7. 5 ka. This suggests that the avalanche events were effective agents in modifying the true surface exposure age of the Pleistocene moraines in the Arroumd valley. This has resulted in similar mean 10 Be apparent exposure ages for the preexisting <b>Late</b> Pleistocene <b>moraine</b> surfaces and Holocene catastrophic rock slope failures. Similar rock avalanche deposits are present in other glaciated valleys in the High Atlas. We conclude that the trigger for collapse was seismic activity related to proximity of the major Tizi n’Test fault. These findings have important implications for interpreting and dating glacial landforms in tectonically active settings...|$|R

In addition to the oldest glacial deposits (McLeod Creek Drift), a group of four <b>late</b> Pleistocene <b>moraines</b> (MP-I, II, III and IV) and three late Holocene till deposits (2 ̆ 7 X 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Y 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Z 2 ̆ 7 drifts) {{are present in the}} region, representing at least eight glacial advances. The 10 Be TCN ages for the MP-I moraine ranged from 2. 5 kyr to 146 kyr, which highlights the problems of defining the ages of <b>late</b> Quaternary <b>moraines</b> using SED methods in central Alaska. The Muldrow 2 ̆ 7 X 2 ̆ 7 drift has a 10 Be TCN age of similar to 0. 54 kyr, which is similar to 1. 3 kyr younger than the independent minimum lichen age of similar to 1. 8 kyr. This age difference probably represents the minimum time between formation and early stabilization of the moraine. Contemporary and former equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) were determined. The ELA depressions for the Muldrow glacial system were 560, 400, 350 and 190 m and for the Peters glacial system 560, 360, 150 and 10 m, based on MP-I through MP-IV moraines, respectively. The difference between ELA depressions for the Muldrow and Peters glaciers likely reflects differences in supraglacial debris-cover, glacier hypsometry and topographic controls on glacier mass balance...|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{marine and}} ice-core proxy climate records {{indicate}} that the Earth's orbital geometry modulates long-term changes. Until recently, little direct evidence has been available to demonstrate correlations between Milankovitch cycles and large-scale terrestrial landforms produced during worldwide glaciations. In central Alaska large areas of loess and sand fill valleys and basins near major outwash streams. The streams themselves are bordered by sets of outwash terraces, and the terraces grade up valley into sets of moraines. The discovery of the Stampede tephra (approximately 175, 000 yr ago) reworked within push moraines of the Lignite Creek glaciation suggests that this event correlates with the glaciation of marine isotope stage 6. A new occurrence of the Old Crow tephra (approximately 140, 000 yr ago) {{on the surface of}} the oldest outwash terrace of the Tanana River, correlated with Delta glaciation, suggests this event also occurred at this time. The penultimate Healy glaciation apparently correlates with marine isotope stage 4, while radiocarbon dates indicate the <b>latest</b> Pleistocene <b>moraines</b> correlate with marine isotope stage 2.

Average moraine ages of 1. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 3 ka (n[*]=[*] 4) on the Treskelen Peninsula and 1. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 1 ka (n[*]=[*] 5) on Scottbreen indicate the timing of a glacial culmination.

Both Scottbreen and the glaciers near Treskelen have surged in the instrumental record, like many glaciers across Svalbard. Yet, the age relation between our possible surge-related moraines and other glacier records leads us to hypothesize that on centennial and longer timescales, climate forcing outweighs surge dynamics, which exerts a stronger control on glacier length on centennial timescales at our study sites...|$|R
40|$|A rock {{avalanche}} deposit {{was investigated}} {{in order to understand}} the chronological evolution of geological hazards and to evaluate the interaction of the triggering geodynamic processes in the valley Val Viola, Italian Alps. The deposit is situated west of the Alpe Dosde´, in a permafrost area with deep-seated gravitational deformations (DSGD) along a tectonic line. Based on its geomorphologic context, the rock avalanche was first interpreted as a result of slope stress release without exact timing. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the 10 Be exposure date of quartz from one boulder from the rock avalanche. The age of 74307460 years places the event in the early Holocene. The timing of the last deglaciation was constrained using the inner <b>late</b> glacial <b>moraine</b> of a moraine doublet in the valley Alpe Dosde´ situated at an altitude between 2140 and 2120 m a. s. l. west of the rock avalanche. The 10 Be concentrations of quartz yield minimum exposure ages of 11, 4807670 and 10, 8507820 years. Different proposals for potential triggering factors of the rock avalanche include (a) melting of the local valley glacier and slope stress release in the Val Viola, likely to play a minor role as trigger, because of the time delay between the deglaciation and the rock avalanche event. More likely are (b) enhanced crustal seismicity induced by post-glacial regional isostatic glacial rebound coupled with tectonic stress or/and (c) climate conditions with higher temperatures around 74307460 years, resulting in an upwards movement of the permafrost limit and destabilization of the rock walls...|$|R
40|$|The Kern Canyon fault {{represents}} a major tectonic and physiographic boundary {{in the southern}} Sierra Nevada of east-central California. Previous investigations of the Kern Canyon fault underscore its importance as a Late Cretaceous and Neogene shear zone in the tectonic development of the southern Sierra Nevada. Study of the late Quaternary history of activity, however, has been confounded by the remote nature of the Kern Canyon fault and deep along-strike exhumation within the northern Kern River drainage, driven by focused fluvial and glacial erosion. Recent acquisition of airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) topography along the ∼ 140 km length of the Kern Canyon fault provides a comprehensive view of the active surface trace. High-resolution, lidar-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) for the northern Kern Canyon fault enable identification of previously unrecognized offsets of <b>late</b> Quaternary <b>moraines</b> near Soda Spring (36. 345 °N, 118. 408 °W). Predominately north-striking fault scarps developed on the Soda Spring moraines display west-side-up displacement and lack a significant sense of strike-slip separation, consistent with detailed mapping and trenching along the entire Kern Canyon fault. Scarp-normal topographic profiling derived from the lidar DEMs suggests normal displacement of at least 2. 8 + 0. 6 /– 0. 5 m of the Tioga terminal moraine crest. Cosmogenic 10 Be exposure dating of Tioga moraine boulders yields a tight age cluster centered around 18. 1 ± 0. 5 ka (n = 6), indicating a minimum normal-sense fault slip rate of ∼ 0. 1 – 0. 2 mm/yr over this period. Taken together, these results provide the first clear documentation of late Quaternary activity on the Kern Canyon fault and highlight its role in accommodating internal deformation of the southern Sierra Nevada...|$|R
40|$|Studies about glacial geology and {{geomorphology}} of the Adamello Group {{have been}} carried out in recent years with particular attention to Holocene landforms and deposits. Till now the following valleys have been investigated: V. dell'Avio, V. Miller - Conca del Baitone, V. Narcanello and upper V. di Genova. Of the 20 glaciers present in the studied area, the Pisgana, Lobbia and Mandrone glaciers proved to be of particular interest. These are between the widest glaciers of the group and are all systems with northerm exposures. Late Pleistocene and Holocene tills have been differentiated {{on the basis of the}} sedimentological characters, lichen cover and development of soils, as well as weathering degree. Several Holocene moraines have also been identified. Several 14 C dates were obtained from buried soils and peat in V. Narcanello and V. di Genova. The oldest date so far obtained in the Adamello Group is from the left side of V. Narcanello. A buried soil found at 2545 m a. s. I, between two lateral <b>moraines,</b> <b>Late</b> Glacial and Holocene respectively yielded an age of 6600 ± 100 14 C yr BP (GX- 14711) corresponding to 7569 / 7372 cal yr BP (according to STUIVER & REIMER, 1986). In the same area, at about 2470 m, two buried soils yielded dates bracketing a Neoglacial advance of the Pisgana Glacier. The first sample was dated to 3015 ± 75 14 C yr BP (GX- 14712) corresponding to 3350 / 3086 cal yr BP (maximum limiting age). It was collected from a soil developed on the cited <b>Late</b> Glacial <b>moraine</b> at about 2470 m and buried by a Holocene lateral moraine. The minimum limiting age for the Pigsana glacier advance was supplied by a soil buried in a depression at about 2600 m and supported by the same lateral moraine. It was dated to 2345 ± 125 14 C yr BP (GX- 14710), corresponding to 2706 / 2207 cal yr BP. In V. di Genova an end moraine deposited at about 1775 m a. s. I. supports a peat deposit, the base of which was dated to 5310 ± 180 1 C yr BP (GX- 15319). It supplies a minimum limiting age for the moraine, probably of Holocene age. Calibrated according to STUIVER et alii (1986) the age is 6299 / 5919 yr BP. · The top of the same peat deposit directly underlies another end moraine. It produced an age of 1190 ± 75 14 C yr BP (GX- 15318), corresponding to 1230 / 1003 cal yr BP. This is a maximum limiting age for this moraine which testifies a glacier advance during the Middle Age or the Little Ice Age. A push moraine made up of peat was identified at about 1800 m near Malga Materot, in V di Genova. The ·top of this peat was dated to 200 ± 70 14 Cyr BP (GX- 15314) corresponding to 305 / 0 cal yr BP.

40|$|Abstract Late Pleistocene glaciers in {{the upper}} Wairau Valley {{deposited}} four groups of moraines inferred to represent one Waimean ice advance, two Otiran ice advances, and an advance of early Aranuian age. The Waimean and early Otiran glaciers advanced into Tarndale Valley, deposited terminal moraines, and shed outwash down both the Alma River and Travellers Valley. The middle Otiran glacier terminated in northern Tarndale Valley and shed outwash from {{the southern part of}} its terminus down the Alma River. The north side of the terminus abutted a large ice-dammed lake in the Wairau Gorge, and fan-deltas graded to an old shore level at an elevation of 1040 m. Well-preserved moraines at the mouths of four glaciated tributaries may be middle Otiran recessional, or <b>late</b> Otiran terminal <b>moraines.</b> The <b>latest</b> ice advance extended 11 km down the upper Wairau Valley and deposited a subdued moraine at Island Gully.

40|$|The Tianshan {{mountain}} range {{has been extensively}} and repeatedly glaciated during the <b>late</b> Quaternary. Multiple <b>moraines</b> in this region record the extent and timing of late Quaternary glacier fluctuations. The moraines and their ages are described in three sub-regions: eastern, central and western Tianshan. Notable glacial advances occurred during marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 6, 4, 3, 2, the Neoglacial and the Little Ice Age (LIA) in these sub-regions. Glaciers in western Tianshan advanced significantly also during MIS 5, but not in eastern and central Tianshan. The local last glacial maximum (llgm) of the three sub-regions pre-dated the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and occurred during MIS 4 in eastern and central Tianshan, but during MIS 3 in western Tianshan. The spatial and temporal distribution of the glaciers suggests that precipitation (as snow at high altitude) is the main factor controlling glacial advance in the Tianshan. The late Quaternary climate in the Tianshan has been generally cold–dry during glacial times and warm–humid during interglacial times. Between neighbouring glacial times, the climate has had a more arid tendency in eastern and central Tianshan. These palaeoclimatic conditions inferred from glacial landforms indicate important relationships between the mid-latitude westerly, the Siberian High an...|$|R
40|$|Late Glacial to Holocene ice retreat was {{investigated}} along a 120 km long fjord system, reaching from Gran Campo Nevado (GCN) to Seno Skyring in the southernmost Andes (53 °S). The {{aim was to}} improve the knowledge on regional and global control on glacier recession with special emphasis on latitudinal shifting of the westerlies. The timing of ice retreat was derived from peat and sediment cores, using mineralogical and chemical characteristics, and pollen as proxies. Stratigraphy was based on 14 C-AMS ages and tephrochronology. The ice retreat of the Seno Skyring Glacier lobe is marked by an ice rafted debris layer which was formed around 18, 300 to 17, 500 cal. yr B. P. Subsequently, fast glacier retreat occurred until around 15, 000 to 14, 000 cal. yr B. P. during which around 84 % of Skyring Glacier were lost. This fast recession was probably also triggered by an increase of the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) from 200 to 300 m. Subsequently, the ice surface was lowered below the ELA {{in an area that}} previously made up more than 50 % of the accumulation area. Much slower retreat and glacier fluctuations of limited extent in the fjord channel system northeast of GCN occurred between around 14, 000 to 11, 000 cal. yr B. P. during both the Antarctic Cold Reversal and the Younger Dryas. This slow down of retreat indicates a decline in the general warming trend and/or increased precipitation, due to a southward migration of the westerlies. After around 11, 000 cal. yr B. P. pollen distribution shows evolved Magellanic Rainforest and similar climate as at present, which lasted throughout most of the Holocene.

Lithologic control for identification and classification of aquifer units was obtained from several hundred drillers 2 ̆ 7 logs calibrated by auger borings and interviews. Transmissivities of drift aquifers calculated from specific capacity tests using Jacob 2 ̆ 7 s equation agree well with estimates made from lithologic logs. Seismic refraction and gravity surveys were coupled with well log data to derive a bedrock elevation map. Vertical variability maps calculated from the lithologic logs show that bedrock topography strongly influences the distribution and character of glacial units, and clearly delineate the two glacial aquifer types present, valley and morainal units. Morainal units parallel the <b>Late</b> Wisconsin end <b>moraine</b> trends, while valley units are perpendicular to the moraines. The morainal units are small ice-contact features such as kames, fans, and deltas. The valley units are stream deposits and may have been deposited subglacially.

The study area was located between the Omoeroa and Waikukupa Rivers in Westland National Park. Three transects, {{from the bottom of}} the slope (on the outwash surface), up the slope to the top of the moraine were established. A total of 43 plots were assessed primarily for vascular species abundance and tree species basal area. Classification of species abundance along these transects using the TWINSPAN procedure resulted in seven vegetation types. These showed an orderly grouping from pakihi and 'heath forest' (pink pine/manuka) vegetation on the older surface, to rimu/kamahi/rata forest on the younger moraine. These vegetation type boundaries were reinforced by establishing the distribution of the basal areas of the major tree species found along one of the transects. The soils of the vegetation types found along one of the transects were characterized. No distinct differences in the measured chemical properties were found between the soils; however, slope position influenced the moisture regime and hence the soil profile morphologies. The main factors influencing the distribution of the vegetation appeared to be the difference in the age of the two surfaces, differences in the soil moisture regimes and the presence of fire on the oldest surfaces...|$|R

Surficial deposits covering ~ 325 km 2 below the glacial termini in the Henrys Fork and ~ 50 km 2 along the Green River in western Browns Park were mapped at 1 : 24, 000 scale to develop a Quaternary stratigraphic framework for the northeastern Uinta Mountains. The Henrys Fork mapping area spans from <b>late</b> Wisconsinan <b>moraines</b> to Flaming Gorge Reservoir. The Henrys Fork stratigraphy contains 10 mainstem gravels, six piedmont gravels, and landslide deposits. Terraces preserved along the Henrys Fork converge downstream and are strath terraces underlain by clast-supported, cobble gravel derived from the Uinta Mountain Group and Paleozoic limestone units. The Henrys Fork terrace stratigraphy was correlated to the Wind River terrace stratigraphy for age control, and incision rates were estimated at 80 - 110 m/m. y. The Browns Park mapping area includes Little Hole and continues through lower Red Canyon into westernmost Browns Park, ending at the Warren Draw-Swallow Canyon quadrangle boundary. The Browns Park stratigraphy includes eight mainstem gravels, five piedmont gravels, and various landslide, colluvial, and eolian deposits. A tuffaceous bed with Lava Creek Bash (640 ka) was identified near the top of a deposit at Little Hole that was previously mapped as Miocene basin fill. Minimum Green River incision rates were estimated between 90 and 115 m/m. y. using the Lava Creek Bash for age control. These rates are comparable to estimates for the Henrys Fork, but are about half of the rates reported for the south flank of the Uintas and other central Rocky Mountain ranges. A series of three distinct deposits in western Browns Park are interpreted as evidence for the landslide impoundment and subsequent outburst flooding of the Green River. These include slackwater deposits at Little Hole, an outburst flood deposit in western Browns Park, and a large paleolandslide deposit that lies between them. Estimates of sediment accumulation rates behind the paleolandslide dam suggest it was stable for ~ 605 years. Peak discharge estimates from impounded water volume estimates and paleoflow competence indicators suggest that the resulting outburst flood was ~ 22, 000 m 3 /s...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the landsystem of the Svalbard tidewater glacier Paulabreen and its <b>late</b> Holocene surge <b>moraines,</b> focusing on the glaciology and the glacial geology. An active surge of Skobreen/Paulabreen was observed and the glacier dynamics and stress regime was studied using satellite images, a time-lapse movie and photographs. A persistent subglacial conduit was found beneath the medial moraine between Paulabreen and Bakaninbreen, and we postulate that this constrained surge propagation by preventing the spread of pressurized water beyond the channel. Fresh glacial submarine landforms in front of the glacier were studied and related to known glacier front positions since 1898. An older moraine system deposited around 600 yrs BP was studied, and we found that the terrestrial and submarine landforms were very similar. A mud apron found in both environments was interpreted as pushed marine sediments deposited in a slurry in front of the surging glacier. Hummocky moraine was formed mainly by squeezing of sediments into basal crevasses. While de-icing is almost complete {{in some parts of the}} 600 yrs BP moraine, more than 30 m of buried glacier ice is found in a lateral part of the moraine, Crednermorenen. This great variance in the ice-core preservation we attribute to a higher supraglacial sediment content at the glacier margins.

We stay on the shores of Lake Wanaka for the night of Day 2. Day 3 takes us from the dry climates of Central Otago to the wet, forest cloaked landscape of the West Coast via the Haast Pass over the Southern Alps. This day involves soils, Holocene coastal geomorphology, marine terraces and <b>late</b> glacial <b>moraines.</b> The day ends in the township of Franz Josef. Day 4 starts with a plane flight for those with the inclination or a trip up to see the Franz Josef glacier. Afterwards we travel to Okarito Bog, the site of a splendid pollen record spanning the complete last glacial cycle, then head north to Hokitika. On the way we stop to discuss last glacial maximum moraines in the Poerua valley, and the effects of a recent large landslide on the landscape and people of the valley. The area around Hokitika is the focus of the next day when we review the classic glacial geomorphology of the Hokitika-Taramakau systems. The final part of the day takes us to Punakaiki on the western flanks of the Paparoa Range. On day 6 we continue north, stopping briefly near Westport to discuss a well studied peat section on a marine terrace of Cape Foulwind, then head through the Buller Gorge to the Inangahua Valley. We then turn south again to re-cross the Southern Alps over the Lewis Pass. Our final stop of the tour before Christchurch is in the Hope Valley...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [46]- 49) Research on currently inactive dunes in Colorado and Nebraska reveals th a t {{they formed}} during widespread Holocene episodes of dune activity. This study {{focuses on the}} relative age of inactive dunes in northern Illinois on the <b>late</b> Wisconsinan Bloomington <b>Moraine.</b> If these dunes were active during the Holocene, they could be an important geomorphological proxy for Holocene climate change. Soils on one dune and in adjacent loesscovered areas were studied to determine the relative degree of soil development and to identify any buried soils under the dune. Ten soil profiles were described and analyzed for particle size, color, pH, and other physical properties. Wind speed and climatic data from a nearby station were used to calculate a mobility index and a sand rose to quantify the potential for eolian sand movement. The result was th a t there was enough wind energy for sand movement; however the P/PE is high enough for stable vegetation cover and therefore stable dunes. The orientation of the dunes indicates northwest winds during their formation. Soils in the dune sand and in the loess both have clay accumulations in Bt horizons, although those in the dune sand are much more weakly developed. This may reflect differences in parent material rath e r th an age. The presence of a Bt horizon indicates the soils {{are more than a}} few hundred years old, probably significantly older. There are no buried soil horizons under the dune, which rests on unweathered late Wisconsinan glacial till. This means the sands were deposited not long after the till or if there were soils on the till before the sands, they were completley eroded away before the sands migrated in. It is concluded th a t the dune most probably formed more than 10, 000 years B. P., under cold climate conditions, rather than during warm, dry parts of the Holocene. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|The Western Massif of the Picos de Europa (latitude 43 N, {{longitude}} 4 e 5 W) {{includes some}} of the highest peaks in the Cantabrian Mountains. This massif was heavily glaciated during the Last Glaciation, though the post-glacial environmental evolution is still poorly understood. Using a complementary geomorphological and sedimentological approach, we have reconstructed the environmental events occurred in this massif since the last Pleistocene glaciation. The geomorphological distribution of glacial landforms suggests the occurrence of four main glacial stages: maximum glacial advance, glacial expansion after the maximum advance, Late Glacial and Little Ice Age. Moreover, a 5. 4 -m long sedimentary sequence was retrieved from the karstic depression of Belbín providing a continuous record of the paleoenvironmental conditions in this area since the Last Glaciation until nowadays. This section suggests that the maximum glacial expansion occurred at a minimum age of 37. 2 ka cal BP, significantly prior to the global Last Glacial Maximum. Subsequently, periglacial processes prevailed in the mid lands of the massif until glaciers expanded between 22. 5 and 18. 7 ka cal BP. Following the melting of the glaciers, a shallow lake appeared in the Belbín depression. Lake sediments do not show evidence of a cold stage during the <b>Late</b> Glacial, when <b>moraine</b> systems formed at higher locations. The terrestrification of this lake started at 8 ka cal BP and the area turned into grassland. At 4. 9 ka cal BP the existence of charcoal particles in the sediments of Belbín sequence reveals the onset of human occupation in the massif through the use of fire activity for grazing purposes. Finally, the presence of moraines inside the highest northern cirques shows evidence of the last glacial phase that occurred during the Little Ice Age cold event. Since then, the warming climate has led to the melting of these glaciers and periglacial processes prevail in the high lands of the massif. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The Mono Basin {{of eastern}} California {{provides}} an ideal laboratory {{in which to}} study the interaction of volcanic and tectonic processes. The late Quaternary geological record of volcanic activity and range-front faulting is relatively complete in the basin. Range-front faults of the Sierra Nevada offset dateable <b>late</b> Pleistocene glacial <b>moraines,</b> thus affording the opportunity to estimate range-front slip rates. The first two chapters concern dating of moraines that are offset by range-front faults. In Chapter One, I discuss {{the ages of the}} glacial moraines of the Mono Basin and their correlation between canyons. I dated the moraines by studying their morphology and the relative weathering of granitic boulders atop their crests, and by use of the clast-sound velocity (CSV) dating technique. The CSV technique consists of measuring the p-wave speed (Vp) in morainal boulders. Vp decreases with age as boulders weather. Clast-sound velocities enabled statistical division of moraines in each canyon into differently weathered deposits. Relative weathering features of boulder surfaces further helped discern age differences between moraines in a single canyon. Finally, CSV, relative weathering and moraine morphology, considered together, allowed correlation of moraines to an established glacial sequence, and therefore, correlation between canyons. Regression of mean Vp against best estimates of glaciation ages within the glacial sequence provided a further check on the validity of the correlations. Moraines in all major canyons from Lee Vining south were correlative with the standard late Pleistocene sequence of Tioga, Tenaya, Tahoe and Mono Basin deposits. At Lundy Canyon, however, Tahoe and Tenaya moraines are poorly, if at all, preserved. The prominent moraines extending into the basin are probably of Tioga age. Poor preservation of Tenaya and Tahoe deposits {{may be due to the}} narrow, steep-sided morphology of Lundy Canyon, and rapid down-dropping on the range-front fault. In Chapter Two, I discuss the application of a new quantitative dating technique to the moraines of Lee Vining Canyon. At Lee Vining Canyon, I measured cross-sectional profiles of lateral moraines of different ages to determine whether the degree to which they have been degraded could be used as a relative-dating method. Correlation of the degree of moraine degradation against an independent measure of age suggested that relative ages of <b>late</b> Pleistocene lateral <b>moraines</b> can be inferred from moraine profiles. Analysis of the degradation of moraine profiles with a diffusion model resulted in equations that relate profile width and maximum slope angle to age. In accordance with the diffusion model, the functional relationship between profile width and estimated age was found to be nearly linear for the moraines of Lee Vining Canyon. Fits of model to data were good, despite evidence of transport of material by non-linear diffusive processes along some of the profiles. Maximum slope angle is inversely proportional to age according to the diffusion model. Regression of mean maximum slope angle against inverse age for the group of moraines from Lee Vining Canyon suggested that the relationship between the two variables is expressed by the diffusion model. Deviations of model profile shapes from true shapes suggested that in addition to moraine age, initial profile shape and non-diffusive degradation processes are important in controlling the relationship between slope parameters and age over spans of 10 (4) years. In Chapter Three, I use moraine ages determined in Chapter One to estimate slip rates of range-front faults. For Chapter Three, I measured fault-scarp profiles on the dated lateral moraines of the Mono Basin to determine fault slip rates. I compared these data with what can be deduced about the extension rate due to dike intrusion underneath the Mono Craters. I then considered extension rates in the context of regional strain patterns to infer the mode of deformation and strain relief in the Mono Basin during late Quaternary time. The extension-rate data indicate that dikes are being intruded underneath the Mono Craters in response to crustal stretching, and because of this, are now accommodating elastic strain that was once accommodated by range-front normal faulting. The section of the range front near the craters accommodated as much as 1 mm/yr of extension until 40, 000 to 70, 000 years ago. For the past 40, 000 to 70, 000 years, this section of range front has become inactive, even though extension along the range front to north and south has continued at up to 0. 9 mm/yr. Dikes have been intruding underneath the Mono Craters for the past 40, 000 years. Depending upon the assumptions used to calculate dike intrusion rates, the dikes accommodate 1 mm/yr of tectonic extension that was previously accommodated by range-front faulting. Consideration of the extension rates in the context of regional tectonic strain patterns suggests that the Mono Craters are forming along one of the extensional boundary structures of a pull-apart basin, the other extensional boundary of which is the deactivated range-front segment. If the Mono Craters represent an early stage of caldera formation, then their formation within a pull-apart zone may indicate that this is an ideal tectonic environment in which to form certain types of calderas...|$|R
40|$|The Tongariro Volcanic Centre, at the {{southern}} end of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, North Island, New Zealand, consists of five large andesite volcanoes - Ruapehu, Tongariro, Ngauruhoe, Pihanga and Kaharamea-Tihia - with several associated minor volcanoes and vents all of Quaternary age. In the northern part of the Centre the north-westerly trending Kakaramea-Tihia Massif and Pihanga form a chain of volcanoes which last erupted more than 20, 000 years BP, but from which large mudflows have recurred up to as recently as 1910 A. D. By contrast the other two multiple vent volcanoes - Ruapehu and the Tongariro Massif - include several vents (four and possibly five) that have been active during the last 100 years and, in particular, Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu Crater Lake. In the first part of the thesis the tephrostratigraphy of the Tongariro area is described. Thirteen rhyolitic tephras erupted from Okataina, Maroa and Taupo Volcanic Centres over the last 20, 000 years are interbedded with local andestitic tephras. The order of succession of the 13 tephras is established by stratigraphy, and is confirmed by their mineralogical composition and by chemical analysis of their titanomagnetites. Seven of the rhyolitic tephras have been previously dated by 14 C, four more (Rotorua Ash, Karapiti Lapilli, Papanetu Tephra and Poronui Tephra) are dated hare, and two others are not yet dated. Six further rhyolitic tephras are of less use as marker beds. Four of these are tentatively correlated with rhyolite tephras from the more northerly volcanic centres and all but one are older than, 20, 000 years BP. These rhyolitic tephra marker beds have provided valuable time control which, together with 12 further radiocarbon dated events has allowed a chronology of the andesitic tephras erupted from vents within the Tongariro Volcanic Centre. Two previously named tephras, Ngauruhoe Tephra and Magatawai Tephra, are given formation status, and a further four formations (Papakai Tephra, Mangamate Tephra, Okupata Tephra and Tetoaira Lapilli) are defined. Ngauruhoe Tephra (0 - 1819 years BP), Mangatawai Tephra (c. 1819 - 2, 500 years BP), and Papakai Tephra (c. 3, 400 - 9, 700 years BP) have all accumulated as a result of intermittent activity from several vents. Mangamate Tephra, with six named members, was erupted mainly from the Tama Lakes-Ngauruhoe area between c. 9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP. Four of the members were deposited eastwards from the Tongariro Massif. The oldest member, Te Rato Lapilli, was erupted c. 9, 780 years BP probably from North Crater. It was distributed in a single lobe to the NNE and is the best andesitic tephra marker bed in rhyolite tephra sequences further north. The youngest member, Poutu Lepilli, was erupted as three lobes (NW, NE, SE) from a source probably at Blue about 9, 700 years BP. Poutu Lapilli has a volume of 0. 9 km 3 and the tephra of the total formation is likely to have destroyed more than 1, 000 km 2 of the pre-Mangamate forest. Ruapehu was very active between c. 10 - 14, 000 years BP. Most of the lapilli and ash beds were deposited east of the volcano and most of the remainder were deposited to the north. The youngest of the units erupted northwards, Okupata Tephra, underlies Te Rato Lapilli and probably has an age between 10 - 12, 000 years BP. Rotoaira Lapilli is prominent north-east of the Tongariro Massif. It was probably erupted from lower Te Meri Crater c. 13, 800 years BP and has been used to define the base of the Tongariro Sub-group. This subgroup is of Aranuian (post-glacial) age and includes all tephras accordant with the present day topography and which have been erupted from the Tongariro Volcanio Centre. Much of the tephra record between 20, 000 and 14, 000 years BP was lost through contemporaneous erosion and andesitic tephras have been reworked in with Oruanui tephra to from loess beds of late Otiran age. A cool-climate origin for these loesses is consistent with the pollen record of the Tongariro area which shows that between 20, 000 and 14, 000 years BP there was a change from Nethofagus forest, grassland and shrubland to podocarp-broadleaf forest. This implies a change to a warmer climate during that period. The major erosional unconformities in the Tongariro area are also of this age. An unconformity at the top of the Mangamate Formation (9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP) resulted from erosion during the time taken fro vegetation to recolonise the surface of the thick tephra sequence following total devastation of the forest. Periods of widespread erosion followed deposition of the thick Oruanui Breccia and Taupo Pumice tephra flow units. Widespread present day erosion is probably due primarily to extensive pre-Eurpoean and early Erurpean fires. <b>Late</b> Otiran glacial <b>moraines</b> recognised in five valleys about the Tongariro Massif are older than 14, 700 years BP and moraine on eastern Ruapehu is probably older than 20, 000 years BP. The amount of soil development undergone by andesitic tephra is related to the net rate tephra accumulation. Mangatawai Tephra shows least soil development and had the fastest accumulation rate; Papakai Tephra shows most soil development and had the slowest accumulation rate. The degree of paleosol development also varies according to the distribution of the tephras from the source vents and their related particle sizes; soils around Tongariro were least well development ESE of the massif where the rate of tephra accumulation was highest, and were best developed in the west to south quadrant where the rate of tephra accumulation was lowest. Eruptions of Mangamate Tephra were violent and the tephras were generally very well sorted. These eruptions were from magma of a "new" chemical composition and their depositions was associated with the first tephras erupted for about 10, 000 years from the Taupo Volcanic Centre. It is likely that the upward movement of this andesite of "new" composition and its initial eruption about 10, 000 years ago provided the trigger for eruption of the oldest Taupo Sub-group tephras. Timing of subsequent eruptions of rhyolitic tephra of a "new" magma composition was probably controlled by increases of vapour pressure over confining pressure with subsequent healing of fractures and a new build up of pressure. The concurrent intermittent andesitic volcanism probably had no significant effect on the timing of the youngest rhyolitic eruptions. Ngauruhoe, a composite cone about 900 m high at {{the southern}} end of the Tongariro Massif is considered to have first erupted about 2, 500 years ago and to have completed most of its growth during deposition of Magatawai Tephra. Red Crater which lies within a small scoria cone on the central part of the Tongariro Massif is mainly younger than 3, 400 years BP although the oldest flew can only be dated as younger than 9, 700 years BP. The six lavas extruded before 1819 years BP are olivine andesites; the five lavas extruded since 1819 years BP are basalts. The Te Mari Craters on northern Tongariro have been active from at least 13, 800 years ago to 1896 A. D. Lava was extruded following the eruption of Rotoaira Lapilli (13, 800 years BP) and a large flank extrusion occurred between 9, 700 and 6, 000 years BP. Lava flows from the upper Te Mari Crater were probably extruded in the early 16 th century. North Crater, near the north-western end of the Tongariro Massif probably dated from abut 70, 000 years ago (Stipp 1968) and most of the cone is older than 10, 000 years. A nuee ardente was erupted about 10, 000 years BP and Te Rato Lapilli was erupted about 9, 780 years BP. The upper part of the cone probably dated from 4, 800 years BP and all major eruptions had ceased by 1819 years BP. Blue Lake was the site of the Poutu Lapilli eruption c. 9, 700 years BP and has probably been active more recently. The Upper and Lower Tama Lakes new occupy the sites of many of the Mangamate Tephra eruptions of 9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP. Some eruptions of Papakai Tephra were probably also from this area. Pukeenake Scoria Cone, west of the Tongariro Massif, and the two plugs to its north define a fissure from which extensive olivine andesites were extruded more than 20, 000 years ago. Pukekaikore dome west of Ngauruhoe is possibly an old cumuledome of labradorite andesite flows. Small olivine andesite flows and associated tephra were erupted from a vent near the summit of the dome about 14, 700 years BP. While most of the lahars from the Tongariro Massif are older than 20, 000 years BP at least five occurred on northern Tongariro during deposition of Papkai Tephra, and tree-ring dating provides an estimated age of 1895 A. D. for a historic mudflow from Ketetahi Springs, also on northern Tongariro. Eruptions from the Kakaramea-Tihia Massif are all older than 20, 000 years BP and the youngest may be represented by a nuee ardente deposit from a vent WSW of Tihia. This deposit cams to rest above its Curie point and was radiocarbon dated at > 40, 300 years BP. Eruptions from Rotopounamu Graben and Pihanga are also older than 20, 000 years BP. Lahars from these centres may date back to 0. 6 m. y. but there have been several Aranuian lahars and the most recent were in 1846 and 1910 A. D. Ruapehu erupted numerous tephra beds from 10 - 14, 000 years BP, probably from a northern crater. An extensive as flow from the north-western summit area has an age between 5 - 10, 000 years BP, similar to the age of lava flows from a parasitic vent lower on the northern side. Murimotu Lahars on the lower north-western slopes of Ruapehu span the final 3, 000 years of the tephra deposition. One of the largest lahars, that formed conical mounds, came to rest above its Curie point and is likely to have been initiated by displacement of a crater lake by lave or a growing lava dome. It is probably that this 'hot' lahar, aged between 9, 540 and 12, 450 years BP, occurred during the Gothenburg reverse polarity event. The vent presently occupied by the Crater Lake was initiated probably about 2, 500 years BP and most lahars since that time have been confined to the Whangaehu River. Since 1859 eruptions through Crater Lake have caused two large lahars in Whangaehu River and there have been four cold lahars. The most recent of the cold lahars, on 24 December, 1953 destroyed the railway bridge at Tangiwai about five minutes before an express reached the bridge and 151 lives were lost. Lavas of Hauhungatahi cone, 12 km north-west of Ruapehu, are older than 20, 000 years BP. The explesion craters at Ohakune, about 19 km south-west of the summit of Ruapehu, are also older than 20, 000 years BP. Tephrochronology provides minimum ages for several rhyolite and dacite domes within or near the northern and of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre: Papanetu Tephra was erupted from the site of Kuharua Dome c. 9, 785 years BP towards the end of dome formation; Puketarata Ash was erupted from the site of Puketarata Dome in the Maroa Volcanic Centre towards the end of dome formation approximately 13, 500 years BP; Manganamu Dome is younger than 1819 years BP and Koroi Dome is likely to be close to 1819 years BP; Pukekaikiore Dome is older than 9, 790 years BP; Horohoro Dome is older than 14, 000 years BP; and Motuepuhi Island, Lake Rotoaira, is older than 20, 000 years BP. Ages for several fault movements near the Tongariro Massif are given. At least one fault movement was associated with eruption of the Mangamate Formation. Fault movements at both ends of Lake Rotoaira occurred after eruption of Taupo Pumice and it is suggested that they were in response to eruption of some of the Taupo Pumice from within that lake. The reverse polarity of andesite lava in Tongariro River suggests its extrusion during the Matuyama reverse polarity epoch. The age of > 0. 69 m. y. is the oldest age for lava within Tongariro Volcanic Centre...|$|R
