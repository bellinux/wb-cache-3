500|$|The 20th Party Congress {{opened on}} 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates {{to rise in}} honor of the {{communist}} leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda. In {{the early morning hours of}} 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the [...] "Secret Speech" [...] to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the [...] "congress <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in silence. As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. It was all so sudden and unexpected." [...] Khrushchev told the delegates: ...|$|E
500|$|It {{appeared}} that [...] "Hard Luck Houtteman" [...] had returned as the 1952 Detroit Tigers season began. On April 2, 1952, {{just before the}} season started, Art lost his seven-month-old daughter in an automobile accident. In an April 26 matchup against the Cleveland Indians, with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, Houtteman was one out away from a no-hitter when he threw a fastball that was [...] "supposed to sink" [...] but did not, which Harry hit for a single. [...] Houtteman said, [...] "This was the only pitch I shook Ginsberg off the whole game", and for years afterwards, catcher Joe Ginsberg repeatedly said to Houtteman, [...] "If you'd <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I'd have you in the Hall of Fame". Detroit won the game by a score of 13–0. After losing his tenth game on June 22, manager Red Rolfe moved Houtteman out of the starting rotation and into the bullpen. He finished the year with an 8–20 record and a 4.36 ERA. His 20th loss came on September 21 against the Indians, and he became the first Tiger to lose 20 games since Bobo Newsom in 1941. His disappointing season led to the possibility of a trade, with general manager Charlie Gehringer acknowledging that Houtteman might be traded if the right offer came along.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{investigation}} in Rome, Hussain {{said he was}} motivated {{to participate in the}} attacks after viewing videos of war-torn Iraq. [...] "I am against war," [...] Osman said [...] "I've marched in peace rallies and nobody <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I never thought of killing people." [...] He claimed that the bombs were never meant to detonate or kill anybody, only {{to draw attention to the}} Iraq war.|$|E

She only <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and sent me a few suitcases of money to prisoners like i told her to." [...] Nevertheless, it is clear that Cutolo had always wanted to maintain a male-only organization based on principles such as criminal fraternity and so could never be seen giving a role to his sister. It could be argued {{that he did not want}} to implicate her and therefore, always insisted that she was innocent.|$|E
