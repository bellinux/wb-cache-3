5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E

It discussed the acquisition of <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> project's production facilities, which the Army recommended be {{in the vicinity of}} Knoxville, Tennessee, with the Boston firm of Stone & Webster as the project's principal contractor. The meeting on July 30, 1942, was devoted to reviewing progress on isotope separation by the centrifugal and gaseous diffusion methods. The August 26, 1942, meeting considered Lawrence's electromagnetic separation project, and expansion of the program to produce heavy water.|$|E
5|$|Gisa {{obtained}} land {{grants for}} the upkeep {{of the church}} and canons from King Edward the Confessor and the later kings Harold Godwinson and William I of England.

5|$|Gravesend Blockhouse was {{designed}} by the Clerk of the King's Works, James Nedeham, and the Master of Ordnance, Christopher Morice, with Robert Lorde serving as the paymaster for the project and Lionel Martin, John Ganyn and Mr Travers acting as the local overseers. The Crown bought the <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fort, along with the space for Gravesend Blockhouse, from William Burston for £66; it is uncertain how much the building work cost, but earlier estimates in 1539 had suggested that it would cost £211 to build such a blockhouse, including the 150,000 bricks and quantities of stone, chalk, lime, timber and labour that would be needed. The work was quickly completed, and by 1540 the blockhouse was fully operational.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn Mine or Wythburn Mine {{opened in}} 1839 by the gill between Whelpside and Helvellyn Screes. It was {{operated}} by a succession of different owners, driving five levels through mostly barren rock to explore three mineral veins.

Only a few hundred tons of galena {{came out of the}} mine; probably insufficient to cover its costs.|$|E

By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act and because the state had not {{lived up to its}} obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new reservation, and buying <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new reservation from within the old reservation). The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of trespass damages. The Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E

5|$|Initial {{examination}} for {{the construction}} of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations. The proposed areas—west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake—were owned by the Penticton Indian Band. The <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> airport was expropriated from the band in 1949 under the War Measures Act, with the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because of wartime military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac was completed. Rights for a temporary public use airport were secured in 1945for an operation of 24hours a day. In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.|$|E

As a proprietary colony, Penn governed Pennsylvania, yet its citizens were still subject to the English crown and laws. Penn's cousin William Markham served as the first colonial deputy governor.|$|E

Once secured, the Earl of Argyll placed Walter MacAulay, Laird of Ardincaple, as keeper of the castle with a garrison of forty men. In 1648, the parish of Row (modern Rhu) was created at the instigation of Aulay MacAulay, Laird of Ardincaple, who wanted to separate from the parish of Rosneath on the opposite side of the Gare Loch.

The tramway opened for trials in 1973 and was officially opened in 1974 by Harry Bowey, mayor of Salisbury, and Frank Kneebone, Minister for Lands, to coincide with St Kilda's centenary. In 2001 a large additional museum building was completed to house the increasing number of donated trams.|$|E
