5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, {{it was not possible}} to exactly confirm the locations of the holes, and nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Marceau splits {{her time}} between seeing to {{the duties of}} the train (such as helping to fix the heat in the engine), {{interviewing}} passengers about the murder, and examining the train and surrounding area for clues. She travels to several additional <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> Poirot does not travel to in the book, such as the engine, the baggage car, and an old shack outside of the snowed in train. Additionally, a sabotaged ham radio is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew and ask him to research the passengers.|$|E

5|$|Registered nurse (RN) – Nurses can be {{involved}} in ambulance work dependent on the jurisdiction, and as with doctors, this is mostly as air-medical rescuers often {{in conjunction with a}} technician or paramedic.

5|$|Surge can be {{measured}} directly at coastal tidal stations as {{the difference between the}} forecast tide and the observed rise of water. Another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead of an approaching tropical cyclone. This was first tested for Hurricane Rita in 2005. These types of sensors can be placed in <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.|$|E
5|$|The Space Pirates' {{operation}} {{was left in}} disarray following defeat in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. In their desperation, they turned to Dark Samus, Samus's sinister doppelgänger, for aid. Dark Samus strengthened the Space Pirates' forces, while also slowly indoctrinating them into mindless servants. Their combined forces seek to corrupt the universe with Phazon by first executing a series of methodical attacks on three Federation planets: Norion, Bryyo, and Elysia. The game is primarily centered on these planets and three other <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> become accessible after completing certain in-game tasks.|$|E

It {{is the first of}} what was planned to be twenty Virgin Hotels <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> operate under this business model. The renovation took longer than planned due to the building's city landmark status, which required continuing coordination with the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. Original features that were retained include a 1920s oak cigar bar, brass elevator lobby doors and a tiled ceiling. The final layout of 250 rooms includes 40 single-room suites and 2 penthouse suites. 40 rooms are pet friendly.|$|E
5|$|Empire of the Sun {{was filmed}} at Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom, and on {{location}} in Shanghai and Spain. The filmmakers searched across Asia {{in an attempt to}} find <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> resembled 1941 Shanghai. They entered negotiations with Shanghai Film Studios and China Film Co-Production Corporation in 1985. After a year of negotiations, permission was granted for a three-week shoot in early March 1987. It was the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1940s. The Chinese authorities allowed the crew to alter signs to traditional Chinese characters, as well as closing down city blocks for filming. Over 5,000 local extras were used, some old enough to remember the Japanese occupation of Shanghai 40 years earlier. Members of the People's Liberation Army played Japanese soldiers. Other locations included Trebujena in Andalusia, Knutsford in Cheshire and Sunningdale in Berkshire. Lean often visited the set during the England shoot.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago's bid, {{the games}} {{would have been}} held from July 22 to August 7, with the Paralympics held between August 12 and 28. The bid plan {{emphasized}} use of Chicago Park District parks to host the games, but other existing facilities such as Soldier Field and McCormick Place would have hosted events. The bid included a plan for North Side, Downtown Loop and South Side celebration <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> would have had high-definition LED screens for unticketed visitors. The bid noted {{that there was a}} very high concentration of event locations and training facilities close to each other and that the majority of event sites were clustered together. Thus, the vast majority of athletes would have been close to their competitions.|$|E

5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be difficult to find <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|Labillardière did not {{acknowledge}} any collector, {{and so it}} was long thought that Labillardière himself had collected the first botanical specimens in 1792 while naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. However, this and eight other species described by Labillardière do not occur in any <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> he visited, suggesting that he obtained specimens from someone else whom he failed to credit. Though he did not specify a type specimen for A.obovata, a specimen upon which the accompanying figure in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen appears to be based has been located; it is annotated, apparently in Labillardière's hand, as having been collected by Leschenault. Ernest Charles Nelson states with certainty that Labillardière based this species on specimens collected by Leschenault, and this view has been accepted by some scholars though others treat it more cautiously.|$|E
5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E

5|$|Norris had {{similarly}} scouted {{settings for}} his novel and chose the upstairs {{of a building}} {{on the corner of}} Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Stroheim discovered that many of the <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets. For authenticity, Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving on construction costs.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{shooting}} {{took place}} at the Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, during late 2007. Principal photography began on January 2008 in New Zealand. One of the filming <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> was selected was Dunedin. Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink. Fox moved some of the explosives to another area. The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required thirteen cameras. Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly. According to Hood, the screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun, with the production in Australia receiving regularly new script pages from Los Angeles, at times in the night before shooting.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoan system brought large {{quantities}} of imported goods to Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and Mesa Verde became isolated from the surrounding region. For approximately six hundred years, most Mesa Verdean farmers had lived in small, mesa-top homesteads {{of one or two}} families. They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, but by the start of the 13th century they began living in canyon <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields.|$|E

5|$|The Decimal Classification {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and relative index which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, {{on the basis of its}} subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} threatened {{large portions}} of the western coastline of Mexico, resulting in the evacuation {{of tens of thousands}} of people. In coastal portions of western Mexico, strong winds downed trees, while heavy rain resulted in mudslides. Hurricane John caused moderate damage on the Baja California peninsula, including the destruction of more than 200houses and thousands of flimsy shacks. The hurricane killed five people in Mexico, and damage totaled $663million (2006MXN, $60.8million 2006USD). In the southwest United States, moisture from the remnants of John produced heavy rainfall. The rainfall aided drought conditions in portions of northern Texas, although it was detrimental in <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> had received above-normal rainfall throughout the year.|$|E

It reaffirmed the reserved right of American Indian tribes in the State of Washington to act alongside the state as co-managers of salmon and other fish, and to continue harvesting them in accordance with the various treaties that the United States had signed with the tribes. The tribes of Washington had ceded their land to the United States but had reserved the right to fish as they had always done, including fishing at their traditional <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> were off the designated reservations.|$|E
