40|$|Since its {{inception}} (1), {{a number of}} changes (2) have occurred to the Transcription Factors Database, some details {{of which will be}} described here. This database is designed to capture and contain information about the properties of transcription factors, their interrelationships, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences that encode them, and the DNA sequences they recognize. This information has been sequestered into different tables so that, through the use of relational database management systems, the existence of relationships between the various entities represented in the database may be apprehended. Figure 1 presents an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram), and Figure 2 the corresponding data dictionary, for release 4. 2 of this database, which became available in February 1992. Since release 1. 0, five new tables (METHODS, N_POINTERS, POLYPEPTIDES, REFERENCES, and X_POINTERS) have been added, one table (ELEMENTS) has been removed, and the name of one table has been changed (from CDNAS to CLONES). The <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> (ref n) fields in the various tables have been maintained from the original database definition, but these fields now contain a Medline Unique Identifier (UID), avoiding the need for maintaining a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> <b>numbering</b> scheme.

40|$|The {{anticipated}} {{improvement in}} precision and proliferation of GNSS and GIS {{is dependent upon}} consistency between ITRF and a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame which defines fixed land boundaries, services, physical infrastructure and machine control (e. g. precision agriculture, automated mining and navigation). This is only achievable through use of a suitable transformation and deformation model to relate the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) and closely aligned GNSS reference frames such as WGS 84 to a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame at any epoch. Regional reference frames are typically defined as a regional densification of the ITRF. These reference frames are necessarily kinematic in nature to account for tectonic and site specific deformation. GNSS data processing (e. g. point positioning and baseline processing) are performed within these kinematic reference frames {{in order to maintain}} consistency with GNSS orbit products. Time dependent transformations and deformation models are subsequently required to relate these ITRF coordinates to a specified fixed epoch of realisation of a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame. This paper compares several different approaches to kinematic reference frame transformations and deformation models. The method and strategy used depends upon the precision required and the tectonic setting of the <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame. A novel approach to high precision modelling in complex deforming zones with frequent episodes of seismic deformation is presented...|$|R
