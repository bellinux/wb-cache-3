25|$|Additional Palestinian {{refugees}} arrived {{after the}} 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Following their {{defeat in the}} Jordanian civil war, thousands of Palestinian militiamen regrouped in Lebanon, led by Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, {{with the intention of}} replicating the modus operandi of attacking Israel from a politically and militarily weak neighbour. Starting in 1968, Palestinian militants of various affiliations began to use southern Lebanon as a <b>launching</b> <b>pad</b> for attacks on Israel. Two of these attacks led to a watershed event in Lebanon's inchoate civil war. In July 1968, a faction of George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked an Israeli El Al civilian plane en route to Algiers; in December, two PFLP gunmen shot at an El Al plane in Athens, resulting in the death of an Israeli.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, {{athletic}} director Bill Martin announced {{the creation of}} a special level for sports at Michigan called Varsity Club status. The new system was established to recognize and increase support for club sports teams that have reached a level of budget, organization and competition that is similar to varsity levels. Varsity club squads are not necessarily closer to being elevated to full varsity status, and will remain for the time being primarily self-funded and administered through the Department of Recreational Sports. However, the designation will give these teams a closer relationship to the U-M athletic department. The Varsity Club status {{has proven to be a}} <b>launching</b> <b>pad</b> for sports to eventually become varsity sports at Michigan. In May 2011, Men's and Women's Lacrosse were officially granted varsity status. Men's Lacrosse began their first season of NCAA competition in 2012 while the Women's program will begin varsity competition in 2014.|$|E
25|$|One of {{her first}} clients was Rolf Fehlbaum, the president-director general of the German {{furniture}} firm Vitra, and later, from 2004 to 2010, {{a member of the}} jury for the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. In 1989 Fehlbaum had invited Frank Gehry, then little-known, to build a design museum at the Vitra factory in Weil-am-Rhein. In 1993, he invited Hadid to design a small fire station for the factory. Her radical design, made of raw concrete and glass, was a sculptural work composed of sharp diagonal forms colliding together in the centre. The design plans appeared in architecture magazines before construction. When completed, it never served as a fire station, as the government requirements for industrial firefighting were changed. It became an exhibit space instead, and is now on display with the works of Gehry and other well-known architects. It was the <b>launching</b> <b>pad</b> of her architectural career.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, the Industrial Engineering {{department}} branched {{off from}} the Mechanical Engineering department. In 1956, a Civil Engineering Department was formed under Lehigh University graduate Robert L. Ketter, {{who went on to}} become Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and later President of the University. In 1959, WBFO was launched as an AM radio station by UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and run by UB's students. The station has since become the <b>launching</b> <b>pad</b> of two modern National Public Radio personalities: Terri Gross and Ira Flatow. In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created. This program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the University's South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with other government-run research labs, consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.|$|E
50|$|The SHAR {{facility}} now {{consists of}} two <b>launch</b> <b>pads,</b> with the second built in 2005.

The two <b>launch</b> <b>pads</b> will allow multiple launches in a single year, which was not possible earlier. India's lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched from the centre at 6:22 AM IST on 22 October 2008.

25|$|BC {{was perhaps}} the hardest Canadian {{province}} hit by the depression. Although Vancouver managed to stave off bankruptcy, other cities in the Lower Mainland were not so lucky, such as North Vancouver and Burnaby. Vancouver also {{happened to be the}} target destination for thousands of transients – unemployed young men – who traveled across Canada looking for work, often by hopping on boxcars. This {{was the end of the}} line and had for years been a “Mecca of the Unemployed” because, as some cynically joked, it was the only city in Canada where you could starve to death before freezing to death. “Hobo jungles” sprouted up in the earliest days of the depression, where men built makeshift shanty towns out of whatever they could find (or steal). The largest of these was shut down allegedly for being unsanitary. Vancouver was also the <b>launching</b> <b>pad</b> for the Communist-led unemployed protests that frequented the city throughout the decade, culminating in the relief camp strike and the On-to-Ottawa Trek in 1935. Communist agitators and their supporters also led strikes in other industries, most notably the 1935 waterfront strike, and organized a large proportion of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion from Vancouver to fight fascism in the Spanish Civil War as Canada’s (unofficial) contribution to the International Brigades.|$|E
25|$|Union {{operations}} {{began with}} securing Kentucky in Union hands in September 1861. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee had early successes in Kentucky and western Tennessee in 1861 and 1862, capturing the important strategic locations of Forts Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. The Army of Tennessee and the Army of the Ohio defeated the Confederate Army of Mississippi, commanded by General Albert Sydney Johnston, at the Battle of Shiloh, driving {{it out of}} western Tennessee, and subsequently marching into Mississippi and capturing Corinth. Grant's troops marched towards and captured Vicksburg in 1862–63. Meanwhile, the Army of the Ohio, later known as the Army of the Cumberland, experienced success, blocking a Confederate invasion of Kentucky and gaining control over large amounts of Tennessee through the Battle of Stones River and the 1863 Tullahoma Campaign while fighting against the Confederate Army of Tennessee, whose commander, Braxton Bragg, was often criticized for his alleged lack of military skill. The Union army was briefly checked in its invasion of Georgia at the Battle of Chickamauga, and besieged at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Grant, now commanding the newly created Military Division of the Mississippi, took command, and received reinforcements from the Army of Tennessee, {{as well as from}} the eastern Army of the Potomac. The siege of Chattanooga was lifted in November 1863. Following his elevation by Abraham Lincoln to General-in-Chief, Grant put Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the combined armies. Chattanooga served as a <b>launching</b> <b>pad</b> for Sherman to capture the Confederate rail-hub of Atlanta and to march to the Atlantic, inflicting a major logistical and psychological blow to the Confederacy. After reaching the ocean, Sherman invaded the Carolinas. Operations in the Western Theater concluded with the surrender of Southern forces to the Union armies in North Carolina and Florida in May 1865 following General Robert E. Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House.|$|E
