40|$|ABSTRACT Agro-pastoralists {{living in}} arid lands of Africa {{tend to have}} highly mobile life-styles and to use natural {{resources}} widely and sparsely. Thus, they require frontiers with low population densities and sufficient natural resources. However, this {{study found that the}} en-closure of the <b>local</b> <b>frontier</b> has prompted social changes, such as the setting of conservation areas and the construction of new villages. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify how Owambo agro-pastoralists living in north-central Namibia have changed their use of natural resources in response to transformations to the <b>local</b> <b>frontiers</b> they inhabit. The Owambo group consists of a number of subgroups. Some of these groups formed small kingdoms; most group mem-bers live at the kingdom’s center surrounded by the frontier at the periphery. Since the 1970 s, other people have migrated into these frontier areas and altered the local conditions, forcing inhabitants to change their use of natural resources. Local inhabitants have coped with this situation in three main ways: (1) wealthy people have established private cattle posts in the frontier where they graze their livestock and gather natural resources, (2) some (especially non-wealthy people) have started to use indigenous fruit trees in multiple and intensified ways, not only for their fruit but also as building materials and wood for fuel, and (3) olde...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{abortive}} {{attempt by}} Britain and Spain {{to negotiate the}} joint sovereignty of Gibraltar in 2001 – 02, the incoming Spanish Government in 2004 proposed {{the establishment of a}} Forum of Dialogue, in which for the first time Gibraltar would take part as an independent third party. This Forum was designed to achieve cooperation across a number of issues, including the use of the airport, <b>frontier</b> <b>traffic</b> flows, pensions for former Spanish workers in Gibraltar and telecommunications, and by September 2006 proposed solutions were reached on all of them. The paper explores the Forum process and its achievements, but concludes that, given the fundamental differences in the ultimate objectives of the Forum participants and in particular Spain’s sensitivity to Gibraltar’s status, the agreements may only prove to be a means of managing the Gibraltar ‘problem’ rather than resolving it. Finally, the article considers whether the Forum model offers any lessons for other disputes in the region where sovereignty is contested...|$|R

In this way, frontiers of low population density and sufficient natural resources have been needed.

A number of sub-groups make up the Ovambo. Some of these groups have formed small kingdoms in which most group members live at the center of the kingdom and the periphery remains the frontier.

These three responses suggest that the coping with the loss of frontier has emerged the disparities mainly caused by economic situation of household. However, local customs of reciprocal exchange of surplus natural resources among neighbors and neighboring areas remain, and have been adapted to the new situation...|$|R

The starting point is the consideration of television series as entertainment audiovisual products. Fiction series belong to the category of audiovisual products, and thus comprise cultural products that draw on the potential afforded by the art of communication. Moreover, these series are entertainment products. The features which define them as both audiovisual and entertainment products enable the development of adaptations and direct sales on a speculative and practical basis. The study focuses on family series, which are defined as such regarding its content and audience. Special attention is paid to the main characteristics that make television series travel beyond <b>local</b> <b>frontiers,</b> especially to regions with cultural and language similarities...|$|R

Pointe Aux Pins was the first resort community on the island. Much of Bois Blanc Island is state-owned forest land containing White and Norway pines that tower 200 ft tall.

The combined force of regulars and militia departed from Limestone on April 18, 1790, crossing the Ohio River and marching to the upper Scioto. From there, they headed south, toward the present-day city of Portsmouth, Ohio, and discovered an abandoned Indian camp. Fresh footprints, including those of a well-known Shawnee warrior– nicknamed Reel Foot because of his two club feet– led away from the camp site. Scott sent a small detachment to follow the tracks; ultimately, they discovered and killed four Shawnee, including Reel Foot.

Natural resources-wise, Hong Kong has too little to offer, as almost all its agricultural lands have been converted into building land, leaving no alternative but to import drinking water and daily supplies from across the Hong Kong-Mainland border on a daily basis. Insatiable demands for housing due to an ever-increasing population growth left the government with little options but to embark on an unprecedented urban form of hyper-density. In 1997, the Hong Kong government commissioned a study known as Sustainable Development for the 21 st Century in Hong Kong (SUSDEV 21). The Study jump-started the city's participation in a worldwide endeavor to embrace sustainable development. The three years expedition guided the city through a world tour and studies on sustainable development from an international frontier, regional <b>frontier,</b> to a <b>local</b> <b>frontier,</b> and ended with a definition of sustainable development for Hong Kong, as well as a policy-making mechanism to achieve sustainability.

After a property situated on a hill was acquired the settlers carried lumber from a local mill on their backs up a hill to construct the gurdwara. When the Gurdwara opened on February 26, 1911 Sikhs and non-Sikhs from across British Columbia attended the ceremony and a local newspaper reported on the event. The temple was a two floor building, that from the outside looked like the contemporary wood houses of seen in <b>local</b> <b>frontier</b> towns. Features and decoration typical for Sikh architecture and design were only used in the interior. The first floor contains the Langar and common dining room for the community, and the second floor contains the prayer hall. The building was extended twice in 1932 and in the 1960s. Until 1975 the gurdawa belonged to the Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver (founded in 1905), then it was transferred to the local Sikh community of Abbotsford, who wished for a greater autonomy.
