40|$|Introduction Turkey is {{a leader}} of tobacco control in Europe. However, {{little is known about}} {{cessation}} implementation, a key component of tobacco control success. This paper discusses the training of nurses in smoking cessation as part of routine practice in Istanbul hospitals. The Turkey project builds and extends on a decade of research and training in developing culturally sensitive cessation education in India and Indonesia (Project Quit Tobacco International). One of the goals of the Turkey project is to provide leadership in the field of nursing in smoking cessation as a foundation for a larger smoking cessation movement within Turkey’s healthcare sector. Material and Methods Prior to training, formative research was conducted with smokers to better understand challenges faced when trying to quit. Site visits to government hospitals and cessation clinics were conducted to observe health care provider-patient interaction. Four culturally sensitive cessation training workshops for nurses (n= 54) were held and follow-up debriefing sessions were conducted. Results Challenges to cessation counseling included lack of time and incentives for nurse involvement; lack of information about the harm of smoking and benefits of quitting; and the medicalization of cessation focused on pharmaceutical distribution. The pay for performance model in hospitals has de-incentivized doctors to work in cessation clinics making referrals by nurses unfeasible. Conclusions o involve nurses in <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>delivery</b> in Turkey, health care providers need to quit smoking, and changes to the health care system need to occur. Cessation needs to be integrated into routine nurse-patient interactions, teamwork between nurses and doctors will need to be established to enable referral in hospitals with and without cessation clinics, and the systemic harms of smoking will need to be integrated into medical and nursing school curriculum.

40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a one-day training program in changing the perceptual role of participants and their self-efficacy to introduce <b>tobacco</b> treatment <b>delivery</b> into their daily clinical practice in the near future. Material and Methods The training program took place in Brussels in April 2016. A pre-post study design was used to evaluate the effectiveness and data from 44 health care professionals from Eastern European Region were analyzed. A 15 -item survey was used for the data collection. Results The training program managed to establish new social and clinical norms related to tobacco dependence treatment in primary care practice settings, increase providers perceptions about the ease of delivering tobacco treatment and self-efficacy to deliver smoking cessation treatment. All six items of perceived behavioral control were significantly improved, 3 out of 4 items of subjective norms, 3 out of 5 items of attitudes significantly changed and 5 out of 6 items of self-efficacy. Immediately after the intervention health care professionals were more confident to advice their patient to quit smoking, mean (SD) = 8. 77 (1. 6) vs. 8. 28 (2. 3), p= 0. 019; provide brief smoking cessation counseling, 8. 72 (1. 6) vs. 8. 03 (2. 7), p< 0. 001; provide counseling to patients not ready to quit 8. 16 (1. 8) vs. 7. 11 (1. 9), p< 0. 001; prescribe pharmacotherapy 6. 64 (2. 6) vs. 5. 89 (3. 6), p= 0. 003 and provide smoking cessation counselling 8. 40 (2. 0) vs. 7. 11 (3. 1), p< 0. 001.

40|$|The recent {{availability}} of internal tobacco industry documents provides significant insight into industry knowledge and manipulation of <b>tobacco</b> smoke <b>delivery.</b> One critical {{area of research}} {{is the role of}} smoke chemistry in determining the absorption and effects of smoke constituents, especially harm producing or pharmacologically active compounds. Independent scientific research has suggested that the nicotine dosing characteristics, hence the addiction potential of cigarettes, may be determined in part by the amount of free‐base nicotine in cigarette smoke and its effects on the location, route, and speed of absorption in the body and on the sensory perception effects of the inhaled smoke. Tobacco industry documents describe the use of a number of methods internally for measuring free‐base nicotine delivery. These include the common use of cigarette “smoke pH” as a means to estimate the fraction of free‐base nicotine in the particulate matter (PM) in cigarette smoke, as well as efforts to measure free‐base nicotine directly. Although these methods do not provide accurate absolute measures of free‐base nicotine in smoke, consistencies observed in the findings across the various manufacturers indicate: (1) real relative differences in the acid/base chemistry of the smoke from different brands of cigarettes; (2) a connection between differences in free‐base levels and brand‐dependent differences in sensory perception and smoke “impact”; and (3) levels of free‐base nicotine that are greater than have typically been publicly discussed by the industry. Furthermore, the results of these methods are generally consistent with those of a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which directly measured the free‐base fraction of nicotine across a range of cigarette types. Consideration of the likely fundamental importance of free‐base nicotine levels in cigarette smoke, together with the efforts discussed in the tobacco industry documents to measure such levels, indicates that the public health community would benefit from additional research to assess directly the delivery of free‐base nicotine in cigarette smoke across brands. This may be especially useful for those products (“light”, “ultralight”, “reduced carcinogen”, etc) that have been promoted, either explicitly or implicitly, as “harm reducing”...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{associations}} between biases in decision-making (delay discounting [DD], opportunity cost neglect [OCN], status quo bias [SQB]), educational attainment, and use of cigarettes and other <b>tobacco</b> and nicotine <b>delivery</b> products among women of reproductive age. Women of reproductive age are of special interest because of the additional risks that cigarette smoking or use of these other products represents should they become pregnant. Data were collected anonymously online in survey format using Amazon Mechanical Turk [AMT]. Participants were 800 women of reproductive age (24 - 44 years) from across the US. Half (n = 400) were smokers who reported current, daily smoking and half (n = 400) were never smokers who reported smoking less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Participants reported smoking characteristics, plans to quit smoking, use of nicotine replacement therapies, use of other <b>tobacco</b> and nicotine <b>delivery</b> products, alcohol and drug use histories, and the FagerstrÃ¶m Test for Nicotine Dependence. Participants completed two measures for each of the three biases in decision-making, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale [BIS- 11], and two scales measuring short- and long-term propensity to plan for money expenditures [PPMS and PPML]. Educational attainment analyses compared three education groups: high school or less vs. some college (e. g. some college/A. A.) vs. B. A. or higher. DD was steeper among current vs. never smokers and for women with lower vs. higher levels of education, with no significant interaction between smoking and education. Modifying the instructions of the DD measure to make the zero option explicit reduced DD similarly across levels of smoking status and education. OCN was worse at lower vs. higher educational attainment on one OCN measure, with no significant effect of smoking status or interaction between opportunity cost neglect and educational attainment on either measure. No evidence was found for stronger SQB by smoking status or education. Smoking status was related to BIS Total, BIS Motor and Nonplanning subscales and to PPML in initial models but remained significant after adjusting for baseline differences in participant characteristics only for BIS Motor subscale and educational attainment was related only to BIS Nonplanning subscale. Preliminary comparisons of e-cigarette users to non-users suggest smokers using e-cigarettes only differ from smokers not using e-cigarettes on measures related to quitting smoking whereas within never smokers e-cigarette users demonstrated a pattern of riskier decision-making compared to non-users. Results confirm that DD and education are important to understanding the use of tobacco and nicotine products in women of reproductive age, and suggest that smoking and educational attainment are independently related to discounting rates. The observed explicit-zero framing effect suggests making alternatives more explicit when presenting choices may help reduce DD and lead to better decision-making, which has possible treatment implications. Results identify OCN as an additional decision-making bias to consider in understanding how low educational attainment might relate to smoking vulnerabilities. The preliminary examination of e-cigarette use suggests for women of reproductive age above age 24 years, e-cigarette use among current smokers may reflect desire or attempts to quit or cut back on smoking whereas e-cigarette use among non-smokers may be a marker of a more impulsive, riskier repertoire, although additional study of this question is needed...|$|R
40|$|Global tobacco {{deaths are}} high and rising. Tobacco use is {{primarily}} driven by nicotine addiction. Overall tobacco control policy is relatively well agreed upon but a long term nicotine policy has been less well considered and requires further debate. Reaching consensus is important because a nicotine policy is integral to the target of reducing tobacco caused disease, and the contentious issues need to be resolved before the necessary political changes can be sought. A long term and comprehensive nicotine policy is proposed here. It envisages both reducing the attractiveness and addictiveness of existing <b>tobacco</b> based nicotine <b>delivery</b> systems {{as well as providing}} alternative sources of acceptable clean nicotine as competition for tobacco. Clean nicotine is defined as nicotine free enough of tobacco toxicants to pass regulatory approval. A three phase policy is proposed. The initial phase requires regulatory capture of cigarette and smoke constituents liberalising the market for clean nicotine; regulating all nicotine sources from the same agency; and research into nicotine absorption and the role of tobacco additives in this process. The second phase anticipates clean nicotine overtaking tobacco as the primary source of the drug (facilitated by use of regulatory and taxation measures); simplification of tobacco products by limitation of additives which make tobacco attractive and easier to smoke (but tobacco would still be able to provide a satisfying dose of nicotine). The third phase includes a progressive reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes, with clean nicotine freely available {{to take the place of}} tobacco as society's main nicotine source...|$|R
30|$|Can {{the male}} gametes {{contribute}} to endosperm failure? In E. scutella, once the sperm nucleus enters the central cell, the chromatin appears less dense in the embryo sac {{than in the}} pollen tube (Cocucci and Jensen 1969). In the nun orchid, the gamete nucleus that fuses with the polar nuclei of the central cell also has a lower staining intensity, prior to fertilization (Ye et al. 2002). Gamete dimorphism {{has been reported in}} sperm cells of a number of species such as <b>tobacco</b> <b>late</b> in sperm development (Tian et al. 2001). Preferential fertilization of one of the sperm cells with the egg has been noted. In Plumbago zeylanica, the plastid-rich, mitochondrion-poor sperm cell tends to fuse with the egg cell (Russell 1985) and a preferential transmission of supernumerary B chromosomes to the egg cells during sexual reproduction in maize has been reported (see Weterings and Russell 2004). Although gamete dimorphism is not a universal phenomenon in flowering plants, if there is defect in the male gamete destined for the central cell, endosperm development could fail. In orchids, since a massive number of pollen tubes is present within a capsule prior to fertilization, this is an excellent experimental system to study sperm cell structure and function and the results can provide clues as to whether the male gametes can contribute to endosperm failure in orchids.|$|R
60|$|At {{first this}} {{sentence}} {{made a very}} deep impression on my heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered the word deliver was foreign to me. And as the children of Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat, Can God spread {{a table in the}} wilderness? in like manner I began to say, Can God himself deliver me from this desolate island? However, the words would still return to my mind, and afterwards made a greater impression upon me. As it was now very <b>late,</b> and the <b>tobacco</b> had dazed my head, I was inclined to sleep: but before I would lie down I fell on my knees, and implored the promise that God had made to me in the Holy Scriptures, that if I called upon him in the day of trouble he would deliver me. With much difficulty I afterwards drank the rum wherein I had steeped the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw me into such a profound sleep, that it was three o'clock the next day before I awaked; or rather, I believe, I slept two days, having certainly lost a day in my account, and I could never tell any other way. When I got up, my spirits were lively and cheerful; my stomach much better, being very hungry; and, in short, no fit returned the next day, which was the 29th, but I found myself much altered for the better.|$|R
40|$|Background: In May 2016, {{along with}} the <b>latest</b> European <b>Tobacco</b> Products Directive (TPD), {{standardised}} packaging legislation was implemented in the UK. During the following 12 -month transition period, both new and old types of packaging were allowed on the market. This study aimed to assess awareness of standardised packaging and other TPD changes in the UK population in March 2017, when both forms of packaging were in widespread use. Methods: We conducted two surveys—one in adults and one in young people—investigating awareness of plain packaging legislation. In young people, we also measured susceptibility to smoking using previously validated questions. We asked smokers whether they had recently changed the product they used and also whether they used any of the products that are banned by the new legislation. Results: In the adult survey, 73. 5 % (95 % CI: 71. 5 – 75. 5 %) {{of the participants were}} aware of the new legislation and 32. 4 % (95 % CI: 30. 3 – 34. 5 %) had noticed changes in tobacco packaging, this proportion being considerably higher among smokers (83. 7 %; 95 % CI: 78. 9 – 87. 5 %) than never smokers (20. 7 %; 95 % CI: 18. 2 – 23. 4 %). More than half (52. 4 %; 95 % CI: 46. 5 – 58. 4 %) were using pack sizes or shapes (typically less than 20 cigarettes or 30 g loose tobacco), that would become illegal after full TPD implementation, and 31. 4 % (95 % CI: 26. 2 – 37. 1 %) reported switching to a different product since October 2016, in most cases to a cheaper brand. Among young people, 20. 2 % (95 % CI: 17. 8 – 22. 7 %) reported that they had noticed standardised packaging, comprising 16. 2 % (95 % CI: 13. 7 – 19. 0 %) of non-susceptible never smokers, 25. 6 % (95 % CI: 18. 0 – 35 %) of susceptible never smokers, and 49 % (95 % CI: 37. 8 – 60. 2 %) of ever smokers. Conclusions: In the final stages of implementation, awareness of the introduction of standardised packs was highest among smokers. The TPD will cause nearly half of adult smokers to purchase larger packs, and may cause many smokers to switch to cheaper brands...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) has a multifactorial etiology, and placental {{vascular}} {{disease may}} be one major risk factor. The risk of placental vascular disease may be lower among some immigrant groups. We studied the association between immigrant status {{and the risk of}} CP. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all singleton and twin livebirths in Ontario between 2002 - 2008, and who survived ≥ 28 days after birth. Each child was assessed for CP up to age 4 years, based on either a single inpatient or ≥ 2 outpatient pediatric diagnoses of CP. Relative to non-immigrants (n =  566, 668), the risk of CP was assessed for all immigrants (n =  177, 390), and further evaluated by World region of origin. Cox proportional hazard ratios (aHR) were adjusted for maternal age, income, diabetes mellitus, obesity, <b>tobacco</b> use, Caesarean <b>delivery,</b> year of delivery, physician visits, twin pregnancy, preterm delivery, as well as small- and large-for-gestational age birthweight. There were 1346 cases of CP, with a lower rate among immigrants (1. 45 per 1000) than non-immigrants (1. 92 per 1000) (aHR 0. 77, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 67 to 0. 88). Mothers from East Asia and the Pacific (aHR 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 39 to 0. 77) and the Caribbean (aHR 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 37 to 0. 93) were at a significantly lower risk of having a child with CP. Whether further adjusting for preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, placental abruption or placental infraction, or upon using a competing risk analysis that further accounted for stillbirth and neonatal death, these results did not change. Immigration and ethnicity appear to attenuate the risk of CP, and this effect is not fully explained by known risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Aim Indigenous Australians {{with asthma}} have higher {{morbidity}} and mortality compared with non-Indigenous Australians. In children hospitalised with acute asthma, we aimed to (i) determine if acute severity, risk factors and management differed between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children; and (ii) identify intervention points to reduce {{morbidity and mortality}} of asthma. Methods Retrospective review of 200 children hospitalised to Royal Darwin Hospital with asthma. We compared admission characteristics, severity indices, treatment, discharge plans and readmissions in Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Results Median age was 3. 6 years (interquartile range 2. 2, 6. 8). A significantly higher proportion of Indigenous children (95. 2 %) were exposed to tobacco smoke compared with non-Indigenous children (45. 7 %). The difference in proportions was - 0. 41 (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 60, - 0. 22). Other risk factors, asthma severity (moderate 83. 9 % vs. 83. 3 %; severe 16 % vs. 16. 1 %), length of stay (1. 9 vs. 1. 3 days) and readmission rate (27. 4 % vs. 27. 5 %) were similar between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Indigenous children {{were significantly more likely}} to be followed up in a community clinic (difference in proportions = 0. 10, 95 % CI 0. 1, 0. 17) and less likely by a paediatrician. Only 62. 5 % of all children had an asthma action plan on discharge. Conclusion Unlike other common respiratory diseases requiring hospitalisation, biological factors are unlikely major contributors to the known gap in asthma outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Intervention points include better identification, documentation and management of <b>tobacco</b> smoke exposure, <b>delivery</b> of salbutamol and discharge planning (including education and utilisation of asthma action plans). © 2013 The Authors.
