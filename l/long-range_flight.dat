5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and remote control features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for <b>long-range</b> <b>flight</b> at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of air-to-air refuelling probes allowed operations {{to be carried}} out {{in the vicinity of the}} Falklands, while the aircraft's armament was supplemented by the {{addition of}} 1,000lb (450kg) general purpose bombs, BL755 cluster bombs and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The use of air-to-air refuelling allowed extremely long reconnaissance missions to be mounted, one example being a 19-hour 15-minute patrol conducted on 15 May 1982, which passed within 60miles (97km) of the Argentine coast to confirm that Argentine surface vessels were not at sea. Another <b>long-range</b> <b>flight</b> was carried out by an MR2 on the night of 20/21 May, covering a total of 8,453miles (13,609km), the longest distance flight carried out during the Falklands War. In all, Nimrods flew 111 missions from Ascension in support of British operations during the Falklands War.|$|E
25|$|A {{requirement}} of the course was that each student had to produce a thesis for graduation: Whittle decided to write his on potential aircraft design developments, notably flight at high altitudes and speeds over 500mph (800km/h). In Future Developments in Aircraft Design he showed that incremental improvements in existing propeller engines were unlikely to make such flight routine. Instead he described what is today {{referred to as a}} motorjet; a motor using a conventional piston engine to provide compressed air to a combustion chamber whose exhaust was used directly for thrust – essentially an afterburner attached to a propeller engine. The idea was not new and had been talked about for some time in the industry, but Whittle's aim was to demonstrate that at increased altitudes the lower outside air pressure would increase the design's efficiency. For <b>long-range</b> <b>flight,</b> using an Atlantic-crossing mailplane as his example, the engine would spend most of its time at high altitude and thus could outperform a conventional powerplant.|$|E

A crewman, Sigizmund Levanevsky, on studying some maps, suggested they fly {{in a completely different}} direction - to the north. Polar aviators were extremely popular at that time, so his plan was considered plausible. The flight was cancelled in the spring of 1935 when he fell seriously ill.|$|E

50|$|In January 1942, the {{commander-in-chief}} of the Regia Aeronautica, General Rino Corso Fougier, began {{plans for a}} <b>long-range</b> <b>flight</b> from Rome to Tokyo. He consulted with pilots with recent experience in long-range flights to South America and East Africa, and reached a consensus that the SM.75 was better suited for the mission than either the SM.82 or the Savoia-Marchetti SM.83 because of its superior endurance, albeit {{at the expense of}} defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks. The SM.75 aircraft selected for the flight, serial no. MM.60537, was modified to become the first long-range SM.75 GA aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{became something}} of a jack-of-all-trades for the French Navy, operating from every Naval Air Station and from many capital ships. Some of the type's most significant moments were trials conducted by Compagnie Générale Transatlantique on the SS Île de France to evaluate the feasibility of catapult-launched mailplanes for their transatlantic liners using two specially-built 37/10s. Another famous use of the aircraft was on René Guilbaud's <b>long-range</b> <b>flight</b> through Africa and the Mediterranean between 12 October 1927 and 9 March 1927, venturing as far as Madagascar before returning to Marseille. In {{the course of the}} flight, he covered 22,600 km in 38 stages without incident.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, the Ju 290 was {{selected}} for the flights and tests began in February 1944 of a Ju 290 A-5 (works number 0170, KR+LA) loaded with 41 tonnes (45 tons) of fuel and cargo. Three Ju 290 A-9s (works numbers 0182, 0183 and 0185) were modified for long-range work at the Junkers factory in March 1943. The plan was eventually put on indefinite hold after the Japanese failed {{to agree on a}} route, as {{they did not want to}} provoke the Soviet Union by an overflight of Siberia, and the three aircraft were eventually transferred to KG 200 without any attempt at a <b>long-range</b> <b>flight</b> to Japan.|$|E
25|$|The first Iris III flew on 21 November 1929, {{with the}} three Iris IIIs {{equipping}} No. 209 Squadron which reformed at RAF Mount Batten, Plymouth in January 1930. 209 Squadron continued the pattern of <b>long-range</b> <b>flights</b> {{carried out by the}} Iris II, with one Iris visiting Reykjavík in June 1930 to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of the Icelandic Althing (parliament), and another making the first crossing of the Bay of Biscay by flying boat when visiting Lisbon in August 1930.|$|R
25|$|Shenandoah was {{designed}} for fleet reconnaissance work of the type carried out by German naval airships in World War I.

During 1932 she also operated with the newly acquired airship , but the decommissioning of Los Angeles on 30 June 1932, {{and the loss of}} Akron on 4 April 1933 saw a reduced need for an airship tender, with Patoka decommissioned on 31 August 1933.|$|R
50|$|The Ki-6 {{originated}} as the Model 8 Super Universal, {{launched by}} Fokker in the United States in 1927 {{as a further}} development of its successful Fokker Universal. The Super Universal was slightly larger and could carry six passengers rather than four. In addition, the aircraft was equipped with a more powerful engine and a cantilever high-wing. In total, about 200 Super Universals {{are thought to have}} been built. Due to its rugged durability, <b>long-range</b> <b>flight</b> ability and large cargo capacity, the Fokker Super Universal was extensively used in bush flying and was well regarded for its versatility. The first flight took place in March 1928. Shortly after, the type entered production at a new factory in Glendale, California. The Super Universal remained in production until January 1931.|$|E
50|$|The next <b>long-range</b> <b>flight</b> planned {{was from}} Moscow to the US via the North Pole. A sloping {{concrete}} runway, 4 km in length, was built at Schelkovo air base near Moscow. In {{the early morning}} of 3 August 1935, Levanevsky, Baydukov and Levchenko climbed aboard their RD and took to the air. For the first 50 km, the aircraft ascended to only 500 m. They then steadily increased their altitude to 5000 m, maintaining an average speed of 165 km/h. After approximately 2000 km, an oil leak was discovered, but the aircraft {{was able to make}} an emergency landing at Krechevits near Novgorod. Levanevsky was called to a Politburo meeting, where he blamed Tupolev, declaring that his single-engined ANT-25 was underpowered. It seemed to be the end for the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of air-to-air refuelling probes allowed operations {{to be carried}} out {{in the vicinity of the}} Falklands, while the aircraft's armament was supplemented by the {{addition of}} 1,000 lb (450 kg) general purpose bombs, BL755 cluster bombs and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.
