The two-fold {{purpose of this study is}} to contribute to the development of theoretical dimensions of <b>local</b> school <b>politics</b> and to provide school officials with a practical view of public opinions and behaviors as they relate to <b>local</b> school <b>politics.</b> Social science models which have been used to assess political attitudes and behaviors are applied to <b>local</b> school <b>politics.</b> These models divide the general public into three hierarchical sub-publics. One of these sub-publics, the attentive public, is of particular interest to local school officials. The problem of this study is to describe the characteristics, political behaviors, and attitudes toward educational policy of the attentive public for <b>local</b> school <b>politics.</b> Data is derived from a secondary analysis of three national surveys drawn in 1979, 1981, and 1983 for the National Science Foundation. The statistical procedure is multivariate log-linear analysis. This procedure allows both the identification of significant structural relationships and the relative strength of association among several independent variables and a dependent variable. Age, gender, parental status, educational status, and residence were found to be significantly associated with attentiveness to <b>local</b> school <b>politics.</b> Attentiveness is also significantly associated with voting, electoral campaigning, and mobilization in <b>local</b> school <b>politics.</b> Attentiveness is also highly predictive of attitudes toward educational policy. Organizational activity was also found to be strongly associated with attentiveness. Finally, of several attitudinal characteristics, only personal efficacy was significantly associated with attitudes toward educational policy. The concept of issue attentiveness is applicable to <b>local</b> school <b>politics.</b> A clearly identifiable and highly consistent segment of the general public was identified as the attentive public for <b>local</b> school <b>politics.</b> <b>Local</b> school officials should seek to contact and utilize attentives when seeking support for tax initiatives or educational policy changes...|$|R
