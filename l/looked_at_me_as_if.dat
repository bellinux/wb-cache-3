500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he thought it was}} my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|Mendelssohn met {{and worked}} with Lind many times, and started an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was {{unfinished}} at his death.

In 1847 Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable– an opera which musically he despised– in order to hear Lind's British debut, in the role of Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mlle. Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success".|$|E

2500|$|Mendelssohn {{was present}} at Lind's London debut in Robert le Diable, and his friend, the critic H. F.

Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mademoiselle Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success". Mendelssohn worked with Lind on many occasions and wrote the beginnings of an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He included a high F sharp in his oratorio Elijah ("Hear Ye Israel") with Lind's voice in mind.|$|E

60|$|There was an instant's silence. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Delora and {{wondered}} what he meant. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a man <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> his enemy.|$|R

60|$|He {{turned and}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to say, 'Who the devil are you!' He looked {{me up and}} down contemptuously, and I began to feel that I was almost losing my temper.|$|E

50|$|Foley {{is known}} for {{claiming}} a scientific approach to the golf swing. One of his trainees, Justin Rose, said of Foley's instruction style:Sean does not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a golfer. He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> an athlete and from a biomechanical point of view. He is not necessarily wrapped up in what makes a swing pretty.
