50|$|If {{the future}} were known with certainty, then the {{economic}} implications of Cap and Share would equal the economic {{implications of a}} carbon tax with lump sum recycling—that is, the carbon tax revenue {{would be used to}} send every household a cheque in the post. Some argue that lump sum recycling is an inferior way to recycle the revenue of environmental taxes, and that this has been repeatedly confirmed for Ireland. The rationale is that with the carbon tax revenue coming into government coffers, it could be directly spent by the government rather than distributed to the population via cheques, and that other kinds of taxation, such as <b>labour</b> <b>taxation,</b> could be decreased correspondingly. It is argued that this would {{have a positive effect on}} GDP since there would be a greater incentive for firms to increase employment, and that it would also positively affect social equity, since labour taxes are regressive by nature.|$|E

40|$|For a {{reforming}} government {{intent on}} improving efficiency, a natural way {{to discriminate between}} alternatives is via optimal taxation. In light of this, we examine quantitatively the extent of progressivity or regressivity of optimal <b>labour</b> income <b>taxation</b> in a model with skill heterogeneity, endogenous skill acquisition and a production sector with capital-skill complementarity. We find that wage inequality driven by the resource requirements of skill-creation implies progressive <b>labour</b> income <b>taxation.</b> In particular, in the steady-state, skilled labour income is taxed about forty percent more than unskilled labour income. We further find that the optimal transition path from the exogenous to optimal policy steady-state also exhibits progressive <b>labour</b> income <b>taxation.</b> These results are explained by a lower work time elasticity for skilled versus unskilled labour which results from {{the introduction of the}} skill acquisition technology...|$|R

50|$|According to Rosberg and Nottingham about 75,000 Kenyans {{served in}} the British {{military}} during the Second World War. Some went to Asia (mainly Ceylon, India and Burma), including Mugambi's father. The struggle for national sovereignty in India was towards its end as the Kenyan veterans were returning home. Their conscription into the war had been justified with the argument that Britain was fighting against tyranny {{in order to preserve}} democracy and freedom, which these veterans and the people they left at home did not enjoy. Upon their return, much more exposed and more self-confident than the peers who had not gone to war, these veterans led the campaign for national independence. The campaign was peaceful at the beginning, but the British administrators and settlers were adamant that Kenya would remain British for ever. The veterans found no justification for colonial domination with its attendant alienation of ancestral lands by British settlers, economic exploitation, forced <b>labour,</b> <b>taxation</b> without representation, restriction of movement in their own country, racial segregation, denial of access to basic social services including schooling and medical care.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the effects of <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> on wages, unemployment and efficiency in a job matching framework. We derive labour market equilibrium with taxes in a model of endogenous job creation and job destruction under three alternative hypothesis of wage formation: Nash bargain, monopoly union and efficiency wages. We find that labour taxes harm employment irrespective of the wage formation mechanism. However, employment {{turns out to be}} much less sensitive to taxation in the models involving wage bargaining. Our results also suggest that increased progression in <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> may improve employment with low or even non-existent efficiency cost if wages are set in a bargaining framework. <b>Labour</b> <b>taxation,</b> wage setting, job matching...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} labour income and its taxation by personal income tax, social security and health insurance contributions, presented in the literature. In order to reveal {{the influence of the}} basic tax elements on the evaluation of the level of the <b>labour</b> income <b>taxation,</b> comparative evaluation has been carried out. During the research, Latvia and Estonia, the countries that are closely related to Lithuania, have been compared. The results of the research have shown that the comparison of the basic tax indicators, such as non-taxable minimum income and standard rates, describes the national level of the <b>labour</b> income <b>taxation</b> only partially. A more accurate description of the tax level could be provided only after applying ratios and evaluating such factors as tax base and tax exemptions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} subsidizing low-skilled, labourintensive services hired by high-skilled individuals {{in the presence of}} <b>labour</b> income <b>taxation.</b> Whether such a subsidy can be Paretoimproving depends crucially on the degree of substitutability of both types of labour in the non-service sector. In case of some substitutability, a service subsidy can benefit all and decrease inequality, but in case of complementarity, low-skilled individuals benefit and high-skilled individuals are worse off. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a union {{bargaining}} framework, {{where the}} wage rate is negotiated between {{the representatives of}} employees and employers and firms unilaterally determine employment, to discuss the relationship between <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> and employment. In imperfectly competitive labour markets higher labour taxes – income and payroll taxes – will increase labour costs and have negative effects on employment. Tax progression tends to moderate wages and boost employment. Moreover, if labour tax bases are unequal due to tax exemptions, the structure of <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> matters so that the tax wedge {{may not be a}} sufficient statistic to describe the channel of influence of <b>labour</b> <b>taxation.</b> Finally, distortionary effects of labour taxes in more corporatist economies should be smaller than in economies with more decentralised wage bargaining. Empirical evidence – though not always very strong – supports these notions. union bargaining; labour taxation; tax progression...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we extend the {{classical}} tax-competition framework of Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986) by modelling involuntary unemployment and by allowing for <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> as a second source of public funds. For a large class of production functions (including CES), {{it turns out that}} tax competition is characterized by underprovision of public goods, and by positive taxes on both labour and capital. We thus conclude that the results of Zodrow and Mieszkowski survive some important and substantial modifications of the framework, and are thus more general than recently suggested elsewhere. tax competition, capital and <b>labour</b> <b>taxation,</b> involuntary unemployment, efficient bargains...|$|E

To {{focus on this}} aspect, we analyze how flexible international outsourcing and <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> affect wage formation, employment and welfare in dual domestic labour markets. Higher productivity of outsourcing, lower cost of outsourcing and lower factor price of outsourcing increase wage dispersion between the high-skilled and low-skilled workers. Increasing wage tax progression of lowskilled workers decreases the wage rate and increases the labour demand of low-skilled workers. It decreases the welfare of low-skilled workers and increases both the welfare of high-skilled workers and the profit of firms. flexible outsourcing, dual labour market, impacts of <b>labour</b> <b>taxation,</b> welfare state...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to assess}} the {{characteristics}} of <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> for five different groups of workers and labour market performance (in terms of employment and unemployment rate) in the EU and to examine whether tax wedge affects employment growth in the EU. The descriptive empirical estimates show {{that the level of}} <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> varies greatly across EU Member States, by which the tax wedge tends to be higher among New Member States (excluding Cyprus and Malta). Furthermore, the panel regression analyses confirm statistically significant negative relationship between tax wedge and employment growth in the EU as a whole. Therefore, the empirical analysis suggests that the EU- 27 should continue with the trend of reducing tax wedge, as this would have favourable effects on labour market performance, especially among New Member States...|$|E

40|$|The study {{consists}} of four essays, which analyse the implications of <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> and unemployment insurance (UI) in the models of imperfectly competitive labour markets. The first essay studies the effects of <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> on unemployment and efficiency in a search equilibrium model with endogenous job destruction. It is shown that the adverse employment effect of labour taxes is mainly due to the prolonged spells of unemployment. A pure increase in the tax progression may reduce unemployment and facilitate the emergence of low-productivity jobs. In the second essay, the link between taxes and the public benefits is perceived owing to the centralised wage setting institutions. This is shown to promote wage moderation, make wages and employment less sensitive to wage taxation and reduce hours worked. The third essay considers alternative ways to organize the government subsidies in a model, where taxalike payments are collected by the industry level funds in order to finance unemployment benefits. It is shown that equilibrium unemployment is decreasing in the share of UI financed by the employed union members. The fourth essay analyses the effects of UI in a job search model with endogenous search effort. It is shown that UI with a limited potential duration induces more search effort among the long-term unemployed who have exhausted {{a considerable amount of}} the current benefits. <b>Labour</b> <b>taxation,</b> unemployment insurance, trade union model, search model...|$|E
40|$|The report {{describes}} {{the development of}} <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> in Finland since the launching of the Employment Guidelines (EG) in 1997. The taxes considered include state and municipal taxes on earned income {{as well as social}} security payments of employees and employers. We find that the Finnish tax policies have been broadly in line with the EG goals of ?making the taxation more employment friendly? and targeting tax cuts to the low-paid workers. The size of the tax cuts has nevertheless been relatively modest and are unlikely to have any remarkable effects on labour demand. According to our illustrative calculations, the reduction in income taxes and social security payments could account for some 10 per cent of the overall improvement in employment since 1997. Also, the tax cuts seem to have favoured wage earners with relatively high annual income. At the aggregate level, the average effective tax burden on labour still lies clearly above the EU-average. <b>Labour</b> <b>taxation,</b> Labour Demand, Employment Guidelines...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} the taxation of small, owner-managed businesses. It {{focuses on the}} difficulties created by treating employees, unincorporated and incorporated businesses differently for tax and social security purposes. The authors reject blanket tax incentives for small firms and differentiation between legal forms and concentrate on issues arising from opportunities created on incorporation for the conversion of income from labour into income from capital (taxed at a lower rate). Experience in the UK and elsewhere suggests that an approach that relies on defining a sub-category of small businesses will not produce a satisfactory solution. The chapter therefore examines methods of aligning the effective tax treatment of different legal forms: in particular it {{considers the}} advantages of combining a Rate of Return Allowance with an Allowance for Corporate Equity, so as to tax income above the normal return to capital {{at the same rate}} whether it is described as dividend, capital gain or salary.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} <b>labour</b> <b>taxation</b> on wages and employment in a trade union model with endogenous working hours. In the model, individuals choose working hours with a given wage rate, competitive firms decide on employment taking wages and working hours as given and a monopoly union sets wages allowing for the response of both workers and firms. Heads and hours {{are assumed to be}} perfect substitutes in production. The government collects taxes on wages and uses the revenue to finance unemployment benefits and public good. Having derived the results of the conventional decentralised union model we show that when the centralised union perceives the link between taxes paid and public good provided, it will lead to wage moderation and higher employment. Also, wages and employment are shown to be less sensitive to increases in the wage taxation in the centralised union case. In the extreme, if individual worker's marginal utility from public good is sufficiently high, a tax increase can even improve employment. This somewhat surprising result arises because labour supply effect dominates the wage effect on labour demand.
