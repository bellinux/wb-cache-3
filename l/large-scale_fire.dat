500|$|Small, {{independent}} resistance groups {{first appeared}} in 1941–42 but the first to co-ordinate with the Freedom Council was the Samsing Group, responsible for most operations from early 1943. The Samsing group, along with others in and around Aarhus, was dismantled in June 1944 when Grethe [...] "Thora" [...] Bartram turned her family and acquaintances over to German authorities. In response, requests for assistance was sent to contacts in England and in October 1944 the Royal Air Force bombed the Gestapo headquarters successfully destroying archives and obstructing the ongoing investigation. The 5 Kolonne group was established with assistance from Holger Danske to restore a resistance movement in Aarhus along with the L-groups, tasked with assassinating collaborators. Resistance operations escalated from mid-1944 with most major sabotage operations and assassinations occurring in the period 1944–45. The growing resistance was countered with 19 Schalburgtage terror operations by the Peter group from August 1944, including <b>large-scale</b> <b>fire</b> bombings and murders. The increasingly destructive occupation was compounded when an ammunition barge exploded in 1944, destroying much of the harbour and damaging the inner city. On 5 May 1945 German forces in Denmark surrendered but during the transitional period fighting broke out in Aarhus between the resistance and German soldiers resulting in 22 dead.

40|$|In 2004, many <b>large-scale</b> <b>fires</b> {{occurred}} in Alaska and the burned area encompassed about 26, 700 km 2. This {{was the largest}} burned area since 1956, and combined with an additional 19, 000 km 2 burned in 2005 (third-largest fire year), the total burned area comprised about 10 % of the Alaskan boreal forest in just two years. To clarify {{the background of the}} many <b>large-scale</b> <b>fires</b> in 2004, spatial and temporal analyses using various data were performed in this paper. The derived results allow the following conclusion. Dry and warm weather conditions with strong persistent winds are crucial for fires. In 2004, easterly winds from Canada caused two daily hotspot peaks in late June and late August; one daily hotspot peak in mid-July was caused by southwesterly winds from Bethel or the Bristol Bay. These persistent winds lasted for about one week and promoted fire expansion. The above wind conditions in June and August were caused by the development of a high-pressure system over the Beaufort Sea under a persistent blocking ridge over Alaska...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the effects of <b>large-scale</b> <b>fires</b> on {{essential}} pollinators, such as bees. A large wildfire occurred in the savannahs of Mburucuya National Park, Argentina, providing one year of both pre- and post-burn data. This allowed for an impact assessment of distance from fire edge using species diversity and guild characterization, based on nesting materials and body size, to examine bee community responses to fire. Our results generally agree with those of earlier smaller-scale fire impact studies upon bee communities: immediate declines in species richness and abundance but increases in diversity post-burn as well as similar responses from bee guilds based on nesting requirements. Our study suggests: (1) above-ground nesters are unable to colonize recently burned habitat as quickly as ground-nesters regardless of survival rates in situ, (2) ground-nesting bees, regardless of size, are least affected by distance from foraging or nesting resources, (3) patterns of fire impacts on bees become exacerbated near the middle of a large burn area, and (4) <b>large-scale</b> <b>fires</b> will have a greater impact upon above-ground nesters than do smaller-scale burns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Spotting {{ignition}} by lofted firebrands is {{a significant}} mechanism of fire spread, as observed in many <b>large-scale</b> <b>fires.</b> The role of firebrands in fire propagation and the important parameters involved in spot fire development are studied. Historical <b>large-scale</b> <b>fires,</b> including wind-driven urban and wildland conflagrations and post-earthquake fires are given as examples. In addition, research on firebrand behaviour is reviewed. The phenomenon of spotting fires comprises three sequential mechanisms: generation, transport and ignition of recipient fuel. In order to understand these mechanisms, many experiments have been performed, such as measuring drag on firebrands, analysing the flow fields of flame and plume structures, collecting firebrands from burning materials, houses and wildfires, and observing firebrand burning characteristics in wind tunnels under the terminal velocity condition and ignition characteristics of fuel beds. The knowledge obtained from the experiments was used to develop firebrand models. Since Tarifa developed a firebrand model based on the terminal velocity approximation, many firebrand transport models {{have been developed to}} predict maximum spot fire distance. Combustion models of a firebrand were developed empirically and the maximum spot fire distance was found at the burnout limit. Recommendations for future research and development are provided...|$|R
