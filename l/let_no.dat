500|$|After {{completing}} Brothers and Sisters, the Allman Brothers Band {{returned to}} touring, playing larger venues, receiving more profit {{and dealing with}} less friendship, miscommunication and spiraling drug problems. This culminated in a backstage brawl when the band played with the Grateful Dead at Washington's RFK Stadium in June 1973. The roadies of the Dead dosed the food and drinks of {{as many people as}} possible with LSD, holding no compunction about the practice as they felt [...] "evangelical" [...] about the substance. The stage was very crowded with the Dead's entourage, and roadie Kim Payne instructed driver Tuffy Phillips to <b>let</b> <b>no</b> one onstage. When Capricorn promotional chief Dick Wooley attempted to get onstage, Phillips punched Wooley in the nose. Wooley competed in martial arts and began punching back. When all three roadies engaged in the fight, the Dead's security (the Hell's Angels) assumed Wooley a [...] "bad guy" [...] and they joined. Soon, the Grateful Dead's roadies realized the situation at hand and they pulled Wooley from the pile.|$|E
500|$|Tensions rose {{after the}} 1986 general {{election}} {{when it appeared}} that UMNO on its own commanded a working Parliamentary majority, allowing it to govern {{without the support of}} other parties. Several UMNO leaders seriously discussed the possibility of governing alone; one, Abdullah Ahmad, publicly espoused permanent Malay supremacy and relegating non-Malays to second-class citizenship. Such calls for unilateralism were eventually disregarded, and the Barisan Nasional government continued. However, some UMNO officials warned non-Malay parties to avoid [...] "playing with fire" [...] by questioning the Malays' special rights and privileges or Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu. At the UMNO General Assembly that year, Mahathir stated: [...] "We do not wish to rob other people of their rights. But <b>let</b> <b>no</b> one try to rob us of our rights." [...] When Parliament reconvened, the DAP began raising objections to what they alleged was the division of Malaysians into [...] "first and second class citizens". In response, some UMNO MPs began referring to the non-Malays as pendatang asing (foreign immigrants, or aliens) in Parliament. When the DAP attempted to enquire about the distribution of economic equity among the races to evaluate the NEP's progress, the Standing Orders of Parliament were amended to forbid such inquiries. This led the DAP to allege that the NEP's aims had been met, and that it could be allowed to expire in 1990.|$|E
