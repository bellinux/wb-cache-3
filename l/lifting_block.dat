Suspension lifts also impact other factors, such as drive shaft length, steering geometry and brake lines. Legality is often an issue when installing suspension lifts, as many jurisdictions have varying laws on vehicle ride height and placement of lights and bumpers.|$|R

25|$|As glaciers flow over bedrock, they soften and <b>lift</b> <b>blocks</b> of rock {{into the}} ice.

50|$|A <b>block</b> <b>lift</b> (often {{referred}} to as a budget lift) is a modification that is similar to a body lift in the way it works, but used in a different location. <b>Block</b> <b>lifts</b> are used to provide more room between the body and axle of a vehicle for larger tires. A <b>block</b> <b>lift</b> consists of either extended spring isolators or blocks that are inserted between a vehicles axle and spring, or a spring and the vehicles body. This type of lift is often preferred due to the affordability and ease of installation.|$|R
50|$|Some {{methods of}} lifting {{are good for}} the rear, {{but not for the}} front, such as <b>lifting</b> <b>blocks.</b> <b>Lifting</b> the rear with blocks is a common way to achieve the desired height. This is done by {{installing}} a block, of the desired height of lift, in between the leaf spring and leaf spring perch and installing longer U-bolts. It is a bad method for the front primarily because of safety issues while braking. When braking, the front wheels create the majority of the braking force. The block moves this lateral force, caused by braking, higher above the axle than it did in the stock form. This can cause the block to become displaced from its location and result in total loss of control.

5000|$|In the {{milieu of}} levering methods, {{there are those}} that <b>lift</b> the <b>block</b> incrementally, as in {{repeatedly}} prying up alternating sides of the block and inserting a wooden or stone shims to gradually move the stone up one course; {{and there are other}} methods that use a larger lever to move the block up one course in one lifting procedure. Since the discussion of construction techniques to <b>lift</b> the <b>blocks</b> attempts to resolve a gap in the archaeological and historical record with a plausible functional explanation, the following examples by Isler, Keable, and Hussey-Pailos [...] list experimentally tested methods. Isler's method (1985, 1987) is an incremental method and, in the Nova experiment (1992), used wooden shims or cribbing. Isler [...] was able to <b>lift</b> a <b>block</b> up one tier in approximately one hour and 30 minutes. Peter Hodges’s and Julian Keable’s method is similar to Isler's method and instead used small manufactured concrete blocks as shims, wooden pallets, and a pit where their experimental tests were performed. Keable was able to perform his method in approximately 2 minutes. Scott Hussey-Pailos's (2005) method [...] uses a simple levering device to <b>lift</b> a <b>block</b> up a course in one movement. This method was tested with materials of less strength than historical analogs (tested with materials weaker than those available in ancient Egypt), a factor of safety of 2, and <b>lifted</b> a 2500-pound <b>block</b> up one course in under a minute. This method is presented as a levering device to work complementary with Mark Lehner's idea of a combined ramp and levering techniques.|$|R

50|$|When {{defending}} {{against a}} smash, players have three basic options: <b>lift,</b> <b>block,</b> or drive. In singles, a block {{to the net}} {{is the most common}} reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes, but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides, because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.|$|R

50|$|Various {{devices such}} as manual and {{automatic}} air vents are used to address free air which floats up to the high points throughout the system. Automatic air vents contain a valve that is operated by a float. When air is present, the float drops, allowing the valve to open and bleed air out. When water reaches (fills) the valve, the float <b>lifts,</b> <b>blocking</b> the water from escaping. Small (domestic) versions of these valves in older systems are sometimes fitted with a Schrader-type air valve fitting, and any trapped, now-compressed air can be bled from the valve by manually depressing the valve stem until water rather than air begins to emerge.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a hybrid}} scheme is {{proposed}} {{for the implementation of}} two level 2 D-DWT using lifting scheme. Two filter banks consisting of two filters each are used for the implementation of both horizontal and vertical filters. Each of the filter banks are implemented using the lifting scheme. The individual <b>lifting</b> <b>blocks</b> are implemented using wavepipelining and are interconnected with registers. An automation procedure is proposed for tuning the parameters of the wavepipelined circuit. The multipliers in the <b>lifting</b> <b>blocks</b> are implemented using Baugh-Wooley constant coefficient multiplier scheme (BW-KCM). For verifying the efficacy of the scheme proposed, both one level and two level 2 -D DWT schemes for sub images of size 32 x 32 are implemented on Xilinx XC 2 S 150 device. The results for the hybrid scheme are compared with that obtained using non-pipelined and pipelined approaches. For the one level 2 D DWT, the hybrid scheme requires the same area but is faster than nonpipelined scheme by a factor of 1. 4. The pipelined scheme using the pipelined BW-PKCM is faster than the hybrid scheme by a factor of 1. 2 at the cost of increase in the no. of registers by a factor of 2. 73. The delay-power product is lower for hybrid scheme by a factor of 2 than the pipelined scheme. The two level 2 D DWT for both pipelined and non pipelined schemes are implemented. The implementation of hybrid scheme for 2 level 2 D DWT is under progress. The technique proposed in this paper is also applicable for ASICs and FPGAs from other vendors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of hybrid wave-pipelined 2 D DWT using lifting scheme. In this approach different <b>lifting</b> <b>blocks</b> are interconnected using pipelining and the individual blocks are implemented using Wave-Pipelining (WP). For the purpose of comparison, non pipelined scheme {{as well as the}} scheme with pipelining within the blocks and between the blocks is implemented. For images of size 512 × 512, one level 2 D DWT scheme is implemented on Xilinx based SOC Kits, using all the three schemes. From the implementation results, it is concluded that the hybrid WP is faster than non-pipelined and requires less area, less clock routing complexity and lower power than pipelined. The one level 2 D DWT scheme is also implemented, in ASICs using pipelining. This is first of its kind...|$|R

40|$|Future {{high-lift}} systems must achieve improved aerodynamic {{performance with}} simpler designs that involve fewer elements and reduced maintenance costs. To expeditiously achieve this, reliable CFD design tools are required. The development of useful CFD-based design tools for high lift systems requires increased attention to unresolved flow physics issues. The {{complex flow field}} over any multi-element airfoil may {{be broken down into}} certain generic component flows which are termed high-lift building block flows. In this report a broad spectrum of key flow field physics issues relevant to the design of improved high lift systems are considered. It is demonstrated that in-flight experiments utilizing the NASA Dryden Flight Test Fixture (which is essentially an instrumented ventral fin) carried on an F- 15 B support aircraft can provide a novel and cost effective method by which both Reynolds and Mach number effects associated with specific high <b>lift</b> building <b>block</b> flows can be investigated. These in-flight high <b>lift</b> building <b>block</b> flow experiments are most effective when performed in conjunction with coordinated ground based wind tunnel experiments in low speed facilities. For illustrative purposes three specific examples of in-flight high <b>lift</b> building <b>block</b> flow experiments capable of yielding a high payoff are described.
