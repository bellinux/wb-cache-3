5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
25|$|The 'pseudoscope' (Wheatstone {{coined the}} term from the Greek ψευδίς σκοπειν) was {{introduced}} in 1852, and is in some sort the reverse of the stereoscope, since it causes a solid object to seem hollow, and a nearer one to be farther off; thus, a bust {{appears to be a}} mask, and a tree growing outside of a window <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were growing inside the room. Its purpose was to test his theory of stereo vision and for investigations into what would now be called experimental psychology.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} {{used to construct}} the church are of importance {{in the history of}} construction in Puerto Rico. Reinforced concrete, the principal material, was seldom, if at all, used at this early date in Puerto Rico. Contemporary concrete buildings exhibited a lack of understanding of the then-new material, evidenced by extremely thick walls and excessive use of iron beams (traditional means of construction were applied to modern materials). These characteristics are not found in the construction of this building. Nechodoma used the concrete in an elegant and even decorative fashion, demonstrating his knowledge of North-American construction techniques and his distance from the local building customs. The building <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is made of stone and not concrete.|$|E

500|$|The rabbi's {{defenders}} strongly {{objected to}} the decision. His primary supporter, synagogue vice president Louis Jackson, who had broken the story to the press, described the congregation as a [...] "collection of jackasses", with the [...] "chief jackass" [...] being the president Louis Schwartz, who Jackson accused of eating ham himself, and of stealing from the synagogue's charity boxes. Jackson was expelled from the congregation, and subsequently convicted of libel and fined $100 (today $) for making the accusations, while Rosenberg sued the synagogue for his salary. Rosenberg died of pneumonia in April 1893, {{at the age of}} 43, his [...] "health and spirits", according to a contemporary New York Times report, [...] "broken" [...] by the expulsion. At the funeral, Jackson berated the congregation's members, who, he charged, had [...] "hounded, hunted, driven [...] to a grave of misery", and allegedly threatened to kill one of them with a stone taken from the newly dug grave. [...] Charges were again brought against Jackson, but this time were dismissed, with the Justice stating [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were an even thing all around." ...|$|E

500|$|Minority Report is {{a futuristic}} film which portrays {{elements}} of a both dystopian and utopian future. The movie renders a much more detailed view of its future world than the book, and contains new technologies not in Dick's story. From a stylistic standpoint, Minority Report resembles Spielberg's previous film A.I., but also incorporates elements of film noir. Spielberg said that he [...] "wanted to give the movie a noir feel. So I threw myself a film festival. Asphalt Jungle. Key Largo. The Maltese Falcon." [...] The picture was deliberately overlit, and the negative was bleach-bypassed during post-production. The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son's kidnapping at the pool {{is the only one}} shot in [...] "normal" [...] color. Bleach-bypassing gave the film a distinctive look; it desaturated the film's colors, {{to the point that it}} nearly resembles a black-and-white movie, yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture. The color was reduced by [...] "about 40%" [...] to achieve the [...] "washed-out" [...] appearance. Elvis Mitchell, formerly of The New York Times, commented that [...] "he picture <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were shot on chrome, caught on the fleeing bumper of a late '70s car." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Hara {{made her}} screen debut in Walter Forde's Kicking the Moon Around (1938), {{although}} she did not consider it {{a part of her}} filmography. Richman had introduced her to Forde at Elstree Studios, but as she was not cast in the film in a notable role, she agreed to deliver one line in it as a favor to Richman for helping with her screen test. Laughton arranged for her to appear in the low-budget musical My Irish Molly (1938), the only film she made under her real name, Maureen FitzSimons. In the film she plays a woman named Eiléen O'Shea who rescues an orphan girl named Molly. Biographer Aubrey Malone stated of it: [...] "One could argue that O'Hara never looked as enticing as she does in Little Miss Molly, even if she isn't 'Maureen O'Hara' quite yet. She wears no makeup, and there's no Hollywood glamour, but despite (or because of?) that, she is rapturously beautiful. Her accent is thick, which is perhaps why she didn't mention the film much. It also <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were made in the 1920s rather than the 1930s, so primitive are the sets and characters". Malone added that though the lot was [...] "ham-fisted", it is a [...] "quaint film which O'Hara scholars should view if only to see early evidence of her natural instinct for dramatic timing and scene interpretation".|$|E
500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics. Writing for Common Sense Media, Melissa Camacho spoke favorably of the series' emphasis on [...] "a successful and powerful {{segment of the}} African-American community" [...] {{that appears to be}} frequently neglected by the popular television. Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and now it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> might not be viable." [...] Hanh Nguyen from Zap2It shared a similar sentiment, criticizing that the [...] "showy elite and rampant consumerism" [...] that the women regularly display [...] "seems rather out of touch" [...] given the United States' economic hardship, although she elaborated that the program [...] " [...] not by any means boring, but you do {{have to be in the}} mood to watch." ...|$|E

500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> might be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E

Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of Homo sapiens is the ultimate purpose behind evolution.

2500|$|The film {{received}} negative reviews upon release. The film's makeup {{special effects}} were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive and excessive. Film critic Roger Ebert called the film [...] "disappointing", though {{said he found}} it scary {{and that it was}} [...] "a great barf-bag movie." [...] However, he criticized what he felt were poor characterizations and illogical plot elements, ultimately giving the film 2½ stars out of 4. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it [...] "a foolish, depressing, overproduced movie that mixes horror with science fiction to make something that is fun as neither one thing or the other. Sometimes it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> aspired to be the quintessential moron movie of the 80s."
