40|$|Abstract Background The {{effect of}} {{different}} thawing procedures for ram semen frozen in minitubes and mini straws on the fertility of sheep was {{tested in a}} field trial. Methods Altogether, 719 Norwegian Crossbred ewes, aged between six months and six-and-a-half years from 8 farms, were inseminated vaginally in natural oestrus with frozen-thawed semen. Minitubes were thawed at 70 °C for 8 sec (T 70) and mini straws either at 50 °C for 9 sec (S 50) or at 35 °C for 12 sec (S 35). Results Vaginal insemination with 200 × 10 6 spermatozoa resulted in 25 -days non-return rates of 63. 2, 59. 6, and 62. 5 % (overall 61. 8 %), respectively, and lambing rates of 56. 8, 55. 0, and 59. 2 % (overall 57. 0 %), respectively. No significant effect on fertility (as 25 -days non-return- or <b>lambing</b> <b>rate)</b> was seen for straw type/thawing temperature (P = 0. 5 / 0. 5), but semen filled in mini straws and thawed at 35 °C resulted numerically in the highest <b>lambing</b> <b>rate</b> (59. 2 %). A significant effect was, however, seen for farmer (P = > 0. 0001 /> 0. 0001) and ram (P = 0. 009 / 0. 002). Moreover, age of the ewes {{had a significant effect}} on the NR rate (0. 007), but not on <b>lambing</b> <b>rate</b> (P = 0. 2).

40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the effects of intravaginal FGA sponges inserted for 4 or 12 days with or without eCG on reproductive performance of ewes out-of-season. Forty-eight anestrous ewes were assigned in equal numbers to four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Ewes were administered with FGA sponges on May 17 for 12 days (12 -day-FGA-eCG and 12 -day-FGA groups, n= 12 each) and on May 25 for 4 days (4 -day-FGA-eCG and 4 -day-FGA groups, n= 12 each). All treatments were timed to end together on May 29 (day 0, 0 h) at which time sponges were withdrawn and eCG or saline was injected. Five fertile rams which had been isolated from ewes were joined at 0 h for breeding and estrus detection. Blood samples were collected to compare progesterone (P 4) concentrations and for pregnancy diagnosis. Overall estrus expression occurred in 40 / 48 ewes which differed only between 12 -day-FGA-eCG and 4 -day-FGA (p 0. 1) and increased gradually thereafter until day 15. Progesterone remained elevated through day 19 in 11 / 12, 8 / 12, 9 / 12 and 6 / 12 ewes, respectively, which were diagnosed pregnant on day 30 by ultrasonography. Of the 34 ewes that became pregnant, 31 lambed 150 days following day 0.

40|$|The aim of {{this trial}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness (fertility and lambing) of priming with a single injection of progesterone plus PMSG in anovulatory lactating Sarda ewes subjected to the ram effect (RE) in spring. Thirty ewes (P 4 group) were i. m. injected with 30 mg progesterone and 500 IU PMSG 36 h before ram introduction (d 0). This treatment was compared to a 12 -day treatment with fluorogestone acetate intravaginal sponges that was followed by injections of 350 IU PMSG upon sponge withdrawal (FGA group, n = 30). All ewes responded to RE, showing plasma progestrone concentrations > 1 ng/mL between d 6 and 12 (FGA) or 6 and 9 (P 4). Eighty-nine percent of the P 4 ewes conceived at first ovulation, and 11 % conceived following a short estrus cycle. Lambings occurred on d 150. 4 ± 3. 9, and the <b>lambing</b> <b>rate</b> was 100 %. The fertility of the FGA ewes was 83 % for the induced ovulation and was 7 % for the second ovulation after a normal cycle. The FGA ewes lambed on d 149. 8 ± 4. 4, and the <b>lambing</b> <b>rate</b> was 83 %. Two abortions were recorded for the FGA ewes, which had higher prolificacy than the P 4 group (2. 2 ± 0. 8 vs. 1. 8 ± 0. 4, respectively; P< 0. 05). Both fertility and the <b>lambing</b> <b>rate</b> were high in both groups, {{with a high degree of}} estrus synchronization, and there were no significant differences between the groups.

40|$|Age-specific {{death rates}} are {{presented}} {{for the period}} 1953 - 70. Mortality was higher than in more favourable environments and was extremely high in lambs and weaners. only Reproduction rates were low at all ages; the <b>lambing</b> <b>rate</b> at its highest 63 per cent and only 75 per cent of these lambs survived to marking. Both autumn and spring joinings were considered. Losses at different stages in the reproductive cycle were examined and most were attributed to poor nutrition in spring and early summer. Provision of adequate nutrition for autumn-born ewe weaners is suggested to facilitate selection for a more productive animal in this environment. This may also bring an immediate improvement in flock productivity. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of different culture media on in vitro embryo production in terms of pregnancy rate, <b>lambing</b> <b>rate,</b> lamb body weight and to compare gene expression in in vivo vs in vitro embryos. Blastocysts were in vitro produced in different culture media with BSA at different doses or serum and divided in: A(BSA 4), B(BSA 8), C(BSA 8 –HA), D(BSA 8 -CH) and E (FBS 10) groups. On day 6 - 7 blastocysts (A, B, C, D groups) were transferred into recipient ewes either fresh or after vitrification. For gene expression in vitro produced and in vivo derived (F group) fresh embryos were analyzed by quantitative Real Time PCR. Gene expression for imprinting (IGF 2 R, GRB 10, UBE 2 A), embryo development (LAMA 1, IL- 6, FGF 4), apoptosis (BAX) and methylation (DNMT 3 A) was analyzed. Pregnancy and <b>lambing</b> <b>rate</b> were similar only for fresh groups, while among vitrified groups A vs D showed significant difference (P < 0. 05). The birth weight was higher for B and C within groups both fresh and vitrified. However, IGF 2 R and UBE 2 A were significantly upregulated (P< 0. 05) in in vitro groups compared with in vivo group. Furthermore, UBE 2 A was significantly upregulated (P< 0. 05) in C compared with to other in vitro groups. LAMA 1 was significantly upregulated (P< 0. 05) in group A compared to all groups. Our data confirm that use of different culture media affects the blastocysts quality in terms of cryotolerance, body weight and gene expression...|$|E

Pregnancy rates of ewes, birth weight and weaning weight of the lambs were investigated with respect to the duration of two reproduction period. The female lambs were first mated at 11 month of age and at an avarage body weight of 37. 49 ± 0. 766 kg, second at 20 month with the body weight of 45. 32 ± 0. 987 kg. <b>Lambing</b> <b>rate</b> for ewes mated at 11 month of age was found % 100 and for ewes mated at 20 month of age was % 83, survival rate of lambs up to weaning were % 96. 5 and % 90. 6 respectively.

Moreover, Lamb wrote: [...] "'Come Back to Me' is unlikely to linger too long in your memory, but it also fails to generate any annoying after taste. Program it into your listening when you need a contemporary, breezy, light pop confection... Sure, you are being manipulated by the corporate music establishment, but the song is fun."

30|$|Lamb {{mortality}} {{is a challenge}} for sheep production systems (Paim et al. 2013). Much of the lamb mortality occurs in the first weeks of life (Nowak et al. 2000), where survival depends on the complex interaction between the ability of mother to care for it and lamb viability. Therefore, ewes at the first parturition may have low mother care which can impact the <b>lamb</b> mortality <b>rate.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{result of}} an {{intensive}} 15 months study of 10 flocks of indigenous sheep is recorded. <b>Lambing</b> <b>rates</b> approach 1. 5 lambs per ewe per year, but a death rate of 23 percent and on off take of 27 per cent, means that flock numbers are probably slightly declining. Twins account for 14 per cent of all births but the death <b>rate</b> of twin <b>lambs</b> is almost twice that of single lambs up to 6 months of age. Increased productivity is therefore {{more likely to be}} achieved by improving the survival and growth <b>rates</b> of single <b>lambs</b> that by selection for twining. The weighed average rate of lightweight gain for all surviving lambs is 82 g per day up to 1 year of age, and is better than that recorded for any other indigenous African sheep. Meat production per kg of breeding female, at 0. 253 kg up to 6 months of age of the young, is almost six times the production of cattle under the same management and environmental conditions, but is inferior to that of goats...|$|R
