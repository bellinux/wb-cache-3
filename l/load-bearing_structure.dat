Removal of affected materials may also be necessary for remediation, if materials are easily replaceable and not part of the <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structure.</b> Professional drying of concealed wall cavities and enclosed spaces such as cabinet toekick spaces may be required. Post-remediation verification of moisture content and fungal growth is required for successful remediation. Many contractors perform post-remediation verification themselves, but property owners may benefit from independent verification.|$|E
25|$|ATK {{worked with}} Northrop Grumman {{to produce the}} {{backplane}} support frame (BSF) for the James Webb Space Telescope. The BSF, center section, and wings form {{what is called the}} primary mirror backplane support system (PMBSS). The BSF is the primary <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structure</b> during launch and the PMBSS holds the telescope's main instruments, including its mirrors. The BSF was designed and manufactured at ATK's facilities in Magna, Utah. ATK designed and fabricated more than 10,000 parts for the PMBSS. PMBSS is made primarily of lightweight graphite, but numerous other materials including invar, titanium, and other composite materials were used.|$|E

Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population, in both traditional societies as well as developed countries, still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structure.</b> Also a primary ingredient in many natural building techniques, clay is used to create adobe, cob, cordwood, and rammed earth structures and building elements such as wattle and daub, clay plaster, clay render case, clay floors and clay paints and ceramic building material. Clay was used as a mortar in brick chimneys and stone walls where protected from water.|$|E

25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structure</b> of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the Balinese {{compound}} {{appears to}} lack the adequate provision for sleeping, eating and bathing {{of the modern}} Western culture. All buildings within a Balinese compound lack wall; in the most basic house compound, the only pavilion building that is enclosed with walls is the pavilion where {{the head of the}} family sleeps. The rest of the family member sleep in an open pavilion. Pavilions are often wall-less, erected over a low plinth, and surmounted by a clay pantiles or thatched roof, which is supported by a timber or bamboo frame depending on wealth of the owner. The wall, if erected, only constitutes a screen to provide privacy and not a <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structure.</b> Each building in a house compound is identified with a certain cardinal direction, body organ, color and deity; depending on its placement.|$|E

2500|$|The Ba.88 was an all-metal, twin-engine, two-crew monoplane, with a {{high-mounted}} wing. It {{employed a}} [...] "concentric" [...] fuselage design, with {{a framework of}} steel tubes and a metallic skin covering which was both streamlined (having a very small fuselage cross-section) and strong. However, this internal <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structure</b> was very complex and of outdated design, as monocoque designs were starting to be developed elsewhere. The internal struts resulted in excessive weight compounded by manufacturing delays. The narrow confines of the fuselage would require the Ba.88 to carry bombs in a semi-external structure, much {{to the detriment of}} the aircraft's aerodynamics. The all-metal wings had two longerons, and housed the engine nacelles, undercarriage main elements, and the majority of the 12 self-sealing fuel tanks (the only protective armour in the aircraft), providing 1,586L (419US gal) total capacity. All three undercarriage units were retractable, which was unusual for the time.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the role played}} by <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structures</b> in determining the formal characteristics that distinguish the historicist architecture of the nineteenth century that uses iron <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structures</b> or components. As shown in the examples studied, except for some proportion or size changes, iron structures did not produce significant changes at the level of architectural space and form, beeing in most cases subject to the aesthetic rules imposed by established architectural language. In those few situations where the load-bearing system has brought significant changes, this issue was managed distinctively by historicist architecture: 1 - in an attempt to provide prestige and overall coherence, it has used the morphology of the established architectural language in order to subordinate through decoration; 2 - through new principles of order, derived from those that formed the basis of established architectural language, some of which later become paradigmatic in the modern architecture, it has provided the conceptual framework through which new typologies could be born. The conclusion underlines that the iron <b>load-bearing</b> <b>structures</b> by them self were not able to determine any formal characteristics of the historicist architecture. Their role was that of a catalyst for change, opening up the established architectural language...|$|R
