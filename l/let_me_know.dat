5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

500|$|Upon retirement, Barkley {{was later}} quoted as stating, {{in regard to}} his career, [...] "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing—the {{spitting}} incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game. It <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Push the Button" [...] was conceptualised after {{group member}} Keisha Buchanan {{developed}} an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say."

[...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language. Musically, [...] "Push the Button" [...] received comparisons {{to the sound of}} pop group ABBA.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk to you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E
500|$|... "Scream" [...] {{contains}} heavily sexual lyrics.

[...] DJ Booth depicted the track to be about orgasms. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner wrote that [...] "Scream" [...] contains [...] "sex-fuelled lyrics" [...] portrayed in the line [...] "I see you over there so hypnotic/ Thinkin' 'bout what I'd do to that body".|$|E

500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man."

500|$|... "Anticipating" [...] is a teen pop and dance-pop {{that lasts}} {{for three minutes}} and 16 seconds. Corey Moss of MTV noted the song also has a 1970s disco sound, while Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{compared}} it to early Madonna tracks such as [...] "Holiday" [...] (1983). Glenn Gamboa of Newsday compared the song to Janet Jackson's [...] "All for You", calling it [...] "pleasant, shimmering R-styled pop". According to the sheetmusic published at musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is composed in the key of F major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 112 beats per minute.

Lyrically, it talks about friendship and camaraderie between women. During the bridge, Spears sings, [...] "Gotta really <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> {{if you want me}} / You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy". During the time of the album's release, her official site stated that [...] "the girl-power anthem 'Anticipating' proves that Britney is, now more than ever, {{a force to be reckoned}} with." ...|$|E
60|$|Once, however, he varied his program, {{and gave}} me a terrible start, <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> for a moment just how it feels to be hunted, at the same time showing with what {{marvelous}} stillness he can glide through the thickest cover when he chooses.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, hardly," [...] he answered, {{leaning back}} luxuriously in his arm-chair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe.

500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] is an uptempo gospel {{song with}} {{elements}} of pop music. The song was also noted for exploring elements of Contemporary Christian {{as well as}} electronic dance music. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse felt that the song contained a [...] "zippy", reggae-dance beat. Its instrumentation includes percussion instruments, synths and horn stabs along with African beats. According to sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., [...] "Say Yes" [...] is written in the key of D major using common time. It contains a moderately fast tempo with a metronome of 120 beats per minute and the singers' vocal elements range from the low note of A3 to the high note of F5. The song samples a popular Nigerian gospel tune originally titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Chris Payne and Colin Stutz of Billboard magazine {{described it as a}} modern dance and contemporary electronic dance reworking of that song. Stutz also found elements of an [...] "upbeat swing" [...] of West African gospel. Regarding the composition of the song, Williams stated, [...] "It is a song that came from Africa {{more than a hundred years}} ago. I don't think anyone knows who wrote it or who started singing that chorus. When the song leaked last week, so many people from Africa and Nigeria were trying to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> where it came from." ...|$|E
500|$|The track segues {{directly}} into [...] "What's My Age Again?", also penned by Hoppus, who created it partially {{as a joke}} to amuse friends. It was originally titled [...] "Peter Pan Complex", referencing the subject matter: one who refuses to grow up. [...] "Dysentery Gary" [...] leads off {{the second half of}} the album, and was written by DeLonge about a crush that instead chooses someone else. Left with [...] "nothing better to do," [...] the devastated friend chooses to mock her boyfriend. It was one of the first songs the band wrote with Barker, who incorporated a [...] "Latin groove" [...] into his drumming. [...] "Adam's Song," [...] the piano-laced seventh track of the record, was written primarily based on the loneliness that Hoppus experienced during the unending days of touring the previous year. When Hoppus brought the song to the band, the trio reacted positively but showed reluctance to add it to the record, believing the dark subject matter might off-put listeners. Although usually vocals would take many alternate takes to complete, Hoppus completed the vocal track for [...] "Adam's Song" [...] in a single take. The power pop-inspired [...] "All the Small Things" [...] was composed by DeLonge as both an ode to his girlfriend and one of his favorite bands, the Ramones. During the recording process of Enema of the State, DeLonge came home to find roses at the top of the stairs from his girlfriend, which inspired the line: [...] "She left me roses by the stairs; surprises <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> she cares." ...|$|E
500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> {{what he was thinking}} without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
60|$|We were housed only yesterday.

60|$|When Amy came up, she {{was quite}} confounded to hear the {{relation}} which the Quaker gave her, and found means to acquaint me of it; only <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>know,</b> to my great satisfaction, {{that she would not}} come to Tunbridge first, but that she would certainly go to Newmarket or Bury first.|$|R
60|$|Amy did {{not tell}} me this story for a great while, nor did she well know what course to take in it; but as she had {{authority}} to manage everything in the family, she took occasion some time after, without <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> anything of it, to find some fault with the maid and turn her away.|$|R
