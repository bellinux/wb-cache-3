5|$|After its {{announcement}} in 1995, the project stalled because P Associates {{was unable to}} find investors to finance the project. Investors were skeptical that <b>luxury</b> residential apartments outside the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in Center City could be successful. The delay allowed another developer to announce an agreement to acquire the property. In March 1999, Chicago-based developer the Barton Group announced its plan to build a 37-story, 322-unit <b>luxury</b> residential tower. The Barton Group's plan would also incorporate the PSFS headquarters building and York Row into the tower.|$|E

40|$|Consumer theory {{suggests}} that expenditures on <b>luxuries</b> and durables should be more cyclical than expenditures on necessities and nondurables. Estimating luxuriousness and durability for 57 consumer goods, we confirm this prediction in U. S. data. We exploit this finding to test predictions of cyclical utilization and increasing returns models of business cycles. Both models predict more cyclical productivity for durable <b>luxuries,</b> a prediction borne out in the data. The utilization model predicts procyclical relative prices for durables and luxuries; the increasing returns model does not. Prices are more procyclical for durables and <b>luxuries,</b> discriminating in favor of cyclical utilization. I...|$|R

5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, <b>luxury</b> goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value <b>luxury</b> items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E

5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a <b>luxury</b> model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and <b>luxury</b> Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E

If the income tax is less progressive than optimal, necessities should bear a lower tax rate than <b>luxuries.</b> If low-income households are income-constrained so cannot afford <b>luxuries,</b> it may be optimal to tax necessities at higher rates than <b>luxuries,</b> depending whether labor varies along the intensive or extensive margin. optimal income tax, Atkinson-Stiglitz Theorem, indirect taxes...|$|R
