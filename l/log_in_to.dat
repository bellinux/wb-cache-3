40|$|Sniffers {{are common}} {{tools of the}} hacker trade. Typically, hackers gain entry to a host machine on a network and install a {{password}} sniffer to obtain passwords which they hope {{will allow them to}} compromise other hosts. Since sniffers are so widely used, the ability to detect when sniffers are running on a network can be a tremendous help in fighting off hacker attacks. Unfortunately, there is currently very little help for the system administrator to detect the presence of sniffers on the network. Other than <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> all the machines on the network and checking if a sniffer is running (and in most cases, hackers can hide their trails), the system administrator is left with no other tools to help them find sniffers. This paper presents the design and implementation of tools which can give system administrators a helping hand. These tools detect when a sniffer is running on a Ethernet network remotely, without <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the machines. 1 INTRODUCTION Sniffers are programs which a [...] ...|$|R

Engineering books are often taken on rent for a semester or 2 and returned after use. With the online space roaring, newer start ups have emerged in online book renting.
