5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight times more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen {{times more likely to}} develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E
50|$|The glass cliff is the {{phenomenon}} of women in leadership roles, such as executives {{in the corporate world}} and female political election candidates, being <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> achieve leadership roles during periods of crisis or downturn, when the chance of failure is highest.|$|R
50|$|Haslam {{has said}} that women {{executives}} are <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> accept glass cliff positions {{because they do not}} have access to the high-quality information and support that would ordinarily warn executives away. Utah State University professors Ali Cook and Christy Glass say women and other minorities view risky job offers as the only chance they are likely to get.|$|R
5000|$|Trans {{men have}} less success fitting in with and {{identifying}} with the gay male community because {{it tends to}} be more cisgender-focused and body-focused (especially in terms of being phallocentric); as a result, gay trans <b>men</b> are likelier <b>to</b> partner with each other than with a cisgender gay man. [...] There are, however, cases of women being <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> thoroughly question trans men about their motivations for modifying their bodies.|$|R

25|$|The German Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency stated {{on their}} website that the {{establishment}} of women's parking spaces does not violate the General Equal Treatment Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz), because women are more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> be victims of sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Grameen {{microfinance}} model inspired similar efforts in about 100 developing countries and even in developed countries including the United States. Many microcredit projects retain Grameen's emphasis of lending to women.

5000|$|Analyzing {{a number}} of studies, Gregory M. Herek, a {{psychology}} professor at the University of California at Davis, concluded: “The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>to</b> molest children. This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children. But {{there is no scientific}} basis for asserting that they are more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>to</b> do so... Many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.” ...|$|R
50|$|Lesbians {{are more}} <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> gay <b>men</b> <b>to</b> engage in {{heterosexual}} sex, suggesting greater variability in their sexuality. No {{research has been}} done on people with gender variation, such as transgender people.|$|R

25|$|Children {{raised in}} {{alcoholic}} families {{have the potential}} to suffer emotional distress as they move into their own committed relationships. These children are at a higher risk for divorce and separation, unstable marital conditions and fractured families. Feelings of depression and antisocial behaviors experienced in early childhood frequently contribute to marital conflict and domestic violence. Women are more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> be victims of alcohol-related domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|While {{women in}} the United States tend to live longer than men, they {{generally}} are of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and therefore have more barriers to accessing healthcare. Being of lower SES also tends to increase societal pressures, {{which can lead to}} higher rates of depression and chronic stress and, in turn, negatively impact health. Women are also more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> suffer from sexual or intimate-partner violence both in the United States and worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Cannibalism {{has also}} been implicated as a {{transmission}} mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as kuru, once found primarily among women and children of the Fore people in Papua New Guinea. While {{the men of the}} tribe ate the body of the deceased and rarely contracted the disease, the women and children, who ate the less desirable body parts, including the brain, were eight times more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> contract kuru from infected tissue.|$|E

25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why women are more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> live in poverty. 63% of female households who have {{children under the age}} of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less of an education than whites. There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.|$|E
25|$|Women {{are more}} <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> {{experience}} sexual harassment, {{especially for those}} working in traditionally masculine occupations. In addition, a study indicated that sexual harassment negatively affects workers' psychological well-being. Another study found that level of harassment at workplaces lead to differences in performance of work related tasks. High levels of harassment {{were related to the}} worst outcomes, and no harassment was related to least negative outcomes. In other words, women who had experienced a higher level of harassment were more likely to perform poorly at workplaces.|$|E
25|$|Women {{tend to have}} poorer health {{outcomes}} than men for several reasons ranging from sustaining greater risk to diseases to experiencing higher mortality rates. In the Population Studies Center Research Report by Rachel Snow that compares the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of both male and females, the global DALYs lost to females for sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are more than ten times greater {{than those of the}} males. Moreover, the female DALYs to male DALYs ratio for malnutrition-related diseases such as Iron-Deficiency Anemia are often close to 1.5, suggesting that poor nutrition impacts women at a much higher level than men. Additionally, in terms of mental illnesses, women are also two to three times more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> be diagnosed with depression. With regards to suicidal rates, up to 80% of those who committed suicide or attempted suicide in Iran are women.|$|E

40|$|Heterosexual {{transmission}} of HIV in India {{is driven by}} the male use of female sex workers (FSW), but few studies have examined the factors associated with using FSW. This nationally representative study examined the prevalence and correlates of FSW use among 31, 040 men aged 15 – 49 years in India in 2006. Nationally, about 4 % of men used FSW in the previous year, representing about 8. 5 million FSW clients. Unmarried men were far more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> married <b>men</b> <b>to</b> use FSW overall (PR = 8. 0), but less <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> married <b>men</b> <b>to</b> use FSW among those reporting at least one non-regular partner (PR = 0. 8). More than half of all FSW clients were married. FSW use was higher among men in the high-HIV states than in the low-HIV states (PR = 2. 7), and half of all FSW clients lived in the high-HIV states. The risk of FSW use rose sharply with increasing number of non-regular partners in the past year. Given the large number of men using FSW, interventions for th...|$|R
25|$|According to {{results from}} the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 14,000 people about their sexual orientation, 94.2% of New Zealanders {{identify}} as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual. No gender {{differences were found in}} the share of New Zealanders identifying as heterosexual (94.1% of men and 94.4% of women) or pansexual (0.5% of both men and women), but men were more likely to identify as gay (3.5%) than women (1.8%), and women were more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> identify as bisexual (2.1% versus 1.5%), bicurious (0.7% v. 0.4%) and asexual (0.4% v. 0.1%). Women in all the non-heterosexual categories were significantly younger than women in the heterosexual category. Men in the gay, bisexual, and bicurious categories categories were also significantly younger than heterosexual men.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic worship {{practiced by}} one Muslim {{may differ from}} another's in minor details, which can affect the precise actions and words involved. Differences arise because of {{different}} interpretations of the Islamic legal sources by the different schools of law (madhhabs) in Sunni Islam, and by different legal traditions within Shia Islam. In the case of ritual worship these differences are generally minor, and should rarely cause dispute. Muslims believe that Muhammad practiced, taught, and disseminated the worship ritual in the whole community of Muslims and made it part of their life. The practice has, therefore, been concurrently and perpetually practiced by the community {{in each of the}} generations. The authority for the basic forms of the Salah is neither the hadiths nor the Qur'an, but rather the consensus of Muslims. Differences also occur due to optional (recommended rather than obligatory) articles of prayer procedure, for example, which verses of the Quran to recite. A 2015 Pew Research Center study found that women are two percent more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> pray on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the gender}} gap has varied over many years, {{women of all ages}} are more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> {{identify}} as Democrats. Recent polls have indicated that 41% of women identify as Democrats while only 25% of women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men identify as Democrats, 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents. Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to identify as Democrats. Also, American women that identified as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican. Again, women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic. The National Federation of Democratic Women is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues. The Woman's National Democratic Club works to promote the Democratic party. National women's organizations that support Democratic candidates are Emily's List, which aims to help elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates to office, and often but not always the National Organization for Women.|$|E
50|$|Most {{research}} on HIV/AIDS focuses on gay and bisexual <b>men</b> <b>than</b> lesbians and bisexual women. Evidence for risky sexual behavior in bisexually behaving men has been conflicted. Bisexually active {{men have been}} shown to be just as likely as gay or heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>to</b> use condoms. Men who have sex with men and women are less <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> homosexually behaving <b>men</b> <b>to</b> be HIV-positive or engage in unprotected receptive anal sex, but more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> heterosexually behaving <b>men</b> <b>to</b> be HIV-positive. Although there are no confirmed cases of HIV transmitted from female to female, women who have sex with both men and women have higher rates of HIV than homosexual or heterosexual women.|$|R
5000|$|Women have {{traditionally}} had more {{limited access to}} improved means of personal transportation and thus had more limited local mobility. [...] Women surveyed in England were less <b>likely</b> overall <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> have drivers licenses and took longer to get to key destinations. Women often seek work closer to home compared <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> taking jobs in a more geographically confined area and relying more on non-automobile transportation. Access to personal transportation can improve women's choice of feasible destinations and decrease average trip time.|$|R
40|$|Studies report gender {{differences}} in medical service utilization among persons with HIV, although most compare women to heterogeneous groups of men. Competing needs for medical care of women may contribute to those differences. We examined prospectively the role that competing social, economic and health needs, such as caring for others, play in {{gender differences}} in hospital, ambulatory and emergency room (ER) visits. We considered sexual identity to study women, gay/bisexual men and heterosexual men {{in the most recent}} wave (n = 1, 385) of the HCSUS, a nationally representative sample of persons with HIV/AIDS in care in the United States. We considered gay/bisexual men and heterosexual men separately because their different resources and social networks may lead to disparate service utilization. Multivariate regression showed that women were more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> gay/bisexual <b>men</b> <b>to</b> be hospitalized, while women and gay/bisexual <b>men</b> were more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>to</b> use the ER without subsequent hospitalization. Controlling for competing needs eliminated neither difference but predicted hospitalization and ER use. Findings suggest that addressing competing needs could reduce unnecessary hospitalization and ER use for both genders. Furthermore, examinations of {{gender differences in}} service use should include sexual identity...|$|R
25|$|An {{update on}} the above study; it employs the same methodology, has a larger sample (20,055 {{respondent}}s), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the entire sample (or 96.8% {{of the men and}} 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a non-significant difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> identify as bisexual, and less likely to report exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine percent of men and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.|$|E
25|$|Problem {{benzodiazepine}} use can {{be associated}} with various deviant behaviors, including drug-related crime. In a survey of police detainees carried out by the Australian Government, both legal and illegal users of benzodiazepines were found to be more likely to have lived on the streets, less likely to have been in full-time work and more likely to have used heroin or methamphetamines in the past 30 days from the date of taking part in the survey. Benzodiazepine users {{were also more likely to}} be receiving illegal incomes and more likely to have been arrested or imprisoned in the previous year. Benzodiazepines were sometimes reported to be used alone, but most often formed part of a poly drug-using problem. Female users were more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> be using heroin, whereas male users were more likely to report amphetamine use. Benzodiazepine users were more likely than non-users to claim government financial benefits and benzodiazepine users who were also poly-drug users were the most likely to be claiming government financial benefits. Those who reported using benzodiazepines alone were found to be in the mid-range when compared to other drug using patterns in terms of property crimes and criminal breaches. Of the detainees reporting benzodiazepine use, one in five reported injection use, mostly of illicit temazepam, with some who reported injecting prescribed benzodiazepines. The injection was a concern in this survey due to increased health risks. The main problems highlighted in this survey were concerns of dependence, the potential for overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with opiates and the health problems associated with injection of benzodiazepines.|$|E
