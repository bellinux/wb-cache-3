40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new home for the aging baby boomers. The US is about to see a massive influx in the elderly population, and the current model of housing the elderly is woefully unprepared. The boomer {{generation}} has lived in single family homes for decades, and will want to continue living in one. Current strategies for retrofitting homes for seniors, things like wheelchair ramps, stair <b>lifts,</b> <b>grab</b> bars, are remark-ably ill-suited to properly accommodate {{the needs of the}} elderly. Incorporating embedded computation into the home will allow the elderly to maintain their independence, and live in an environment which accommo-dates their expanding and changing needs as they deteriorate both mentally and physically. The home will {{take an active role in}} monitoring the occupant, monitoring itself, adapting to the changing physical/mental dexterity of the occupants, as well as assisting with domestic activities. Given the varying degrees of com...|$|R
50|$|The machine {{concept was}} a {{standard}} base to each model on which optional front-end equipment could be mounted with appropriate counterbalances, crawler track frames and minimal additional machinery. The most common variants included face shovel, dragline, <b>lifting</b> crane and <b>grabbing</b> crane. Less common variants included drag shovel, skimmer and pile driver. Some cranes were also lorry-mounted. All machines had 360 degree rotation on a conical section roller path.|$|R
40|$|Built environments can be {{made more}} people-friendly by {{involving}} those who design, build, maintain and use them. It’s all about people: what they think, what they do, what information they have and exchange and what they need and want. This is not just as something special, {{but as part of}} their everyday lives - as a right, not a privilege. If we continue to see access features (such as <b>lifts,</b> ramps, <b>grab</b> rails) only as separate add-on items, it will still not add up to being a people-friendly place. A value-added approach to design & specification asks ‘how can we take what we have and make it so much better, to maximise access features and make them an intrinsic part of the whole built environment?’ Value-added environments are seamless and are often experienced unnoticed...|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} to {{the wheelbarrow}} facebuster which sees the attacking wrestler {{stand at the}} side of an opponent and begin to lift them as for a belly-to-back suplex. Instead of falling backwards to drop the opponent back-first, the wrestler stops after <b>lifting</b> the opponent, <b>grabs</b> a hold of his/her legs while still holding the opponent up, and slams him/her face-first on to the mat. Jushin Thunder Liger is well known for using this move as a finisher, calling it the Crash Thunder Buster.|$|R
25|$|At art {{exhibitions}} {{the visitor}} usually {{is not allowed}} to touch the displayed objects, not even when they clearly have a functional background like an artistic chair or jewellery. Therefore, Noten used a funfair machine he called Mr Claw to offer visitors the opportunity to actually touch works of art. Mr Claw contains plastic bubbles with small pieces of jewellery inside the visitor can attempt to grab by using the machine's remote-controlled grabber. As a special attraction Noten put a 1kg silver bar inside as well (unfortunately this item is too heavy to be <b>lifted</b> by the <b>grabber).</b> Mr Claw was used at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam Geel metalliek: Goud voor Robert Smit exhibition on contemporary jewellery in 2004, and at the Icon Experiment 2008 exhibition in London, UK.|$|R
25|$|Rounding a {{bend and}} nearing the East River, the tram {{encountered}} Kong {{hanging from the}} Queensboro Bridge. A police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on Kong to protect the approaching tram. Kong retaliated, pounding the roof of tram and sending the chopper crashing and exploding into the bridge. Narrowly escaping the attack, the tram finally crossed over the river to Roosevelt Island. A second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram, inhibiting the view of what lay ahead. The tram operator urged the chopper {{to turn off the}} light, and in doing so, revealed that Kong had cut the tram off. He proceeded to <b>grab,</b> <b>lift</b> and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter. After narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time, small television monitors lowered from the tram's ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride as part of a breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the Roosevelt Island station. Although Kong was never actually defeated, the news report indicated that he was making his way away from New York City, thereby alleviating the threat.|$|R
40|$|The {{soil tare}} of sugar beet from wet clay soils should {{be reduced to}} lower the cost and prevent some {{negative}} effects of soil tare. Commonly used share lifters press the soil onto the sugar beet and, thereafter, the soil adheres strongly to the beet and is difficult to remove from the beet by mechanical cleaning systems. With the objective to reduce adhering-soil tare and soil adherence, a grab lifter (extraction, three variants) and a driven rotary-shoe lifter were compared with a conventional driven polder share lifter in a field experiment on clay soil. Soil tare after quick extraction with a small-pitch, spiral motion was reduced {{by a factor of}} 3. 8 - 6. 2, depending on the wetness of the soil. Relative soil adherence was reduced by a factor of 1. 5. Soil tare after lifting with a driven rotary-shoe lifter was reduced by a factor of 3. 7, irrespective of the soil wetness. Relative soil adherence was not reduced. For both uprooting methods, dug losses were slightly higher and superficial beet damage was lower compared to share lifting. While complex engineering and crown fracture hinder practical application of <b>grab</b> <b>lifting,</b> the driven rotary-shoe lifter offers good potential for reduction of soil tare in practice.
