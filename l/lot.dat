5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the <b>LOT,</b> this leaves him open to the question of why the <b>LOT</b> itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the <b>LOT</b> itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the <b>LOT)</b> in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the <b>LOT</b> itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the <b>LOT,</b> then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the <b>LOT</b> would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the <b>LOT</b> is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
5|$|By 1778, Isaac Parsons (1752–96) was in {{ownership}} of <b>Lot</b> Number 17. The parcel was later resurveyed for David Hunter by surveyor John Mitchel on April17, 1788. <b>Lot</b> Number 17 {{was bound to}} the west by the Yellow Banks and the South Branch Potomac River below, to the north by <b>Lot</b> Number 20, and to the south by <b>Lot</b> Number 16. Most of the western area of the present-day corporate boundaries of Romney were located within <b>Lot</b> Number 17. <b>Lot</b> Number 17's eastern boundary stretched between the present-day Savilla-Vale and Wirgman Hill neighborhoods of Romney. The location of Valley {{was not included in}} surveyor John Mitchel's plan for Romney dated June 30, 1790, and the forested lands of Depot Valley remained undeveloped into the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to housing {{the rental car}} facilities, a six-story parking garage (which {{is attached to the}} terminal) provides long-term and short-term parking. Lower cost satellite parking options, with continuous free shuttle service, {{can be found in the}} Blue, Red and Green parking lots along International Gateway. The Blue <b>lot</b> is the closest to the terminal and also offers some covered parking. The cost of parking a car in the blue <b>lot</b> is $9 per 24 hours. The Red <b>Lot</b> costs $7 per 24 hours and the green lost costs $5 per 24 hours to park.The Green <b>lot</b> is the furthest away from the terminal. Additionally, there is a free cell phone <b>lot</b> accessed from the outbound side of International Gateway.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} plats for {{the development}} subdivided the 80 acre into 50 ft <b>lots.</b> Between 1928 and 1937, the <b>lots</b> were re-platted and consolidated into acreage. Between 1937 and 1952, the land was again re-platted and the acreage converted back into individual <b>lots.</b> These <b>lots</b> encompassed a variety of widths: most in excess of 75 ft, many over 100 ft. With the exception of one, all the original 50 ft <b>lots</b> were either re-platted into bigger <b>lots,</b> or through land sales, were merged with adjacent <b>lots.</b>|$|R

5|$|A new parking <b>lot</b> {{has been}} {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This parking <b>lot</b> {{has replaced the}} former Joan of Arc parking <b>lot,</b> which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the Joan of Arc dormitory (JOA). The former parking <b>lot</b> was torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle is yet to be named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in/out days.|$|E

5000|$|Land {{speculation}} in the lotteries were common, many <b>lots</b> {{were sold}} sight-unseen by the winners for other <b>lots</b> or for gold. Real estate agents, individual citizens and even unscrupulous lottery officials attempted to secure promising gold belt <b>lots</b> or valuable Cherokee plantation <b>lots.</b> During the 1832 Lottery alone, some 85,000 people competed for 18,309 land <b>lots</b> {{to be given}} away, and at least 133,000 people competed for 35,000 gold belt <b>lots</b> to be given away.|$|R

5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a <b>lot,</b> and in the late 1920s lied its eyes on a parcel of land owned by Hamar Jernstøperi. However, the <b>lot</b> was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the <b>lot</b> from the bank. The club established a new committee {{to look into the}} stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E
