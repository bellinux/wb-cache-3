25|$|Most social constructivist models, {{such as that}} {{proposed}} by Duffy and Jonassen (1992), also stress the need for collaboration among <b>learners,</b> <b>in</b> direct contradiction to traditional competitive approaches.

Defined as the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem-solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers, it differs from the fixed biological nature of Piaget's stages of development. Through a process of 'scaffolding' a learner can be extended beyond the limitations of physical maturation {{to the extent that the}} development process lags behind the learning process (Vygotsky 1978).|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{hypothesis is that}} <b>learners</b> <b>in</b> this type of task may be using a “propose-but-verify” mechanism rather than a statistical learning mechanism. Medina et al. and Trueswell et al. argue that, because Yu and Smith only tracked knowledge {{at the end of}} the training, rather than tracking knowledge on a trial-by-trial basis, it is impossible to know if participants were truly updating statistical probabilities of co-occurrence (and therefore maintaining multiple hypotheses simultaneously), or if, instead, they were forming a single hypothesis and checking it on the next trial. For example, if a participant is presented with a picture of a dog and a picture of a shoe, and hears the nonsense word vash she might hypothesize that vash refers to the dog. On a future trial, she may see a picture of a shoe and a picture of a door and again hear the word vash. If statistical learning is the mechanism by which word-referent mappings are learned, then the participant would be more likely to select the picture of the shoe than the door, as shoe would have appeared in conjunction with the word vash 100% of the time. However, if participants are simply forming a single hypothesis, they may fail to remember the context of the previous presentation of vash (especially if, as in the experimental conditions, there are multiple trials with other words in between the two presentations of vash) and therefore be at chance in this second trial. According to this proposed mechanism of word learning, if the participant had correctly guessed that vash referred to the shoe in the first trial, her hypothesis would be confirmed in the subsequent trial.|$|E

The participants in this study consisted of 25 exclusively online Masters students in the Instructional Technology program at Wayne State University.

60|$|But supposing the Professorial {{forces of}} our University to be duly organised, there remains an {{important}} question, {{relating to the}} teaching power, to be considered. Is the Professorial system--the system, I mean, of teaching in the lecture-room alone, and leaving the student to find his own way when he is outside the lecture-room--adequate to the wants of <b>learners?</b> <b>In</b> answering this question, I confine myself to my own province, and I venture to reply for Physical Science, assuredly and undoubtedly, No. As I have already intimated, practical work in the Laboratory is absolutely indispensable, and that practical work must be guided and superintended by a sufficient staff of Demonstrators, who are for Science what Tutors are for other branches of study. And {{there must be a}} good supply of such Demonstrators. I doubt if the practical work of more than twenty students can be properly superintended by one Demonstrator. If we take the working day at six hours, that is less than twenty minutes apiece--not a very large allowance of time for helping a dull man, for correcting an inaccurate one, or even for making an intelligent student clearly apprehend what he is about. And, no doubt, the supplying of a proper amount of this tutorial, practical teaching, is a difficulty in the way of giving proper instruction in Physical Science in such Universities as that of Aberdeen, which are devoid of endowments; and, unlike the English Universities, have no moral claim on the funds of richly endowed bodies to supply their wants.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVocabulary {{learning}} {{is one of}} the most challenging issues that EFL <b>learners</b> face. <b>In</b> the past the learners depended on their teachers but new teaching methodologies encourage learner autonomy. At the university level, learners should become more autonomous in learning foreign language vocabulary and try to find different ways of how to become more successful learners. At the university level learners are forced to become autonomous and make conscious efforts to learn vocabulary outside of the classroom simply because exposure to target language is limited in university classes. Consequently, the autonomy of the learner play an important role in developing and enhancing their vocabulary. This paper aims at exploring the application of <b>learner</b> autonomy <b>in</b> the context of vocabulary learning for English language students. It also proposes the importance of <b>learner's</b> autonomy <b>in</b> vocabulary learning and learning strategies.
