500|$|Television critics reacted mostly mixed to [...] "Excellence in Broadcasting", {{calling the}} storyline [...] "funny," [...] but [...] "toothless." [...] In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the show, and the broadcast of American Dad! that followed it, The A.V. Club reviewer Rowan Kaiser noted, [...] "most of the episode was spent justifying its existence as a Rush Limbaugh episode of Family Guy," [...] and that the episode [...] "failed to do that." [...] In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised Family Guy for its past political humor, but ultimately rated it as a D, the second worst rating, behind The Simpsons episode [...] "Loan-a Lisa" [...] and the American Dad! episode [...] "100 A.D.", beating only The Cleveland Shows F-grade episode [...] "Cleveland Live!". In a slightly more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised Limbaugh's appearance in the episode, commenting Limbaugh [...] "certainly deserves credit for his willingness to participate and lend his own voice." [...] Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's debut of the high-definition opening sequence, and its introduction of Joyce Kinney {{as a replacement for}} news anchor Diane Simmons, who was killed off in [...] "And Then There Were Fewer." [...] Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The show definitely skewered Brian’s hardcore conservative conversion, but overall it seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> fair fight." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, {{four months}} before the release of Superman Returns, Warner Bros. {{announced}} a summer 2009 theatrical release date for a sequel, with Bryan Singer returning as director. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Sam Huntington, Frank Langella, and Tristan Lake Leabu were expected to reprise their roles, however, {{with the release of}} Superman Returns in July 2006, Warner Bros. was hesitant on moving forward with development. Warner Bros. President Alan F. Horn explained that Superman Returns was a very successful film, but that it [...] "should have done $500million worldwide. We should have had perhaps a little more action to satisfy the young male crowd." [...] Singer reacted incredulously to the studio complaints, saying, [...] "That movie made $400million! I don't know what constitutes under-performing these days..." [...] Filming was supposed to start in March 2008; no screenplay was ever written, but Singer would have titled it Man of Steel, with an interest in Darkseid as the main villain. Singer stressed {{that it would have been}} more action-packed than Superman Returns. while writer Michael Dougherty was interested in using Brainiac. [...] "In my mind, if the Kryptonians really were a space-faring race... it would only make sense that there would've been colonies and off-planet missions... other Kryptonians making their way to Earth seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big one. It wouldn't necessarily be evil right off the bat. That's too easy and cliché... I think it'd be interesting to see how these other Kryptonians show up, land and have all these powers and [...] how to adapt to them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Hamilton {{had settled}} on a name, the guitarist Peter Mengede's then-girlfriend Reyne Cuccuro [...] {{suggested}} the Germanic name [...] "Helmuth". Hamilton misinterpreted her and mistakenly believed that {{she was referring to}} the form of protective gear. Hamilton then thought excitingly that Helmet had [...] "sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> cool name for a band" [...] and opted for the Anglicized spelling. Other names taken in consideration were [...] "Cry Ruth" [...] and [...] "Poly Orchids", along with the more esoteric and obscure [...] "Tuna Lorenzo" [...] and [...] "Froth Albumen".|$|E

2500|$|The New Yorker {{describes}} {{what it calls}} this [...] "strangely but tellingly misbegotten" [...] cover design thusly: [...] "The image is a photograph, taken from a French fashion shoot, of a glassy-eyed, heavily made-up little girl. Behind her sits, a mother figure, stiff and coiffed, casting an ominous shadow. The girl, with her long, perfectly waved platinum-blond hair and her pink feather boa, looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> and inert doll—" [...] The article continues: [...] "And if the Stepford daughter on the cover is meant {{to remind us of}} Veruca Salt or Violet Beauregarde, she doesn't: those badly behaved squirts are bubbling over with rude life." [...] Moreover, writes Talbot, [...] "The Modern Classics cover has not a whiff of this validation of childish imagination; instead, it seems to imply a deviant adult audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jenkins couldn't {{agree on}} terms with Chrysler for 1966, {{so he decided}} to run a Chevy {{independently}} by making his own Chevy engine package. Without factory support, Jenkins developed his first Grumpy's Toy, a 327 cubic inch / 350 horsepower Chevy II. When he found the compact car was to be placed in the same class as the 426 ci/425 horsepower hemi Dodge and Plymouth muscle cars, he commented it [...] "looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good gimmick at the time". The lower displacement engine in the smaller car, hence lighter minimum weight, enabled it to outrun the larger-engined but heavier cars. He set a class record with an 11.66 second pass. He was added to Chevrolet's team in 1967. He became known as the premiere normally aspirated drag race engine builder after his Super Stock victory at the 1967 Nationals. He entered Pro Stock when NHRA started it in 1970, and won the first two events of the year (the Winternationals and Gatornationals) in a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro, ultimately taking the national title. His first car built specifically for Pro Stock, a 1970½ Camaro, would be the first of the class to make the cover of Hot Rod (their July 1970 issue).|$|E

Her hat was at her back, and her skirts a good deal the worse for the brooks she had crossed, the trees she had climbed, and the last leap, which added several fine rents.|$|R

6000|$|Burnamy {{could not}} bear to let it.

Of course it's sentimental, and it begs the {{question}} a good deal; but it imagines something heroic in character, and it makes the reader imagine it too. The man who wrote that book may be a donkey half the time, but he's a genius the other half. By-and-by he'll do something--after he's come to see that his 'Maiden Knight' was a fool--that I believe even you won't be down on, Mr. March, if he paints a heroic type as powerfully as he does in this book." ...|$|R
