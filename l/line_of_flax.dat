6000|$|Assembling {{the images}} we have traced, and adding the {{simplest}} of all, from Isaiah xl. 6, we find the grass and flowers are types, in their passing, of the passing of human life, and in their excellence, of the excellence of human life; and this in twofold way: first by their beneficence, and then by their endurance--the grass of the earth, in giving the seed of corn, and in its beauty under tread of foot and stroke of scythe; and the grass of the waters, in giving its freshness for our rest, and in its bending before the wave. But, understood in the broad human and Divine sense, the [...] "herb yielding seed"--(as opposed to the fruit tree yielding fruit)--includes a third family of plants, and fulfils a third office to the human race. It includes the great family of the lints and flaxes, and fulfils thus the three offices of giving food, raiment, and rest. Follow out this fulfilment; consider the association of the linen garment and the linen embroidery with the priestly office and the furniture of the tabernacle, and consider how the rush has been to all time the first natural carpet thrown under the human foot. Then next observe the three virtues definitely set forth by the three families of plants--not arbitrarily or fancifully associated with them, but in all the three cases marked for us by Scriptural words: 1st. Cheerfulness, or joyful serenity; in the grass for food and beauty--"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin." [...] 2nd. Humility; in the grass for rest--"A bruised reed shall he not break." [...] 3rd. Love; in the grass for clothing, (because of its swift kindling,)--"The smoking flax shall he not quench." [...] And then finally observe the confirmation of these last two images in, I suppose, the most important prophecy, relating to the future state of the Christian Church, which occurs in the Old Testament, namely that contained in the closing chapters of Ezekiel.

40|$|As a crop, flax holds {{significant}} {{commercial value}} for its omega- 3 rich oilseeds and stem fibres. Canada {{is the largest}} producer of linseed but there exists scope for significant yield improvements. Implementation of mechanisms such as male sterility can permit the development of hybrids to assist in achieving this goal. Temperature sensitive male sterility {{has been reported in}} flax but the leakiness of this system in field conditions limits the production of quality hybrid seeds. Here, we characterized a 2, 588 bp transcript differentially expressed in male sterile <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>flax.</b> The twelve intron gene predicted to encode a 368 amino acid protein has five WD 40 repeats which, in silico, form a propeller structure with putative nucleic acid and histone binding capabilities. The LuWD 40 - 1 protein localized to the nucleus and its expression increased during the transition and continued through the vegetative stages (seed, etiolated seedling, stem) while the transcript levels declined during reproductive development (ovary, anthers) and embryonic morphogenesis of male fertile plants. Knockout lines for LuWD 40 - 1 in flax failed to develop shoots while overexpression lines showed delayed growth phenotype and were male sterile. The non-viable flowers failed to open and the pollen grains from these flowers were empty. Three independent transgenic lines overexpressing the LuWD 40 - 1 gene had ~ 80 % non-viable pollen, reduced branching, delayed flowering and maturity compared to male fertile genotypes. The present study provides new insights into a male sterility mechanism present in flax. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

This thesis examines {{the changes in}} DNA methylation levels in the cotyledons and shoot tips <b>of</b> early-flowering Royal <b>flax</b> <b>lines</b> (i. e.

It also examines {{the question of whether}} DNA is methylated in the chloroplast genome <b>of</b> <b>flax.</b> Finally, the thesis looks at the differences in transcript abundance of the flowering genes LEAFY and TERMINAL FLOWER 1 in RC and RE 2. Methylation levels in RE 1 and RE 2 were found to be lower than in RC from 24 days of age to the onset of flowering and the levels <b>of</b> all three <b>lines</b> increase with tissue age and/or differentiation. In addition, buds of RE 2 were hypomethylated relative to RC. If plants were placed in the dark prior to DNA extraction, hypomethylation was not seen in the total DNA of RE 2. The chloroplast DNA <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> was found to be methylated, and RE 2 chloroplast DNA was hypomethylated relative to RC. Differences in transcript levels of LFY were seen in RC and RE 2 shoot tips, where a higher accumulation of transcript seen in RE 2 compared to RC may be related to its earlier flowering time. In leaves, {{there was no significant difference}} in the transcript abundance of LFY between RC and RE 2. TFL 1 was detected in genomic DNA of RC and RE 2; it was not detected in the cDNA <b>of</b> the two <b>lines.</b> In summary, compared to RC, hypomethylation was seen in the total DNA of RE 2 plants grown under regular light conditions and the methylation levels in the all lines increased with age in shoot tips, cotyledons, and leaves. The chloroplast DNA of RE 2 was also hypomethylated relative to that of RC. RE 2 accumulated LFY transcript in shoot tips at flowering, which was not the case in RC. Although these ideas cannot be linked at this time, they are all likely related to the early-flowering phenotype...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe type 2 {{modified}} augmented design (MAD 2) is {{an efficient}} unreplicated experimental design used for evaluating large numbers <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> in plant breeding and for assessing genetic variation in a population. Statistical {{methods and data}} adjustment for soil heterogeneity have been previously described for this design. In the absence of replicated test genotypes in MAD 2, their total variance cannot be partitioned into genetic and error components as required to estimate heritability and genetic correlation of quantitative traits, the two conventional genetic parameters used for breeding selection. We propose a method of estimating the error variance of unreplicated genotypes that uses replicated controls, and then of estimating the genetic parameters. Using the Delta method, we also derived formulas for estimating the sampling variances of the genetic parameters. Computer simulations indicated that the proposed method for estimating genetic parameters and their sampling variances was feasible and {{the reliability of the}} estimates was positively associated with the level of heritability of the trait. A case study of estimating the genetic parameters of three quantitative traits, iodine value, oil content, and linolenic acid content, in a biparental recombinant inbred <b>line</b> population <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> with 243 individuals, was conducted using our statistical models. A joint analysis of data over multiple years and sites was suggested for genetic parameter estimation.

A split plot design based on randomized complete blocks with four replications was performed in this study. Main factor (a) consisted of fertilizer application form (a 1 = control without nitrogen fertilizer, a 2 = nitrogen fertilizer, a 3 = nitroxin + N, a 4 = phosphate barvar 2 + N, and a 5 = nitroxin + phosphate barvar 2 + N) and sub factor (b) consisted <b>of</b> five <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> oily <b>flax</b> (b 1 = 97 - 26, b 2 = 97 - 14, b 3 = 97 - 3, b 4 = 97 - 21, b 5 = 97 - 19). Quantitative and qualitative traits such as number of sub stems, leaf weight, capsule weight per main stem and sub stems, seed yield, oil and protein content were calculated or estimated. Results showed that the main factor (fertilizer form) had significant effect (at Œ±= 0. 01 probability level) on all the parameters which have been studied in this experiment. Sub factor (linseed lines) and interaction between the two factors had statistically significant effects on all traits. The highest seed yield (4781 kg h- 1) and the highest seed oil content (36. 5 %) were obtained from applying nitroxin + phosphateye barvare 2 + N on 97 - 14 and 97 - 3 lines.

In general, delayed seeding was accompanied by reduction of emergence, number of days to maturity, yield and yield components in all genotypes, with the exception that the last seeding date led to increased number of days to maturity and seeds per capsule. Based on regression analysis, seed weight, number of seeds per capsule and number of seedlings/m 2 were the most important components that contributed in seed yield variation, respectively.
