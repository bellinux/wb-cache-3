It is common for {{the last line of}} text not to be terminated with a CR-LF marker, and many text editors (including Notepad) do not automatically insert one on the last line.|$|E

Only four specific characters are considered whitespace for this purpose: space, horizontal tab, <b>line</b> <b>feed,</b> and carriage return.

40|$|Nowadays, {{assembly}} {{systems are}} used for the assembly of an increasing amount of models, which are often mass-customized to meet customers’ demands. This results in a rising number of parts used for assembly and, consequently, space scarcity at the line. There-fore, parts must not only be fed to the line cost-efficiently, but also meet space constraints (Limère et al., 2015). The assembly <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> problem (ALFP) deals with the assignment of parts to <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies {{in order to reduce}} costs and obtain a feasible solution. Within this paper, we examine all distinct <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies at the same time, namely line stocking, kanban, sequencing and kitting (stationary and traveling kits). There is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no research conducted, including more than three <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies in a single model (cf. Sali and Sahin, 2016). Furthermore, we assume space at the border of line (BoL) being variable. For this reason, space is not constrained per individual station, but we assume one overall space constraint for the entire line (Hua and Johnson, 2010). The main focus of this work is on accurately modeling the problem. This includes a rep-resentation of all <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> processes, being storage, preparation, transportation, line side presentation and usage. By incorporating the variable space constraints at the BoL, we pro-vide a decision model reducing the overall costs for <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> in assembly systems, since rigid space constraints at the BoL usually lead to more expensive <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies. In contrast, variable space constraints enable balancing unequal space usage of different sta-tions, allowing cheaper <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies to be selected. Some preliminary results on the cost impact of variable versus fixed space constraints will be discussed...|$|R

Nevertheless, considerable uncertainty still exists concerning {{the costs and benefits of}} these supply methods. The purpose of this research is to uncover the advantages and disadvantages of the different <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> alternatives and quantify them. The complete flow of components, starting from the supplier to the supply at the final assembly line will be considered. Different methods of <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> have an impact on material handling costs, operator efficiency, storage space requirement and flexibility. A cost model is developed that captures all these impacts and that quantifies the costs for different <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> alternatives. This model is tested with data and some conclusions are drawn...|$|R
25|$|Construction {{began in}} mid-1960, with the {{official}} opening on November 1, 1963. As the primary dish is spherical, its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as {{would be the case}} for a parabolic reflector. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each <b>line</b> <b>feed</b> covered a narrow frequency band: 2–5% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.|$|E

At the same time, however, it restricts the use of C0 and C1 control characters other than U+0009 (Horizontal Tab), U+000A (<b>Line</b> <b>Feed),</b> U+000D (Carriage Return), and U+0085 (Next Line) by requiring them to be written in escaped form (for example U+0001 must be written as &#x01; or its equivalent). In the case of C1 characters, this restriction is a backwards incompatibility; it was introduced to allow common encoding errors to be detected.|$|E

Instead of altering thickness or spacing, one can add a third parallel wire to increase the antenna impedance 9nbsp&times over a single-wire dipole, raising the impedance to 450nbsp&ohms, making a good match for window <b>line</b> <b>feed</b> cable, and further broadening the resonant frequency band of the antenna.|$|E

40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. internationale. International audienceIn-plant {{material}} supply {{has gained}} more interest since product diversity has increased {{with the growth}} of mass customization. In such production environment, mixed-model assembly lines are designed to support the production of a large scale of finished products obtained by the combination of alternative variants of components that ensure a specific functionality on the finished product. The availability of the required variant at each stage of the assembly process is critical for the production processes that operate in a just in time (JIT) environment as it’s the case for some first tier suppliers in the automotive industry. To ensure the availability of the required parts at each stage of the assembly process, several <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> modes can be used. Their relative performance depends on several factors like the components’ diversity and physical features to name a few. The impact of these parameters on the performance of the <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> modes is not well known and this issue remains weakly represented in the literature. Using an empirical approach, this study aims to analyse the performance of three <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> modes (<b>line</b> stocking, kitting and sequencing) according to a set of key parameters. The performance of each <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> mode is measured as a periodic total cost that includes preparation, picking for the assembly, transportation and storage costs...|$|R

50|$|Matching the {{impedance}} of {{the antenna}} to {{the impedance of}} the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an antenna tuner, an impedance matching device. Installing the tuner between the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> and the antenna allows for the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter's power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point impedance. Installing a tuner in between the transmitter and the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> to one preferred by the transmitter.
