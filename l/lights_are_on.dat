2500|$|Zoo animals live in {{enclosures}} {{that often}} attempt to replicate their natural habitats or behavioral patterns, {{for the benefit}} of both the animals and visitors. Nocturnal animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.e. only dim white or red <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> during the day so the animals are active during visitor hours, and brighter lights on at night when the animals sleep. Special climate conditions may be created for animals living in extreme environments, such as penguins. [...] Special enclosures for birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, fish, and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as lemurs, marmosets, birds, lizards, and turtles. Visitors are asked to keep to paths and avoid showing or eating foods that the animals might snatch.|$|E

2500|$|As a result, {{the rate}} of {{corruption}} in the country was drastically reduced and the business environment was improved significantly. The economy began growing and {{the standard of living}} rose. Georgia's ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International improved dramatically from rank 133 in 2004 to 67 in 2008 and further to 51 in 2012, surpassing several EU countries. The World Bank named Georgia as the leading economic reformer in the world, and the country ranked 8th in terms of ease of doing business- while most of the country's neighbors are ranked somewhere in the hundreds. The World Bank noted a significant improvement in living conditions in Georgia, reporting that [...] "Georgia's transformation since 2003 has been remarkable. The <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> <b>on,</b> the streets are safe, and public services are corruption free." [...] Doing Business report founder Simeon Djankov has given Georgia as an example to other reformers during the annual Reformer Awards.|$|E
2500|$|The Court did {{not find}} it {{necessary}} to define what the [...] "ordinary incidents" [...] of prison life were, vis-à-vis confinement in Supermax conditions, for [...] "assignment to OSP imposes an atypical and significant hardship under any plausible baseline." [...] Prisoners in OSP are forbidden [...] "almost all human contact". [...] They may not converse with each other from cell to cell. [...] <b>Lights</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> 24 hours a day, though for some periods of time the light is dimmed. [...] Inmates are allowed only one hour of exercise per day, in a small indoor room. [...] These circumstances may be common to mere administrative segregation; however, unlike the administrative segregation considered in Conner, placement at OSP was for an indefinite period of time, and such placement rendered an inmate ineligible for parole. [...] The Court found that the combination of these two sets of conditions rose to the level of an [...] "atypical and significant hardship within the correctional context", and hence gave rise to a liberty interest in avoiding placement in OSP. [...] This is so despite any purported necessity of controlling the danger posed by high-risk inmates.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2014, The Guardian {{published}} evidence implicating Jan van Risseghem, {{a military}} pilot who {{served with the}} RAF during World War II, later with the Belgian Air Force and became famous as the pilot of Moise Tshombe in Katanga. [...] The article claims that an American NSA employee, former naval pilot Commander Charles Southall, working at the NSA listening station in Cyprus in 1961 shortly after midnight {{on the night of}} the crash, heard an intercept of a pilot's commentary in the air over Ndola – 3,000 miles away. Southall recalled the pilot saying: [...] "I see a transport plane coming low. All the <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> <b>on.</b> I'm going down to make a run on it. Yes, it is the Transair DC-6. It's the plane," [...] adding that his voice was [...] "cool and professional". Then he heard the sound of gunfire and the pilot exclaiming: [...] "I've hit it. There are flames! It's going down. It's crashing!" [...] Based on aircraft registration and availability with the Katangese Air Force, registration KAT-93, a Fouga CM.170 Magister would be the most likely aircraft used and the website http://www.belgian-wings.be/ claims that van Risseghem piloted the Magisters for the KAF in 1961.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second example}} {{can be read}} [...] "If both switch A and switch B are closed, then the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> Therefore, it <b>is</b> either true that if switch A <b>is</b> closed, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on,</b> or that if switch B <b>is</b> closed, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on." [...] Here, the most likely natural-language {{interpretation}} of the [...] "if ... then ..." [...] statements would be [...] "whenever switch A <b>is</b> closed, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on", and [...] "whenever switch B <b>is</b> closed, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when both switches are closed).|$|R

40|$|A novel moving objects {{dimension}} measurement {{system based on}} the linear array CCD <b>is</b> designed. The <b>light</b> source <b>is</b> a pulsed laser with pulse width 200 ns. Single point of light passes through lens converted to parallel light which will illuminate to the CCD through the moving object to be tested. CCD pixels which are blocked by the object while <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>are</b> low, and the remaining pixels are high conversely. The distance of the tested objects while <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> can <b>be</b> ignored since the <b>light</b> pulse width <b>is</b> {{much smaller than the}} integration time of CCD (generally). The size of the tested object can be achieved by the number of dark pixels of CCD while <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> This paper introduces the principle and composition of the {{dimension measurement}} system. The results show that this system can measure the size of moving objects and measuring accuracy is better than 50 microns. Accuracy and stability of the system can achieve actual production requirements when the object&# 39;s moving speed is smaller than 50 mm/s. Optimizing the parallelism of the parallel light, the measurement accuracy can be further improved. © 2016 SPIE. </p...|$|R
