40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} {{international}} labor movement in a two-country macroeconomic model where we assume each country has dual <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> -primary and secondary- and real consumption wage differentials affect labor supply flows. We investigate cases where workers move between primary <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> and between secondary <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> of two countries. In both cases, we find that workers usually move from countries with higher to lower tax rates on wages. We also find that international labor movement between primary <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> usually increases {{the sum of the}} two countries' output, while international labor movement between secondary <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> does not seem to affect the sum of the two countries' output. This implies that the sum of two countries' output is larger with international labor movement between primary <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> than with international labor movement between secondary <b>labor</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

40|$|This chapter reviews recent {{developments}} in research on public sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets.</b> Public sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> have two important characteristics which account for the interest in their operation. First, public sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> are large [...] in most developed countries the public sector workforce accounts for over 15 % of total employment. Second, public sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> are different from private sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets.</b> Most importantly, politicians or bureaucrats may have objectives which {{differ from those of}} the owners of private sector firms; and the political system can allow scope for achieving those objectives where a market system would not. The introductory sections of the chapter present a simple conceptual framework for thinking about the operation of public sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets,</b> and background information on a range of key characteristics of public sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> such as union structure and the institutional environment for wage bargaining. The main sections summarize a variety of research relating to earnings and employment outcomes in public sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets.</b> First, studies which compare average earnings outcomes of public sector and private sector employees in a range of countries are reviewed. Second, studies of the determinants of earnings of local government employees in the United States are described. Third, various information on the earnings structure and distribution of earnings in the public sector and private sector is presented. Fourth, studies of the level and composition of public sector employment are summarized. A concluding section presents an overview of the main findings and themes from research on public sector <b>labor</b> <b>markets,</b> and suggests topics for future research. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Natural {{disasters}} have particularly devastating {{impacts on}} {{economic growth in}} developing countries since they impede the accumulation of capital. The resilience of <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> is crucial especially for the poor who rely only on labor to diversify their income portfolio and buffer against risk. Such a risk management strategy may become more challenging as global climate change increases the frequency of natural disasters. We use the Bangladesh Flood Impact panel household survey to evaluate how the 1998 “flood of the century ” affected <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> in Bangladesh. We find long-term declines in wages where non-agricultural <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> are more severely affected. We also evaluate how the availability of irrigation, drainage, credit access, and proximity to auxiliary <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> cushions <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> against the disaster. The most compelling evidence shows that workers in areas further from centers of economic activity are more vulnerable to flood-induced wage losses. Our findings suggest that future emergency relief and climate change programs should consider the protection of <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> by improving infrastructure to facilitate job searches in alternative locations or reduce migration costs...|$|R
50|$|As {{the market}} began to {{transform}} from Fordism to a post-Order regime of capital accumulation, the social regulation of <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> {{and the very}} nature of work began to shift. This transformation has been characterized by an economic restructuring that emphasized flexibility within spaces of work, <b>labor</b> <b>markets,</b> employment relationships, wages and benefits. Most governments in Western Europe started to deregulate temporary work. And indeed, global processes of neoliberalism and market rule contributed greatly to this increasing pressure put on local <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> towards flexibility. This greater flexibility within <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> is important at the global level, particularly within OECD countries and liberal market economies (see liberal market economy).|$|R
25|$|Sociologist Ruth Levitas created three sociological interpretations used {{to examine}} ways in which {{societies}} can remedy social exclusion. These tactics affect youth because they deal with the <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> and thus young people just beginning to gain financial independence. The redistributionist discourse (RED) sees poverty as the greatest contributor to social exclusion. This understanding focuses on transferring taxes and welfare to those in need. The moral underclass discourse (MUD) interpretation blames individual choice for causing social exclusion. This method suggests punishment {{as a means of}} remedying social exclusion. The last method, social integrationist discourse (SID), views the <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> as the enemy to social exclusion and therefore explores avenues for getting more people into the labor force.|$|E

25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin {{women in the}} labor force were discrimination in the <b>labor</b> <b>market,</b> inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men {{in the labor force}}, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls {{are much more likely to}} drop out of school than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} use of <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> to {{mitigate}} the impact of violent shocks on households in rural areas in Colombia. It examines changes in the labor supply from on-farm to off-farm labor {{as a means of}} coping with the violent shock and the ensuing redistribution of time within households. It identifies the heterogeneous response by gender. Because the incidence of violent shocks is not exogenous, the analysis uses instrumental variables that capture several dimensions of the cost of exercising terror. As a response to the violent shocks, households decrease the time spent on on-farm work and increase their supply of labor to off-farm activities (non-agricultural ones). Men carry the bulk of the adjustment in {{the use of}} time inasmuch as they supply the most hours to off-farm non-agricultural work and formal <b>labor</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>markets</b> do not fully absorb the additional labor supply. Women in particular are unable to find jobs in formal <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> and men have increased time dedicated to leisure and household chores. Additional off-farm supply does not fully cover the decrease in consumption. The results suggest that in rural Colombia, <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> are a limited alternative for coping with violent shocks. Thus, policies in conflict-affected countries should go beyond short-term relief and aim at preventing <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> from collapsing and at supporting the recovery of agricultural production.
