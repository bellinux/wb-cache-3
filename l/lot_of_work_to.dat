5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

These older boats can be modified if one wants a competitive J/24. New boat manufacturing is done by multiple companies {{around the world in}} France, USA, Italy and Argentina. In the US, J/24s are built by US Watercraft.|$|E
25|$|Accusations and recriminations flew around. Some {{civilians were}} {{angry at the}} Germans, some at the British for abandoning them and many at other civilians for how they had behaved. Investigators turned up looking for war crimes.

25|$|The {{reason that}} the Zariski {{topology}} does not work well {{is that it is}} too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck's key insight was to realize that {{there is no reason why}} the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works perfectly well for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined étale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of étale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these can be thought of as open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (after a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work)</b> <b>to</b> give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/nZ when n is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over.|$|E
500|$|... "Run Baby Run" [...] {{was first}} {{written by the}} end of 2003 at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. The song began from an idea by guitarist Duke Erikson, and took a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> complete. The band, while happy with the chorus, rebuilt the rest of the song around it; most of the song's {{original}} verses, lyrics and melody were re-written.

Ten years, 15 years, long-term. This {{is not going to be}} solved in a short term". In the same month, he gave {{an interview}} for The Sunday Times, in which he said that soldiers' morale had been damaged by the unpopularity of the war among the British public. Later in 2005, Walker was instrumental in drawing up new procedures for the treatment of British service personnel accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners, following claims that the army had abandoned those soldiers charged in connection with the prisoner abuses. In February 2006, Walker headed up a military delegation to Bulgaria to discuss military cooperation between the British and Bulgarian governments.|$|E
500|$|Senji Ishii of Famitsu Xbox 360 {{praised the}} {{scenario}} for its detail {{and noted that}} events that were overlooked as insignificant later returned to affect events of the future. Due {{to the way the}} plot ties the many different events of the game together, Ishii believes {{it must have been a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> write the scenarios. In 2009, the Famitsu Awards gave Steins;Gate an annual Game of Excellence award. 4Gamer.net commented that Steins;Gate is comparable to [...] and felt that it is a gem that has not been seen in recent years. ITmedia Gamez noted that players should be attentive to all the details in the story as the twists will surprise the player in many different ways. It was also suggested to the player that the characters' voices be left turned on as the voice acting is very good. The review did caution that players who have played through the demo and who did not enjoy the atmosphere of the game were not likely to find the rest of the game interesting. Steins;Gate has also been praised by Square Enix producer Tomoya Asano, who described it as having [...] "appealing and likable characters and a scenario that surprised players"; this led to Steins;Gate writer Naotaka Hayashi writing the plot and characters for the role-playing video game [...] In 2011, Steins;Gate was voted #6 in Famitsus poll of [...] "most tear-inducing games" [...] of all time.|$|E

30|$|SAR {{is playing}} an {{important}} role both in national defense and civil applications, because SAR can work in all weather and day/night conditions. For better taking advantage of SAR data, the problem of target recognition should be overcome. In 1997 – 2000, L.M. Novak publishes a number of articles on SAR ATR [1 – 3].
