40|$|We {{formulated}} a <b>latex</b> <b>ink</b> for ink-jet {{deposition of}} viable Gram-negative bacterium Gluconobacter oxydans {{as a model}} adhesive, thin, highly bio-reactive microstructured microbial coating. Control of G. oxydans latex-based ink viscosity by dilution with water allowed ink-jet piezoelectric droplet deposition of 30 × 30 arrays {{of two or three}} droplets/dot microstructures on a polyester substrate. Profilometry analysis was used to study the resulting dry microstructures. Arrays of individual dots with base diameters of ~ 233 – 241 µm were obtained. Ring-shaped dots with dot edges higher than the center, 2. 2 and 0. 9 µm respectively, were obtained when a one-to-four diluted ink was used. With a less diluted ink (one-to-two diluted), the microstructure became more uniform with an average height of 3. 0 µm, but the ink-jet printability was more difficult. Reactivity of the ink-jet deposited microstructures following drying and rehydration was studied in a non-growth medium by oxidation of 50 g/L D-sorbitol to L-sorbose, and a high dot volumetric reaction rate was measured (~ 435 g·L− 1 ·h− 1). These results indicate that <b>latex</b> <b>ink</b> microstructures generated by ink-jet printing may hold considerable potential for 3 D fabrication of high surface-to-volume ratio biocoatings for use as microbial biosensors with the aim of coating microbes as reactive biosensors on electronic devices and circuit chips...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our work}} on building low-cost music controllers intended for educational and creative use. The main {{idea was to}} build an electronic music controller, including sensors and a sensor interface, on a " 10 euro" budget. We have experimented with turning commercially available USB game controllers into generic sensor interfaces, and making sensors from cheap conductive materials such as <b>latex,</b> <b>ink,</b> porous materials, and video tape. Our prototype controller, the CheapStick, is comparable to interfaces built with commercially available sensors and interfaces, but {{at a fraction of}} the price.

40|$|This work {{aimed at}} testing some natural and {{synthetic}} substances, not phytotoxics and not lethal for the fauna, {{to verify the}} repellence action for the consuming wild animals of Parana-Pine seeds, in two direct sowing experiments in the field. In experiment I, there was the direct application of the treatments in the Parana-Pine seeds and, in the experiment II, there was {{the application of the}} treatments only in the surface of the plantation hollows, after the sowing of Parana-Pine seeds. The Parana-Pine seeds and the treatments were prepared at Laboratory of Center of Agroveterinary Sciences, University of Santa Catarina State, at Lages city, Brazil. The experiments were carried to a native-antropic field area at Lages city. It was adopted the experimental design of randomized blocks for both experiments. Experiment I was composed of 15 treatments, 10 seeds per treatment, with 4 replications, and experiment II was composed of 11 treatments, 10 seeds per treatment, with 4 replications. The tested substances, isolated or in mixtures, were: fruit of red pepper, root of parsley, stem and leaf of wormwood herb, lemon scented gum essential oil, linseed oil, castor bean oil, rosin, copper oxychloride, copper sulphate, sulphur, <b>látex</b> <b>ink</b> and calcium lignosulfonate. Through the periodic inspections, during 167 and 165 days respectively for the experiments I and II, data were collected and organized through the attacked and not attacked Paraná-Pine seeds, being submitted to statistical analysis later. The predation rates were considered high for both experiments: 86, 7 % in experiment I and 84, 3 % in experiment II. In the experiment with treated Parana-Pine seeds, the longer time for the beginning of the predation was 104 days after the sowing, while, in the experiment with treatment in the environment (hollows), it was 64 days after the sowing. Solution of rosin and alcohol + lemon scented gum oil, applied in the seeds, presented potential for reduction of the predation level. The treatments with linseed oil presented changeable behaviors, equally to the treatments with <b>latex</b> <b>ink,</b> in the experiment with treated Parana-Pine seeds. In the experiment with treated hollows, the lignosulfonate of calcium in mixture with extracts of pepper, with root of parsley and with wormwood herb presented significant effect of reduction on the predation. The solution of linseed with red pepper extracts and with root of parsley extract also had significant effect for reduction of the predation of these seeds, in the experiment with treated hollows. </p...|$|E

50|$|Signs {{created with}} large-format {{printers}} may use solvent <b>inks,</b> water-based <b>inks,</b> <b>latex</b> <b>inks</b> or ultraviolet-curable/cured inks. The last material {{is the most}} modern, and can be printed directly onto many different substrates such as wood, metal and plastic, adhesive-backed or non-adhesive films. Adhesive-backed films are then laminated to another substrate.|$|R
50|$|Another {{benefit of}} aqueous-based {{sublimation}} ink {{is the absence}} of hazardous components as found in UV-curable, solvent and, even, in <b>latex</b> <b>inks.</b> When executed properly, direct to media printing with disperse ink is achievable on uncoated fabrics and offers maximum print-through; this is essential in applications viewed from both sides, such as with flag printing. As such, products can be sold at a higher margin, with a ‘green’ label and with a higher quality. Other media and ink combinations cannot allow this.|$|R
40|$|The seed of Araucaria angustifolia, pinhão, is {{becoming}} a alternative way of income for many families living at south and southeast of Brazil. The intensive attack on Paraná pine seeds by the wild fauna, that occur at newly-planted areas by direct sowing and at nursery of seedlings, {{is one of several}} adverses and distimulating factors to specie spreading. The objective of this work was to verify probable phytotoxics effects of some naturals and synthetics substances potentially repellentes to wild fauna, in Araucaria angustifolia seeds in vitro. The experiment was realized at Phytopatology and Plant Physiology Laboratory of Center of Agroveterinary Sciences, University of Santa Catarina State Brazil, from june to december, 2004. The Paraná pine seeds, after preparation and treatment with vegetal and not vegetal substances, were sown in plastic trays with vermiculite substratum and put on cabin of growth with controlled temperature, relative humidity of air, humidity of substratum and photoperiods. It was adopted the randomized complete design with 15 treatments, with 10 seeds each treatment and with 4 repetitions. The tested substances separately or in mixtures were: extract of fruit of red pepper, root of parsley, stem and leaf of wormwood herb, lemon scented gum essential oil, linseed oil, castor bean oil, rosin, copper oxychloride, copper sulphate, sulphur and <b>látex</b> <b>ink.</b> The root emission, stem emission, length of main root and length of stem were evaluated 76 days after sowing and statisticaly analyzed. The analysis make possible to conclude that the tested extract do not have phytotoxic effect on seeds and that the substances tested in vitro can be used in field experiments, in repellence traits for Parana pine seeds consuming fauna.

50|$|Polyester {{fabric is}} printed mostly with dye-sub or {{disperse}} direct ink, although UV and solvent <b>inks</b> (including HP’s <b>latex</b> formulation) {{can also be}} used. The great benefit of sublimation ink {{is the fact that}} the colorants will bond with the fibre during sublimation or fixation. The colours are ‘inside’ the media and don’t stay within the coating and on top of the media, as it is the case with UV-curable formulations. Even <b>latex</b> <b>inks</b> on porous textiles can suffer from crocking issues or ‘rub-off’. Low energy sublimation ink is easier to print with, but has the disadvantage of colours fading faster; its UV resistance, or light-fastness, is less resistant than equivalents using high energy disperse direct ink. Dye-sub can also suffer from a ‘halo’ effect which results in less sharp images. The disperse direct ink is a ‘stronger’ ink than the dye-sub kind, and this is very important for outdoor use, such as for fence fabric, flags and banners: artwork will last longer.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Radical {{surgery for}} {{neoplasm}} {{of the tongue}} can endanger one or both lingual arteries, threatening {{the survival of the}} remaining tissue and the recovery of speech and swallowing. Our hypothesis is that although there is little anastomosis in the substance of the tongue, arterial anastomoses outside it could provide a collateral circulation to protect the surviving tissue. Methods: Parts of nine embalmed cadaver heads were examined. In two specimens, the arteries had been previously injected with <b>latex</b> and India <b>ink.</b> In the remaining seven, a mixture of <b>latex</b> and India <b>ink</b> was injected into the lingual artery at its origin on one side. Five injections were successful. Results: There is considerable variation in the course and distribution of the lingual arteries. Arteries do not cross the midline of the tongue, but actual or potential anastomoses could be seen round the base of the tongue, in the floor of the mouth, and with facial artery branches. After the experimental injections, the mass filled the lingual artery and its branches on the injected side, but also reached the trunk and main branches of the opposite side. Conclusion: A mass injected into the lingual artery of one side can reach the trunk and territory of the lingual artery of the opposite side. In life it is likely that a similar collateral circulation would exist. Some clinical literature supports this conclusion, but preoperative arteriography might be a reasonable precaution...|$|R

40|$|Vascularization of the {{subcutaneous}} tissue {{of the upper}} extremity is described. Injection of coloured <b>latex</b> or India <b>ink</b> and gelatine solution showed the principal sources of the blood supply. Microdissection and transclarification of Spaheholz allowed {{for the study of}} the direct and indirect arterial branches which form the principal network of the {{subcutaneous tissue}}. The findings are of practical importance since the subcutaneous tissue can be used as a separate flap for covering soft tissue defects of the forearm and hand. The first description of the vascularization of the skin was made by Manchot in 1889. His study, based on whole cadaver dissection, showed that each anatomical territory of the human body had its own blood supply. These findings were confirmed in 1936 by the X-ray examinations of Salmon. Since then, many studies have been made of the vascularization of the skin, the fascia and muscles (Marajo, 1961; Rollin et al. 1971; Nakajima et al. 1981; Lamberty et al. 1982), and all of thes...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{cross-flow}} ultrafiltration for {{the recovery}} of coating material from aqueous streams started about 30 years ago with electro-deposition paint in the automotive industry. This early success {{can be related to}} both environmental and economical advantages of using ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration recovers and concentrates electro-deposition paint on the retentate side and produces purified water on the permeate side. Based on this success, the focus more recently moved to other coating materials, such as paper coatings, <b>latex</b> and flexographic <b>ink.</b> Similar to electro-deposition paint, the concept is to recover the diluted coating materials with ultrafiltration to obtain a solid-free permeate stream, which can be either recycled or easily treated, and a retentate stream, which contains the coating materials preferably at concentrations suitable for recycling or disposal. The advantages can be directly translated into very short payback times for ultrafiltration systems of typically less than two years. Application studies focusing on the coating recovery in a paper mill, the concentration of latex from the tank wash at a latex producer and {{the recovery of}} flexographic ink at a producer of printed cartons will highlight these benefits...|$|R
