5|$|The {{stems and}} fleshy {{rhizomes}} of C.australis {{are high in}} natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (umu tī, a <b>large</b> <b>type</b> of hāngi) to produce kāuru, a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called kōuka—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around C.australis. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} largely {{accepted her}} proposal. The Charity School Spelling Book was printed first {{and was the}} most widely used. It {{was one of the}} first children's books for the poor that was small but still had <b>large</b> <b>type</b> and large margins (features often considered appropriate only for books for more privileged readers). The stories themselves were also innovative: they emphasized the ordinary lives of ordinary children—"these children climbed trees, played with fire, threw cricket bats at sheep and begged in the streets". The book was adopted by Andrew Bell around 1800 for his Madras system of education and by various educational societies throughout Britain and its colonies; it was even used to educate adult slaves in Antigua and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{was first}} offered the {{position}} of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and {{by the middle of}} October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the Gau. Goebbels was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany. Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using <b>large</b> <b>type,</b> red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.|$|E

25|$|A <b>large</b> <b>type</b> of {{mongoose}} {{common in}} Africa, the ichneumon (Herpestes ichneumon) {{is represented in}} Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Revered {{for its ability to}} kill snakes, the ichneumon was related to Horus and Atum, among others and worshipped throughout the country. The shrew, a mouse size nocturnal mammal, substituted for ichneumons in Egyptian myth. Believed to have vision in both light and darkness, the god Horus Khenty-irty of Letopolis was represented by the wide eyed type of ichneumon and the shrew respectively. Shrews appear as the focus of worship particularly in the Late Period.|$|E

500|$|Barbauld {{demanded that}} her books be printed in <b>large</b> <b>type</b> with wide margins, so that {{children}} could easily read them; {{she was more}} than likely the [...] "originator" [...] of this practice, according to Barbauld scholar William McCarthy, and [...] "almost certainly [...] popularizer". In her history of children's literature in The Guardian of Education (1802–1806), Sarah Trimmer noted these innovations, as well as the use of good-quality paper and large spaces between words. While making reading easier, these production changes also made the books too expensive for the children of the poor, therefore Barbauld's books helped to create a distinct aesthetic for the middle-class children's book.|$|E

500|$|Overall, the {{skeletal}} anatomy of this genus is well documented, and restorations {{have been published}} in several papers, including skeletal restorations and models. The skeleton is known well enough that a detailed reconstruction of the hip and hindlimb muscles has been made. The animal's size has been estimated in the 2.5–4.0m range for length (8.2–13.1ft) for various specimens, and a weight of 200–300kilograms (450–660pounds), with the <b>large</b> <b>type</b> specimen of T. garbanii estimated at 4–4.5 meters (13.1–14.8feet) long. As discussed more fully under [...] "Discovery, history, and species", it may have been sexually dimorphic, with one sex larger than the other. Juvenile remains are known from several locations, mostly based on teeth.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld's Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for Children were a {{revolution}} in children's literature. For the first time, {{the needs of the}} child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in <b>large</b> <b>type</b> with wide margins so that children could easily read them and, even more important, she developed a style of [...] "informal dialogue between parent and child" [...] that would dominate children's literature for a generation. In Lessons for Children, a four-volume, age-adapted reading primer, Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son. More than likely, many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld's experience of teaching her own son, Charles. This series is far more than a way to acquire literacy—it also introduces the reader to [...] "elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility." [...] Moreover, it exposes the child to the principles of [...] "botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry ... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [...] astronomy." [...] The series was relatively popular and Maria Edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co-authored with her father, Practical Education (1798), that it is [...] "one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared." ...|$|E
