A super hydrophobic surface is unique in that a droplet of water resting on it will exhibit contact angles greater than 1 so· and this brings about a variety of benefits, such as low liquid loss due to low adhesive properties. An unexplored application for superhydrophobic surfaces is in microfluidics for 'Lab-on-a-chip' type devices. In using a sand blaster approach, an intrinsically hydrophobic material such as Teflon {{was able to be}} transformed into a superhydrophobic one with contact angles up to 170 •. The impact angle of the particulates onto the surface was found to have significant influence on the behaviour modification. A rod that was made superhydrophobic allowed for direct contact with droplets under low sticking. In microplate wells, this permitted mixing to be done by simple <b>liquid</b> <b>compression.</b> Drops could be delivered to a superhydrophobic well either {{through the use of a}} liquid nebuliser, or the continuous delivery of water through a hole at the bottom of the well via a pump. The nebuliser allowed for accurate dispensation of droplets while the pump method offered better opportunities for the creation of a more compact device. The superhydrophobic well could also be used to restrain droplets when it was tilted at different speeds. The angular velocity of the well was found to correlate with the angle in which the droplet would escape the well; the faster the well rotated, the greater the angle required before the droplet would escape. Additionally, with an arrangement of multiple wells on a platform, droplets could be pushed from one well to another using a controlled short bursts of pressurised air. Overall, it has been found that attributes of superhydrophobic surface, particularly the low adhesion, non-contamination and non-sticking properties, have been shown to offer interesting vistas in discrete microfluidics...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The melting curve of [ [...] . ]-iron in the pressure range of 100 to 300 GPa has been derived by computing Gibbs free energies at high pressures and high temperatures from thermodynamic and equations of state (EOS) {{data for the}} [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] and liquid-phases. Our calculations indicate the melting curve of iron is very sensitive to the EOS of both the solid [ [...] . ] and melt phase. Our best estimate of the EOS parameters for [ [...] . ]-iron are: p 0 = 8. 775 ± 0. 012 Mg/m 3, [ [...] . ] = 205 ± 4 GPa, [ [...] . ] = 4. 80 ± 0. 01 (referenced to 12 GPa and 300 K). The calculation favors the melting curve of Boehler [1993] or Saxena et al. [1993]. Shock-wave experiments on pure iron preheated to 1573 K were conducted in 17 - 73 GPa range. The shock-wave equation of state of [gamma]-iron at 1573 K initial temperature can be fit with [ [...] . ] = 4. 102 (0. 015) km/s + 1. 610 (0. 014) [ [...] . ] with [ [...] . ] = 7. 413 ± 0. 012 Mg/m 3. [Gamma]-iron's bulk modulus and its pressure derivative are 124. 7 ± 1. 1 GPa and 5. 44 ± 0. 06 respectively. We present new data for sound velocities in the [gamma]- and liquid-phases. In the [gamma]-phase, to a first approximation, the longitudinal sound velocity is linear with respect to density: Vp = - 3. 13 (0. 72) + 1. 119 (0. 084) [ [...] . ] (units for Vp and [ [...] . ] are km/s and Mg/m 3 respectively). Melting was observed in the highest pressure (about 70 - 73 GPa) experiments at a calculated shock temperature of about 2775 ± 160 K. This result is consistent with our calculated [ [...] . ]-iron melting curve which is close to those measured by Boehler [1993] and Saxena et al. [1993]. The liquid iron sound velocity data yield a Gruneisen parameter value for liquid iron of 1. 63 ± 0. 28 at 9. 37 ± 0. 02 Mg/m 3 at 71. 6 GPa. The quantity [ [...] . ] from our data is 15. 2 ± 2. 6 Mg/m 3, which is {{within the bounds of}} Brown and McQueen [1986] (13. 3 - 19. 6 Mg/m 3). Based on upward pressure and temperature extrapolation of our melting curve of [gamma]-iron, the estimated inner core-outer core boundary temperature is 5500 ± 400 K, the temperature at the core-mantle boundary on the outer core side is about 3930 ± 630 K, and the thermal boundary layer at the core-mantle boundary has a temperature difference between 400 and 1400 K. The shock-wave equation of state of initially solid (300 K) and molten (1573 K) fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4, Fa) are reported in the ranges 23 to 212 GPa and 5 to 47 GPa, respectively. The 300 K data appear to undergo a phase change in the 35 - 55 GPa range. The density of the high pressure phase (HPP) is consistent with a dense oxide mixture. Although the initially 300 K fayalite may melt along its Hugoniot, this is not explicitly detected. Fitting the HPP Hugoniot data in the shock velocity ([ [...] . ]) -particle velocity ([ [...] . ]) plane yields: [ [...] . ] = 4. 375 (0. 027) Mg/m 3, (1) [ [...] . ] = 4. 07 (0. 22) km/s + 1. 43 (0. 06) [ [...] . ], (2) where [ [...] . ] is the initial density. The isentropic bulk modulus [ [...] . ] = 72. 4 ± 8. 0 GPa, and its pressure derivative [ [...] . ] = 4. 72 ± 0. 24. The 1573 K data set yields: [ [...] . ] = 3. 750 (0. 018) Mg/m 3, (3) [ [...] . ] = 2. 63 (0. 02) km/s + 1. 59 (0. 01) [ [...] . ], (4) and [ [...] . ] = 25. 9 ± 0. 4 GPa, [ [...] . ] = 5. 36 ± 0. 04. The bulk modulus compares favorably with Agee [1992 a]'s result (24. 4 GPa), but the pressure derivative is quite different (10. 1 from Agee [1992 a]). Above 50 GPa, the high pressure regime of the Hugoniot of the solid fayalite can be fit with oxide mixture models using stishovite and FeO (either LPP or HPP). The fayalitic <b>liquid</b> <b>compression</b> data above 40 GPa are well fit with ideal mixing of partial molar volumes of stishovite and FeO (LPP or HPP), in support of the hypothesis of Rigden et al.

The current study investigates two alternative technologies for improving the efficiency of vapor compression cycles especially at very low ambient temperatures. The first method is <b>liquid</b> flooded <b>compression</b> with regeneration in which {{a significant amount of}} non-volatile liquid is mixed into the stream of refrigerant vapor entering the compressor in order to approach an isothermal compression process. The second method is multi-port refrigerant injection during compression and economizing which is similar to multi-stage compression in providing refrigerant cooling between compressor stages and a lower refrigerant quality entering the evaporator. ^ Both technology improvements address the thermodynamic inefficiencies that are inherent within the simple vapor compression cycle that is employed in most heat pumping equipment. The benefits of oil flooding and saturated vapor injection are evaluated using experimental testing of an oil flooded R 410 A scroll compressor and a 2 port saturated vapor injection R 410 A scroll compressor and simulation. The results show that the performance of the compressor increases with oil flooding and saturated vapor injection especially at very low evaporation temperatures. The experimental compressor results were used for system analysis of <b>liquid</b> flooded <b>compression</b> with regeneration and saturated vapor injection. At - 10 °C ambient temperature, estimated COP (heating) of the flooded compression with regeneration cycle was 25 % higher while that of the vapor injection cycle was 12. 5 % higher than the standard vapor compression cycle. For Minneapolis, the seasonal efficiency (heating) of a flooded compression with regeneration cycle was estimated to be 34 % higher while that of the vapor injection cycle was 21 % higher than the standard vapor compression cycle. Both technologies lead to higher energy efficiency and less degradation in heating capacity at low ambient temperatures. Also, a previously developed detailed flooded scroll compressor model has been validated with the oil flooding experimental data, for which good agreement was found. ...|$|R

Correlations between geomechanical parameters for the soils were known to be important for geotechnical engineers to be able to obtain suitable design parameters, as well as to find suitable construction techniques on these soft materials. Approach: To evaluate the geomechanical characteristics of the soils, field and laboratory investigations were carried out according to the organic contents. To achieve such purpose, the soils samples having different organic contents from several locations in Malaysia were collected to determine the correlations of various geomechanical properties of the soils. The classifying tests were determined based on the test procedures according to the British Standard Institution.

Because a liquid can conform to an irregular chamber volume, the surface {{area to volume ratio}} in the gas chamber can be maximized using a liquid piston. This creates near-isothermal operation, which minimizes energy lost to heat generation. A liquid piston eliminates gas leakage and replaces sliding seal friction with viscous friction. The liquid can also be used as a medium to carry heat {{into and out of the}} compression chamber. A simulation is presented of the heat transfer and frictional forces for a reciprocating piston and a liquid piston. In the application of an air compressor, with a pressure ratio of 9. 5 : 1 and a cycle frequency of 20 Â Hz, the liquid piston decreased the energy consumption by 19 % over the reciprocating piston. The liquid piston and the reciprocating piston exhibited a total efficiency of 83 % and 70 % respectively. The liquid piston demonstrated significant improvements in the total compression efficiency in comparison to a conventional reciprocating piston. This gain in efficiency was accomplished through increasing the heat transfer during the gas compression by increasing the surface area to volume ratio in the <b>compression</b> chamber. <b>Liquid</b> piston Gas <b>compression</b> Air compressor Compression efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Electrospun nanowebs with pores {{ranging from}} {{nanometers}} to micrometers, constitute new materials with enhanced absorbency {{and ability to}} retain liquids in pores {{for a long period}} of time. These materials can be used as nanofluidic probes collecting minute amount of liquids. However, extraction of liquids from nanofibrous materials presents a problem: menisci in the interfiber pores create very high suction pressure which holds the liquid inside the material. This problem can be resolved if the probe is completely filled with the liquid: menisci at the probe edges become flat to establish a pressure equilibrium with the atmosphere. Therefore, one can take advantage of the nanoweb softness and extract liquid by mechanically deforming the nanowebs. We show that the liquid-saturated nanowebs follow the Voigt-type rheology upon loading. We theoretically explain this behavior and derive the relations between the Voigt phenomenological parameters, nanoweb permeability and compression modulus. We show that the limiting deformations follow the Hooke’s law which assumes linear relation between the extracted volume of liquid and the applied load. Because of this predictable behavior, the nanoweb probes can be engineered to release minute <b>liquid</b> doses upon <b>compression.</b> The developed experimental methodology can be used for characterization of nanostructured materials which otherwise impossible to analyze by using the existing instruments...|$|R
40|$|The project {{involves}} {{the construction of}} a 260 tons-per-day (TPD) or 80, 000 gallon per day methanol demonstration unit utilizing an existing coal-derived synthesis gas from Eastman. The new equipment consists of synthesis gas feed preparation and <b>compression,</b> <b>liquid</b> phase reactor and auxiliaries, product distillation, and utilities. The technology to be demonstrated was developed by Air Products in a DOE sponsored program that started in 1981. Originally tested at a small, DOE-owned experimental facility in LaPorte, Texas, the LPMEOH{trademark} process offers several advantages over current methods of making methanol. This liquid phase process suspends fine catalyst particles in an inert liquid, forming a slurry. The liquid dissipates heat from the chemical reaction away from the catalyst surface, protecting the catalyst and allowing the gas-to-methanol reaction to proceed at higher rates. The process is ideally suited to the type of gas produced by modern coal gasifiers. At the Eastman Chemical complex, the technology will be integrated with existing coal gasifiers to demonstrate the commercially important aspects of the operation of the LPMEOH{trademark} Process to produce methanol. A four-year demonstration will prove the commercial applicability of the process. An off-site product-use test program will prove the suitability of the methanol as a transportation fuel and as a fuel for stationary applications in the power industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{phase diagram}} at zero {{temperature}} of ^ 4 He adsorbed on an helium incommensurate triangular solid {{on top of}} a single graphene sheet has been obtained using the diffusion Monte Carlo method. We have found that, in accordance with previous experimental and simulation results for graphite, the ground state of ^ 4 He on this setup is a <b>liquid</b> that, upon <b>compression,</b> transforms into a triangular solid. To define the stability limits of both liquid and solid phases, we considered not only the adsorption energies of the atoms located on the second layer but the average energy of the atoms in both layers. Our results show that the lower density limit for a stable liquid in the second layer is 0. 163 ± 0. 005 Å^- 2 and that the lower limit for the existence of an incommensurate solid on the second layer is 0. 186 ± 0. 003 Å^- 2. Both values are in overall agreement with the results of torsional oscillator experiments and heat capacity measurements on graphite. The 4 / 7 and 7 / 12 registered solids are found to be metastable with respect to triangular incommensurate arrangements of the same density. Comment: 7 pages, accepted for publication in Phys.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to implementing a gas Ericsson cycle heat pump was developed. The concept, termed a liquid flooded Ericsson cooler (LFEC), uses liquid flooding of the compressor and expander to approach isothermal compression and expansion processes. Since the LFEC cycle {{has not been}} studied previously {{most of the work}} presented represents new contributions to the literature. The specific major contributions of the work can be summarized as follows. ^ Analytical models of <b>liquid</b> flooded <b>compression</b> and expansion processes were developed, using ideal gas, constant specific heat, and incompressible liquid assumptions. Special considerations for fixed volume ratio positive displacement compressors are detailed. The unique behavior of a liquid flooded compressor was explored, including the discovery of an optimum liquid flooding rate that minimizes compression power. ^ A computer model of the LFEC cycle was developed using ideal gas, incompressible liquid, and constant specific heat assumptions. The model was used for a thorough parameterc study. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore the feasibility of the concept, identify the optimum operating parameters, and to provide the basis for the design of an experimental system. ^ An experimental system was developed. It was believed to be the only system of its type in existence at the time of construction. Cooling capacities of up to 677 W were measured. Several factors related to the early state of development for the LFEC resulted in maximum second law efficiencies of only 3 %. ^ A second computer model of the LFEC was developed, which incorporated real fluid properties and additional parameters that were deemed necessary based on experimental observations. Two parametric studies were performed using this model. First, a parametric sensitivity study was performed to identify the minimum rotating machinery adiabatic efficiencies required to attain a COP of 1. 25 for near ambient refrigeration applications. It was found that a well designed system with realistic losses could reach the target COP if the adiabatic efficiencies of the rotating machinery are equal or greater than 85 %. The second parametric study, with the real fluid model, was used to identify the application (i. e. source temperature) for which the LFEC was most suited. It was found that when nonideal operation was assumed that the best second law efficiency for the LFEC occurs at source temperatures in the range of - 90 °C. ...|$|R

The tablets are marketed with a score providing an option to split. However, there are no systematic studies evaluating the effect of splitting on dose accuracy, and current study was undertaken to evaluate effects of splitting and potential causes for uniformity failures by measuring assay and content uniformity in whole and split tablets. Stability was evaluated by assaying drug {{for a period of}} 8  weeks. Effect of formulation factors on splittability was evaluated by a systematic investigation of formulation factors by preparing levothyroxine tablets in house by varying the type of excipients (binder, diluent, disintegrant, glidant) or by varying the processing factors (granulating <b>liquid,</b> mixing type, <b>compression</b> pressure). The tablets were analyzed using novel analytical tool such as near infrared chemical imaging to visualize the distribution of levothyroxine. Assay was not significantly different for whole versus split tablets irrespective of method of splitting (hand or splitter), and splitting also had no measurable impact on the stability. Split tablets either by hand or splitter showed higher rate of content uniformity failures as compared to whole tablets. Tablet splitter produced more fragmentation and, hence, more content uniformity and friability failures. Chemical imaging data revealed that the distribution of levothyroxine was heterogeneous and was dependent on type of binder and the process used in the manufacture of tablets. Splitting such tablets could prove detrimental if sub- or super-potency becomes an issue...|$|R

The liquid density (ρ), the bulk modulus (K), and its pressure derivative (K′) were measured from 1 atm to 161 GPa using 1 -atm double-bob Archimedean, multi-anvil sink/float, and shock wave techniques. Shock compression results on initially molten Fe_(2) SiO_ 4 (1573 K) fitted with previous work and the ultrasonically measured bulk sound speed (C_o) in shock velocity (U_S) -particle velocity (u_p) space yields the Hugoniot: U_S = 1. 58 (0. 03) u_p + 2. 438 (0. 005) km/s. Sink/float results are in agreement with shock wave and ultrasonic data, consistent with an isothermal K_T = 19. 4 GPa and K′ = 5. 33 at 1500 °C. Shock melting of initially solid Fe_(2) SiO_ 4 (300 K) confirms that the Grüneisen parameter (γ) of this <b>liquid</b> increases upon <b>compression</b> where γ = γ_o(ρ_(o) /ρ) ^q yields a q value of – 1. 45.
