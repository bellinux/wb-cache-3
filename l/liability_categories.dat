40|$|Barth, Hodder, and Stubben {{examine how}} the risk and {{expected}} return of existing shares varies {{as a function of}} the amount of outstanding employee stock options (ESOs), finding that the association is a negative one, consistent with ESOs being equity-like in character. They suggest that their approach could be used to address the question of how best to characterize other complex financial claims. The study is well executed and provides a thought-provoking contribution to the debate. However, it is far from obvious that the ‘‘debt or equity’’ question can be solved in this manner. Their approach effectively defines a liability as a financial claim that has characteristics akin to fixed-rate debt. I provide examples of the limitations of this perspective, starting by comparing ESOs that are settled with shares with those settled in cash. Whether a claim is treated as a liability or equity is of little con- sequence if it is simply a matter of balance sheet presentation. The real question is the implications for income measurement. I suggest progress might best be made if we start with Penman’s proposal that assets and liabilities be separated into oper- ating and financial items, an approach which would include many claims that have equity-like characteristics, such as unvested ESOs, within the operating <b>liability</b> <b>category.</b> Once a claim ceases to be an operating item—e. g. when an ESO vests—the approach suggested in the paper can then be used to determine how it should be classified...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{the subject of}} {{analysis}} is semantic links of the concepts responsibility and <b>liability</b> to other <b>categories</b> of ethics. When analysing semantic links of the concepts responsibility and <b>liability</b> to other <b>categories</b> of ethics, {{the aim is to}} ascertain the synonymy of the abovementioned concepts. The concept responsibility is most frequently used when a certain human feature is under discussion, and the concept liability – when the observance of legal requirements, a legal norm is under discussion. The conception of responsibility is the underlying category of ethics and law. It is close to concepts ”conscience”, “obligation”, “diligence”, „dignity“, and is related to the emotional reaction to do one’s duty. Responsibility manifests when a human being takes responsibility for own independent and sovereign actions. The concept liability made of the adverb liable is more often found in different texts than the concept responsibility, which describes a feature. It is the most general moral feature of a personality, which stimulates a careful action when doing own duties. Liability manifests as selfcontrol mechanism of a person. It implies a person‘s relationship to moral obligation...|$|R
40|$|Contract rules can be {{justified}} by utilitarian theories (such as efficiency theory), which are concerned with promoting rules that enhance societal wealth and utility. Contract rules can also {{be justified}} by rights-based theories (such as promissory and reliance theories), which are concerned with protecting the contractual freedom and interests ofthe individual parties to the contract. Or, contract rules can be analyzed through the lenses {{of a host of}} other theories, including critical legal theory, bargain theory, and so on. Because no single, unitary theory can ever explain the complex body of laws and societal conventions surrounding contracts, the best rule to govern any particular situation is the one that {{can be justified}} by multiple normative theories. Such an approach would stand the best chance of achieving consensus, and would acknowledge the insight of pluralism theorists—that no single unified theory can explain the civil law. This Article applies a concordant approach to selecting contract rules to address the question of whether a parent company should be held liable in tort for directing the termination of a contract entered into by its subsidiary. Under ordinary circumstances, a simple breach of contract does not give rise to tort liability and punitive damages; one cannot tortiously interfere with one’s own contract. But the courts around the country are deeply divided {{on the question of whether}} parent companies are immune from tort liability for inducing a subsidiary to breach a contract. Some courts hold that because the parent and subsidiary share common interests, the parent is completely immune from tort liability, just as though it were a party to the contract (Category 1). Some courts take the similarly formalistic approach that because the parent and subsidiary are technically separate entities, the parent enjoys no immunity from tort <b>liability</b> (<b>Category</b> 2). Some courts impose tort liability only if the parent acted against the business interests of the parent and subsidiary or committed an independent tort (Category 3). Some courts impose tort liability even if the breach of contract was in the business interest of the parent and subsidiary if the parent company’s actions were “wrongful,” which can be something less than tortious behavior (Category 4). This Article presents an exhaustive survey and categorization of these conflicting rules and then applies normative contract theory to determine which is the best approach. In particular, the two most dominant contract law theories of our time are applied to the issue: efficiency theory and rights-based theory. Applying efficiency theory to the problem at hand, this Article begins with the proposition that, in order to facilitate efficient breaches of contract, no tort liability should be imposed. However, once one takes into account the underlying false assumption of efficiency theory that commercial actors always act rationally, allowing for tort liability to be imposed in those situations where the parent does not act out of business judgment makes sense. When rights-based theory is applied to this issue, it raises questions as to whether breach should be penalized to honor the promise made to the nonbreaching party and to protect the non-breaching party’s reliance on that promise. However, rights-based theory would also argue for protecting the parent company’s autonomy by allowing it to reject a promise it never accepted and to decline to honor reliance it never induced—but only if the parent is acting out of rational business interest. Accordingly, the parent company should be afforded autonomy in choosing to terminate a contract it did not bargain for (so long as it pays compensatory damages). If the parent company’s actions are not taken for rational business reasons, but rather for reasons of spite, malice, or oppression, then the law should punish and deter such behavior...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by the Nigerian financial institutions. Nigeria have been using domestic accounting standard (NGAAP) for banks and non-banks financial institutions known as Statement of Accounting Standards (SAS 10 Part 1 and SAS 15 Part 2) issued in 1990 and 1997 respectively for financial reporting. These domestic standards were adopted from International Accounting Standards (IAS 30) but have not been updated like IAS 30 {{as reported by the}} Report on Observance of Standard Codes (ROSC) of Nigeria in 2004 and 2011. The change in accounting regulations is {{as a result of the}} weaknesses of NGAAP and low disclosure requirements. IFRS reporting has more disclosures than NGAAP especially for financial institutions. Under NGAAP financial instruments have not been classified as in IFRS. For instance, financial instruments have been classified into four under IAS 39 as; (i) recognised fair value on gain or loss in profit or loss, (ii) are measured at amortised cost for investments held-to-maturity, (iii) measured at amortised cost for loans and receivables, (iv) measured at fair value gain or loss for available-for-sale financial assets recognised in other comprehensive income. Additionally, financial <b>liabilities</b> have been <b>categories</b> into two namely; (i) measured at amortised fair value on financial liabilities through profit or loss and, (ii) measured at amortised other liabilities. Now with the mandatory adoptions of reporting under IFRS by all listed financial institutions, will the accounting disclosures be more valu...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} {{in real estate}} lending was {{a major reason for}} the rapid expansion of New England banks during the 1980 s. When nominal real estate prices began to decline in New England, collateral became impaired and many loans stopped performing. The consequent increased provision for expected loan losses (loan loss reserves) caused a rapid deterioration in bank capital throughout the region.; Having just lost a significant proportion of their capital, many banks tried to satisfy their capital/asset ratio requirements by shrinking their institutions. This article discusses why banks facing binding capital constraints will shrink more than unconstrained banks when an adverse capital shock occurs. It shows that New England banks with low capital/asset ratios are in fact shrinking their institutions faster than better capitalized institutions, and that this behavior has been particularly apparent in those <b>liability</b> <b>categories</b> that are marginal sources of funds for most banks.

40|$|Presently, {{there exists}} {{numerous}} microeconomic models of commercial banks. These numerous models {{can be classified}} {{as one of the}} following: models that require monopoly power for a solution, models that utilize a portfolio structure, or models that recognize the resources used in producing banking services. Unfortunately, no narrowing of focus in the theoretical work has occurred. One reason for numerous models and the lack of focus is the lack of empirical tests of bank models. ^ In the literature, there have been two empirical tests of theoretical bank models: Parkin (1970) and Graddy and Kyle (1979). Parkin 2 ̆ 7 s test of his highly detailed model of English discount houses supported a portfolio structure, but the results should not be generalized to a U. S. commercial bank. Graddy and Kyle test a very unstructured bank model to demonstrate the interdependence of asset and liability decisions. ^ This research empirically tests the model published by John Mason (1979). The Mason model was chosen because it modelled bank management as a price-discriminating, risk-neutral monopolist facing a portfolio decision. It also provided the structure for a test of a certainty vs. uncertainty model of bank behavior. For the purpose of this research, the Mason model was modified to include the institutional constraints of reserve requirements and interest rate ceilings. In addition, a proof of a unique equilibrium was presented and the comparative statics were examined. ^ The Mason model was tested by fitting balance sheet and interest rate data from a single bank holding company to the mathematical form implied by the first-order conditions of the model 2 ̆ 7 s solution. The OLS regressions were fitted for three loan and five <b>liability</b> <b>categories.</b> The regression results provide (1) an endorsement that uncertainty models are a significant improvement over certainty models, (2) limited support for the Mason model in five of the eight regressions, and (3) evidence that large U. S. banks acquire the majority of their assets and liabilities in competitive markets. This research suggests that banks should be modelled as competitive firms that operate in a world of uncertainty. ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{introductory}} {{chapter to}} an upcoming book, the authors discuss the two principal types of efficiency frontier methodologies - the econometric (parametric) approach and the mathematical programming (non-parametric) approach. Frontier efficiency methodologies are discussed as useful {{in a variety}} of contexts: they can be used for testing economic hypotheses; providing guidance to regulators and policymakers; comparimg economic performance across countries; and informing management of the effects of procedures and strategies adapted by the firm. The econometric approach requires the specification of a production, cost, revenue, or profit function as well as assumptions about error terms. But this methodology is vulnerable to errors in the specification of the functional form or error term. The mathematical programming or linear programming approach avoids this type of error and measures any departure from the frontier as a relative inefficiency. Because each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages, it is recommended to estimate efficiency using more than one method. An important step in efficiency analysis is the definition of inputs and outputs and their prices. Insurer inputs can be classified into three principal groups: labor, business services and materials, and capital. Three principal approaches have been used to measure outputs in the financial services sector: the asset or intermediation approach, the user-cost approach, and the value-added approach. The asset approach treats firms as pure financial intermediaries and would be inappropriate for insurers because they provide other services. The user-cost method determines whether a financial product is an input or output based on its net contribution to the revenues of the firm. This method requires precise data on products, revenues and opportunity costs which are difficult to estimate in insurance. The value-added approach is judged the most appropriate method for studying insurance efficiency. it considers all asset and <b>liability</b> <b>categories</b> to have some output characteristics rather than distinguishing inputs from outputs. In order to measure efficiency in the insurance industry in which outputs are mostly intangible, measurable services must be defined. The three principal services provided by insurance companies are risk pooling and risk-bearing, "real" financial services relating to insured losses, and intermediation. The authors discuss how these services can be measured as outputs in value-added analysis. They then summarize existing efficiency literature. ...|$|E
