Arriving off the bay on 1 January 1833, contrary winds from the northwest rather than the expected northeast quarter, coupled with a strong southward current caused the ship to lose ground on every tack, until on January 6, she sailed into an unknown bay which proved to host Phú Yên Province's Vung-lam harbour.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lint</b> {{cleaners}} at cotton gins {{improve the}} grade and {{market value of}} cotton, but excessive cleaning can reduce bale values and some quality factors. Textile mills prefer that ginned <b>lint</b> be cleaned at gins with only one saw-type <b>lint</b> cleaner, but many gins use two stages of saw <b>lint</b> cleaning to obtain higher grades. Experiments were conducted to study the characteristics and efficiency of flow-through air-type <b>lint</b> cleaners operating under commercial gin conditions. Comparisons were also made to a controlled-batt saw-type <b>lint</b> cleaner that followed the air-type <b>lint</b> cleaner. One air-type <b>lint</b> cleaner was only 25 % as effective at cleaning {{as one of the}} saw-type <b>lint</b> cleaners. However, the air-type cleaners caused less fiber damage than the saw-type <b>lint</b> cleaners. Information from the field study will be used to (i) advise cotton ginners on the proper use of air-type <b>lint</b> cleaners and (ii) plan new studies to develop air-type <b>lint</b> cleaners that better supplement <b>lint</b> cleaning with only one saw-cylinder cleaner and ensure acceptable market return. Experiments were conducted at three commercial gins to study the characteristics and efficiency of flow-through air-type <b>lint</b> cleaners operating under standard field conditions. Overall, one air <b>lint</b> cleaner gave a cleaning efficiency of 9 % compared to 36 % for one saw <b>lint</b> cleaner following an air <b>lint</b> cleaner. However, the air-type cleaners caused less fiber damage than the saw-type cleaners. Although textile mills prefer that ginned <b>lint</b> be cleaned at gins with only one saw-type <b>lint</b> cleaner, many gins use two stages of saw <b>lint</b> cleaning to obtain higher grades. An air-type <b>lint</b> cleaner can be substituted for one of the gin’s usual saw machines.

40|$|Abstract. Seed {{surface area}} is the basic ground for <b>lint</b> {{production}} in cotton and, hence, {{a starting point for}} genetic improvement in <b>lint</b> yield. Experiments on upland cottons were carried out under 2 temperature regimes (April sown, high temperature regime; June sown, moderate regime) for 2 years in the field to study their modifying effect on phenotypic expression and combining ability of <b>lint</b> weight per seed (LW/S), <b>lint</b> weight per unit seed surface area (LW/SA), <b>lint</b> weight per unit fibre length (LW/FL), <b>lint</b> frequency (LF), number of spinnable fibres per seed (F/S), and number of spinnable fibres per unit seed surface area (F/SA). Variation among cultivars for relative decrease in the basic <b>lint</b> traits under high temperature regime indicated their differences in heat sensitivity. Genetic variation for all basic <b>lint</b> traits was low over environments but high within environments. Temperature regime was a stronger source of variation in basic <b>lint</b> traits than year. Temperature regimes modified phenotype, ranking among parents, and combining ability of basic <b>lint</b> traits. Relative contribution of specific combining ability to total variation decreased under high temperature regime for all the basic <b>lint</b> traits, except LW/FL, with a corresponding increase in general combining ability due to either female or male parents.

Fourteen of these Wfteen lines were found to be homozygous for the dominant fuzzless seed allele N 1. Only one line was homozygous for the recessive fuzzless seed allele n 2. The measured <b>lint</b> percent of each line was very stable through time, however, large variability existed between many of the N 1 lines ranging from 0. 7 to 23. 6 % <b>lint.</b> The <b>lint</b> percent for the n 2 line was 24. 4 %. Scanning electron microscopy was used to diVer-entiate patterns of <b>lint</b> initiation on 1 day post anthesis ovules. General patterns included: Wrst, <b>lint</b> initiation restricted to the chalazal end of the seed crest; second, <b>lint</b> initiation along the seed crest and laterally around the chalazal end of the ovule; and third, <b>lint</b> initiation covered all but the micropylar end of the ovule. <b>Lint</b> quality was evaluated for each line using the Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) which included measurements of length, maturity, and Wneness. The means of each measurement varied among the fuzzless seed lines with signiWcant diVerences between Wber length, short Wber con-tent, immature Wber content, Wneness, and matu-rity ratio. No correlation was found between <b>lint</b> percent and any of the <b>lint</b> quality measurements.
