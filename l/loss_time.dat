5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while <b>loss</b> <b>time</b> can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 64 is {{very similar}} to Shakespeare's Sonnet 60 where both sonnets focus on a central idolizing of [...] "time as the destroyer". In Helen Vendler's, The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Vendler {{describes}} Sonnet 64 to be written in a state of horror and [...] "unprotected vulnerability". The speaker's horror is manifested in the line, Increasing store with loss, and loss with store. Vendler argues that in this line [...] "Loss wins in both cases. It is of course impossible to increase abundance with loss, and equally impossible to increase loss by adding abundance to it." [...] Atkins is also in agreement that sonnet 64 especially in line 12, the speaker expresses a state of fear: That Time will come and take my love away. In [...] "Shakespeare's Sonnets" [...] Atkins argues the meaning of this line is clear that [...] "after seeing all these other ruins, I think about your eventual ruin". Vendler calls line 12 a [...] "collapse into monosyllabic truth", [...] "and its dismayed adolescent simplicity of rhythm, this line feels like a death." [...] Booth claims that in line 13 is unclear: [...] "death, the nearest potential antecedent, cannot choose, but it cannot weep or fear either; thought makes better sense, but it is the thinker who does the weeping and fearing." [...] Vendler argues that in the last three lines of the sonnet a [...] "'natural' pattern of unreversed ruin 'defeats' the intellectual mastery-by-chiasmus, as the concept of gradual leakage comes to represent personal <b>loss.</b> <b>Time</b> takes love away, a thought is like a death, one weeps to have what one fears to lose.... Having while fearing to lose is already a form of losing." [...] Overall, both Booth and Vendler agree in the last three lines of the sonnet the speaker weeps at the fear of losing his love, ultimately realizing that he cannot escape time and time will come and take his love away.|$|E

50|$|Under Okoloko the Midwestern {{management}} team achieved significant production; first oil was {{achieved in the}} Umusadege Field in 2008 at flow rates of around 3,000bopd from re-entry of the Umusadege-1 well. This has been rapidly increased to approximately 25,000bopd through additional development drilling efforts. A total of fifteen (15) wells have been drilled to date; the company has achieved success through its ability to peacefully coexist with the host communities. Okoloko eventually led Midwestern to acquire Mart Resources taking it private in 2016. Midwestern achieved another commendable milestone in 2016 when the company celebrated nine Million Man-Hours LTI-Free operations. Midwestern has also received several awards and recognitions by notable international bodies for achievements in HSE; in 2013 the company won the prestigious Africa Oil and Gas Award for Health Safety and Environment (HSE).

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in Machine Learning to find a classifier and parameter settings that work well on a given dataset. Evaluating all possible combinations typically takes too much time, hence many solutions have been proposed that attempt to predict which classifiers are most promising to try. As the first recommended classifier {{is not always the}} correct choice, multiple recommendations should be made, making this a ranking problem rather than a classification problem. Even though this is a well studied problem, there is currently no good way of evaluating such rankings. We advocate the use of <b>Loss</b> <b>Time</b> Curves, as used in the optimization literature. These visualize the amount of budget (time) needed to converge to a acceptable solution.
