VA was divided into upper (VAU), middle (VAM), and basal sections (VAB). An in vivo study was performed to examine the effect on <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>growth</b> in adolescent rats. In addition, in vitro osteogenic activities were examined using osteoblastic MG- 63 cells. VA promoted <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>growth</b> and height of the growth plate in adolescent rats. Bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) in growth plate of VA group was highly expressed compared with control. The anabolic effect of VA on bone was further supported by in vitro study.

The mRNA expressions of osteogenic genes such as collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin were increased by VA treatment. These effects of in vivo and in vitro study were decreased from upper to basal sections of VA. In conclusion, VA treatment promotes <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>growth</b> in growing rats through enhanced BMP- 2 expression, osteogenic activities, and bone matrix gene expressions.

Long bones, especially the femur and tibia, are subjected to most of the load during daily activities and they are crucial for skeletal mobility. They grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis, with an epiphysis {{at each end of the}} growing bone. The ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage ("articular cartilage"). The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>growth</b> of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate.

Method: To investigate the effect on <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>growth</b> in adolescent male Sprague-Dawley rats, the <b>longitudinal</b> length of <b>growth</b> plate was measured directly by the tetracycline fluorescent labeling method and chondrocyte staining method.

50|$|Endochondral {{ossification}} {{is responsible}} for the initial bone development from cartilage in utero and infants and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>growth</b> of long bones in the epiphyseal plate. The plate's chondrocytes are under constant division by mitosis. These daughter cells stack facing the epiphysis while the older cells are pushed towards the diaphysis. As the older chondrocytes degenerate, osteoblasts ossify the remains to form new bone. In puberty increasing levels of estrogen, in both females and males, leads to increased apoptosis of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate. Depletion of chondrocytes due to apoptosis leads to less ossification and growth slows down and later stops when the entire cartilage have become replaced by bone, leaving only a thin epiphyseal scar which later disappears.|$|E

50|$|Anatomically, Eusthenopteron shares many unique {{features}} {{in common with}} the earliest known tetrapods. Largest individuals grew up to 1.8 m (~ 6 ft) in length. It shares a similar pattern of skull roofing bones with forms such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. Eusthenopteron, like other tetrapodomorph fishes, had internal nostrils, (or a choana) which are one of the defining traits of tetrapodomorphs (including tetrapods). It also had labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by infolded enamel, which characterizes all of the earliest known tetrapods as well. Like other fish-like sarcopterygians, Eusthenopteron possessed a two-part cranium, which hinged at mid-length along an intracranial joint. Eusthenopterons notoriety comes from the pattern of its fin endoskeleton, which bears a distinct humerus, ulna, and radius (in the fore-fin) and femur, tibia, and fibula (in the pelvic fin). These appendicular long bones had epiphyseal growth plates that allowed substantial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>growth</b> through endochondral ossification, as in tetrapod long bones. These six appendicular bones also occur in tetrapods and are a synapomorphy of a large clade of sarcopterygians, possibly Tetrapodomorpha (the humerus and femur are present in all sarcoptergyians). Similarly, its elasmoid scales lack superficial odontodes composed of dentine and enamel; this loss appears to be a synapomorphy with more crownward tetrapodomorphs.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} confirm whether appositional growth could be used as an indicator for stress during childhood in a nineteenth century rural population from Middenbeemster, the Netherlands. This population is known to have suffered from malnutrition and epidemic outbreaks, which makes this population ideal for this research. In order to study longitudinal length, femoral length was plotted against dental age of Middenbeemster subadults. To study appositional growth, cortical thickness, measured on X-rays, was plotted against dental age. These were compared with long bone lengths and cortical thicknesses of modern populations. It appeared that Middenbeemster subadults between 7 and 11 years old were deficient in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>growth</b> compared to modern children, and that children younger than 7 years were not deficient in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>growth.</b> Middenbeemster children were deficient in appositional growth.

40|$|IGF-I is {{expressed}} in virtually every tissue of the body, but with much higher expression in the liver {{than in any other}} tissue. Studies using mice with liver-specific IGF-I knockout have demonstrated that liver-derived IGF-I, constituting a major part of circulating IGF-I, is an important endocrine factor involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Detailed studies comparing the impact of liver-derived IGF-I and local bone-derived IGF-I demonstrate that both sources of IGF-I can stimulate <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>growth.</b> We propose here that liver-derived circulating IGF-I and local bone-derived IGF-I to some extent have overlapping growth-promoting effects and might have the capacity to replace each other (= redundancy) in the maintenance of normal <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>growth.</b> Importantly, and in contrast to the regulation of <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>growth,</b> locally derived IGF-I cannot replace (= lack of redundancy) liver-derived IGF-I for the regulation {{of a large number of}} other parameters including GH secretion, cortical bone mass, kidney size, prostate size, peripheral vascular resistance, spatial memory, sodium retention, insulin sensitivity, liver size, sexually dimorphic liver functions, and progression of some tumors. It is clear that a major role of liver-derived IGF-I is to regulate GH secretion and that some, but not all, of the phenotypes in the liver-specific IGF-I knockout mice are indirect, mediated via the elevated GH levels. All of the described multiple endocrine effects of liver-derived IGF-I should be considered in the development of possible novel treatment strategies aimed at increasing or reducing endocrine IGF-I activity...|$|R
