30|$|In {{the case}} of wells {{downstream}} of KSWTP, three sources could simultaneously be responsible for increasing the salinity. The first source could come from direct river <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> <b>leakage</b> through the riverbed. This leakage is dependent on stream flow and properties of the riverbed sediment. The stream flow {{is estimated to be}} 267, 000  m 3 /day and the leakage was recorded through the rise in the water table in observation well 2, which is located within 1  km downstream from KSWTP. The water level rose 7.72  m between 2000 and 2005, averaging 1.5  m per year (Fig.  4). The hydrogeological setting of the aquifer system downstream of the KSWTP allows this infiltration to occur. The upper part of the shallow aquifer consists of alluvium which is highly permeable material. The second possible source of salinity is the dissolution of the accumulated salts in the soil by the irrigation water (similar to the situation upstream of KSWTP). The third source is due to direct evaporation from the water table for the wells tapping the relatively shallow alluvium, its average depth around 10  m.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a sample}} with a split back-gate, a linear {{frequency}} {{dependence of the}} ac quantum Hall resistance was observed. The frequency coefficient, {{which is due to}} dielectric <b>losses</b> produced <b>by</b> <b>leakage</b> current between the 2 DEG and the back-gates, can be turned from a positive to a negative values by increasing the back-gate voltage. More interestingly, by removing theses back-gates, the losses can be considerably reduced leading to a residual frequency coefficient on the order of (0. 03 +- 0. 03) ppm/kHz. Moreover, at 1 kHz, an extremely flat plateau was observed over a magnetic field range of 1. 4 T. These results clearly indicate that the audio frequency dependence of the QHR is to a large extend related to the measurement apparatus and does not originate from the physical transport properties of the 2 DEG.

40|$|Rubidium (similar to {{the highly}} mobile {{macronutrient}} K) and strontium (immobile in the phloem) were fed through a flap {{into one of}} the three uppermost leaves of field grown wheat. In all cases rubidium (supplied to the plants shortly after ear emergence) was mainly translocated into shoot parts above the feeding position. Strontium accumulated in the fed leaf and was essentially not detectable in other plant parts. These results indicate that direct contamination with the feeding solution was negligible and Rb was redistributed through long distance translocation. A considerable amount flowed from the flag leaf into the maturing grains. Rb fed into the two lower leaves accumulated in the internode below the flag leaf and only a minor portion reached the ear. A high percentage of the Rb was lost from the shoots at the end of maturation. This decrease was most pronounced after feeding the lowest leaf.

40|$|Incontinentia lactis is a {{possible}} predisposing factor for an elevated level of intramammary infection. The goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate possible causes of incontinentia lactis in dairy cows. Two farms that differed in breed composition, but that had similar average milk yields were studied: herd A, 28 kg/d, 31 Red Holstein cows; and herd B, 26 kg/d, 16 Brown Swiss cows. Herd A was classified into 2 groups: incontinentia lactis (ILA group) and control, whereas herd B was exclusively a control herd. Milk samples that represented foremilk and the main milk fraction were collected during 4 milking sessions. In addition, milk leakage samples from the ILA group were collected at different time intervals from 0 to 5 h before milking. Measurements of the teat, milk flow, fractions of cisternal and alveolar milk, intramammary pressure, and blood oxytocin pattern also were obtained. The ILA cows did not have differences in fat content between milk leakage and cisternal milk fraction. Milk fat content, however, increased during milking in response to continuous milk ejection (1. 95, 1. 99, and 4. 61 % for milk leakage, cisternal, and main milk samples, respectively). Teat canals were 9 % shorter in the ILA cows, which showed greater milk yield, peak, and average flow rates. Quarter cisternal milk yield of ILA cows tended to be greater (0. 50 vs. 0. 23 and 0. 28 kg for ILA and controls from herds A and B, respectively), whereas percentages of cistern milk and alveolar milk did not differ from controls. The greater pressure in the ILA group, both before and after manual udder stimulation (ILA: 4. 0 and 6. 4 kPa; control: 2. 0 and 5. 0 kPa, respectively), could be an important cause for the leakage. Nevertheless, the increase in IMP that occurred after udder preparation affirms that milk ejection occurred in response to the tactile teat stimulation, but not before the onset of leakage. Blood oxytocin concentration in ILA cows was low until the start of udder preparation and increased in response to the milking stimulus (reaffirming the hypothesis that milk leakage occurred in the absence of milk ejection). In conclusion, milk <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>leakage</b> are likely due to the large amount of cisternal milk, which creates pressure and causes leakage, in the absence of milk ejection...|$|R

The differences between potassium and sodium {{may be due to}} a different compartmentation on the tissue level or on the subcellular level.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} field performance testing of five thermal distribution systems in four light commercial buildings. The systems studied {{are located in}} Sacramento and Pleasanton, California, and are connected to typical rooftop packaged units serving small office spaces. All of the buildings are single-story office-buildings with floor areas less than 1, 000 m 2. The field study included distribution system characterization of the five duct systems, and short-term refrigerant-side monitoring {{on two of the}} packaged units. The air leakage results are presented in terms of specific effective leakage areas (ELAs), the ASHRAE-defined duct leakage classes, leakage flowrate (from flow subtraction or derived from ELA and operating pressures), and air leakage ratios (i. e., fractional loss of fan flow). Comparisons are made with results from previous studies on light commercial buildings. The specific ELAs ranged from 0. 8 to 5. 3 cm 2 per m 2 of floor area served, and the leakage classes ranged from 232 to 414, making these duct systems much leakier than the “unsealed ductwork ” classification by ASHRAE. The air leakage ratios were approximately 10 % of fan-supplied airflow on average, which was considerably lower than previous studies. Conduction energy <b>losses</b> calculated <b>by</b> temperature measurements in the duct systems were found to be significant, ranging from 9 % to 24 % of capacity. Refrigerant-side monitoring of temperature and pressure were used to calculate equipment efficiencies. The results show that there were considerable energy <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> air <b>leakage</b> and conduction through ducts, and that the losses varied from system to system. Frequent on-off cooling cycling was common with the systems we tested and additional losses were also found due to improper system control. These diagnostic results suggest that efficiency improvement in thermal distribution could be achieved via better system control, design and sizing, and by duct sealing...|$|R

In order to estimate the magnitudes of these losses, 24 houses in the Sacramento, California, area were tested before and after duct retrofitting. The systems in these houses included conventional air conditioning, gas furnaces, electric furnaces and heat pumps. The retrofits consisted of sealing and insulating the duct systems. The field testing consisted of the following measurements: leakage of the house envelopes and their ductwork, flow through individual registers, duct air temperatures, ambient temperatures, surface areas of ducts, and HVAC equipment energy consumption. These data were used to calculate distribution system delivery efficiency as well as the overall efficiency of the distribution system including all interactions with building load and HVAC equipment. Analysis of the test results indicate an average increase in delivery efficiency from 64 % to 76 % and a corresponding average decrease in HVAC energy use of 18 %.

Furthermore, when the turbine worked at different tip speed ratio, the results were discussed, either.

Currently available heat-to-current converters, such as thermoelectric generators, operating in a low-grade heat regime reach efficiencies no higher than a few percent (< 3 %). Herein, we illustrated a thermal capacitive electrochemical cycle (TCEC) using electrochemical cell, where the connection to the hot or cold reservoirs alternates in a cyclic charging–heating–discharging–cooling mode to convert heat into electricity, which performs as an electrochemical heat engine. TCEC technology is a cost-effective method for exploiting the temperature-dependent electrostatic potential in an electric double layer (EDL) at carbon electrode/electrolyte interfaces; it produces net electricity by altering the EDL thickness via heating and cooling. In this paper, TCEC on supercapacitor was confirmed on commercial supercapacitor, which showed a poor conversion efficiency. To improve the performance, we redesigned the cell by employing the pouch cell setup with activated carbon as electrode materials and homemade temperature controlling system, which boosted the efficiency from 0. 5 % of commercial supercapacitor to 3. 05 % when cycling between 10 and 65 °C.

Water leakage problems in unlined or shotcrete lined water tunnels are not new issues. In many occasions severe water inflow as well as leakage problems have been faced that not only reduced stability of the rock mass surrounding the tunnel, but also valuable water has been lost from it, causing safety risk as well as huge economic loss to the projects. In the Himalaya, due to active tectonics in this region, the rock masses are highly fractured, folded, sheared and deeply weathered. Tunneling through numerous zones of weakness, fractures and faults is thus a matter of reality. Moreover, the majority of these zones are in general highly conductive, representating potential sources of ground water aquifer as well as possible sources of water leakage from the completed unlined or shotcrete lined water tunnels. Thus, the degree of uncertainty and risk associated with water leakage is extremely high. Water leakage control in the tunnels plays a vital role not only in improving the rock mass quality, but also in increasing the safety as well as saving economic <b>loss</b> caused <b>by</b> large <b>leakages.</b> The real challenge is however accurate prediction and quantification of possible water leakage prior to tunnel excavation, so that cost consequences are incorporated well in advance.
