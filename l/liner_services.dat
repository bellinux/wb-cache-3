Renamed , the ship entered service with Chandris Line on the United Kingdom—Mediterranean—Australia -route in December 1963.

Following rebuilding she entered service with Chandris Line in August 1965 as , joining Ellinis on the UK-Australia service. The Australis particularly proved to be an extremely popular ship on the run from United Kingdom to Australia, usually operating at full capacity. Chandris Line expanded further in 1965 when they acquired National Hellenic American Line and their sole ship, , from Home Lines. Although the Queen Frederica was a relatively old ship, Anthony Chandris considered her to be well suited for the North American cruise market. During the summer months she was used for cruising out of New York, while during the winters she was used in Piraeus—New York and Piraeus—Australia <b>liner</b> <b>services.</b> For some time the Queen Frederica was marketed as a Chandris Lines/National Hellenic American Line ship. The Queen Fredericas cruise service from New York proved short, as new legislation came in effect in the US at the end of 1967, aimed at improving safety standards on cruise ships. Bringing the Queen Frederica in-line with the new requirements would have been extremely costly, and as a result she was withdrawn from the North American cruise service in September 1967.
