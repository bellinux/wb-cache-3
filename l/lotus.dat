5|$|The {{main unit}} began its work in August 1976 in Sardinia. Don McLaughlan, {{then head of}} public {{relations}} at <b>Lotus</b> Cars, heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype <b>Lotus</b> Esprit with all <b>Lotus</b> branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked <b>Lotus</b> to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming of the car chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences. While moving the car between shoots, <b>Lotus</b> test driver Roger Becker impressed with {{his handling of the}} car {{and for the rest of}} filming on Sardinia, Becker became the stunt driver.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1975 season, Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at <b>Lotus,</b> the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's {{progress}} throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, <b>Lotus</b> was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and <b>Lotus</b> would swap Pryce and Swede Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost <b>Lotus</b> less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims that it came very close to being completed.|$|E

50|$|Coinciding {{with the}} decline in <b>Lotus’s</b> {{fortunes}} were the performances of the Type 105 and 106 (X180R) cars in the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Escort World Challenge between 1991 and 1992. These performances were an invaluable tool for <b>Lotus’s</b> North American Marketing. The kudos of owning a proven race winner was important in securing increased sales against the established race brands of Porsche and Ferrari. Also <b>Lotus’s</b> reputation of being a manufacturer of fragile unreliable cars had been improved through being successful in endurance racing.|$|R

5|$|Rindt was {{pronounced}} dead {{on the way to}} hospital and <b>Lotus</b> withdrew all cars from the race, including the <b>Lotus</b> 72 entered by Rob Walker. The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed <b>Lotus</b> 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a Lola Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has rested in a garage near Milan.|$|E
