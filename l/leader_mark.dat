25|$|The Australian Government did {{not hold}} a {{majority}} in the Senate, and thus required the support of the opposition Labor party, the Greens, Democrats, or independent senators in order to secure ratification. The Government put heavy pressure on Labor Party <b>leader</b> <b>Mark</b> Latham to secure Opposition support of the agreement (knowing that Latham, among many Labor members, viewed the FTA as beneficial). The issue had divided the party, with the Left faction in particular arguing that Labor should reject the agreement.|$|E

Mostert took his first victory for Ford Performance Racing by winning the third race ahead of Lowndes and Winterbottom. All cars run by the Holden Racing Team and Erebus Motorsport suffered punctures, forcing their drivers down the order. Lowndes trimmed Winterbottom's championship lead to 101 points, while Whincup moved past James Courtney for fourth.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Ulster Unionist Party in the 2005 UK general election and Sinn Féin's continual abstention from Westminster, the SDLP was the second largest parliamentary grouping from Northern Ireland at Westminster. The SDLP saw this as a major opportunity to become the voice of Irish Nationalism in Westminster and to provide effective opposition to the much enlarged Democratic Unionist Party group. The SDLP was consequently paying more attention to the Westminster Parliament and working to strengthen its ties with the Parliamentary Labour Party, whose whip they informally accepted. The SDLP was a vocal opponent at Westminster of the proposal to extend detention without trial to 42 days and previously opposed measures to extend detention to 90 days and 28 days. SDLP MP and former <b>leader</b> <b>Mark</b> Durkan tabled an Early Day Motion on cluster munitions which gained cross-party support and was quickly followed by a decision by the UK government to support a ban.|$|E

25|$|In 41 BCE, Herod and {{his brother}} Phasael were named as tetrarchs by the Roman <b>leader</b> <b>Mark</b> Antony. They were placed in this role to support HyrcanusII. Later, Antigonus, Hyrcanus' nephew, took the throne from his uncle {{with the help of}} the Parthians. Herod fled to Rome to plead with the Romans to restore HyrcanusII to power. The Romans had a special {{interest}} in Judea because their general Pompey the Great had conquered Jerusalem in 63 BCE, thus placing the region in the Roman sphere of influence. In Rome, Herod was unexpectedly appointed King of the Jews by the Roman Senate. Josephus puts this in the year of the consulship of Calvinus and Pollio (40 BCE), but Appian places it in 39 BCE. Herod went back to Judea to win his kingdom from Antigonus. Toward the end of the campaign against Antigonus, Herod married the granddaughter of HyrcanusII, Mariamne (known as MariamneI), who was also a niece of Antigonus. Herod did this in an attempt to secure his claim to the throne and gain some Jewish favor. However, Herod already had a wife, Doris, and a young son, Antipater, and chose therefore to banish Doris and her child.|$|E
25|$|Jamie Whincup {{dominated}} the ITM 500 Auckland, winning {{two of the}} three races and finishing second in the other. Whincup won from pole position in the first race with Shane Van Gisbergen and David Reynolds completing the podium. Scott Pye originally finished in fourth place but was relegated to fifth after cutting a chicane in the closing laps to keep ahead of Craig Lowndes. Lowndes led {{for the first half of}} the second race before his left-rear tyre failed at the end of the main straight, causing Lowndes to spin and collide heavily with a wall. The car had to be taken to a local panel shop in order for the necessary repairs to be carried out, with the car not fully fixed until the following morning. Lowndes' demise allowed Reynolds to take victory ahead of Whincup and Scott McLaughlin. Whincup won the third race ahead of Lowndes while Scott Pye achieved his first career podium. Championship <b>leader</b> <b>Mark</b> Winterbottom endured a difficult race, being spun early on before recovering to finish in eleventh place. Reynolds moved into second place in the championship after a strong weekend, 239 points behind Winterbottom and one point ahead of Lowndes.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{event in}} Townsville saw Craig Lowndes lose {{ground in the}} {{championship}} race. On the opening lap of race one, Lowndes made contact with both Garth Tander and James Courtney before being spun into the wall by Will Davison, failing to finish a race {{for the first time}} since 2012. Lowndes and Davison both received points penalties for their roles in each incident, while Todd Kelly also received a points penalty for an incident with Jack Perkins. Lowndes' teammate Jamie Whincup capitalised to win the race ahead of a recovering Tander and Davison. Tander went on to win the second race with Courtney in second place, while polesitter Fabian Coulthard finished third. Lowndes had more problems on Sunday, with a grid penalty dropping him from first to third on the grid, gifting pole to Jason Bright, before an overheating engine dropped him to twenty-third position. Whincup won again, with Tander in second and Shane Van Gisbergen in third. Championship <b>leader</b> <b>Mark</b> Winterbottom qualified poorly during the weekend, but managed to finish in the top ten in two of the races to maintain his series lead, with Whincup moving up to second, 96 points behind, and Lowndes dropping to sixth behind Coulthard, Van Gisbergen and Courtney.|$|E

500|$|By 1981, the Fall had {{released}} three {{critically acclaimed}} albums, but band <b>leader</b> <b>Mark</b> E Smith felt {{the group was}} undervalued and poorly supported by their label Rough Trade Records, whom he regarded as [...] "a bunch of well meaning but inept hippies". He felt constrained by the label's ethos and worried that the Fall {{were in danger of}} becoming [...] "just another Rough Trade band". Smith made overtures to other labels, and found kindred adventurous spirits at small emergent label Kamera Records. Kamera's first release in November 1981 was the Fall's single [...] "Lie Dream of a Casino Soul", which also featured drummer Karl Burns {{for the first time since}} Live at the Witch Trials. Burns previously substituted for Paul Hanley on a US tour when the latter was denied a visa for being too young, and upon the group's return to the UK, Smith suggested that Burns should stay on as a second drummer.|$|E
