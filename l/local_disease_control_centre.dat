Patients and methodData of 82 patients with macromastia undergoing ORM for breast cancer between 1996 and 2011 were retrospectively examined and evaluated with regard to oncological results. ResultsThe median age was 50 years. The median follow-up was 121 months (range 28 – 212 months). The median breast volume was 1402  cm 3 and the median weight of excised breast material was 679  g. The median surgical margin was 16  mm. Ten-year local recurrence rate was 8. 7 %. The 10 -year overall survival rate was 82. 2 % and the disease-free survival rate was 73. 2 %.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> <b>control,</b> overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and local relapse-free survival (LRFS) in patients with endometrial cancer undergoing adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) ± external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS:From September 2007 to February 2011, 40 patients with endometrial cancer were retrospectively analysed. Surgery consisted of total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without node dissection (16 patients) or with bilateral pelvic node dissection (24 patients). The stage distribution was as follows: two IA, nine IB, 12 IC, five IIA, eight IIB, two IIIA and two IIIC. Thirty-four patients underwent EBRT and VBT. Six patients received VBT alone. RESULTS:Median follow-up was 26 months. The 5 -year OS and DFS were 96. 4 % and 86. 9 %, respectively. No local recurrence was observed. Four patients presented distant disease (three had lung metastases and one had hepatic node metastases). Acute EBRT-related toxicities were seen in 15 (38 %) patients. We recorded late toxicities in 14 patients (35 %). There was no evidence of grade 3 - 4 toxicity.

Patients and methods From a series of 240 patients with stage III-IV carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract who were treated consecutively according to the RADPLAT protocol, a subset analysis of 155 patients with T 3 -T 4 SCC (Oral cavity SCC N = 22, oropharynx SCC N = 94 and hypopharynx SCC N = 39), was performed.

40|$|AIM. To {{determine}} the procedure {{of choice for}} rectal cancer, particularly low rectal cancer. METHODS. Complete search, according to evidence-based methods, of comparative studies and national surveys published in English since 1990. Selection criteria: comparative studies between abdominoperineal excision (APER) and sphincter-saving operations (SSO) {{with a minimum of}} 50 patients presenting cancer in the lower one-third of the rectum, perfect split of cases with cancer located in the lower, middle or upper one-thirds of the rectum, specified numbers of patients treated by surgery alone or combined with radio-chemotherapy, specified length of follow-up with a minimum of 1 year, univariate or multivariate analysis of prognostic factors. Thirty-four studies fulfilling evidence level C were analyzed, including 6, 570 patients. Endpoints: operative risk, <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> <b>control,</b> <b>disease</b> free or cancer specific survival and quality of life. RESULTS. Postoperative morbidity after APER and SSO is comparable and postoperative mortality decreased to 2 % or less. The type of surgery was not identified as a prognostic factor in terms of <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> <b>control</b> and survival. Quality of life is significantly inferior after APER. National data reveal an APER rate for cancer of the whole rectum (up to 16 cm) at 50 % or above, and SSO still would represent only 32 % of the radical resections for low rectal cancer. CONCLUSION. All available evidence indicates that SSO should be the procedure of choice for rectal cancer, even in the lower one-third. An APER should only be performed when cancer invades the anal sphincters and negative resection margins cannot be achieved by a SSO. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Brachytherapy is an {{important}} therapeutic strategy {{for the treatment of}} locally advanced gynaecologic (GYN) cancers despite evolution of different newer radiotherapy techniques like high-dose-rate and image-guided BT. Despite being used in the management of advanced gynaecological cancer, currently there is a scarcity of studies and data on interstitial BT in Indian context. This is a retrospective analysis on 71 patients with locally advanced gynaecological malignancies treated in the period of 2010 to 2016 to assess the local tumour control, survival, and complications with the template (Syed-Neblett) guided interstitial technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS The patients with a median age of 51 years treated from July 2010 to May 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. This study included previously unirradiated 71 patients with advance stage of gynaecological malignancies, not suitable for intracavitary brachytherapy due to distorted anatomy or extensive disease stage. Histologically all patients had squamous cell carcinoma (cervix= 56, vault= 9, vagina= 6) and treated by whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) up to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. These patients were further treated by high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy using SyedNeblett dedicated vaginal plastic template. During treatment all these patients were re-optimised and a dose of 15 - 21 Gy was delivered in 3 fractions with a minimum gap of 6 hours between fractions using Varisource iX HDR unit.
