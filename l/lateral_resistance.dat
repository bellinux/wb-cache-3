25|$|Bi-block (or twinblock) ties {{consist of}} two {{concrete}} rail supports {{joined by a}} steel bar. Advantages include increased <b>lateral</b> <b>resistance</b> and lower weight than monobloc concrete ties, as well as elimination of damage from torsional forces on the ties center due the more flexible steel connections.

25|$|Because {{wind-powered}} vehicles typically sail at {{apparent wind}} angles {{aligned with the}} leading edge of the sail, the sail acts as an airfoil and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. Low forward resistance to motion, high speeds over the surface, and high <b>lateral</b> <b>resistance</b> help create high apparent wind speeds—with closer alignment of the apparent wind to the course traveled for most points of sail—and allow wind-powered vehicles to achieve higher speeds than conventional sailing craft.|$|E

The objectives of the paper are to investigate: 1 {{the response of the}} pile groups subjected to torsion; 2 {{the way in which the}} applied torque is transferred in the pile groups; 3 the internal forces mobilized in these torsionally loaded pile groups and their contributions to resist the applied torque; and 4 the influence factors that affect the load transfer, such as soil density and pile-cap connection. In these model tests, the group torsional resistances of the pile groups increased monotonically in the test range of twist angles up to 8 °. Both torsional and <b>lateral</b> <b>resistances</b> of the individual piles were simultaneously mobilized to resist the applied torque. The torsional resistances were substantially mobilized at small twist angles, while the <b>lateral</b> <b>resistances</b> kept increasing in the whole range of twist angles. Thus, the contribution of the torsional resistances to the applied torque decreased at large twist angles. The piles at different locations in a pile group could develop not only different horizontal displacements, but also different pile–soil–pile interactions and load–deformation coupling effect, hence, the torsional and <b>lateral</b> <b>resistances</b> of the piles are a function of pile location.

25|$|The Bruce foil is a foil that {{provides}} a <b>lateral</b> <b>resistance</b> with zero heeling moment by placing the foil to either {{or both of the}} leeward and the windward sides, angled so the direction of the force passes through the center of effort of the sail. Since proas already have an outrigger to the windward side, a simple angled foil mounted on the ama becomes a Bruce foil, making the already stable proa even more stable. Bruce foils are often combined with inclined rigs, which results in a total cancellation of heeling forces. Inclined rigs are also well suited to the proa, as the direction of incline remains constant during shunting.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Contessa 32 is {{generally}} seen as a cross between older and newer designs. She has the well ballasted keel, low centre of gravity, and narrow beam of traditional English cutters, but has a fin keel characteristic of newer, lighter racing yachts. The narrow beam and substantial ballast provide {{a high degree of}} positive stability, with an AVS of 155°, although due to her small size the STIX is only 33. If knocked down or capsized, the Contessa readily rights herself. Because it is shorter than a full-length keel, a fin keel creates less drag. The blending of the keel into the hull forward captures the lateral stability of a full keel, and with the cut away aft portion lends greater responsiveness to the helm. While the skeg bestows additional <b>lateral</b> <b>resistance</b> to the hull aft producing directional stability, its robust design also supports and protects the rudder.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we explain}} the {{behavior}} of multijunction solar cells under non-uniform (spatially and in spectral content) light profiles in general and in particular when Gaussian light profiles cause a photo-generated current density, which exceeds locally the peak current density of the tunnel junction. We have analyzed the implications on the tunnel junction's limitation, that is, {{in the loss of}} efficiency due to the appearance of a dip in the I–V curve. For that, we have carried out simulations with our three-dimensional distributed model for multijunction solar cells, which contemplates a full description of the tunnel junction and also takes into account the <b>lateral</b> <b>resistances</b> in the tunnel junction. The main findings are that the current density photo-generated spreads out through the <b>lateral</b> <b>resistances</b> of the device, mainly through the tunnel junction layers and the back contact. Therefore, under non-uniform light profiles these resistances are determinant not only to avoid the tunnel junction's limitation but also for mitigating losses in the fill factor.

2500|$|The {{active state}} {{occurs when a}} {{retained}} soil mass is allowed to relax or deform laterally and outward (away from the soil mass) {{to the point of}} mobilizing its available full shear resistance (or engaged its shear strength) in trying to resist lateral deformation. That is, the soil is at the point of incipient failure by shearing due to unloading in the lateral direction. It is the minimum theoretical lateral pressure that a given [...] soil mass will exert on a retaining that will move or rotate away from the soil until the soil active state is reached (not necessarily the actual in-service lateral pressure on walls that do not move when subjected to soil lateral pressures higher than the active pressure). The passive state occurs when a soil mass is externally forced laterally and inward (towards the soil mass) to the point of mobilizing its available full shear resistance in trying to resist further lateral deformation. That is, the soil mass is at the point of incipient failure by shearing due to loading in the lateral direction. It is the maximum <b>lateral</b> <b>resistance</b> that a given soil mass can offer to a retaining wall that is being pushed towards the soil mass. That is, the soil is at the point of incipient failure by shearing, but this time due to loading in the lateral direction. Thus active pressure and passive resistance define the minimum lateral pressure and the maximum <b>lateral</b> <b>resistance</b> possible from a given mass of soil.|$|E

The sensor relies on a modified ACPD technique that measures simultaneously both values of resistance in the axial and lateral directions using a square electrode configuration. The technique monitors the variation in {{the ratio of the}} measured axial and <b>lateral</b> <b>resistances,</b> therefore can efficiently separate the mostly isotropic common part of the resistivity variation caused by reversible temperature variations from the mostly anisotropic differential part caused by direct geometrical and indirect material effects of creep. Initially, this ratio can be considered proportional to the axial creep strain, while at later stages, the resistance ratio accelerates due to the formation of directional discontinuities such as preferentially oriented grain boundary cavities and micro-cracking in the material. This ACPD technique has been applied to a series of accelerated creep tests on 2. 25 CrMoV Steel at 650 °C.

However, the ultimate strength of <b>lateral</b> nail <b>resistance,</b> the stiffness, and the yield strength of nailed joints were affected by the density profile of MDF and showed high values when the surface layer of the MDF had high density. It is known that bending performance is also influenced by density profile. Therefore, the stiffness and the yield strength of nailed joints were compared with the bending performance of MDF. The stiffness of nailed joints was positively correlated with the modulus of elasticity (MOE); in the case of CN 65 nails, the initial stiffness of joints changed little in response to changes in MOE. The yield strength of nailed joints had a high positive correlation with the modulus of rupture (MOR). The stiffness and the yield strength of nailed joints showed linear relationships with MOE and MOR, respectively.|$|R
40|$|With cooling costs rising exponentially, {{designing}} cooling {{solutions for}} worst-case power dissipation is prohibitively expensive. Chips that can autonomously modify their execution and powerdissipation characteristics permit {{the use of}} lower-cost cooling solutions while still guaranteeing safe temperature regulation. Evaluating techniques for this dynamic thermal management (DTM), however, requires a thermal model that is practical for architectural studies. This paper describes HotSpot, an accurate yet fast and practical model based on an equivalent circuit of thermal resistances and capacitances that correspond to microarchitecture blocks and essential aspects of the thermal package. Validation was performed using finite-element simulation. The paper also introduces several effective methods for DTM: “temperature-tracking ” frequency scaling, “migrating computation ” to spare hardware units, and a “hybrid ” policy that combines fetch gating with dynamic voltage scaling. The latter two achieve their performance advantage by exploiting instruction-level parallelism, showing the importance of microarchitecture research in helping control the growth of cooling costs. Modeling temperature at the microarchitecture level also shows that power metrics are poor predictors of temperature, that sensor imprecision has a substantial impact on the performance of DTM, and that the inclusion of <b>lateral</b> <b>resistances</b> for thermal diffusion is important for accuracy...|$|R
