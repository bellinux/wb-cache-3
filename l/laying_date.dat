40|$|Clutch {{sizes of}} many single-brooded birds {{decrease}} as the breeding season progresses. This decrease is usually quantified {{using data from}} several years, an approach that would mask any annual variation.

Both <b>lay</b> <b>date</b> and year were strong predictors of clutch size for all species. However, Generalised Linear Modelling revealed an interaction between <b>lay</b> <b>date</b> and year in the prediction of clutch size, indicating that the strength of the relationship between <b>lay</b> <b>date</b> and clutch size varied between years. Multilevel modelling was used to establish proximate factors that may be responsible for annual variability. Factors affecting the relationship between <b>lay</b> <b>date</b> and clutch size were species-specific. For Blue Tits, seasonal decline in clutch size was steepest when the density of all cavity-nesting species was high (47 % variance explained). For Great Tits, decline was steepest in “early” seasons, particularly when density was high (32 % variance explained), and for Pied Flycatchers, decline was steepest in warmer years (33 % variance explained). Thus annually variable factors appear to influence not only breeding phenology and clutch size individually, but also the relationship between these variables...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} Cory’s shearwater nesting biology suggest that pairs nesting at very close range {{to one another}} lay their eggs more {{synchronously}} than the colony as a whole.

40|$|Across North America, tree {{swallows}} {{have advanced}} their mean date of clutch initiation (<b>lay</b> <b>date)</b> by ≈ 9 days {{over the past}} 30 years, apparently in response to climate change. In a sample of 2, 881 nest records collected by the lay public from 1959 to 1991, we examined whether clutch size has also responded to climate change. We found that clutch size is strongly related to <b>lay</b> <b>date,</b> both within and among years, {{and there has been}} no significant temporal variation in the slopes or intercepts of the clutch-size/lay-date regressions. As a consequence, we expected increases in clutch size with advancement in lay date; however, we detected no such trend over time. The distributions of egg-laying dates were more constricted in the warmest (and earliest) years, suggesting that changes in mean clutch size might be constrained by changes in the distribution of <b>laying</b> <b>dates.</b> If spring temperatures continue to increase, we predict further reductions of variance in <b>laying</b> <b>dates</b> and relatively small increases in clutch size. Such constraints on life-history variation probably are common and need to be considered when modeling the effects of climate change on reproduction in natural populations.

50|$|As another example, {{studies of}} the Pied Flycatcher (ficedula hypoleuca) have shown that their spring {{migration}} timing is triggered by an internal circannual clock that is fine tuned to day length.

From 1980-2000, temperatures {{at the time of}} arrival and the start of breeding have warmed significantly.

40|$|Several {{studies of}} marine top predators, above all of seabirds, have {{analysed}} {{the effects of}} either individual age or environmental fluctuations on reproduction; nevertheless, {{little is known about}} the age patterns in breeding performance in a variable environment.

40|$|Plumage colour {{variation}} exists among Gyrfalcons throughout their Arctic and sub-Arctic circumpolar distribution, ranging from white through silver and grey to almost black. Although different colour variants coexist within many populations, a few geographical regions, such as northern Greenland, possess a single variant, suggesting that local environments may influence plumage {{colour variation}}. In central-west Greenland (66. 5 – 67. 5 °N), where multiple colour variants exist, white male Gyrfalcons fathered sig-nificantly earlier clutches than grey males.

50|$|Several reviews report {{eastern towhee}} clutch sizes from 2 to 6 eggs, with means ranging from 2.45 to 3.6 eggs per nest. All 5 eastern towhee nests on Sanibel Island, Florida, {{contained}} 3 eggs.

5000|$|For this species, {{the timing}} of {{egg-laying}} {{has much to do}} with male behavior. Males can affect female reproductive success so strongly because for the 20 days up to egg-laying, females spend up to 80% of their time in the nest. This leaves males with the responsibility of providing food regularly and securing (and maintaining) a high-quality territory for nesting. This phenomenon of the genetics of one individual affecting those of another individual is known as indirect genetic effects. For this population, at least, possible explanations for this atypical heritability pattern exist. While controlling female health and safety, males are responsible for {{the timing of}} the start of courtship feeding, as well. These populations also typically have excesses of females, allowing males to exert even further choice in the form of mate choice. These factors in combination give males a great opportunity to express their [...] "laying date genotype". In spite of the presence of directional selection and significant male heritability for breeding time, no advancement of breeding time was seen during the 46 years of this experiment. This does not discount the significance of the paper's other results however - one of the most significant being that here a [...] "female trait (<b>laying</b> <b>date)</b> is largely determined by genetic characteristics of its mate".|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{correlated}} {{the advancement of}} <b>lay</b> <b>date</b> in birds with warming climate trends, yet the fitness effects associated with this phenological response have been examined in {{only a small number}} of species. Most of these species– primarily insectivorous cavity nesters in Europe–exhibit fitness declines associated with increasing asynchrony with prey. Here, we use 25 years of demographic data, collected from 1986 to 2010, to examine the effects of spring temperature on breeding initiation date, double brooding, and annual fecundity in a Nearctic- Neotropical migratory songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens). Data were collected from birds breeding at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, where long-term trends toward warmer springs have been recorded. We found that black-throated blue warblers initiated breeding earlier in warmer springs, that early breeders were more likely to attempt a second brood than those starting later in the season, and that double brooding and <b>lay</b> <b>date</b> were linked to higher annual fecundity. Accordingly, we found selection favored earlier breeding in most years. However, in contrast to studies of several other long-distance migratory species in Europe, this selection pressure was not stronger in warmer springs, indicating that these warblers were able to adjust mean <b>lay</b> <b>date</b> appropriately to substantial inter-annual variation in spring temperature.

40|$|Avian {{seasonal}} {{timing is}} a life-history trait with important fitness consequences {{and which is}} currently under directional selection due to climate change. To predict micro-evolution in this trait, {{it is crucial to}} properly estimate its heritability. Heritabilities are often estimated from pedigreed wild populations. As these are observational data, it leaves the possibility that the resemblance between related individuals is not due to shared genes but to ontogenetic effects; when the environment for the offspring provided by early laying pairs differs from that by late pairs and the <b>laying</b> <b>dates</b> of these offspring when they reproduce themselves is affected by this environment, this may lead to inflated heritability estimates. Using simulation studies, we first tested whether and how much such an early environmental effect can inflate heritability estimates from animal models, and we showed that pedigree structure determines by how much early environmental effects inflate heritability estimates. We then used data from a wild population of great tits (Parus major) to compare <b>laying</b> <b>dates</b> of females born early in the season in first broods and from sisters born much later, in second broods. These birds are raised under very different environmental conditions but have the same genetic background. The <b>laying</b> <b>dates</b> of first and second brood offspring do not differ when they reproduce themselves, clearly showing that ontogenetic effects are very small and hence, family resemblance in timing is due to genes. This finding is essential for the interpretation of the heritabilities reported from wild populations and for predicting micro-evolution in response to climate change. ...|$|R
40|$|The condition-dependent {{model of}} optimal clutch size assumes body {{reserves}} required to initiate egg production include those for subsequent breeding phases. The threshold {{is expected to}} be similar among individuals, and hence postlaying condition should be independent of clutch size and <b>lay</b> <b>date.</b> Alternatively, the cost of incubation hypothesis predicts that females laying larger clutches should secure extra resources for incubation, and the expected fitness hypothesis suggests females adjust their condition according to the anticipated fitness benefits of the clutch. In these 2 cases, postlaying condition is predicted to be positively related to clutch size. We tested these predictions in common eider (Somateria mollissima), a precocial bird that produce eggs mostly from stored lipids and partly from endogenous proteins and rely extensively on reserves to incubate. We collected females at incubation onset and measured body condition indicators. Clutch size (number of eggs laid or number found in the nest at incubation onset) was not related to postlaying fat stores but females that laid fewer eggs maintained extra protein reserves. Timing of breeding was not related to postlaying body mass or protein reserves, whereas <b>lay</b> <b>date's</b> relationship with fat stores varied annually. Our results are generally consistent with the condition-dependent model and indicate variation in postlaying condition is mostly driven by factors other than clutch size and <b>lay</b> <b>date.</b> These data are inconsistent with the cost of incubation and the expected fitness hypotheses and suggest body store differences at incubation onset are mostly caused by environmental conditions encountered by laying females.

50|$|Mating and {{egg-laying}} timing for {{golden eagle}} is variable {{depending on the}} locality. Copulation normally lasts 10-20 seconds. Mating seems to occur around 40-46 days before the initial egg-laying. Unusual mating systems of three birds have been recorded in Scotland and Sweden, usually the third being an immature of either sex. These may simply reflect a relatively unstable period of population adjustment. Occasionally, pairs have been recorded copulating outside of the context of fertilization, possibly for pair maintenance and displacement activity. In Japan, a pair was seen mating 46 days before egg laying and in the United States 55 days after egg-laying. The date of egg laying has been directly correlated by the latitude where the pair lives. In the U.S., egg laying can be from anywhere between January and September, though is usually in March or later. In Scotland, egg-laying occurs in March to mid-April. The earliest median <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> in 25 international studies was December 3 in Oman; the latest median date of egg-laying was May 7 in sub-Arctic Alaska. Egg laying starts in the dry season as early as late November around Mali and Niger while the median egg <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> in southwestern Morocco is January 15. In Ethiopia, the estimated range of egg-laying dates ranged from October 24 to January 5. The median egg laying day in Arctic Russia was May 1. In the Kilbuck and Ahklun Mountains area, three pairs had eggs hatched from May 14 to 23, and young fledged from July 8 to August 10 with a median date of July 23 for 11 nests. Two nests on the Kisaralik River still contained young on July 24, and four nests contained young from 16 to 21 July. Clutches have been recorded {{range in size from}} 1 to 4 eggs, though two is the norm around the range. Records of single egg clutches are fairly common in Europe, with 3 being rare there but seemingly more common in North America, where up to 12% of clutches include 3 eggs. A 4 egg clutch is considered exceptional. The lowest mean clutch size known from surveys is 1.82 eggs in the Altai Mountains of Russia. A mean of 48 clutches from Algeria and Tunisia showed an average of 1.89 eggs per nests, with a range of 1 to 3. The female laid an average number of eggs of 1.99 in 332 clutches from 8 studies in 5 of the Western United States. The largest mean clutch size across the range was 2.1 in Montana. In the wild, eggs are typically laid at 3 to 5 day intervals, with records in captivity of intervals of up to 7 or 10 days. The eggs vary from all white to white with cinnamon or brown spots and blotches. Scottish eggs averaged 75 by 59 mm in size and weigh about 145 g. In Armenia, the average egg measured 76.5 by 59.1 mm and weighed 123 g. In North America, eggs average 74.5 by 58 mm, with a range of lengths from 67.5 to 85.7 mm and a range of width of 49.4 to 63.2 mm. Eggs of golden eagles in California weighed from 113.9 to 176.6 g, averaging 141.4 g. The incubation period lasts from 41 to 45 days, averaging about 42.4 days, with previously reported claims of as low as 33 days from North America now known to be erroneous. Females do a majority of, but not all, of the incubating and largely attain their own food up to the stage of egg-laying, after which they are typically fed by the male. The female may continue to grab most of their own food in areas where carrion is easily accessible. If made to forage excessively during the incubation stage by a non-attentive mate, the female may abandon the nesting attempt. In Idaho, the female did 84% of the incubation during the day, with the male doing about 16%. At night, the female generally appears to do all of the incubating. In Japan, the female did 90% of the observed incubating.|$|E

40|$|Many {{morphological}} and life-history traits show {{phenotypic plasticity}} {{that can be}} described by reaction norms, but few studies have attempted individual-level analyses of reaction norms in the wild. We analyzed variation in individual reaction norms between <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> and three climatic variables (local temperature, local rainfall, and North Atlantic Oscillation) of 1126 female collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) with a restricted maximum likehood linear mixed model approach using random-effect best linear unbiased predictor estimates for the elevation (i. e., expected <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> in the average environment) and slope (i. e., adjustment in <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> {{as a function of}} environment) of females' reaction norms. Variation in <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> was best explained by local temperature, and individual females differed in both the elevation and the slope of their laying date-temperature reaction norms. As revealed by animal model analyses, there was weak evidence for additive genetic variance of elevation (h 2 +/- SE = 0. 09 +/- 0. 09), whereas there was no evidence for heritability of slope (h 2 +/- SE = 0. 00 +/- 0. 01). Selection analysis, using a female's lifetime production of fledglings or recruits as an estimate of her fitness, revealed significant selection for a lower phenotypic value and breeding value for elevation (i. e., earlier <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> at the average temperature). There was selection for steeper phenotypic values of slope (i. e., greater plasticity in the adjustment of <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> to temperature), but no significant selection on the breeding values of slope.

40|$|Timing of {{reproduction}} has major fitness consequences, {{which can only}} be understood when the phenology of the food for the offspring is quantified. For insectivorous birds, like great tits (Parus major), synchronisation of their offspring needs and abundance of caterpillars is the main selection pressure. We measured caterpillar biomass over a 20 -year period and showed that the annual peak date is correlated with temperatures from 8 March to 17 May. <b>Laying</b> <b>dates</b> also correlate with temperatures, but over an earlier period (16 March – 20 April). However, as we would predict from a reliable cue used by birds to time their reproduction, also the food peak correlates with these temperatures. Moreover, the slopes of the phenology of the birds and caterpillar biomass, when regressed against the temperatures in this earlier period, do not differ. The major difference is that due to climate change, the relationship between the timing of the food peak and the temperatures over the 16 March – 20 April period is changing, while this is not so for great tit <b>laying</b> <b>dates.</b> As a consequence, the synchrony between offspring needs and the caterpillar biomass has been disrupted in the recent warm decades. This may have severe consequences as we show that both the number of fledglings as well as their fledging weight is affected by this synchrony. We use the descriptive models for both the caterpillar biomass peak as for the great tit <b>laying</b> <b>dates</b> to predict shifts in caterpillar and bird phenology 2005 – 2100, using an IPCC climate scenario.

40|$|Timing of {{reproduction}} in temperate-zone birds is strongly correlated with spring temperature, with an earlier onset of breeding in warmer years. Females adjust their timing of egg laying between {{years to be}} synchronized with local food sources and thereby optimize reproductive output. However, climate change currently disrupts the link between predictive environmental cues and spring phenology. To investigate direct effects of temperature on the decision to lay and its genetic basis, we used pairs of great tits (Parus major) with known ancestry and exposed them to simulated spring scenarios in climate-controlled aviaries. In each of three years, we exposed birds to different patterns of changing temperature. We varied the timing of a temperature change, the daily temperature amplitude, and the onset and speed of a seasonal temperature rise. We show that females fine-tune their laying {{in response to a}} seasonal increase in temperature, whereas mean temperature and daily temperature variation alone do not affect <b>laying</b> <b>dates.</b> Luteinizing hormone concentrations and gonadal growth in early spring were not influenced by temperature or temperature rise, possibly posing a constraint to an advancement of breeding.

For clutch size, we only found significant IxE and GxE in WW but no significant difference between populations. From a multivariate perspective, plasticity in <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> was not correlated with plasticity in clutch size in either population. Our results suggest that generalizations about the form and cause of any response to changing environmental conditions across populations may be difficult. ...|$|E
40|$|We used a {{long-term}} data set (26 years) from Audouin's Gull (Larus audouinii), a long-lived seabird, {{to address the}} relationship between the age-dependent pattern of reproductive performance and environmental conditions during breeding. Although theoretical models predict that the youngest and oldest breeders (due to inexperience and senescence, respectively) will perform less well than intermediate age classes, few empirical data exist regarding how this expected pattern varies with food availability. To assess the influence of age and food availability (corrected by population size of the main consumers to take into account density dependence) on a number of breeding parameters (<b>laying</b> <b>dates,</b> egg volume, clutch size, and hatching success), we modeled mean and variances of these parameters by incorporating heterogeneity into generalized linear models. All parameters varied with age and to different degrees, depending on food availability. As expected, performance improved with increased food supply, and the observed age pattern was quadratic, with poorer breeding performances occurring in extreme ages. For most parameters (except for <b>laying</b> <b>dates,</b> for which age and food did not interact), the pattern changed with food somewhat unexpectedly; the differences in performance between age classes were higher (i. e., the quadratic pattern was more noticeable) when food was more readily available than when food availability was lower. We suggest that, under poor environmental conditions, only high-quality individuals of the younger and older birds bred and that the differences in breeding performance between age classes were smaller. Although variances for egg volume were constant, variances for <b>laying</b> <b>dates</b> were highest for the youngest breeders and tended to decrease with age, either due to the selection of higher-quality individuals or to a greater frequency of birds skipping breeding with age, especially when food was in low supply. Our results show that mean and variances of breeding parameters changed with age, but that this pattern was different for each parameter and also varied according to food availability. It is likely that, other than food, certain additional factors (e. g., sex, cohort effects, density dependence) also influence changes in breeding performance with age, and this may preclude the finding of a common pattern among traits and among studies on different taxa. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

40|$|For birds, habitat {{quality is}} largely {{determined}} by local vegetation, and reproductive performance {{can therefore be}} negatively influenced by anthropogenic activities. A tree logging event enabled us to {{examine the effect of}} removing trees of different maturities and types on the reproductive performance of Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). Against expectations, only the logging of small coniferous trees, but not larger and deciduous trees, was associated with a {{reduction in the number of}} eggs laid, whereas logging had no significant effect on <b>lay</b> <b>date.</b> Therefore, we conclude that modest logging activity has no or limited negative influence on Blue Tit reproductive performance...|$|R
40|$|Advances in mowing {{schedules}} {{have led}} to early and rapid declines in the seasonal food availability for, and survival rates of, chicks of grassland-breeding waders. Concurrently, increased levels of soil fertilization may have improved food abundance for adults. These developments are assumed to have resulted in an advancement of laying during 1930 – 1976 in several meadowbird species, including Black-tailed Godwits. Despite an apparent selective advantage of early breeding, after 1976 Godwits stopped advancing their <b>laying</b> <b>dates.</b> We have analyzed the timing of breeding and reproductive investment in Dutch Black-tailed Godwits relative to recent changes in agricultural practices and climate during 1976 – 2007. Early and late spring temperatures and precipitation in March were used as indicators for the timing of fertilizer application and mowing, and also as qualitative measures of relative food availability for adults and chicks. When precipitation was higher in March, Black-tailed Godwits laid earlier. Following warmer winters, the earliest females laid larger eggs, which hatched heavier chicks with a higher survival probability. We suggest that {{the positive effect of}} an increasing March precipitation on invertebrate abundance may be constrained by the current policy of rigid control of the water table. This policy prevents Godwits from further advancing <b>laying</b> <b>dates,</b> which would increase their chick’s survival prospects under increasingly early mowing schedules. Policy-makers should, next to delaying mowing schedules, also consider reduced draining in early spring as a tool to help stop the population decline of the Black-tailed Godwit. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{characteristics}} of organisms in free-living populations {{appear to be}} under directional selection, possess additive genetic variance, and yet show no evolutionary response to selection. Avian breeding time and clutch size are often-cited examples of such characters. We report analyses of inheritance of, and selection on, these traits in a long-term study of a wild population of the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. We used mixed model analysis with REML estimation ("animal models") to make full use of the information in complex multigenerational pedigrees. Heritability of <b>laying</b> <b>date,</b> but not clutch size, was lower than that estimated previously using parent-offspring regressions, although for both traits there was evidence of substantial additive genetic variance (h 2 = 0. 19 and 0. 29, respectively). <b>Laying</b> <b>date</b> and clutch size were negatively genetically correlated (rA = - 0. 41 +/- 0. 09), implying that selection {{on one of the}} traits would cause a correlated response in the other, but there was little evidence to suggest that evolution of either trait would be constrained by correlations with other phenotypic characters. Analysis of selection on these traits in females revealed consistent strong directional fecundity selection for earlier breeding {{at the level of the}} phenotype (beta = - 0. 28 +/- 0. 03), but little evidence for stabilising selection on breeding time. We found no evidence that clutch size was independently under selection. Analysis of fecundity selection on breeding values for <b>laying</b> <b>date,</b> estimated from an animal model, indicated that selection acts directly on additive genetic variance underlying breeding time (beta = - 0. 20 +/- 0. 04), but not on clutch size (beta = 0. 03 +/- 0. 05). In contrast, selection on <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> via adult female survival fluctuated in sign between years, and was opposite in sign for selection on phenotypes (negative) and breeding values (positive). Our data thus suggest that any evolutionary response to selection on <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> is partially constrained by underlying life-history trade-offs, and illustrate the difficulties in using purely phenotypic measures and incomplete fitness estimates to assess evolution of life-history trade-offs. We discuss some of the difficulties associated with understanding the evolution of <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> and clutch size in natural populations...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} wild animal species have {{documented}} that population level responses to environmental change are underpinned by individual level phenotypic plasticity. However, where {{the relationship between}} an individual trait and a climate variable occurs when both show a trend over time, phenotypic plasticity may be confounded by ageing. We investigated between and within individual change in <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> in the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, a longlived species experiencing a dramatic decline in population size. <b>Laying</b> <b>date</b> has advanced {{over the last three}} decades. A mean-centering analysis demonstrated that this pattern was driven by within-individual changes as opposed to appearance or disappearance of phenotypes. Furthermore, a lack of between individual effect suggested the change resulted from ageing as opposed to phenotypic plasticity. Females varied significantly in rate of advance, such that those with low past reproductive rates exhibited a negative temporal trend in <b>laying</b> <b>date,</b> whereas birds with moderate to high past reproductive performance showed little change. The population trend was therefore driven by a subset with low past breeding success. An analysis of effects of timing of breeding on breeding success revealed stabilizing selection for relative <b>laying</b> <b>date.</b> Furthermore, current breeding success was positively related to past success rate, which suggests that there may be indirect selection against plasticity in this population. Our results show that population trends can arise from individual level change unrelated to prevailing environmental conditions, thus demonstrating the importance of longitudinal analyses in the interpretation of climate change effects...|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies provide {{evidence}} that female plumage coloration is indicative of individual quality and can influence male mate choice. In blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), both sexes exhibit bright ultraviolet (UV) -reflectant crown feathers, which have previously {{been shown to be}} attractive to the opposite sex. In males, there is evidence that UV reflectance of the crown feathers is an honest signal of quality in this species, but it is unclear whether this is the case for females. To address this, the UV signal (an index of relative UV reflectance specific to the visual sensitivities of the blue tit) of mothers was measured during brood rearing for 3 years (2008 – 2010) and related to indices of reproductive success, that is, <b>lay</b> <b>date,</b> clutch size, and number of chicks fledged and maternal state, that is, body condition and baseline corticosterone (CORT). Maternal UV signal was unrelated to clutch size but was positively correlated with number of chicks fledged in 3 years. Maternal UV signal was also negatively correlated with <b>lay</b> <b>date,</b> but this was not consistent across years. In addition, maternal UV signal was negatively correlated with baseline CORT in all years but was not predictive of body condition. Taken together, these results provide evidence that female plumage coloration is indicative of female quality and may serve as a signal for mate choice. Further, it provides novel evidence that maternal baseline CORT is associated with UV plumage signal in free-living birds and may be an important mechanistic link between an individual’s ornamentation, state, and reproductive performance...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} plethora of studies {{investigating}} biotic implications of climate change, most {{research has been}} undertaken {{without the need for}} change being quantified. Failure to link observed responses to selection pressure is a fundamental omission because whether change is appropriate cannot then be determined. We use almost 7, 000 records to analyse long-term (1974 – 2004) changes in breeding phenology for six co-occurring woodland birds at a site with significantly increasing spring temperatures. We link observed change to changes in selection for early laying (calculated using differential breeding success as the season progresses) to determine whether change is: (1) necessary, (2) appropriate, and (3) sufficient. Three (resident) species—blue tit, great tit, and nuthatch—started clutches significantly earlier over time without selection for early laying becoming stronger over the same period. This suggests that observed advancements are appropriate, and sufficient, to track climate change. For another species—coal tit—there was no change in <b>lay</b> <b>date,</b> and although there was always selection to lay early, selection intensity did not change over time. For this, the earliest-laying species, bet-hedging to prevent maladaptation (laying too early) or stabilising selection may be acting to maintain phenological inertia, even when phenological change could be adaptive. For the final two (migratory) species—pied flycatcher and redstart—there was no temporal change in <b>lay</b> <b>date,</b> despite selection for early laying becoming significantly stronger over time. This study indicates that some species are tracking climate change successfully while ecologically-similar species, at the same study site, are failing to do so...|$|R
