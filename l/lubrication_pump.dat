5000|$|Fluid-film thrust {{bearings}} were invented by Australian engineer George Michell who patented his invention in 1905. Michell bearings contain {{a number of}} sector-shaped pads, arranged {{in a circle around}} the shaft, and which are free to pivot. These create wedge-shaped films of oil between the pads and a rotating disk on the shaft. Each lubricant [...] "wedge" [...] can only be of a limited length (in the direction of travel, i.e. circumferential) so multiple pads are needed rather than a single ring. No <b>lubrication</b> <b>pump</b> is needed: the rotation of the shaft itself is sufficient.|$|E
50|$|A {{ring oiler}} {{is a simple}} device, {{consisting}} of a large metal ring placed around a horizontal shaft, adjacent to a bearing. An oil sump is underneath this shaft and the ring {{is large enough to}} dip into the oil. As the shaft rotates, the ring is carried round with it. The rotating ring in turn picks up some oil and deposits it onto the shaft, from where it flows sideways and lubricates the bearings. The oil ring is effectively a simple <b>lubrication</b> <b>pump,</b> with only one moving part and no complex or high-precision components. The device is crude, but automatic, effective and reliable. Unlike a drip oiler, there is also no need to close off the oiler or remove oil wicks when the machine is stopped.|$|E
50|$|In the APU, a {{fuel pump}} boosted the {{hydrazine}} pressure and fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox. The waste gas, now cooler and at low pressure, was passed {{back over the}} gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard. The gearbox drove the fuel pump, its own <b>lubrication</b> <b>pump,</b> and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since the fuel pump was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the fuel pump outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the fuel pump.|$|E

These new designs feature liquid cooling with forced-air rotor cooling, metered oil <b>lubrication</b> <b>pumped</b> to the main bearings (directly) and to the rotor tips (via the inlet manifold), with partial oil recovery, dual ignition, and electric starting (all of which were features of the MidWest engines).

50|$|Neutral / No gear (N): This {{disengages}} all gear trains {{within the}} transmission, effectively disconnecting the transmission from the driven wheels, allowing {{the vehicle to}} coast freely under its own weight and gain momentum without the motive force from the engine. Coasting in idle down long grades (where law permits) should be avoided, though, with many transmission designs as the transmission's <b>lubrication</b> <b>pump</b> is commonly driven by the input (engine) side, which may not provide sufficient fluid flow at engine idle speed for high-speed travel. Similarly, emergency towing (with the driven wheels of the disabled and non-running vehicle on the ground) with an automatic transmission in neutral is not permitted by the manufacturer for many vehicles. Manufacturers understand emergency situations and list limitations of towing a vehicle in neutral (usually not to exceed 55 mph and 50 miles). This is the only other selection in which the vehicle's engine may be started.|$|E
50|$|As another example, {{imagine an}} {{investigation}} into a machine that stopped because it overloaded and the little fuse blew. Investigation shows that the machine overloaded because it had a bearing that wasn't being sufficiently lubricated. The investigation proceeds further and finds that the automatic lubrication mechanism had a pump which was not pumping sufficiently, hence the lack of lubrication. Investigation of the pump shows {{that it has a}} worn shaft. Investigation of why the shaft was worn discovers that there isn't an adequate mechanism to prevent metal scrap getting into the pump. This enabled scrap to get into the pump, and damage it. The root cause of the problem is therefore that metal scrap can contaminate the lubrication system. Fixing this problem ought to prevent the whole sequence of events recurring. Compare this with an investigation that does not find the root cause: replacing the fuse, the bearing, or the <b>lubrication</b> <b>pump</b> will probably allow the machine to go back into operation for a while. But there is a risk that the problem will simply recur, until the root cause is dealt with.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the evolution of}} the lubrication pumps for internal combustion engines in the last two decades. After the description of the traditional fixed displacement gear units, the interaction with the circuit is evaluated to determine their operating points. The analysis brings to evidence a mismatch in terms of flow rate and pressure between the engine requirements and the pump characteristic. Such difference has a negative effect on the overall efficiency of the flow generating unit, leading to a significant waste of fuel. For this reason several innovations aimed at reducing the power absorbed by the <b>lubrication</b> <b>pump</b> have been developed in recent years. The solutions presented in this paper range from variable displacement to variable timing to electric pumps. Moreover different methods for controlling the circuit pressure, such as thermostatic and electrical devices, discrete and continuous, are also discussed. From this extensive analysis it is evident that the most recent innovations can lead to a reduction of the fuel consumption from 2 to 4 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} of lubrication systems for aircrafts engines has seen significant development during {{the history of}} aeronautics and has progressed in parallel with {{the evolution of the}} engines themselves. Starting from the first, wetsump schemes derived from automotive applications, more complex systems and components have been introduced. The progressive increase of aeronautic engines' power and speed, {{as well as that of}} the maximum operative altitude of the aircraft, have increased the lubricant flow rate required to avoid severe mechanical issues that can cause dangerous conditions for the vehicle and its users. Currently, the main focus on the development of novel lubrication pumps is aimed at reducing the pumps' weight and envelope while maintaining, or possibly increasing, their reliability. The first two objective could be pursued by searching for novel pump types and/or increasing the pump speed in order to downsize its required capacity, but the low-pressure environment, typical of the lubrication circuits, over imposes a few, severe, limitations to avoid cavitation occurrence that decrease the effectiveness of this approach. The central aim of the presented research, performed within the program "Greening the Propulsion", is to provide a theoretical framework to help in the development of a novel gerotor pump for the lubrication of aeronautic engines. The first step of the research involves the study of the state of the art of aeronautic engines' lubrication systems, providing particular care to the effect that any design choice and possible operational condition may have on the <b>lubrication</b> <b>pump</b> design. Hence, the state of the art for gerotor pumps is investigated; results of this study are used, along with catalogue comparisons, to build simplified sizing tools to perform a benchmarking activity involving gerotors and other low pressure pumps type. This activity, performed to position gerotor pumps in the aeronautic engine lubrication market, is then used as a starting point to highlight the weak points of gerotors traditional design and to propose some possible solutions to enhance the pumps performances. To study the outcomes of these modifications, a rigorous theoretical framework is required; sizing and modeling criteria, based on the theory of gearing and compressible fluids, are hence detailed and used to build an Automatic Design and Simulation Framework, able to automatically design, validate and simulate a novel gerotor pump given a minimum number of geometrical and physical input parameters. This design and simulation tool is then used to evaluate the performance boost provided by the proposed variations and to optimize the gears profiles by pairing it with a multiobjective algorithm based on evolutionary strategies. Another critical component of any lubrication system is the pressure relief valve used to avoid the occurrence of dangerous conditions for the pipes integrity. A side activity involving the study of a preliminary sizing tool for pressure relief valve is hence performed. A preliminary design framework is presented and discussed, highlighting the importance of the valve discharge coefficient. To study its dependence on the valve's geometry, a lengthy CFD simulation campaign is performed varying the poppet shape and the fluid Reynolds' number. Results are hence discussed and used inside the design framework...|$|E

40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contamination outside the bearing system. These bearings {{are more often}} lubricated with grease rather than oil. Much knowledge is available on oil lubricated seals but {{a good understanding of}} grease lubricated seals is lacking. In this thesis, first the <b>lubrication,</b> <b>pumping</b> and sealing mechanisms of oil and grease lubricated radial lip seals have been discussed. The first paper reviews the public literature. This review has shown that very little is known on grease lubrication in radial lip seals. The primary <b>lubrication,</b> sealing and <b>pumping</b> mechanisms found for oil lubricated seals are micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication between the seal and shaft roughness and tangential deformations of the seal surface for a pumping action. These mechanisms are important but it is felt that other effects have to be included for explaining differences seen in grease lubricated radial lip seals. One effect in grease lubrication is the normal stress effect which is described in the second paper. It is shown that the grease rheology and especially the normal stress effect {{play a significant role in}} film formation in grease lubricated seals. The model predicts that 50 to 60 % of the load carrying capacity can be generated by the normal stress effect for a low contact pressure bearing seal depending on the operating conditions. The oil bleed model presented in the third paper describes the release of oil from the grease. This model is based on viscous flow through the porous soap microstructure and the driving force is the pressure gradient resulting from centripetal forces. It is shown that the soap fibre distribution has to become anisotropic during oil bleed and the model has been validated with experiments at different temperatures and rotating speeds. The model can be used with good confidence for longer periods of time and can be used as input for replenishment models.

The authors have developed different approaches to analyse the contribution of each power loss source, namely: (a) the windage losses based on simplified air flow models neglecting {{the influence of the}} lubricant, which compare well with the experimental evidence from a specific test bench; (b) an original model of gas trapping in the intertooth time-varying spaces, which has been validated using the experimental findings on a spur gear test rig in which pressure transducers have been placed {{at the bottom of the}} space between two teeth; (b) tooth friction, by introducing into a three-dimensional dynamic model of gears a new traction law based on measurements from a two-disc machine which accounts for lubricant properties and surface finish. The combination of the three models allows for the prediction of gear efficiency over a wide range of speeds and loads for jet-lubricated geared units. This approach also makes it possible to improve tooth geometry and gearbox design to minimize power losses and heat generation. The procedure is illustrated in several industrial applications...|$|R
