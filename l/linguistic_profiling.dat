25|$|<b>Linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> is the {{practice}} of identifying the social characteristics of an individual based on auditory cues, in particular dialect and accent. The theory was first developed by Professor John Baugh to explain discriminatory practices {{in the housing market}} based on the auditory redlining of prospective clientele by housing administrators. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> extends to issues of legal proceedings, employment opportunities, and education. The theory is frequently described as the auditory equivalent of racial profiling. The bulk of the research and evidence in support of the theory pertain to racial and ethnic distinctions, though its applicability holds within racial or ethnic groups, perceived gender and sexual orientation, and in distinguishing location of geographic origin.|$|E
25|$|Baugh's {{theory is}} {{distinct}} from <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> as defined by Hans van Halteren from the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. Van Halteren's theory deals with the categorization of linguistic features {{for the purposes of}} author identification and verification from a text, not necessarily specifically addressing the socially defined categories within which they are included.|$|E
25|$|<b>Linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> is {{also evident}} in education. Michael Sheperd’s study on teacher's {{perceptions}} of student responses compares how favorably teachers from the Los Angeles area viewed a response with the race and gender of the student speaker. Students were grouped based on white or minority and male or female. Teachers of various racial and ethnic backgrounds tended to view responses attributed to white females as being most favorable, followed by white boys, then minority girls. Students who were perceived as minority boys were ranked least favorably. Particularly noteworthy {{is the fact that}} Black and Hispanic teachers tended to rank responses given by minority boys, minority girls, and white boys, significantly lower than other teachers. While indicative of on overall stigmatization of boys, the study also provides evidence that the negative associations with minority students (who are identified through <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling)</b> are held by members of all racial groups.|$|E

40|$|Williams {{syndrome}} (WS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} resulting from a deletion on chromosome 7. A {{number of studies have}} shown that individuals with WS have a superior <b>linguistic</b> <b>profile</b> compared to their non-verbal abilities, however the evidence has been inconclusive, as many studies have disputed such a profile. The vast majority of studies on WS have assumed a single, homogeneous WS <b>linguistic</b> <b>profile</b> in order to support various theoretical viewpoints. The present study investigated the <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles</b> of 5 individuals with WS on a number of standardized verbal measures and in conversational settings. The results indicated substantially variable performance in all aspects of the verbal domain, which supports the view that WS, linguistically, is a rather heterogeneous condition and this should be taken into consideration when referring to it in theoretical accounts of language acquisition and debates on modularity...|$|R
40|$|Background: The spoken {{language}} difficulties {{of children with}} moderate or severe to profound hearing loss are mainly related to limited auditory speech perception. However, degraded or filtered auditory input as evidenced in children with cochlear implants (CIs) may result in less efficient or slower language processing as well. To {{provide insight into the}} underlying nature of the {{spoken language}} difficulties in children with CIs, <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles</b> of children with CIs are compared with those of hard-of-hearing (HoH) children with conventional hearing aids and children with specific language impairment (SLI). Aims: To examine differences in <b>linguistic</b> abilities and <b>profiles</b> of children with CIs as compared with HoH children and children with SLI, and whether the spoken language difficulties of children with CIs mainly lie in limited auditory perception or in language processing problems. Methods & Procedure: Differences in linguistic abilities and differential <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles</b> of 47 children with CI, 66 HoH children with moderate to severe hearing loss, and 127 children with SLI are compared, divided into two age cohorts. Standardized Dutch tests were administered. Factor analyses and cluster analyses were conducted to find homogeneous <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles</b> of the children. Outcomes & Results: The children with CIs were outperformed by their HoH peers and peers with SLI on most linguistic abilities. Concerning the <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles,</b> the largest group of children with CIs and HoH children shared similar profiles. The profiles observed for most of the children with SLI were different from those of their peers with hearing loss in both age cohorts. Conclusions & Implications: Results suggest that the underlying nature of spoken language problems in most children with CIs manifests in limited auditory perception instead of language processing difficulties. However, {{there appears to be a}} subgroup of children with CIs whose <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles</b> resemble those of children with SLI...|$|R
25|$|<b>Linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> {{also applies}} to gender and sexual orientation. Munson {{conducted}} a study in which naïve listeners were asked to distinguish between heterosexual male and female speakers, and gay male and bisexual or lesbian female speakers. He found that listeners tended to classify male and female speakers by masculinity and femininity, respectively; male speakers were perceived as gay if they sounded less masculine, while female speakers were identified as bisexual or lesbian if they sounded less feminine.|$|E
25|$|In higher education, <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> {{has been}} found to impede student comprehension. In a 1992 study, D. Rubin found that {{undergraduate}} university students would comprehend material more poorly if they heard a non-accented lecture presented with a picture of an Asian female. When the same non-accented lecture was presented with a European American teaching assistant, students had a greater ability to comprehend the material. This suggests that face identification may be enough to make students believe that language performance will be accented, which corresponded with a belief that comprehension would be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding the effects of <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> relates to housing. A study at the University of Pennsylvania found that discrepancies existed not only between white speakers of Standard American English and black speakers of African American Vernacular English, but in addition in between females and males and speakers of Black Accented English and African American Vernacular English when applying for housing. African Americans as a whole {{were also more likely}} to be told about the problems of creditworthiness when applying for a lease. An explanation offered by {{the research}}er suggests the linkage between low socio-economic backgrounds and African American Vernacular English, while Black Accented English was associated with higher middle class status. Speech closer to the standard form yielded greater acceptance.|$|E

25|$|<b>Linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> occurs {{beyond the}} spheres {{of race and}} {{ethnicity}} in the identification of geographic origin. Indeed, evidence suggests that listeners may successfully categorize speakers based upon dialect. Clopper and Pisoni (2003) found that naïve (or inexperienced) listeners could successfully categorize speakers as hailing from New England, the South, or the West, but had greater difficulty discerning geographic origin when a larger number of dialects were provided: New England, North, North Midland, South Midland, South, West, New York City, or Army Brat. Listeners were only able to identify speakers correctly 30% of the time. They also found evidence suggesting that residential history of the listener affected speaker categorization, and that listeners tended to use a small set of phonetic cues to make these distinctions.|$|E
2500|$|While much {{evidence}} has been collected describing <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> between racial groups within a speech community, <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> also extends to members within a racial or ethnic group. This is evidenced by {{a study conducted by}} Jaquelyn Rahman describing the perception of middle class African Americans to African American Vernacular English, or AAVE, and Standard American English. She found that subjects associated AAVE with their heritage, while perceiving African Americans who used Standard English as [...] "acting white".|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} distinction {{exists between the}} many uses of <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> {{and the potential for}} discriminatory treatment. The power to determine origin or racial identity based on speech can be utilized without overt discrimination, as argued in several court cases where voice was used in the prosecution of a suspect. The negative effects of <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> are seen in the practice of denying housing or employment based on stereotypes associated with dialect and/or accent. Further negative practices are associated with education and general treatment of individuals speaking stigmatized dialects. A more positive view of the practice is found in Baugh's description of expressions of ethnic pride. [...] Though average people {{have been shown to be}} well equipped in measuring social characteristics by means of speech, the failings of those unfamiliar with a speech community and the capability of manipulation of speech should be taken into account when determining the unbiased use of <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: This study compares 4 - to 7 -year-old {{cochlear}} implanted (CI) {{and specific}} language impaired (SLI) {{children in the}} production of finite verb morphology and mean length of utterance (MLU). It has been hypothesized that, due to reduced exposure to grammatical elements in the ambient language, both groups are delayed in their acquisition of morphosyntax. Method: Spontaneous language samples were analyzed for Dutch monolingual CI (N = 48) and SLI children (N = 38) on MLU, number of finite verbs, and number of errors in the target-like production of verbal agreement. CI and SLI children were compared on their <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles,</b> including MLU and finite verb production, using the norms of typically developing (TD) children. Results: Statistical differences between CI and SLI children were found only for finite verb production at ages 5 and 6, in the direction of better outcomes for CI children. Both groups produced significant numbers of verbal agreement errors. Weak <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles</b> were found for 75 % of the SLI children and 35 % of the CI children. Conclusion: CI and SLI children show both weak performances on the target-like production of verbal agreement. Nevertheless, CI children produce more finite verbs and have stronger <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiles</b> as compared to SLI children. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

2500|$|The primary {{research}} done on <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> {{was a result}} of linguist John Baugh's experience searching for housing as an African American. Baugh found a discrepancy between the proclaimed availability of an apartment in a phone interview, in which he utilized [...] Standard American English, and its apparent unavailability upon a face-to-face meeting with the landlord. The changed conception of the housing administrator between auditory and visual cues pointed to overt discrimination based on race.|$|E
2500|$|Linguist Dennis Preston has {{presented}} {{an expansion of}} the rulings set down on the use of <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> in legal contexts. Preston argues for the further definition of [...] "personal familiarity" [...] with a dialect to an individual {{as a member of the}} speech community within which the identification is taking place. The person identified must be an authentic speaker with no perceived imitation of other dialects within the language. Further, there should be no evidence of overt stereotypes connecting the speaker to a particular style of language.|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{justification}} {{was used}} in the later case of Clifford v. Kentucky. A white police officer testified against Charles Clifford, an African American appellant at the Kentucky Supreme Court based on his evaluation of race from spoken language. The presiding Judge cited the findings of Sanchez v. People in justifying the officer's claim of identifying the suspect based on overheard speech. A similar case is that of Clifford v. Commonwealth, where a testimony of <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> was allowed based on the caveat that [...] "the witness is personally familiar with the general characteristics, accents, or speech patterns of the race or nationality in question, i.e. so long as the opinion is 'rationally based on the perception of the witness'".|$|E

Some items were trained using a phonological intervention; others were trained using a semantic one. Lexical access outcomes were measured using a picture-naming test at pre- and posttesting. Results: Three children exhibited a significant reduction in WFDs on the intervention words after 6 sessions. These effects were present at posttest and 6 months later for the treated words only and not the control words. Each child responded differently to the intervention, and these response patterns seemed to be related to each child's <b>linguistic</b> <b>profile.</b> Conclusion: This intervention seemed to achieve long-lasting reductions in children's WFDs.

2500|$|A major {{precedent}} {{was formed}} {{on the use}} of <b>linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> in the case of Sanchez v. People. A witness testified against a suspect based on his overhearing of an argument between two apparent Spanish speakers where the killer was identified as having a Dominican rather than a Puerto Rican accent. The New York Superior Court ruled that distinguishing between accents was permissible {{based on the fact that}} [...] "human experience has taught us to discern the variation in the mode of speech of certain individuals."

2500|$|<b>Linguistic</b> <b>profiling</b> is very {{apparent}} in employment, {{as evidenced by}} the Supreme Court case United States v. Ferril. Shirley Ferril, a former employee of the telemarketing firm TPG, filed suit against the firm after being fired on the basis of her race. Ferril was hired by TPG, a firm that generates 60% of its revenue from providing pre-election [...] "get-out-the-vote" [...] phone calls to prospective voters, for the November 1994 election. She was subsequently fired after the election was over. The particular controversy about the case was TPG’s practice of matching callers to voters based upon race; with the rationale that voters would respond best when the caller was perceived {{to be a member of}} their own racial group. This was done with the particular belief that white voters would respond negatively to black callers. Indeed, African American employees would be given a [...] "black" [...] script to read to voters, while white employees read off of a [...] "white script." [...] Ferril, an African American, primarily called African American voters. Though the suit clearly displayed the fact that Ferril's work was based primarily on her race, the court allowed TPG to continue to assign callers to voters based upon dialect, accent, or speech pattern though acknowledging the practice was engaging in racial stereotypes.|$|E
