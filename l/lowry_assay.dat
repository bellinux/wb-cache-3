The reaction mechanism is not well understood, but involves reduction of the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and oxidation of aromatic residues (mainly tryptophan, also tyrosine). Experiments have shown that cysteine is also reactive to the reagent. Therefore, cysteine residues in protein probably also contribute to the absorbance seen in the <b>Lowry</b> <b>assay.</b> The concentration of the reduced Folin reagent is measured by absorbance at 750 nm. As a result, the total concentration of protein in the sample can be deduced from the concentration of tryptophan and tyrosine residues that reduce the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent.|$|E

It is a major concern for the consumers who are sensitive to the allergenic extractable proteins (EP) in products such as NRL gloves. Objective of this research was to develop an economical method to reduce the EP in finished dipped NRL products. In order to reduce the EP levels, two natural proteases, bromelain from pineapple and papain from papaya, were extracted and partially purified using (NH 4) 2 SO 4.

LAT-A increased AHF by 87 % for 3 hours and increased ka by 94 % over 6 hours; LAT-B increased ka by 39 % over 6 hours without affecting AHF.

40|$|The dermal microvasculature is an {{integral}} component of skin windows. However, {{in spite of the}} obvious dependence of the skin window model on vascular function, its almost exclusive application has been the study of leukocyte function and recovery of the cellular components of inflammatory exudates. In the studies reported here, skin window chambers were employed for assessment of function of the underlying microvasculature in rats given intravenous infusions of Evans blue dye or colloidal carbon. Increased vascular permeability was documented by photometric measurement of Evans blue dye, and vascular labeling of dermal vessels with colloidal carbon was assessed histologically. Zymosan-activated serum elicited accumulation of both leukocytes and Evans blue dye in chamber fluid overlying skin windows, confirming the responsiveness of the preparations. With serotonin as a model vasoactive substance, both increased vascular permeability and vascular labeling were directly related to serotonin concentration in the chamber fluid. It is estimated that plasma exudates were distributed as approximately 10 % in the fluid and 90 % in the dermis. Finally, serotonin-induced exudates recovered from the 0. 3 -ml chambers were estimated to be up to 3 microliter of plasma based on Evans blue dye measurement or up to 70 micrograms of protein based on <b>Lowry</b> <b>assay.</b> Thus, soluble components of skin window exudates were recovered for examination, and the dermal microvasculature was shown to be an important functional component of the skin window model that was directly accessible for study...|$|E

40|$|Calcium salts {{are often}} {{present in the}} center of all types of gallstones. Matrix {{proteins}} are known to be essential for biomineralization and may therefore also be important in the formation and growth of gallstones. Other researchers have described an anionic peptide fraction of a biliary lipoprotein complex in bile and a low-molecular weight acidic glycoprotein present in gallstones. Our goal was to determine whether such a protein was present in bile and whether this protein has any calcium-binding properties. We identified a pigment-associated, highly acidic protein that precipitates from bile on addition of CaCl 2 0. 5 mol/L. In addition, the protein is selectively concentrated in cholesterol and pigment stones. We have, therefore, confirmed the findings of these other researchers, and we have extended the study of this protein's interactions with calcium. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrates a single band (molecular weight ≤ 14 kD) that reacts positively with cationic stains. The protein was shown to inhibit the precipitation of CaCO 3 from a supersaturated solution. The capacity to bind calcium was further confirmed by autoradiography with 45 Ca++ and by a membrane adsorption-binding assay. Calcium-induced aggregation was demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis and by quasielastic light scattering studies. Protein measured by <b>Lowry's</b> <b>assay</b> method and amino acid analysis constitutes only 2 % to 4 % of the harvested material. We speculate that a substantial lipid component may also be present.

Since polyphenols seriously confound quantification of extracted protein, minimising this interference is important to ensure measurements are representative. Although the Bradford colorimetric assay is used routinely in soil science for rapid quantification protein in soil-extracts, it has several limitations. We therefore investigated an alternative colorimetric technique based on the <b>Lowry</b> <b>assay</b> (frequently used to measure protein and humic substances as distinct pools in microbial biofilms). The accuracies of both the Bradford assay and a modified Lowry microplate method were compared in factorial combination. Protein was quantified in soil-extracts (extracted with citrate), including standard additions of model protein (BSA) and polyphenol (Sigma H 1675 - 2). Using the Lowry microplate assay described, no interfering effects of citrate were detected even with concentrations up to 5 times greater than are typically used to extract soil protein. Moreover, the Bradford assay {{was found to be}} highly susceptible to two simultaneous and confounding artefacts: 1) the colour development due to added protein was greatly inhibited by polyphenol concentration, and 2) substantial colour development was caused directly by the polyphenol addition. In contrast, the Lowry method enabled distinction between colour development from protein and non-protein origin, providing a more accurate quantitative analysis. These results suggest that the modified-Lowry method is a more suitable measure of extract protein (defined by standard equivalents) because it is less confounded by the high polyphenolic content which is so typical of soil extracts...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} whether neoglycoproteins can potentially act as carriers for targeting of antiviral drugs to certain cell types in the body, various neoglycoproteins were synthesized using thiophosgene-activated p-aminophenyl sugar derivatives. These neoglycoproteins were conjugated with the 5 '-monophosphate form of the antiviral drug AZT. For a proper characterization of these preparations, both protein and drug content have to be determined. Comparison of the Lowry and the Bio-Rad protein assays revealed that for both the neoglycoprotein carriers themselves and the AZTMP conjugates, the <b>Lowry</b> <b>assay</b> yielded the most reliable and reproducible results. It was demonstrated that both the reagent used for drug conjugation (ECDI) {{as well as the}} introduction of phenyl-sugar groups in the protein interfered with the analysis of bound nucleotide as based on spectral differences between protein and protein-drug conjugate. Therefore, we developed a rapid HPLC system for determination of the drug-protein coupling ratio through acid hydrolysis of the covalently bound nucleotide. With the ECDI-mediated conjugation of 5 '-monophosphate drug derivatives to neoglycoproteins, products with molar ratios of drug to protein ranging from 1. 2 to 5. 6 were obtained. The drug-neoglycoprotein conjugates appeared to be fairly stable during storage, in lyophilized form, at - 20 degrees C. The anti-HIV- 1 activity of the neoglycoprotein-drug conjugates, as determined in vitro in MT- 4 cells, was shown to be dependent on glycosylation of the albumin and also on the kind of sugar present in the neoglycoprotein.

We compared different protein assays (Bicinchoninic acid (BCA), Lowry and Bradford) against the ‘gold standard’ amino-acid assay in urine from 43 women (8 non-pregnant, 34 pregnant, including 8 with pre-eclampsia. BCA assay was superior to both <b>Lowry</b> and Bradford <b>assays</b> (Bland Altman bias: 0. 08) compared to amino-acid assay, which performed particularly poorly at higher protein concentrations. These data highlight the need to use amino-acid or BCA assays for unprocessed urine protein estimation...|$|R
