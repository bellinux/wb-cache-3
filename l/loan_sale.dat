40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relation between}} securitization and loan performance using a comprehensive dataset from a major national mortgage lender.

Moreover, the performance gap between sold and retained loans was wider among the subsample of loans that were perceived as easier to resell. The investors’seeming advantage over the originating bank can mostly be explained by information revealed during the time between loan origination and sale. (JEL G 21, D 12) Traditional banks used to be lenders that held loans until they matured or were paid off. These loans were funded by direct obligations of the bank, principally by deposits and sometimes by debt.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the information {{content of the}} announcement of the sale of a borrower’s loan by its bank. A large body of research has documented the positive impact on a firm’s stock price around the announcement of formation and renewal of bank lending relationships. In light of these findings it would seem natural that when a bank chooses to sell off its loans, the stock returns of the borrower would be adversely affected. Our paper is the first study to test this hypothesis. We find that the stock returns of these borrowers are significantly negatively impacted on average for the period surrounding the announcement of a <b>loan</b> <b>sale.</b> The post-loan sale period is also marked by a large incidence of bankruptcy filings by the borrowers whose loans are sold. Overall, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the news of a bank <b>loan</b> <b>sale</b> has a negative certification impact, which is validated by the subsequent performance of the firm whose loan is sold. We conduct similar event study tests for those banks that engage in loan sales and find that the stock returns of the selling banks are not significantly impacted on average. Cross-sectional tests reveal that loan sales were made by banks that emphasized trading income and had relatively large Commercial and Industrial loan portfolios. For our sample period, a bank’s capital adequacy position did not appear to have a material effect on a bank’s decision to sell its loans. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{a variety of}} {{financial}} tools {{have been developed for}} transferring credit risk between financial institutions. Credit risk is defined as the risk that the value of a corporate loan (or debt obligation more generally) will decline due to a change in the borrower’s ability to make payments, whether that change is an actual default or a change in the probability of default. Credit risk transfer (CRT) mechanisms range from outright selling of loans to credit derivatives that permit shifting credit risk without necessarily referencing specific loans.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{difference}} between <b>loan</b> <b>sales</b> and credit default swaps. After making a loan, a bank finds out if the loan needs contract enforcement (“monitoring”) and if the bank should lay off the risk so as to release regulatory capital. A bank can lay off credit risk by either selling the loan or by buying insurance through a credit default swap (CDS). With a CDS, the originating bank retains the loan’s control rights but no longer has incentive to monitor; with <b>loan</b> <b>sales,</b> control rights pass to the buyer of the loan, who can then monitor, albeit in a less-informed manner. For high levels of credit risk, only <b>loan</b> <b>sales</b> are used in equilibrium; risk transfer is efficient, but monitoring is excessive. For low levels of credit risk, CDS and <b>loan</b> <b>sales</b> may coexist, in which case risk transfer is efficient {{but there is no}} monitoring; in another equilibrium, only poor quality loans are sold, so risk transfer is inefficient while monitoring is optimal. In a two period setting, a reputational equilibrium may be possible if credit risk is low, but not too low. In the first period, the bank uses CDS and efficient monitoring and risk transfer are achieved. In the second period, however, first period defaults are “punished ” as noisy signals of shirked monitoring, with no use of CDS, inefficient risk transfer, and monitoring of sold loans.

40|$|Banks are {{increasingly}} using secondary <b>loan</b> <b>sales</b> to manage credit risk and diversify their portfolios. However, <b>loan</b> <b>sales</b> fundamentally alter the lending process by separating loan origination from servicing and funding. How do banks reduce agency problems {{that arise from}} selling loans? How do <b>loan</b> <b>sales</b> affect lending relationships and borrower’s access to loans? Our analysis suggests that sold loans are structured to reduce buyer-seller agency problems. Sold loans contain additional, more restrictive covenants, particularly when agency problems between buyers and sellers {{are likely to be}} more severe, such as when low reputation lenders originate the loan. When loans are sold, borrowers benefit from increased access to private debt capital, both in the present and in the future. This potentially balances the costs of more restrictive covenants and borrowing from additional lenders. Contrary to concerns that that loan selling negatively impacts lending relationships, borrowers whose loans are sold are more likely to retain their lending relationships.
