5|$|Predators {{are mainly}} {{free-living}} species that directly consume {{a large number}} of prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (Coleomegilla maculata) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a <b>lady</b> <b>beetle,</b> was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
25|$|In North America, {{eggs and}} first-instar larvae of the monarch are eaten by larvae and adults of the {{introduced}} Asian <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (Harmonia axyridis). The Chinese mantis (Tenodera sinensis) will consume the larvae once the gut is removed thus avoiding cardenolides. Wasps commonly consume larvae.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lady</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are some}} of the most {{noticeable}} and popular insects found in the garden and on the farm. This publication will help the farmer, gardener, or amateur naturalist to better understand and identify <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> found in Nebraska. <b>Lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are in the family Caccinellidae, of which nearly all members are predators.

40|$|Adults of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> in {{the tribe}} Scymnini {{imported}} for biological control of hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand, in eastern North America {{can be readily}} distinguished from native <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coccinellidae). The imported <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are in the genera Pseudoscymnus and Scymnus (Neopullus), {{both of which are}} Palearctic. These taxons have characteristics {{that can be used to}} separate them from Nearctic <b>lady</b> <b>beetles.</b> The most useful morphological feature is that the number of antennal segments is less than 11; ten-segmented in Scymnus (Neopullus) and ninesegmented in Pseudoscymnus. Elytral patterns and coloration also can be useful in field recognition. Larvae of the imported <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are all in the tribe Scymnini, which can be distinguished from <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> in other tribes. A characteristic of the Scymnini is the wax covering of the last two larval instars and, for most species, the body lacks pronounced spines and is neither black or heavily sclerotized. Identification of a Scymnini larva to the genus level requires careful microscopic examination. Pseudoscymnus tsugae larval antennae have been described as onesegmented, but our examination indicates that they are two-segmented. Scymnus (Neopullus) larvae have three-segmented antennae.

25|$|Some insects {{present in}} the grapes at harvest inevitably {{end up in the}} press {{and for the most part}} are inoffensive. Others, notably types of ladybirds, or the multicoloured Asian <b>lady</b> <b>beetle,</b> release {{unpleasant}} volatile compounds as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's bouquet and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compounds are methoxypyrazines, or pyrazines, that are perceived as rancid peanut butter, bitter herb, green bell pepper, or cat urine. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so ladybird taint has been known to make Rieslings taste like Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
25|$|Amongst the invertebrates, typical insects of the Moist Mixed Grassland {{ecoregion}} are monarch (Danaus plexippus), mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus), rose curculi, yellow jacket wasp (Vespula pennsylvanica), sow bug (Malacostraca isopoda), bumblebee (Bombus ternarius), blue-winged olive (Ephemerella cornuta), {{daddy longlegs}} (Opiliones), dragonfly, grasshopper (Melanoplus differentialis), harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex), and two-spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (Adalia bipunctata). Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans {{during the growing}} season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), spruce gall adelgid (Adelges cooleyi), pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius). Freshwater invertebrates of Saskatchewan typically consist of clams (Pelycypoda) (Mollusca Bivalvia), mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), leech (Hirudinea), freshwater earthworm Oligochaeta, virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Scud (Amphipoda), fairy shrimp (Anostraca), Copepod, water flea (Cladocera), clam shrimp (Conchostraca), water mite (Hydrachnida) caddisfly (Trichoptera), damselfly (Zygoptera), mayfly (Ephemeroptera), alderfly (Megaloptera), seed shrimp (Ostracod), and tadpole shrimp (Notostraca).|$|E
2500|$|Most accidentally or {{intentionally}} {{introduced species}} {{do not become}} invasive as the ones [...] mentioned above. For instance Some 179 coccinellid species have been introduced to the U.S. and Canada; about 27 of these non-native species have become established, and only a handful can be considered invasive, including the intentionally introduced Harmonia axyridis, multicolored Asian <b>lady</b> <b>beetle.</b> However the small percentage of introduced species that become invasive can produce profound ecological changes. In North America Harmonia axyridis {{has become the most}} abundant <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> and probably accounts for more observations than all the native lady beetles put together.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{a popular}} {{biocontrol}} method for aphids in home gardens and landscapes. Many gardeners purchase these insects at nurseries, garden centers, and online. This publication {{will discuss the}} drawbacks to using purchased <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> and suggest some alternatives for attracting and retaining local species...|$|R
25|$|Aphids {{may also}} be {{controlled}} by the release of natural enemies, in particular <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> and parasitic wasps. However, since adult <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> tend to fly away within 48 hours after release, without laying eggs, repeated application {{of large numbers of}} <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are needed to be effective. For example, one large, heavily infested rose bush may take two applications of 1500 beetles each. In reality, therefore, the only cost effective situation in which mass release of natural enemies makes sense is in closed or semi-closed environments such as glasshouses or polytunnels.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{signals are}} {{involved}} in the courtship behavior of many invertebrate and vertebrate species. <b>Lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are no exception to this rule; a significant number of published reports highlight the role of cuticular chemicals involved in the reproduction of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles,</b> including gender recognition. Recent data have also demonstrated the presence of a volatile female sex pheromone that facilitates male attraction in some species. Here, we present a synthetic overview of the current knowledge about the sexual behavior of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> and associated chemicals for which the function and identification have been provided. Because <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are often reared as biological control agents, the chemical cues involved in their sexual behavior could be used as components in integrated management approaches against soft-bodied hemipterans. In conclusion, this review provides new perspectives and potential developments for sustainable insect management mainly based on the semiochemicals involved in the sexual behavior of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles.</b> A better understanding of these chemical signals would help maximize their presence in areas where their predatory behavior is requested, {{as a result of the}} application of formulations inducing behavioral manipulation.

2500|$|The name coccinellids {{is derived}} from the Latin word coccineus meaning [...] "scarlet". The name [...] "ladybird" [...] {{originated}} in Britain where the insects became known as [...] "Our Lady's bird" [...] or the <b>Lady</b> <b>beetle.</b> Mary (Our Lady) was often depicted wearing a red cloak in early paintings, and the spots of the seven-spot ladybird (the most common in Europe) were said to symbolise her seven joys and seven sorrows. In the United States, the name was adapted to [...] "ladybug". Common names in other European languages have the same association, for example, the German name Marienkäfer translates to Marybeetle.|$|E
2500|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} {{have formed a}} relationship with an invasive mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis. Colony growth is known to increase if ants have access to resources produced by P. solenopsis, and the population density of these mealybugs is significantly higher in areas where red imported fire ants are present (the spread of P. solenopsis in areas it is not native is attributed {{to the presence of}} the ants). As well as that, the life expectancy and reproductive rate of P. solenopsis both increase. These mealybugs may even be transported by workers back to their nest. Predation of P. solenopsis decreases due to tending workers interfering with the predation and parasitism by natural enemies. Mealybugs are preyed on by the <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (Menochilus sexmaculatus) and are hosts of two parasites (Aenasius bambawalei and Acerophagus coccois) if there are no ants present, but this is different if ants are present. Lady beetles are less frequently seen on plants with red imported fire ants, and the rate of [...] "mummy" [...] nymphs is significantly lower. This is clearly evident as scientists observed that cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) populations, and the predation of sentinel bollworm eggs, increased in areas with red imported fire ant presence. Red imported fire ants have developed a mutual relationship with another mealybug (Dysmicoccus morrisoni). The ants promote the colony growth of D. morrisoni through protection, covering the colonies up with debris and collecting the honeydew they secrete.|$|E
