5|$|<b>Lethal</b> {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of <b>lethal</b> injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, <b>lethal</b> injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of <b>lethal</b> injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness.

40|$|After fertilization, the {{development}} of a zygote depends upon both gene products synthesized by its maternal parent and gene products synthesized by the zygote itself. To analyze genetically the relative contributions of these two sources of gene products, several laboratories have been isolating two classes of mutants of Drosophila melanogaster: maternal-effect <b>lethals</b> and zygotic <b>lethals.</b> This report concerns the analysis of two temperature-sensitive mutants, OX 736 hs and PC 025 hs, which were isolated as alleles of a small-disc mutant, l(3) 1902. These alleles are not only zygotic <b>lethals,</b> but also maternal-effect <b>lethals.</b> They have temperature-sensitive periods during larval life and during oogenesis. Mutant larvae exposed continuously to restrictive temperature have small discs. One- or two-day exposures to the restrictive temperature administered during the third larval instar lead to a homeotic transformation of the midlegs and hindlegs to the pattern characteristic of the forelegs. Mutant females exposed to the restrictive temperature during oogenesis produce eggs that can develop until gastrulation, but do not hatch. —The existence of these mutants, and one that was recently described by another group, implies {{that there may be a}} class of genes, heretofore unrecognized, whose products are synthesized during oogenesis, are essential for embryogenesis and are also synthesized during larval stages within imaginal disc cells...|$|R

It appeared from the breeding behavior that the gene for rubricalyx bud color must be completely linked to the <b>lethals</b> of Oe. Lamarckiana in certain plants of similar parentage to others in which the gene was independent of the <b>lethals.</b> At the time this seemed an anomalous situation. The crosses between Oe. Lamarckiana and Oe. rubricalyx have been repeated and a check has been kept on the chromosome configurations of the various hybrids {{in an attempt to}} determine the cause of the differences in the linkage relationships...|$|R

5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay <b>Lethal</b> and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if <b>Lethal</b> and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with a weight limit, while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused <b>Lethal</b> to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; <b>Lethal</b> followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. <b>Lethal</b> then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, <b>Lethal</b> won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a weight limit in the company.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match to}} {{take place on the}} event's card was the Six Man Tag Team Tables match pitting the team of Johnny Devine and Team 3D against the team of Jay <b>Lethal</b> and MCMG. The match lasted {{fourteen}} minutes and fifty-nine seconds. The objective of a Six Man Tag Team Tables match is to drive {{one of the members of}} the opposing team through a table. During the contest, <b>Lethal</b> drove Devine through a table with a driving elbow drop. However, as the referee was scripted to appear unconscious, this allowed Team 3D to knockout MCMG and <b>Lethal</b> with the X Division Championship belt. They followed by draping Devine over <b>Lethal,</b> making it appear as though Devine had drove <b>Lethal</b> through the table, thus winning the match for his team.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-one temperature-sensitive (ts) {{sex-linked}} <b>lethals</b> were screened {{by means of}} X-ray-induced somatic crossing over to determine if any were ts cell-lethal mutants. Cell-lethal mutations were identified by their ability to block the development of homozygous clones when raised under restrictive conditions (29 °). Twenty-two ts cell-lethal mutants were isolated and categorized into three classes, depending upon the patterns of damage observed in larval and imaginal tissues. The phenotypes produced by these mutations ranged from those which affected only a limited set of structures (i. e., genital discs only) to those which affected diverse tissues at all stages of the life cycle. Each mutation has its own characteristic time-dependent pattern, frequency, and type of damage. All the mutations affect imaginal tissue, but only one-third of the mutations affect both larval and imaginal tissue. The fastest-acting <b>lethals</b> need 15 hours at the restrictive temperature to kill the cells and the slowest-acting <b>lethals</b> require at least 48 hours. By choosing the appropriate mutant and by manipulating the times {{of exposure to the}} restrictive temperature, it has proven possible to produce duplications and deficiencies in specific structures of the adult. A mechanism by which lethality might yield such structures is suggested. In addition, 15 of the mutants are ts female sterile mutants.
