50|$|The oiling system {{addresses}} {{the need to}} properly lubricate an engine when it’s running. Properly lubricating an engine not only reduces friction between moving parts but is also the main method by which heat is removed from pistons, bearings, and shafts. Failing to properly lubricate an engine will result in engine failure. The oil pump forces the motor oil through the passages in the engine to properly distribute oil to different engine components. In a common oiling system, oil is drawn out of the oil sump (oil pan, in US English) through a wire mesh strainer that removes {{some of the larger}} pieces of debris from the oil. The flow made by the oil pump allows the oil to be distributed around the engine. In this system, oil flows through an oil filter and sometimes an oil cooler, before going through the engine’s oil passages and being dispersed to <b>lubricate</b> pistons, <b>rings,</b> springs, valve stems, and more.|$|R
40|$|Parametric {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with a 35 millimeter bore, {{angular contact ball bearing}} having a single outer land guided cage. Lubrication was achieved by flowing oil through axial grooves and radial holes machined in the inner ring of the bearing. Test conditions were a thrust load of 667 N (150 lb), shaft speeds from 48, 000 to 72, 000 rpm, and an oil inlet temperature of 394 K (250 F). Data from tests where the distribution of the total oil supplied to the inner ring was 50 percent for bearing lubrication and 50 percent for bearing inner ring cooling were compared with those where the distribution pattern was 25 percent lubrication and 75 percent cooling. Successful operation was experienced with both the 50 - 50 and 25 - 75 percent flow distribution patterns to 2. 5 million DN. The 50 - 50 percent flow pattern provided the cooler bearing operation of the two inner <b>ring</b> <b>lubricated</b> bearings. The jet lubricated bearing had lower outer ring and higher inner ring temperatures than the inner <b>ring</b> <b>lubricated</b> bearings. Maximum power loss of 2. 8 kW (3. 7 hp) was experienced with the 25 - 75 percent flow distribution, and maximum percent cage slip of 7. 0 occurred at 72, 300 rpm with the 50 - 50 percent flow distribution...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{enhanced}} and cost-effective performance of engineering components, Surface Engineering embraces traditional and innovative surface technologies which modify the surface properties of metallic and non-metallic engineering components for specific and sometime unique engineering purposes. The surface roughness of an engineered surface may be classified as: the random surface roughness which {{is a product of}} surface finishing and the deterministic surface roughness which is engineered to increase the lubrication characteristics of the hydro dynamically <b>lubricated</b> thrust <b>ring.</b> The effect of stochastic/random roughness can not be ignored when the roughness is of the same amplitude as that of fluid film thickness. Average flow model derived in terms of flow factors which are functions of the roughness characteristics is used to study the random surface roughness effects on hydrodynamic lubrication of deterministic asperity. In addition, the effect of boundary conditions on flow factors is studied by calculating the pressure and shear flow factor using two different new boundary conditions. The results are obtained for random surface roughness having a Gaussian distribution of roughness heights...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Analyses for incompressible and compressible spiral groove thrust bearings (SGTBS) and face seals (SGFSS) are presented. A successive approximation linearizes the partial differential equation of pressure that arises in the compressible fluid analysis. The zeroth-and first-order equations giving the static and dynamic performance of SGFSS, respectively, are solved using the finite element method for both the incompressible and compressible fluid cases. Favorable comparisons with the Narrow Groove Theory (NG 7 -) and a Finite Element Method (FEM analysis validate the incompressible fluid case for SGTBs without inward radial flow. A parametric study indicates effects of changing face seal geometry on the opening force, force coefficients, leakage rate, and power loss and gives the optimum SGFS geometry. Validation of the isothermal compressible fluid model occurs by comparison of the static and dynamic SGTB and SGFS behavior with previous NGT analyses. The optimum compressible fluid SGFS geometry follows from a parametric study, indicating the advantages of using grooved face seals with seal dams over traditional mechanical face seals and oil <b>lubricated</b> seal <b>rings...</b>|$|R

Introduction: The {{generator}} tested for characteristic action under different load conditions {{is of the}} revolving field, separately excited, stationary armature type. The above drawing shows the principal points {{in the construction of}} the machine. On the left is the main pulley which is run by the main drive belt; on the right is a smaller one from which a small direct current generator is run for exciting the alternator field. The shaft is <b>lubricated</b> by <b>rings</b> which dip into an oil reservoir. The revolving field receives its exciting current from the exciter through two slip rings. The field spider and pole faces are of laminated steel that in the pole faces is japanned and that in the spider is not. These laminations are held together by bolts as shown in drawing. The armature ring is built of japanned laminations which are held together by bolts and clamps. If the laminations should for any reason become loose and cause a disagreeable humming they may readily be tightened. There are six field coils which are wound as shown; all coils are in series each adjacent one being wound opposite and the terminals brought to the slip rings. One brush on the ring is shown; there are two brushes on each ring. The scheme of an armature slot is shown on drawing and is the construction most commonly employed by modern dynamo builder...|$|R

Introduction: 2 HP Three Phase Induction Motor, No. 83362, Type 1, Form K. 1800 R. P. M., 110 Volts, 60 Cycles, 12 amperes. The primary or rotor {{of the motor}} is mounted in a hollow {{cylindrical}} frame of cast iron. This frame also forms {{the base of the}} machine and supports two end plates which contain the rotor bearings. The bearings consist of brass boxes arranged to be <b>lubricated</b> by two <b>rings</b> in each bearing. These rings revolve as the shaft turns carrying the oil from a chamber below the bearings. The primary consists of an iron core which is built up of sheet steel stampings. The core is firmly bolted to the frame. The conductors, which are copper wires or bars, depending upon the size of the machine, are placed in grooves in the core. These coils are insulated from the core and from each other where more than one conductor is placed in a slot. The windings, which are (y) connected, are held in the slots by thin wedges of tough wood, to protect the winding from mechanical injury, and also from the mechanical pull due to the reaction of the flux in the rotor. The secondary member or rotor is built up of laminated sheet steel. The laminae are insulated from each other by sheets of tissue paper or by a coating of japan, {{in order to reduce the}} loss by eddy currents which are induced by the flux. The conductors in this member are heavy copper bars which are short circuited at the ends of the rotor by heavy copper plates...|$|R

In this work, the mechanics and the tribologyof the power cylinder unit and more specifically the operation of thetwin land oil control ring (TLOCR) is investigated. In heavy duty dieselengines (HDDE), TLOCR are typically used. The TLOCR plays a veryimportant role in the engine since it is supposed to distribute the correctamount of oil on the liner to <b>lubricate</b> the other <b>rings.</b> It is importantthat the TLOCR does not leave too much oil on the liner for the twotop rings since it could lead too high oil consumption. In a HDDE thepiston assembly is the largest contributor to frictional losses where thepiston ring pack accounts for the major part of this. The oil control ringhas the largest contribution to frictional losses in the piston ring packtherefore making it very interesting to study from a fuel consumptionperspective. The objective of this thesis is to develop a simulation toolthat can be used to quantify design changes to the TLOCR. Such as thedimensions of the ring itself but also ring tension, running land profileand out of roundness of the cylinder liner. The model developed in this work accounts for the tribological interfaceof the TLOCR against the cylinder liner and piston ring groove aswell as the elastic deformation of the ring and the ring dynamics withinthe piston ring groove. The actual ring cross section is modelled in orderto account for the full three dimensional elastic deformation of the ring. By solving all of these problems as a coupled system it is believed thatthe entire operation of the oil control ring could be understood in a betterway than earlier and open up new optimisation possibilities for theTLOCR. The full ring is modelled in order to account for out of roundcylinder liners. Since the cylinder liner in an engine will always havesome deviation from perfectly round this is important. The model cantherefore be used to investigate the effect on oil distribution by reducedring tension which will affect the frictional losses of the system.

There {{is a need to}} develop and usetools to investigate and predict the result of specific design changesmade on the components. In this work, the mechanics and the tribologyof the power cylinder unit and more specifically the operation of thepiston rings was investigated both numerically and experimentally. Theobjectives of the numerical part of this thesis were to develop simulationtools {{that can be used to}} quantify design changes to the TLOCR andthe cylinder liner. Such as the dimensions of the ring itself but also ringtension, running land profile, out of roundness of the cylinder liner andsurface texture of dimple type applied on the cylinder liner. Numericalsimulation models were developed and used to investigate operation of atwin land oil control ring (TLOCR). TLOCR are typically used in heavyduty diesel engines (HDDE). The TLOCR plays a very important role inthe engine since it is supposed to distribute the correct amount of oil onthe liner to <b>lubricate</b> the other <b>rings.</b> It is important that the TLOCRdoes not leave too much oil on the liner for the two top rings since itcould lead too high oil consumption. In a HDDE the piston assemblyis the largest contributor to frictional losses where the piston ring packaccounts for the major part of this. The oil control ring is the largestcontributor to frictional losses in the piston ring pack therefore makingit very interesting to study from a fuel consumption perspective. One ofthe models developed in this work accounts for the tribological interfaceof the TLOCR against the cylinder liner and piston ring groove as wellas the elastic deformation of the ring and the ring dynamics within thepiston ring groove. The actual ring cross section was modelled in orderto account for the full three dimensional elastic deformation of the ring. By solving all of these problems as a coupled system, the entire operation of the oil control ring can be understood in a better way than earlierand this opens up new optimisation possibilities for the TLOCR. Sincethe cylinder liner in an engine will always have some deviation fromperfectly round this is important. The full ring is modelled in order toaccount for out of round cylinder liners. The model can therefore beused to investigate the effect on oil distribution by reduced ring tensionwhich will affect the frictional losses of the system. It was found that thereduction in tangential force on the TLOCR with kept sealing capability,enabled by reduced out-of-roundness, could result in friction reductionof 40 % at mid-stroke. Because of the complexity, a multi-physics model of this type introducesdifficulties with convergence. Especially when implementinga mass conserving cavitation model and solving for the reversal of thepiston ring. Implementation and numerical verification of a mass conservingcavitation model was therefore performed. A method for dealingwith the convergence problem close to reversal was implemented and discussed. A model considering texture, of dimple type, on the cylinder linerwas also developed to find dimple dimensions optimal for reduced fuelconsumption. Since the dimples are modelled in a deterministic manner,only a periodic section of one land of the TLOCR was considered. Themodel takes mixed lubrication and inertia of the ring into considerationand a mass conserving cavitation algorithm were implemented. Theresults from the model predict friction {{reduction of}} approximately 40 %at mid-stroke speeds. The objective of the experimental part of this thesis is to developa novel test method for evaluation of piston ring friction at realisticspeeds. The test-rig was designed and constructed during the first halfof the project. The rig was designed so that standard HDDE productionpiston rings and cylinder liners could be easily mounted, and so thatpiston ring friction could be measured without influence from pistonfriction. Both cylinder liner and oil tank were equipped with heaters,where the oil supply resembles that in an actual engine. Repeatabilityof the results was found to be good. Influence on friction by differentcylinder liner surface roughness and coatings were investigated. Variouspiston ring designs, ring tension and coatings were also investigated. Itwas found that friction of the TLOCR could be reduced with close to 50 % with kept sealing capability by reduced ring tension and differentgeometry on the lands in contact with the cylinder liner. The numerical simulation model governing the full cross section of the TLOCR wasvalidated against measured piston ring friction data at a number ofdifferent speeds and excellent correlation was found...|$|R
