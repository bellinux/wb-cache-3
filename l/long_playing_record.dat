500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1991, Sub Pop {{gave the}} group $1000 to record the July 1992 entry in the labels singles club series. The group entered James Kavoussi's Toxic Shock Studios on Broadway in New York with Frigid Stars LP {{producer}} Mike McMacklin to record early versions of [...] "Realize", [...] "Jr", and a cover of the MX-80 song [...] "Promise of Love". The tracks were not successful with only [...] "Promise of Love" [...] being usable. Engle noted that Codeine desired the song to be loud {{on both sides of}} the single, but could not get the song [...] "Jr" [...] to come together. The group had already gone through most of their budget for recording, which led to the group going to an eight-track studio in the Boston suburb of Allston. Immerwahr went into the studio where the group were able to complete a version of the song [...] "Realize". The group met up again to work in early 1992 towards their second LP (<b>Long</b> <b>playing</b> <b>record)</b> The White Birch, with recording commencing in June at Harold Dessau Recording at 25 Murray Street in Manhattan. At the studio, the group attempted to record versions of [...] "Realize", [...] "Jr", [...] "Tom", [...] "Wird" [...] "Smoking Room", [...] "Barely Real", [...] "Something New" [...] and [...] "Sea" [...] within a months time. Immerwahr was not content with the tracks, noting several issues such as: his own vocals, his desire to record music with even slower tempos, and the presence of high pitched noises in the songs that no one else could hear. On attempting to fix a broken toilet at the studio, Immerwahr accidentally flooded the clothing store below the studio.|$|E
