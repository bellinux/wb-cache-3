2500|$|... "But one Persian, a young man, {{riding up}} {{very close to}} the Roman army, began to {{challenge}} all of them, calling for whoever wished to do battle with him. And no one of the whole army dared face the danger, except a certain Andreas, one of the personal attendants of Bouzes, not a soldier nor one who had ever practised at all the business of war, but a trainer of youths in charge of a certain wrestling school in Byzantium. Through this it came about that he was following the army, for he cared for the person of Bouzes in the bath; his birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the courage, without being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of his own accord to meet the man in single combat. And he caught the barbarian while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his spear on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a sacrificial animal as he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> and a mighty shout was raised both from the city wall and from the Roman army." ...|$|E

Now, I see movies where the dead get up and walk. And when they do that, rarely do good things happen." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{following}} year, they {{recorded for}} Modern Records, and in 1948 for the Specialty and Supreme labels. However, Wynn's records were not commercially successful, {{and he began}} working as a sideman in T-Bone Walker's band, mainly playing the baritone saxophone. By the late 1940s, Wynn had developed an innovative performance style, involving dancing, stomping, and playing the saxophone while <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> One reviewer said: [...] "He would kick, dance, shuffle, strut, go down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees, roll and literally provide <b>his</b> own mini-show <b>on</b> stage, all the while blowing wild solos <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sax. He {{was the first of}} the Los Angeles area sax players to perform these antics on stage...". [...] Wynn himself said: [...] "Jay McNeely was a little kid when he used to come in and watch me play at weekends. Two or three years later he was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> and playing. He's a great musician but he got the clowning from me." ...|$|R

60|$|He <b>lay</b> down, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>on</b> my table, {{and with}} that action of his head threw up his beard at the chin.|$|R

60|$|He <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> {{breathing}} {{with great}} difficulty. Do what he would, and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a film {{came over the}} placid look at the white ceiling.|$|E
60|$|Dennin's {{hands were}} {{released}} {{long enough for}} him to sign the document. Then a silence fell in the room. Hans was restless, and Edith felt uncomfortable. Dennin <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> staring straight up at the moss- chinked roof.|$|E
6000|$|Both the brothers' brows clouded at once. Amyas, as he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the pebbles, {{said quietly}} to the gulls over his head--"I {{wonder what the}} Frenchman whose head I cut off at the Azores, thinks by now about all that." ...|$|E

60|$|Hare saw the inert {{forms of}} two men lying near the gate; one rested on his face, arm outstretched with a Colt gripped in the stiff hand; the other <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> his spurs deep in the ground, as if driven there in his last convulsion.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Parsons {{went up to}} her son, by whom sat the Colonel, {{looking at}} him wistfully.

60|$|The wayfarer smoked {{his pipe}} out, {{put it in}} his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, and <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the heap of stones. He was fast asleep directly.|$|R

60|$|When Pawnee Brown {{managed to}} climb {{down to the}} Indian's side, to make certain the wily redskin was not shamming, he found Yellow Elk stone dead, his neck having been {{completely}} broken by his fall.

60|$|Instantly, {{with the}} leap of a panther, Graddy was upon him {{with both hands}} {{grasping}} tightly at his throat. Down, down, he pressed him, until Gaff <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> with his head over the gunwale. His strength now availed him nothing, for unnatural energy nerved the madman's arm.|$|E
60|$|Some of them {{rushed into}} the street.

5|$|The third {{match was}} between Monty Brown and Jeff Hardy to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

Hardy then {{climbed to the top}} rope and jumped off with a somersault toward Brown, who was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> in the ring, to attempt his signature Swanton Bomb maneuver. Once Hardy jumped, Brown moved {{out of the way and}} then performed his signature Pounce maneuver by crashing into Hardy.
