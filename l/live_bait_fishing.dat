2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, bass fishing had been well {{established}} as a sport with its own following.

50|$|In August 2006, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation {{confirmed}} that the lake was the first outside the contiguous Great Lakes waterways to be stricken with a new strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), an infectious fish disease responsible for mass die-offs of many species, but not linked to any human health concerns. The disease is spread between waterways through <b>live</b> or frozen <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> roe, contaminated fishing equipment or live water wells in boats.|$|R
50|$|The reels {{used for}} the tackle are usually high-capacity, {{open-face}} bait casting reels. When kite fishing you want your bait still alive so it can move along the surface and make splashes. As bait, many kite fishermen use a fish called a goggle-eye as <b>live</b> <b>bait.</b> The problem with these fish {{is that they are}} nocturnal and are caught off of the reef at night so they are hard to catch yourself but can be bought. More commonly used are Threadfin Herring, Spanish Sardines, Cigar Minnows, Pilchards, and Blue runners. Circle hooks are becoming very popular because they do very little damage to large <b>fish.</b> To <b>live</b> <b>bait</b> a <b>fish</b> you must run a wire with a hook on one end and a loop on the other and run it up the bait’s back until it sticks out right before the dorsal fin. Then take the leader with a hook attached to that and put it through the loop on the wire and attach it and hook it through the fishes nose. This way the fish can still swim freely. With four to six <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> skimming along the surface your boat is almost guaranteed to get a hook up.|$|R
40|$|Several {{species of}} marine {{invertebrates}} are imported into California {{for use as}} <b>live</b> <b>bait</b> in recreational <b>fishing.</b> I investigated the marine <b>live</b> <b>bait</b> trade in California as a potential introduction pathway for non-indigenous species (NIS). I estimated that ~ 1, 900, 000 ghost shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis), ~ 575, 000 bloodworms (Glycera dibranchiata), ~ 600, 000 pileworms Nereis virens), and ~ 1, 100, 000 lugworms (Perinereis sp.), and are imported annually into California {{from different parts of}} the world. Hitchhiker species and parasites are also commonly observed in <b>live</b> <b>bait</b> shipments along with target species. The bopyrid isopod Ione cornuta, a parasitic castrator, infected imported ghost shrimp at a high prevalence (14 %). The short-term survival of three of these <b>live</b> <b>bait</b> NIS is not restricted by thermal conditions typically found in southern California.

The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and can push 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as <b>live</b> <b>bait</b> for larger <b>fish,</b> including billfish, cobia and amberjack. It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their flesh, with several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|R
5000|$|Veneration of Njörðr survived into 18th or 19th century Norwegian folk practice, as {{recorded}} in a tale collected by Halldar O. Opedal from an informant in Odda, Hordaland, Norway.

5000|$|Big Game fishing {{has evolved}} from a heavy tackle to a light tackle sport in many regions. Using a fishing kite has {{opened the door to}} fishing for Billfish, {{especially}} Sailfish with tackle as light as 8 or 12 lb but normally 20 - 30 lb gear is used. The kite is also effective on Tuna, Dolphin fish (Mahi Mahi), Sharks, Marlin, Swordfish & all sorts of other Big Game fish. The idea behind the kite is that a smaller <b>live</b> <b>bait</b> can be <b>fished</b> on lighter tackle and positioned away from the boat and placed right on the surface. The <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> will try to run away or fight to get deeper in the water column, but the kite will hold the bait in place. The fighting action and stress of the bait will [...] "turn on" [...] big game fish and cause them to strike. This method of fishing not only presents a bait to the Big Game Fish but drives the fish to strike the bait.|$|R
50|$|The Michigan DNR {{announced}} on May 17, 2007 that Budd {{became the first}} inland lake {{in the state of}} Michigan confirmed to be infected by viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). The DNR analyzed fish specimens after a very large die-off that began on April 30, 2007 of muskies, bluegills, and black crappie. VHS is an infectious virus-spread fish disease responsible for mass die-offs of many species, but not linked to any human health concerns. The disease can be spread between bodies of water through <b>live</b> or frozen <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> roe, contaminated fishing equipment, live water wells in boats, and ballast water, among other ways.

50|$|Corves were {{originally}} crucial to keep captured fish fresh until {{the boat with}} the catch reached its harbor. A corf could be towed behind the boat while fishermen made the journey from the fishing grounds to the fish market. These journeys could last up to half a day. When used for storing eels in Blekinge, Sweden, the corves could be as large as 3.75 by 1.33 by 0.8 m and contain about 2 MT of eels.

5000|$|Effective {{methods for}} {{catching}} this hard-fighting <b>fish</b> include dead <b>baits,</b> <b>live</b> <b>baits,</b> and lure <b>fishing.</b> Pike {{can easily be}} damaged when handled since {{they are not as}} robust as their reputation would suggest. Colour of lure can be influenced by water clarity and weather conditions. Since pike have numerous sharp teeth it is wise to take extreme care when unhooking them. The use of a wet leather gauntlet and surgical forceps to remove hooks is highly recommended on safety grounds. If practicing catch and release fishing, care for the pike should be the pike angler's utmost concern. The formerly recommended practice of grasping a pike by its eye sockets (tragically interpreted as [...] "its eyes") resulted in countless released pike that quickly died from inability to see prey any longer.|$|R
50|$|A large die-off of bass in {{the spring}} of 2007 was later {{confirmed}} to be due to viral hemorrhagic septicema (VHS), a virus-caused fish disease that has killed millions of fish in the Great Lakes since its presence was noticed in the region in 2005. This is the second of the Finger Lakes found to be contaminated with the virus, after its presence was detected in the westernmost of the Finger Lakes, Conesus Lake, in 2006. The virus and disease are not a threat to human health, but the state of New York is working to slow its spread to other lakes. New state bait regulations were announced on June 6, 2007, aimed at curbing the spread of VHS. VHS can be spread between bodies of water through <b>live</b> or frozen <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> roe, <b>live</b> wells, and ballast water, among other ways.

30|$|Tuna tubes {{have been}} {{suggested}} as an alternative solution for the transport of live medium-sized Scombrids when smaller fishing vessels are used, either by necessity of reducing costs, or to allow better manoeuvrability while approaching the fish schools (McPherson 2004). Tuna tubes are comprised of several opaque round or oval cylinders with a funnel shaped bottom, ranging in material from plastic, to polyvinyl chloride (PVC), stainless steel, or aluminium, which are installed vertically on the fishing vessel’s deck. The funnel {{at the bottom of}} each tube is connected to a water system, which can provide pressurized water supply. Once caught, each individual fish is placed head first in a tube, and water is pumped through the fish mouth and gills, providing oxygen and removing wastes (Bass and Alworth 1998; McPherson 2004). This method is used primarily by recreational fishermen to hold medium-sized Scombrids as <b>live</b> <b>bait</b> for game <b>fish</b> such as tuna species (Thunnus spp.), billfish (Istiophoridae family) and more. Captured fish were reported to maintain a good, healthy condition for up to 12  h (White 2011; Rudow 2011).|$|R
50|$|<b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> are {{consumed}} by larger, aquatic predators. Swimming in ocean water with <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> can be dangerous, as these <b>fish</b> attract sharks. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> will sometimes use whale sharks {{as a shield}} from their other predators such as tuna, as tuna are usually wary of approaching the sharks. The shark cannot attack the <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> easily, as they constantly swim above them and are too fast for the shark to manoeuvre its mouth into position. However, the sharks eventually dive deep, where the <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> cannot follow, and as the other predators finally dare attack the stranded <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> the shark comes back to eat numerous <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> who are already preoccupied with the attacking tuna.|$|R
