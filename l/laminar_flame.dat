In particular, understanding the transport and chemical reaction processes of <b>laminar</b> <b>flames</b> is a necessary precursor to understanding these processes in practical turbulent flames and many aspects of <b>laminar</b> diffusion <b>flames</b> have direct relevance to turbulent diffusion flames through application of the widely recognized laminar flamelet concept of turbulent diffusion flames. The investigation was divided into three phases, considering the shapes of nonbuoyant round <b>laminar</b> jet diffusion <b>flames</b> in still air, the shapes of nonbuoyant round <b>laminar</b> jet diffusion <b>flames</b> in coflowing air, and the hydrodynamic suppression of soot formation in <b>laminar</b> diffusion <b>flames...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Laminar</b> {{diffusion}} <b>flames</b> are {{of interest}} as model flame systems that are more tractable for analysis and experiments than practical turbulent diffusion <b>flames.</b> Certainly understanding <b>laminar</b> <b>flames</b> must precede understanding more complex turbulent <b>flames</b> while man'y <b>laminar</b> diffusion <b>flame</b> properties are directly relevant to turbulent diffusion <b>flames</b> using <b>laminar</b> flamelet concepts. <b>Laminar</b> diffusion <b>flame</b> shapes have been of interest since the classical study of Burke and Schumann because they involve a simple nonintrusive measurement that is convenient for evaluating flame structure predictions. Motivated by these observations, the shapes of <b>laminar</b> <b>flames</b> were considered during the present investigation. The present {{study was limited to}} nonbuoyant flames because most practical flames are not buoyant. Effects of buoyancy were minimized by observing flames having large flow velocities at small pressures.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of <b>laminar</b> <b>flames</b> consists of capturing {{the evolution of}} {{a very large number of}} species that may react within a broad range of time scales. It results in a highly non-linear stiff numerical problem that requires large computational resources. In the present paper, an alternative approach for the {{simulation of}} unsteady premixed flames is proposed. The approach focuses on describing the flame using a single scalar only (so-called progress variable) on relatively coarse grids. The unresolved details of the flame structure are analysed and described in term of spatial filtering. A model originally developed for large eddy simulation is discussed in the framework of unsteady <b>laminar</b> <b>flames.</b> The ability of the present approach to represent the filtered flame structure is validated against detailed numerical simulations of freely propagating <b>laminar</b> <b>flames.</b> Further, simulations of steady and unsteady <b>laminar</b> Bunsen <b>flames</b> are presented with a focus on the influence of the numerical grid and filter width upon the flame dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Soot {{processes}} within hydrocarbon-fueled flames affect particle {{emissions from}} combustion processes, thermal loads of combustor components, hazards of unwanted fires, and capabilities for computational combustion. Thus, soot processes within laminar nonpremixed (diffusion) and premixed flames are being studied, using both space-based (flight) experiments at MicroGravity (MG) and supporting ground-based experiments at Normal Gravity (NG). The study {{is limited to}} <b>laminar</b> <b>flames</b> due to their experimental and computational tractability, noting the relevance of these results to practical turbulent <b>flames</b> based on <b>laminar</b> flamelet concepts. Unfortunately, buoyancy affects soot processes in <b>laminar</b> diffusion <b>flames</b> while effects of buoyancy are small for most practical flames; therefore, present observations of <b>laminar</b> diffusion <b>flames</b> involve either particular flame conditions where effects of buoyancy are small during ground-based experiments at ng or truly nonbuoyant flames during planned flight experiments at mg. <b>Laminar</b> premixed <b>flames</b> are also being considered during ground-based experiments at ng because soot processes are easier to interpret and less affected by buoyancy in <b>laminar</b> premixed <b>flames</b> than in <b>laminar</b> diffusion <b>flames...</b>|$|R

50|$|Under {{controlled}} conditions (typically in a laboratory) a <b>laminar</b> <b>flame</b> may {{be formed}} {{in one of}} several possible flame configurations. The inner structure of a laminar premixed flame is composed of layers over which the decomposition, reaction and complete oxidation of fuel occurs. These chemical processes are much faster than the physical processes such as vortex motion in the flow and, hence, the inner structure of a <b>laminar</b> <b>flame</b> remains intact in most circumstances. The constitutive layers of the inner structure correspond to specified intervals over which the temperature increases from the specified unburned mixture up to {{as high as the}} adiabatic flame temperature (AFT). In the presence of volumetric heat transfer and/or aerodynamic stretch, or under the development intrinsic flame instabilities, the extent of reaction and, hence, the temperature attained across the flame may be different from the AFT.|$|E

It is considered a second-generation fuel surrogate designed to emulate the <b>laminar</b> <b>flame</b> speed, largely supplanting n-decane, primarily due to its higher molecular mass and lower hydrogen to carbon ratio which better reflect the n-alkane content of jet fuels.|$|E
50|$|The {{flame speed}} is the {{measured}} rate of {{expansion of the}} flame front in a combustion reaction. Whereas flame speed is generally used for a fuel, a related term is explosive velocity, {{which is the same}} relationship measured for an explosive.

40|$|In this work, we {{applied and}} {{analyzed}} a new computational code, called laminarSMOKE, for the numerical simulation of <b>laminar</b> <b>flames</b> in complex, multidimensional geometries with detailed kinetic mechanisms. The code, built {{on top of}} the open-source OpenFOAM platform, solves the usual transport equations of mass, momentum, energy, and species for reacting flows on both structured and unstructured meshes. The operator-splitting technique is adopted in order to effectively face the reacting, stiff processes associated with detailed kinetics. The proposed algorithm was used to simulate different combustion systems with different degrees of complexity under both steady-state and transient conditions. In particular, simulations of 1 D and 2 D <b>laminar</b> premixed <b>flames,</b> 2 D counter-flow diffusion flames, and coflow flames (purely diffusive and partially premixed) were successfully performed, demonstrating that the proposed tool is a robust, accurate solution method for <b>laminar</b> <b>flames.</b> In particular, the simulations of coflow, <b>laminar</b> <b>flames</b> with very detailed kinetic mechanisms (∼ 200 species) resulted in very good agreement with published experimental data. Despite its generality (i. e., the ability to manage arbitrarily complex multidimensional geometries), the laminarSMOKE code showed satisfactory scalability up to 96 processors. More importantly, as demonstrated by Tosatto et al. [Combustion Theory and Modeling 2011, 15 (4), 455 − 486], it was observed that the parallel efficiency increased with the number of species in the kinetic scheme adopted. This makes the proposed code an ideal framework for the numerical simulation of combustion systems with very detailed kinetic schemes. In contrast to most of the existing codes for the simulation of reacting systems with detailed kinetics, the laminarSMOKE code is freely distributed on the web ([URL]...|$|R

50|$|Nitromethane {{also has}} a high latent heat of vaporization, meaning that it will absorb {{substantial}} engine heat as it vaporizes, providing an invaluable cooling mechanism. The <b>laminar</b> <b>flame</b> speed and combustion temperature are higher than gasoline at 0.5 m/s and 2400 °C respectively. Power output can be increased by using very rich air fuel mixtures. This is also something that helps prevent pre-ignition, something that is usually a problem when using nitromethane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Laminar</b> <b>flame</b> {{speed is}} a {{property}} of the mixture (fuel structure, stoichiometry) and thermodynamic conditions upon mixture ignition (pressure, temperature). Turbulent flame speed {{is a function of}} the aforementioned parameters, but also heavily depends on the flow field. As flow velocity increases and turbulence is introduced, a flame will begin to wrinkle, then corrugate and eventually the flame front will be broken and transport properties will be enhanced by turbulent eddies in the flame zone. As a result, the flame front of a turbulent flame will propagate at a speed that is not only a function of the mixture's chemical and transport properties but also properties of the flow and turbulence.|$|E

Jet fuel {{is an example of a}} fuel requiring a surrogate for experimental research and numerical modelling due to its complexity and high content variability from one batch to the next. Neat hydrocarbon jet fuel surrogate components include decane, dodecane, methylcyclohexane, and toluene. Gasoline surrogate components include n-heptane and iso-octane. Hexadecane is a diesel surrogate component. Biodiesel surrogate components include methyl butyrate and methyl decanoate.|$|E

50|$|The flamelet concept {{considers}} the turbulent flame as an aggregate of thin, laminar(Re<2000), locally one-dimensional flamelet structures present within the turbulent flow field. Counterflow diffusion flame {{is a common}} <b>laminar</b> <b>flame</b> {{which is used to}} represent a flamelet in a turbulent flow. Its geometry consists of opposed and axi-symmetric fuel and oxidizer jets. As the distance between the jets is decreased and/or the velocity of the jets is increased, the flame is strained and departs from its chemical equilibrium until it eventually extinguishes. The mass fraction of species and temperature fields can be measured or calculated in laminar counterflow diffusion flame experiments. When calculated, a self-similar solution exists, and the governing equations can be simplified to only one dimension i.e. along the axis of the fuel and oxidizer jets. It is in this direction where complex chemistry calculations can be performed afford-ably.|$|E
50|$|This model {{takes into}} {{consideration}} only the final concentration of species and {{takes into account}} only the global nature of combustion process where the reaction proceeds infinitely fast as a single step process without much stress on the detailed kinetics involved. The reactants are assumed to react in stoichiometric proportions. The model also deduces a linear relationship between the mass fractions of fuel, oxidant and the non dimensional variable mixture fraction. The model also takes into account an additional assumption that the mass diffusion coefficients of all species are equal. Owing to this additional assumption the model only solves one extra partial differential equation for mixture fraction and after solving the transport equation for the mixture fraction the corresponding mass fractions for fuel and oxidant are calculated. This model can very well be applied to a combustion environment where laminar diffusion effects are dominant and the combustion proceeds via non premixed fuel and oxidant streams diffusing into each other giving rise to a <b>laminar</b> <b>flame.</b>|$|E

The larger the Markstein length, {{the greater the}} effect of curvature on localised burning velocity. It is named after George Markstein (1911—2011), who showed that thermal diffusion stabilized the curved flame front and proposed a relation between the critical wavelength for stability of the flame front, called the Markstein length, and the thermal thickness of the flame. Phenomenological Markstein numbers {{with respect to the}} combustion products are obtained by means of the comparison between the measurements of the flame radii as a function of time and the results of the analytical integration of the linear relation between the flame speed and either flame stretch rate or flame curvature. The burning velocity is obtained at zero stretch, and the effect of the flame stretch acting upon it is expressed by a Markstein length. Because both flame curvature and aerodynamic strain contribute to the flame stretch rate, there is a Markstein number associated with each of these components.|$|E

50|$|Diffusion flames can be laminar {{diffusion}} flames (e.g. Candles and matches {{burning in}} the air etc.) and turbulent diffusion flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and internal combustion engines) depending {{on the nature of}} mixed gas flow. Further, the flame shapes of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. Flame shapes also depend on the discharging velocity of fuel and air. Eddies inside the air flow {{plays an important role in}} deciding the flame shapes. With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become turbulent diffusion flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where <b>laminar</b> <b>flame</b> is changing into turbulent flame is termed as “break-up point”. Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent diffusion flames and in laminar diffusion flames are almost similar.|$|E

The findings of the investigation are relevant to reducing emissions of soot and continuum radiation from combustion processes, to improving terrestrial and spacecraft fire safety, and to developing methods of computational combustion, among others. <b>Laminar</b> premixed <b>flames</b> are attractive for studying soot formation because they are simple one-dimensional flows that are computationally tractable for detailed numerical simulations.
