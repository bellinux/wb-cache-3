25|$|Carbon {{composition}} resistors (CCR) {{consist of}} a solid cylindrical resistive element with embedded wire leads or metal end caps to which the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> are attached. The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> were wrapped around {{the ends of the}} resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for color-coding of its value.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{building}} wire {{is compatible}} with brass and quality plated screws. The wire provides connections that will not corrode or creep. It is not, however, compatible with aluminium wire or connectors. If the two metals are joined, a galvanic reaction can occur. Anodic corrosion during the reaction can disintegrate the aluminium. This is why most appliance and electrical equipment manufacturers use copper <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> for connections to building wiring systems.|$|E
25|$|Very low {{voltages}} are inefficient {{since the}} <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> would conduct too much heat {{away from the}} filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts. Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.|$|E
50|$|Since {{cartridge}} heaters {{are installed}} {{in a wide variety}} of machines, manufacturers must design the heaters to meet certain clearances. link The cartridge heaters might be terminated with the leads coming out straight, or in a right angle. Also, manufacturers must be careful that the leads are not exposed to temperatures higher than the maximum rating for the <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> In order to prevent <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> damage from temperature, movement or contamination, the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> can be protected with a metal conduit, braided metal or silicone sleeves.|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} of silver/silver chloride sensors operation is {{the conversion of}} ion current at the surface of human tissues to electron current to be delivered through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> to the instrument to read. An {{important part of the}} operation is electrolyte gel which is applied between the electrode and tissues. The gel contains free chloride ions such that the charge can be carried through the electrolyte, therefore the electrolyte can be considered as conductive for ion current as the human tissues. When the ion current exists, the silver atoms in the electrode oxidize and discharge cations to the electrolyte and the electrons carry charge through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> At the same time, the chloride ions which are anions in the electrolyte travel toward the electrode and they are reduced as they bond with silver of the electrode resulting in silver chloride and free electrons to deliver to the <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> The reaction allows current to pass from electrolyte to electrode and the electron current passes through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> for the instrument to read.|$|R
50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state bonding machines where he pre-heated the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to thermal softening the <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> the subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> and deliverying the ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of the <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> the onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip.|$|R
25|$|Incandescent {{light bulbs}} consist of an {{air-tight}} glass enclosure (the envelope, or bulb) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb, through which an electric current is passed. Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical {{connections to the}} filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its <b>lead</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A second {{aluminum}} foil strip, called the [...] "cathode foil", serves to make electrical {{contact with the}} electrolyte. [...] The spacer separates the foil strips to avoid direct metallic contact which would produce a short circuit. <b>Lead</b> <b>wires</b> are attached to both foils which are then rolled with the spacer into a wound cylinder which will fit inside an aluminum case or [...] "can". The winding is impregnated with liquid electrolyte. This provides a reservoir of electrolyte to extend the lifetime of the capacitor. The assembly is inserted into an aluminum can and sealed with a plug. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte have grooves {{in the top of}} the case, forming a vent, which is designed to split open in the event of excessive gas pressure caused by heat, short circuit, or failing electrolyte.|$|E

40|$|A {{two step}} process of joining a <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> to. 000002 m thick {{platinum}} alloy film which rests upon an equally thin alumina insulating layer which is adhered to a metal substrate is described. Typically the platinum alloy film forms {{part of a}} thermocouple for measuring the surface temperature of a gas turbine airfoil. In the first step the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> is deformed 30 to 60 % at room temperature while the characteristic one million ohm resistance of the alumina insulating layer is monitored for degradation. In the second step the cold pressed assembly is heated at 865 to 1025 C for 4 to 75 hr in air. During the heating step any degradation of insulating layer resistance may be reversed, provided the resistance was not decreased below 100 ohm in the cold pressing...|$|R

50|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} components and devices sometimes have {{plug and socket}} connectors or terminal blocks, but individual screw terminals and fast-on or quick-disconnect terminals are more common.

40|$|Despite the high-precision {{mechanical}} CNC machining of the die surfaces, modern {{sheet metal}} forming tools are subject to deviations from the theoretically ideal nominal state due to manufacturing tolerances. For this reason, the inspection and, if necessary, the correction of the adjusting tool gap or intermediate spaces is necessary after the assembly process of {{the upper and lower}} tool. In the solution approach presented here, instead of a cylindrical <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> cube-shaped metal foam plates are positioned in the tool at the point to be measured. Compared to <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> the tool gap can be determined in this way in a larger area. A decisive advantage is also the fact that tool gaps or intermediate spaces can also be measured at heated forming tools. For this purpose, only a metal foam alloy whose melting temperature is above the forming temperature must be selected...|$|R

50|$|Another {{classification}} of laboratory PRTs is Secondary-Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometers (Secondary SPRTs). They are constructed like the SPRT, but {{the materials are}} more cost-effective. SPRTs commonly use reference-grade, high-purity smaller-diameter platinum wire, metal sheaths and ceramic type insulators. Internal <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> are usually a nickel-based alloy. Secondary SPRTs are more limited in temperature range (−200 °C to 500 °C) and are approximately accurate to ±0.03 °C over the temperature range.|$|E
50|$|Industrial PRTs are {{designed}} to withstand industrial environments. They can be almost as durable as a thermocouple. Depending on the application, industrial PRTs can use thin-film or coil-wound elements. The internal <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> can range from PTFE-insulated stranded nickel-plated copper to silver wire, depending on the sensor size and application.
