Undertaking activities on a global scale requires a proper distribution system which could take advantages of different transportation modes. Accordingly, the present paper addresses a location-routing problem on multimodal transportation network. The introduced problem follows four objectives simultaneously which form main contribution of the paper; determining multimodal routes between supplier and distribution centers, <b>locating</b> <b>mode</b> changing facilities, <b>locating</b> distribution centers, and determining product delivery tours from the distribution centers to retailers. An integer linear programming is presented for the problem, and a genetic algorithm with a new chromosome structure proposed to solve the problem. Proposed chromosome structure consists of two different parts for multimodal transportation and location-routing parts of the model. Based on published data in the literature, two numerical cases with different sizes generated and solved. Also, different cost scenarios designed to better analyze model and algorithm performance.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 In Bayesian analysis, {{means are}} {{commonly}} used to summarize Bayesian posterior distributions. Problems {{with a large number}} of parameters often require numerical integrations over many dimensions to obtain means. In this dissertation, posterior modes with respect to appropriate measures are used to summarize Bayesian posterior distributions, using the Newton-Raphson method to <b>locate</b> <b>modes.</b> Further inference of modes relies on the normal approximation, using asymptotic multivariate normal distributions to approximate posterior distributions. These techniques are applied to two statistical estimation problems. First, Bayesian sequential dose selection procedures are developed for Bioassay problems using Ramsey's prior [28]. Two adaptive designs for Bayesian sequential dose selection and estimation of the potency curve are given. The relative efficiency is used to compare the adaptive methods with other non-Bayesian methods (Spearman-Karber, up-and-down, and Robbins-Monro) for estimating the ED 50. Second, posterior distributions of the order of an autoregressive (AR) model are determined following Robb's method (1980). Wolfer's sunspot data is used as an example to compare the estimating results with FPE, AIC, BIC, and CIC methods.

40|$|A new {{clustering}} approach {{based on}} mode identification is developed by applying new optimization techniques to a nonparametric density estimator. A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend {{to the same}} local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efficiently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively <b>locating</b> <b>modes</b> of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model fitting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Specifically, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is defined using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difficulty for parametric mixture modeling.

The response of cladding mode effective index with increasing overlay thickness is analyzed.

Further, the transmission spectrum of the coated LPFG is investigated while the overlay thickness is <b>located</b> in <b>mode</b> transition and the surrounding region, the amplitude of attenuation peak of the cladding mode which will enter the overlay decreases rapidly and the peak position of adjacent higher cladding mode shift towards the former lower mode.

Dichroic experiments u ing single crystals of these micas showed {{that some of the}} bands or components related to K have a strong in-plane and out-of-plane dichroic haracter. These experimental data led to the assignment of the FIR bands at 110, 91, and 83 cm- ~ for muscovite, phlogopite, and biotite, respectively, which have no in-plane and out-of-plane dichroic haracter, to the vibration of the double ring of oxygen atoms that constitutes the cage in which K is <b>located</b> (<b>mode</b> III). Bands at 146, t 36, and 152 cm-I for muscovite, phlogopite, and biotite, respectively, which have a strong out-of-plane dichroic character, were assigned to the out-of-plane vibrations of K atoms (mode IV). Some of the components at 190, 158 - 153, and 145 - 124 cm l for muscovite, phlogopite, and biotite, respectively, which have a strong in-plane dichroic haracter, are possibly related to the in-plane vibrations of K atoms (modes I and II).

40|$|A {{mechanistic}} {{air quality}} {{model has been}} constructed which is capable of predicting the contribution of individual emissions source types to the size- and chemical-composition distribution of airborne particles. This model incorporates {{all of the major}} aerosol processes relevant to regional air pollution studies including emissions, transport, deposition, gas-to-particle conversion and fog chemistry. In addition, the aerosol is represented as a source-oriented external mixture which is allowed to age in a more realistic fashion than can be accomplished when fresh particle-phase emissions are averaged into the pre-existing atmospheric aerosol size and composition distribution. A source-oriented external mixture is created by differentiating the primary particles emitted from the following source types: catalyst-equipped gasoline engines, non-catalyst-equipped gasoline engines, diesel engines, meat cooking, paved road dust, crustal material from sources other than paved road dust, and sulfur-bearing particles from fuel burning and industrial processes. Discrete primary seed particles from each of these source types are emitted into a simulation of atmospheric transport and chemical reaction. The individual particles evolve over time in the presence of gas-to-particle conversion processes while retaining information on the initial source from which they were emitted. The source- and age-resolved particle mechanics model is applied to the 1987 August SCAQS episode and comparisons are made between model predictions and observations at Claremont, CA. The model explains the origin of the bimodal character of the sub-micron aerosol size distribution.
