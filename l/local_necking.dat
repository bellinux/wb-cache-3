50|$|Forming limit curves (FLC) {{for four}} steel sheet grades are {{displayed}} in the attached figure. All forming limit curves have essentially the same shape. A minimum of the curve exists at the intercept with the major strain axis or close thereby, the plane strain forming limit. With {{the definition of the}} onset of <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> (e. g. membrane force reaches an extreme value) and the assumption of a hardening law according to Hollomon (σ = K εn) it can be shown that the corresponding theoretical plane strain forming limit is identical with the strain hardening coefficient, n. There is no thickness effect. Taking into account the strain rate sensitivity of the material, which is obvious in steel, along with the sheet thickness, the fact can be explained that practical forming limits, obtained by the use of the above described method, lie well above theoretical forming limits. Thus the basic influence parameters for the forming limits are, the strain hardening exponent, n, the initial sheet thickness, t0 and the strain rate hardening coefficient, m. The lankford coefficient, r, which defines the plastic anisotropy of the material, has two effects on the forming limit curve. On the left side there is no influence except that the curve extends to larger values, on the right hand side increasing r values reduce the forming limits.|$|E

40|$|Swallowing, voice disorders, throat {{discomfort}} and subjective neck discomfort are usually reported by {{patients with a}} known thyroid nodule and are correlated to nodular thyroid disease itself. Moreover, in endemic goitrous areas, total thyroidectomy (TT) is the most frequently performed surgical procedure. We are used to relate swallowing, voice and throat discomfort to the mechanical effects of nodular goiter or to thyroidectomy itself, but in both these cases the relationship between symptoms and the thyroid mass or its removal is not always clear or easily demonstrated. How can we explain the persistence of <b>local</b> <b>neck</b> symptoms after TT? And how can TT worsen the dysphagic or dysphonic disorders attributed to the goiter’s effect over the surrounding structures? During these years, many articles have analyzed {{the relationship between the}} thyroid disease and the laryngopharyngeal reflux, finding more and more evidences of their consensuality, leading to important new management considerations and notable medico-legal implications; if the reason of <b>local</b> <b>neck</b> symptoms is not the thyroid disease, we have to study and specially cure the reflux disease, with specific test and drugs.

40|$|Sheet metal {{formability}} {{is traditionally}} {{described by the}} forming limit curve (FLC). Experimental FLCs are obtained by performing formability tests and determining failure strains. The strains are usually measured either by etching a grid on the sheet surface or by digital image correlation (DIC). Ductile metal sheets fail primarily by <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> which introduces a severe strain gradient in the failure region. This makes accurate detection of the failure strains challenging. An international standard (ISO 12004 - 2 : 2008) was introduced in 2008 to unify the procedure of FLC detection; prior to this large discrepancies were observed between the results reported by different laboratories. The main limitation of the standard method for detection of forming limits is that its application is limited to cases where a single local neck is formed in the metal sheet prior to fracture. In the case of multiple local necks, the samples are simply discarded. Furthermore, the standard method does not include any guidelines to distinguish the failure by <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> and direct failure by fracture. One {{of the advantages of}} DIC over the traditional etched-grid technique is that the former allows us to obtain not only the strain distribution but also its history. This allows for alternative methods for detection of forming limit strains. This paper introduces a DIC-based method which was specially developed to handle the case of multiple local necks and to distinguish failure by <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> from direct fracture automatically. The method is not confined to a single test type and can be used in combination with different formability tests as long as DIC is used to measure strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to improve the {{understanding}} and {{the accuracy of the}} description of metal sheet formability following the needs of the automotive industry. In particular, the effects of plastic anisotropy and prestrain by rolling on the formability of AA 6016 sheets were investigated. The formability of metal sheets is traditionally described by strain-based Forming Limit Curves (FLCs) which are known to be path-dependent. In this thesis the merits of the alternative descriptions by means of stress-based and equivalent plastic strain based FLCs were investigated. First, the mechanical properties of the AA 6016 sheets were examined through a series of material tests. Uniaxial tension tests in seven different directions in the plane of the sheet along with the disc compression test were used for calibration of the plasticity model. In addition, plane-strain tension, in-plane shear and cyclic shear tests were performed for validation of the plasticity model. Then, the formability properties were investigated by means of Marciniak-Kuczynski and Nakazima tests. The investigated material showed a tendency to form multiple local necks in biaxial tension making the standard method for experimental detection of forming limit strains inapplicable. In order to enable the construction of FLCs a method capable of handling multiple local necks had to be developed. The new method improved the accuracy and robustness of experimental detection of forming limits. In addition, this method was developed to differentiate between <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> and fracture strains without involvement of the user. It was shown that for the tested AA 6016 the sheet formability in biaxial tension is limited by <b>local</b> <b>necking.</b> The possible influence of fracture on the forming limits was excluded both by improving the experimental procedure to differentiate between <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> and fracture strains and by applying predictions of calibrated fracture models. The experimentally detected FLCs at necking were compared with the predictions of the Marciniak- Kuczynski model. The comparison revealed that the investigated material displayed significantly higher anisotropy in formability than could be explained by the plastic anisotropy alone. The formability proved to be affected by roping phenomenon. Roping {{is likely to be the}} cause of the multiple <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> that made accurate experimental detection of the forming limit strains challenging in the first place. The effect of prestrain by rolling on the forming limit strains proved to be similar to the effect of prestrain in plane-strain tension. On the other hand, the forming limit stresses and the equivalent plastic strain at necking proved to be much less affected by the prestrain. This confirmed the advantages of the description of formability by means of stress-based and equivalent strain based FLCs in comparison with the traditional strain-based FLCs...|$|E

Alessia Cusimano 1, Achille Mastrosimone 2, Eugenio Fiorentino 1 1 Policlinico Of Palermo, Palermo/ITALY, 2 Policlinico Of Palermo, Agrigento/ITALY Background: Swallowing, voice {{disorders}} and throat discomfort are usually reported by {{patients with a}} thyroid nodule. it may frequently occur in patients who have undergone uncomplicated TT complain of symptoms such as swallowing disorders, hoarseness, a sensation of strangling or of a lump in the neck, a cough and sore throat, all usually attributed to oro- tracheal intubation. Swallowing, voice and throat discomfort should thus be in some way related to the mechanical effects of nodular goiter or to thyroidectomy; {{it has never been}} suggested that the same symptoms might refer to a different concomitant medical problem with an overlapping clini- cal presentation. Reflux laryngopharyngitis is the most frequent caused by the laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), a term which refers to the backflow of gastric juice into the laryngopharynx. LPR has been considered one of the atypical clinical presentations of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) affecting the larynx and pharynx; several otolaryngologists maintain that LPR differs from GER and concerns reflux in otolaryngology patients more often in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.

For the achievement of this study, it was considered various roughness and waviness profile parameters such as: arithmetic average roughness (Ra), maximum distance peak-valley (Rt), average waviness (Wa) and waviness of the total height peak-valley (Wt). Tensile test specimens of IF steel at 0 º, 45 º and 90 º to the direction of rolling were fabricated. After preparing the sheet proof specimens, it was performed simple tensile tests and measurements of roughness and waviness of the specimen surface at various strain stages resulting in a large quantity of data. During the tensile test, it has been measured the following plastic strain to indicate the incremental step: (ε 1) longitudinal strain and (ε 2) transverse strain. From these data, {{it was possible to}} obtain points needed to plot the curves of roughness and waviness parameters versus strain and to determine the material behavior using equations of the equivalent strain (ε).

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} work {{has revealed that}} necking of tensile specimens, subjected to dynamic loading, is a deterministic phenomenon, governed by the applied boundary conditions. Furthermore it was shown that the potential sited, dictated by the boundary conditions, may prevail even {{in the presence of}} a notch, thus necking may occur away of the notched region. The present paper combines experimental and numerical work to address this issue. Specifically, it is shown that the dynamic tensile failure locus is dictated by both the applied velocity boundary condition and the material mechanical properties, specifically strain-rate sensitivity and strain-rate hardening. It is shown that at sufficiently high impact velocities, the flows stress in the notch vicinity becomes quite higher than in the rest of the specimen, so that while the former resists deformation, it transfers the load to the latter, resulting in the formation of a <b>local</b> <b>neck</b> and failure away from the notch. Small local perturbations in the material properties are shown to be sufficient to stabilize the structure under local failure until a neck forms elsewhere. While the physical observations are quite counterintuitive with respect to the engineering views of stress concentrator's effect, the present work rationalizes those observations and also provides information for the designers of dynamically tensioned structures that may contain notches or similar flaws...|$|R
40|$|Densification of EB-PVD yttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} (YSZ) coatings {{occurs in}} two stages. Initially, the feathery morphology {{of the individual}} columns of the as-deposited coatings smoothens with the concurrent development of surface undulations. Then, some of these undulations on adjacent columns grow in amplitude until impinging to span {{the gap between the}} columns and form rows of <b>local</b> <b>necks</b> along the columns. The necks motivate sintering together of adjacent columns. The formation of necks and the overall response of the coating to this sintering process, however, depend on the roughness of the alloy surface. If the surface on which the coating is deposited is flat the columns are straight and parallel. Adjacent columns sinter together and the columnar microstructure is preserved with no cracking and the coating can withstand exposure to 1400 degreesC for at least 350 h with no transformation to monoclinic zirconia occurring. If the substrate is not flat, or develops roughness on thermal cycling, necks form and clusters of individual columns sinter together to form large-scale dense regions with larger gaps in between. The pattern of the gaps appears to reproduce the roughness of the underlying bond-coat alloy. The origin of this different behavior is attributed to the local undulations in the substrate surface causing individual columns to converge, narrowing the gap between them. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the prediction of the forming limit of certain Advanced High Strength Steel grades under stretch-bending conditions. For these types of steels it is experimentally observed and shown that {{when there is a}} bending component added to the main membrane deformation the formability predicted by the regular FLCs underestimate the material behavior. Due to the added effects of thickness stress due to contact and small radius bending as well as bending stresses, a through-thickness stress gradient forms which gives additional stability to the material beyond the forming limits determined by tests that generate mostly uniform membrane deformation. It is observed experimentally and by the detailed simulations that the cross-sectional stability is not lost instantaneously but gradually. A surface dent forms first on the outer surface and progresses in a stable manner towards the contact side since on the contact side the material has still potential to harden. This process delays the localization of the strains and stabilizes the formation of the <b>local</b> <b>neck.</b> For the prediction of this phenomenon theoretically and using shell elements, a modified incremental form of the maximum tension stability criterion is proposed to be applied at integration points through thickness. It is shown that with this criterion the phenomenon of gradual loss of stability can be captured during stretch-bending with shell elements. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R

In addition, the study evaluated whether these exercise protocols elicited any systemic effects by studying sympathetic nervous system (SNS) function and pain at a location distant from the cervical spine. Participants were randomly allocated into either a cranio-cervical flexion (CCF) coordination exercise group (n = 24) or a cervical flexion (CF) endurance exercise group (n = 24). Measures of pain and SNS function were recorded immediately before and after a single session of the exercise interventions. Pain measures included visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings of neck pain at rest and during active cervical motion and pressure pain threshold (PPT) and thermal pain threshold (TPT) recordings over the cervical spine and at a remote site on the leg. Measures of SNS function consisted of blood flow, skin conductance, skin temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. immediately after 1 session of exercise, there was a reasonably sized increase of 21 % (P <. 001, d = 0. 88) and 7. 3 % (P =. 03, d = 0. 47) in PPT locally at the neck for the CCF exercise and the CF exercise, respectively. There were no changes in <b>local</b> <b>neck</b> TPT with either exercise. Pressure pain threshold and TPT at the leg and SNS did not change after exercise. Only the CCF exercise demonstrated a small improvement in VAS ratings during active movement (change on 10 -cm VAS: CCF, 0. 42 cm (P =. 04).

While this is important, the five year survival rate is only one measure of success of laryngeal cancer surgery. Whereas, postoperative morbidity and mortality are also very important. Pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is the most frequent complication in the early post operative period after total laryngectomy.

40|$|Abstract: Neck pain is a {{significant}} societal burden due to its high prevalence and healthcare costs. While physical activity can help to manage other forms of chronic musculoskeletal pain, little data exists {{on the relationship between}} physical activity and neck pain. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare physical activity levels between individuals with neck pain and healthy controls, and then to relate disability, fear of movement, and pain sensitivity measures to physical activity levels in each of the two participant groups. 21 participants were recruited for each of the two participant groups (n = 42). Data collection included the use of the Neck Disability Index, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, electrocutaneous (Neurometer CPT) and pressure stimulation (JTech algometer) for quantitative sensory testing, and 5 days of subjective (Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity) and objective (BioTrainer II) measurements of physical activity. Analysis of Variance and Pearson’s Correlation were used to determine if differences and relationships exist between dependent variables both within and between groups. The results show that individuals with mild neck pain and healthy controls do not differ in subjectively and objectively measured physical activity. While participants with neck pain reported higher neck disability and fear of movement, these factors did not significantly relate to physical activity levels. Perceived activity level was related to pain threshold and tolerance at <b>local</b> <b>neck</b> muscles sites (C 2 paraspinal muscle and upper trapezius muscle), whereas measured activity was related to generalized pain sensitivity, as measured at the tibialis anterior muscle site...|$|R
40|$|A {{constitutive}} model {{that describes the}} mechanical behavior of steels exhibiting "TRansformation Induced Plasticity" (TRIP) during martensitic transformation is presented. Multiphase TRIP steels are considered as composite materials with a ferritic matrix containing bainite and retained austenite, which gradually transforms into martensite. The effective properties and overall behavior of TRIP steels are determined by using homogenization techniques for nonlinear composites. A methodology for the numerical integration of the resulting elastoplastic constitutive equations {{in the context of}} the finite element method is developed and the {{constitutive model}} is implemented in a general-purpose finite element program. The model is calibrated by using experimental data of uniaxial tension tests in TRIP steels. The problem of necking of a bar in uniaxial tension is studied in detail. The constitutive model is used also for the calculation of "forming limit diagrams" for sheets made of TRIP steels; it is found that the TRIP phenomenon increases the strain at which <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> results from a gradual localization of the strains at an initial thickness imperfection in the sheet. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Marciniak–Kuczynski and Nakajima {{tests of}} the dual-phase steel Docol 600 DL (www. ssab. com/) {{have been carried out}} for a range of stress-states {{spanning}} from uniaxial tension to equi-biaxial tension. The deformation histories of the specimens have been recorded by digital images, and the displacement and strain fields have been determined by post-processing the images with digital image correlation software. The fracture characteristics of the material are presented by means of the stress triaxiality, the Lode parameter and the equivalent strain. These parameters are evaluated {{on the surface of the}} specimens based on the optical field measurements and assumptions regarding the mechanical behaviour of the material. Additionally the minor versus major principal strains up to fracture are presented. It is found that the material displays a significantly lower ductility in plane-strain tension than in uniaxial tension and equi-biaxial tension, and that it, in the tests exposed to <b>local</b> <b>necking,</b> undergoes large strains between the onset of necking and fracture. Fractographs of selected specimens reveal that fracture is due to growth and coalescence of voids that occur in localised areas governed by shear-band instability...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} electromechanical properties of a new stretchable interconnect design for "fine pitch" applications in stretchable electronics. Design/methodology/approach - A patterned metal interconnect with a zigzag shape is adhered on an elastomeric substrate. In situ home-built electromechanical measurement is carried out by the four-probe technique. Finite element method is used to analyze the deformation behavior of a zigzag shape interconnect under uniaxial tensile loading. Findings - The electrical resistance remains constant until metal breakdown at elongations beyond 40 percent. There is no significant <b>local</b> <b>necking</b> in either the transverse or the thickness direction at the metal breakdown area as shown by both scanning electron microscopy micrographs and resistance measurements. Micrographs and simulation results show that a debonding occurs due to the local twisting of a metal interconnect, out-of-plane peeling, and strain localized at the crest of a zigzag structure. Originality/value - In this paper, the zigzag shape is, for the first time, proven as a promising design for stretchable interconnects, especially for fine pitch applications...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring airbag production, {{many parts}} are {{obtained}} by plastic deformation {{such as the}} lid of the gas generator. Since the airbag gas generator is a significant vehicle safety part, several pressure tests have been developed in order to prove the reliability of this product. A ductile fracture problem initialized by a localization of the deformation is observed along the blending radius. In order to understand the mechanical processes involved in the forming operation, a numerical and experimental study was developed.  A tensile test specimen extracted from the sheet of study, undergoes elastic deformation that is followed by a transition to plastic deformation. Although during this stage of the test the deformation is stable, the strains begin to localize within a relatively broad zone known as diffuse necking. The stable deformation, with continuously rising load, is followed by the instability whereby a <b>local</b> <b>neck</b> or shear band is produced due to strong localization of deformation. The localization is explainable by the inhomogeneity in macroscopic material properties in the specimen. The necking behavior is a vital precursor to the final failure. A Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method is used in 2 D and 3 D to evaluate the necking and localization of deformation, which shows clearly the two stage of necking phenomena. Moreover, a numerical modeling was developed of tensile test under ABAQUS commercial software. In this model we use Gurson Tvergaard Needleman (GTN) ductile model of damage to predict the necking phenomenon. Furthermore the results from FE simulations are compared with experimental results from uniaxial tensile tests. Finally we develop the numerical model of {{the lid of the}} gas generator obtained by forming process...|$|R
