40|$|As {{wireless}} sensor networks mature, {{they are}} increasingly being used in real-time applications. Many of these applications require reliable transmission within latency bounds. Achieving this goal is very difficult because of link burstiness and interference. Based on significant empirical evidence of 21 days and over 3, 600, 000 packets transmission per link, we propose a scheduling algorithm that produces latency bounds of the real-time periodic streams and accounts for both link bursts and interference. The solution is achieved through {{the definition of a}} new metric Bmax that characterizes links by their maximum burst length, and by choosing a novel least-burst-route that minimizes the sum of worst case burst <b>lengths</b> <b>over</b> <b>all</b> links in the route. A testbed evaluation consisting of 48 nodes spread across a floor of a building shows that we obtain 100 % reliable packet delivery within derived latency bounds.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{contributes}} {{urban traffic}} modeling used in optimization of traffic lights aiming at preventing traffic jams. The main {{indicator of the}} optimization quality is the weighted sum of the queue <b>lengths</b> <b>over</b> <b>all</b> lanes in the given part of city. The length of a queue cannot be measured directly, thus it should be modeled. The modeled part of a city, so-called microregion, consists of lanes and junctions. A lane {{is supposed to be}} equipped by maximum three detectors and by traffic lights at the downstream end. The junction serves as physical connection of the lanes. It is assumed, that microregion is bordered by the lanes with detectors and contains at least one traffic light. The model is macroscopic continuous-time and is based on the classical mechanics. The detectors data, settings of traffic lights and traffic network structure are the input information. The microregion model consists of two models: the lane model and the junction model. The lane model (see [1]) uses four state variables and two input/output variables. The state variables are the length of queue, average density of vehicles in the queue, the speed of the last vehicle and speed of the outgoing flow. The inputs to the lane model are the speed and intensity of the incoming flow at the upstream end of lane, while the outputs are speed and intensity of the outgoing flow a...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA Steiner {{star for}} a set P of n points in Rd connects an {{arbitrary}} point in Rd to all points of P, while a star connects {{one of the points}} in P to the remaining n− 1 points of P. All connections are realized by straight line segments. Let the length of a graph be the total Euclidean length of its edges. Fekete and Meijer showed that the minimum star is at most 2 times longer than the minimum Steiner star for any finite point configuration in Rd. The supremum of the ratio between the two <b>lengths,</b> <b>over</b> <b>all</b> finite point configurations in Rd, is called the star Steiner ratio in Rd. It is conjectured that this ratio is 4 /π= 1. 2732 … in the plane and 4 / 3 = 1. 3333 … in three dimensions. Here we give upper bounds of 1. 3631 in the plane, and 1. 3833 in 3 -space. These estimates yield improved upper bounds on the maximum ratios between the minimum star and the maximum matching in two and three dimensions. We also verify that the conjectured bound 4 /π in the plane holds in two special cases. Our method exploits the connection with the classical problem of estimating the maximum sum of pairwise distances among n points on the unit sphere, first studied by László Fejes Tóth. It is quite general and yields the first nontrivial estimates below 2 on the star Steiner ratios in arbitrary dimensions. We show, however, that the star Steiner ratio in Rd tends to 2 as d goes to infinity. As it turns out, our estimates are related to the classical infinite Wallis product: π 2 =∏n= 1 ∞(4 n 24 n 2 − 1) = 21 ⋅ 23 ⋅ 43 ⋅ 45 ⋅ 65 ⋅ 67 ⋅ 87 ⋅ 89 ⋯...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers large-scale service {{systems with}} multiple customer classes and agent types. Customers are classified {{according to their}} processing requirements, service-level guarantees, or both. The customers are served by agents of different types. These are classified according to the subset of customer classes that they can serve. We consider the problem of optimally choosing the capacity allocations of the different agent types and the real-time routing of costumers to agents. As a first step towards solving two such optimization problems, we introduce and analyze the Queue-and-Idleness-Ratio (QIR) family of routing rules. The QIR rules are defined as follows: (i) an arriving customer is routed to the agent pool (among those that are eligible to serve him) whose idleness most exceeds a specified state-dependent proportion {{of the total number}} of idle agents, summed <b>over</b> <b>all</b> types; (ii) a newly-available agent serves the customer from the head of the queue (from among those he is eligible to serve) whose length most exceeds a specified state-dependent proportion of total queue <b>length,</b> summed <b>over</b> <b>all</b> classes.
