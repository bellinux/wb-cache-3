40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} oral {{storytelling}} by pupils {{in the secondary}} English classroom has a potential neglected by teachers and the education system in Britain. Part One considers the history of traditions of storytelling from pre-literate times, {{through the development of}} communication technologies, the increase in the numbers of readers in the population and the development of schooled literacy, foregrounding oral continuities. It traces the development of the traditional concept of literacy as a neutral technology of the intellect, arguing against the notion of an oral-literate divide. It supports a revised conceptualisation of oral-literate relations which accepts that, in any society, there are multiple literacies. From a developmental perspective, it insists on the centrality of oral narrative discourse to the individual's thinking and sense of social identity. Finally, it reviews narratological theories and shows that the application of some of them to the transcripts of oral stories can reveal the <b>literary</b> <b>competences</b> of tellers. Part Two applies theory drawn from authorities consulted in Part One to data collected in English lessons where 12 / 13 year old pupils performed oral stories for an audience of their peers (public performances) or alone with a tape-recorder (private performances). The multiple contexts of the empirical study and the collection of data are described; ethnographic and discourse analyses of the public performances are presented through a paradigmatic instance. The findings of the textual analyses of ten exemplars are scrutinised and three related but separate significances identified in them, all signs of pupils' communicative and narrative competence. The private performances are analysed separately, using categories drawn from literary theory; comparative analyses reveal <b>literary</b> <b>competences</b> in experienced and inexperienced readers alike and enable an outline developmental perspective on <b>literary</b> <b>competences</b> to be constructed. On the basis of the findings of this work, the educational validity of oral storytelling in the secondary English classroom is asserted as a form of inclusive social justice. ...|$|R

Bavji therefore published the gist of various religious scriptures, including concise treatise in Mewadi on Ramayan Ramayana, Bhagwad Gita in simple Rajasthani (Mewadi), the mother tongue of the local public so that a lay man can understand and adopt the path of righteousness. To that extent his contribution to the society is indeed invaluable and trend-setting. This is the reason for his popularity and public reverence. He greatly emphasized on social reforms (especially women’s emancipation, BENAN AAPAN AUCHI NEE HAN), value-based education, adherence to moral values, constructive philosophies of life, and observance of yogic practices. Bavji also published his thoughts in magazines and newspapers of the day with the help of Ratan Lalji Dhankuta. Bavji used to organize weekly poetry meetings at Karjali Haveli under the aegis of [...] "SUKH SAMAJ" [...] (Happy Society) which was coordinated by Shri Ram Pratap Jotkhiji; the best poet of the meet was garlanded and the second best was presented a bouquet. Kids of the family, the numerous nephews and nieces, were encouraged to attend these meetings to give them right SANSKARIK exposure. He created a personal library that had more than a thousand books.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on my work as a teacher of Swedish {{language}} and literature to upper secondary school students, and my interest in developing the teaching of literature by using both new criticism theories and theories of literary perception focusing on reader response. The {{purpose of the study}} is to examine the learning process in trying to develop <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> and {{to find out how to}} describe the competence shown by the students. My starting-point is a discussion about <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> and the theory and model of <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> by Örjan Torell. In examining <b>literary</b> <b>competence,</b> by how students use their constitutional competence as well as performance and literary transfer competences, Torell´s model shows the possibility and the need for both knowledge of literature and personal reception by focusing on the dialogue between author and reader. The method is qualitative and the empirics are material collected in one senior high school class in the Social Science programme during their second and third year. The material contains written reading logs, written answers to tasks and transcribed recordings of discussions of literature. The analysis shows a variety among the <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> shown and developed by the students and points to the complexity of understanding the concept of <b>literary</b> <b>competence.</b> The model proves to be useful in focusing the teaching and learning of literature and the results indicate that teaching of literature by combining learning of epochs, genres, ideas and conceptions with personal reading is a valuable approach.

40|$|Abstract a) Objective To {{design a}} {{learning}} line for literary translation {{that meets the}} high level requirements concerning knowledge and skills and the particularities of careers in literary translation. b) Description Since literary translation requires {{a high level of}} knowledge and skills and, as a consequence, has become an academic discipline in several countries, the need is felt to establish a learning line that distinguishes not only the several learning steps (from an absolute beginner to an expert professional) but also the different competences and skills a translator should master. On the other hand education and training of literary translators cannot succeed without a close collaboration with the working field: publishers, literary funds and especially experienced translators willing to pass their knowledge and skills to the next generation. Outside the academia a whole lot of training initiatives have emerged and it would be wise {{for the sake of the}} profession to join forces. A learning line therefore should take in account both the necessity of a transparent, competence-based curriculum and the existing need for a continuous training of translators by translators. The learning line we wish to propose has five levels each linked with a certain qualification, and it distinguishes six core competences (translation competence, language competence, textual <b>competence,</b> research <b>competence,</b> <b>literary</b> and cultural <b>competence</b> and professional competence) and two flanking competences (didactic-evaluative competence, scientific competence), each with their descriptors und indicators. c) Results and conclusions In our contribution we would like to show how the learning line can be used as an analytical instrument that is useful for the design of courses, to detect personal and institutional shortcomings and to create means of (self) remedy. Moreover it allows individual translators and training institutes to assess themselves by indicating their place on the line. status: publishe...|$|R

From the opening chapter, which examines assumptions about what poetry might be, successive chapters map a path that takes the reader from the basics of simple appreciation {{to an understanding of}} the often complex theoretical and historical contexts that enrich any appreciation of poetry. While emphasising the importance of close textual analysis - or reading in slow motion - the authors clearly demonstrate how an understanding of form, language and context can combine to produce sophisticated and original responses to all types of poetry. The second edition of this best-selling book includes a number of developments that make it more user-friendly for the individual reader and more suitable as a stand-alone textbook for university courses in poetry. The poetic examples have been increased to 150, ranging from the 14 th to the 21 st century, and clear guidance is provided on further reading in footnotes and an expanded bibliography.

40|$|The {{tradition}} of English (and European) poetics has persistently had recourse to an implicit model of competence for the literary reader. Presumptions {{of a certain}} literary knowledge, of familiarity with particular literary conventions and codes, and of a specific functional attunement to the literary text extend from Pope 2 ̆ 7 s Essay on Criticism (an only partially arbitrary terminus a quo) through the varied state of contemporary literary theory. But it has taken the impetus of Saussurean linguistics and its various structuralist progeny to make explicit {{the need for a}} theory of reader competence which can most adequately account for our experience, interpretation, and evaluation of literary texts. 2 ̆ 2 Structuralism 2 ̆ 2 defines the task of poetics as a representation of the underlying system of conventions and codes which makes literary effects possible. The focus of such a task is not upon description of the qualities or properties of a given set of texts but rather upon the conditions under which such 2 ̆ 2 qualities 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 properties 2 ̆ 2 are experienced by a reader. ^ Such a task is clearly parallel with the central concern of Saussurean linguistics, which sees as its goal a description of language competence (i. e. the mastery of phonological, syntactic, and semantic codes or rules [...] an internalized grammar) rather than language performance (i. e. the body of individual utterances, which are seen as dependent upon such an underlying competence both for construction and comprehension). But precisely the power of this parallel or analogy raises what I suggest are characteristic issues for a theory of <b>literary</b> <b>competence,</b> for there are crucial limitations on our use of the linguistic model in literary studies. One of the major contentions of the dissertation is that to look for the precision that apparently characterizes linguistics in literary studies is a misconceived task. Not only is such precision not convincingly reflected in current linguistic extrapolations into literary theory and criticism, but, as Aristotle warned, to look for a greater precision in each class of things than the nature of the subject admits is in itself an error. I suggest a number of reasons why the competence we see presumed of the literary reader is simply not 2 ̆ 2 precisely 2 ̆ 2 determinable; the demands upon a <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> that texts may occasion are neither stable, nor uniform, nor exclusively linguistic. ^ The dissertation explores the nature of <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> and how (and under what conditions) such competence may be acquired, transmitted, and manifested by readers. More fundamentally it asks about the nature of theoretical problems that confront any specification of a <b>literary</b> <b>competence.</b> How are we to distinguish and designate the phenomena that a theory of <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> will organize and structure? Is such specification inevitably a form of critical or ideological coercion? What {{is the nature of the}} dialogue between a theoretical concern for <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> and traditional problems in poetics? The answers to these questions depend in large measure upon an understanding of literary convention, and a central chapter of the dissertation undertakes a theoretical exploration of precisely this problem. ^ The dissertation concludes by asking about the general consequences of a theory of competence for the enterprise of poetics, for our understanding of the institutional nature of this enterprise, and for literary pedagogy. ...|$|E

The discussion is based on three larger empirical studies of the reading attitudes and practices of 18 -year-olds. These studies build on and complement each other {{in relation to the}} overarching research questions through a triangulating process combining qualitative and quantitative methods. The studies are, however, freestanding and were conducted using different empirical methods. The first study is diachronic in that it compares national test essays on the topic of reading from the year 2000 with essays written according to the same instructions twelve years later. The main aim {{of this study is to}} reveal possible differences between the two generations in terms of attitudes and approaches to reading fiction, and to relate them to issues of <b>literary</b> legitimization and <b>competence.</b> The second study consists of a questionnaire about a short story read by the respondents, as well as about their general reading and media habits. A connection is drawn between media habits and reading frequency, on the one hand, and the results of the essay study, on the other. The respondents’ reception and understanding of the story is analyzed separately. A summary of the first two studies reveals several complex issues with contradictory patterns. The third study, which examines these issues more closely, was conducted through focus-group interviews. All three studies have been carried out among groups of pupils in the third year of upper secondary school in Sweden. The final part of the dissertation summarizes the results of the three studies, applying a pedagogical perspective to literature pedagogy within the subject of Swedish at the upper secondary level.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{apparent}} to Dante critics throughout the centuries that the ancient {{tradition of the}} afterlife plays a substantial role in the Comedy. The fact remains, however, that the two principal scholarly approaches to this question (on the one hand, {{the search for the}} “forerunners” of Dante; on the other hand, as a means of preserving critical respect for Dante 2 ̆ 7 s originality, rejection of the notion that the poet had recourse to established tradition) are no longer adequate, given the lack of direct textual references. This thesis considers the relationship between the Comedy and the topos of Paradise in the light of modern theories of intertextuality. It presents a methodology for an explication de texte that pays detailed attention to the peculiarities of the medieval mind, its memory structures and the concept of allegory. The thesis argues that, through keywords, the author could invoke entire bodies of text that constituted a common cultural background for the typical reader in Dante 2 ̆ 7 s times; these keywords are aimed at summoning up the whole tradition of Paradise in the Western tradition as depicted in fundamental texts ranging from Homer and Virgil, through the Apocalypse and the New Testament, and into medieval visionary writings. The thesis further argues that the more obscure the text in Dante (obscure, that is, {{from the perspective of the}} modern reader), the more frequent we may consider the presence of intertextual hypostases, and the more meaningful such passages within the entire economy of the poem. The thesis demonstrates how intertextuality proves to be an instrument of allegory for Dante. His contemporary reader could be counted on to possess the necessary <b>literary</b> and cultural <b>competence</b> to read such passages in the light of the earlier texts invoked intertextually, and which would thereby elucidate Dante 2 ̆ 7 s text itself. All of the passages dealing with images of loci amoeni are analyzed, so as to show how an intertextual/interdiscoursive interpretation allows us to resolve several hitherto dubious interpretations, and to bring about a better understanding of the whole poem. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how the translation competences were {{taught in the}} classroom and how the students’ translation practices were evaluated by the lecturers in the process of teaching literary translation. This study was aimed at describing and giving criticism to the translation competences taught by the lecturers in the literary translation course, the activities done by the lecturers in the process of teaching literary translation and the students’ responses to the Translating Literary Works (TLW) class. The research implemented a case study design and the data were collected through observation, questionnaire, interview and students’ translation works. The observation was recorded by using video recording and note-taking. The main aim of the observation was to comprehensively learn the process of teaching. The open-ended, closed-ended questions and the combination of the two types of questions were developed in this questionnaire to collect the valuable information on the students’ responses, experiences and understanding of the aspects of translation theories. Then, the lecturers and students were interviewed to collect additional information on the students’ interest and feeling about the process of teaching, teaching techniques and evaluation. Finally, the students’ translation works were used to show the authentic documents in doing some translation practices. Fifty five students and two lecturers participated in this research. A simple calculation of data was applied to find out the percentages of the students’ responses in the process of teaching TLW. The data were analyzed based on the learning theory by Katz (1993), the basic concept of translation competences proposed by Schaffner (2000) in Schaffner and Adab (2000 : 6), the steps of translation teaching process proposed by Duff (1989), translation evaluation by Dollerup (1994) in Dellerup and Lindergaard (1994), the elements of evaluation of the students’ translation practices from Salas (2000), criteria for students’ translation score by Adab (2000) in Schaffner and Adab (2000 : 224) and translation problems by Nord (1991 : 151). The findings showed that: (1) the translation competences focused on TLW class included linguistic competence, cultural competence, textual competence, subject competence, research competence, and transfer competence. From the competences taught by the lecturers, research and transfer competences were given more emphasis than those of the other competences; (2) the students were generally taught in the specific patterns of teaching which were classified into five steps of teaching activities: doing theoretical sensitization, doing translation practices, presenting the student’s works, sharing and discussing students’ experiences and providing feedbacks for the students. The translation practices in the TLW class were dominated by practicing literary translation from English into Indonesian; and (3) the TLW classes in general had got positive responses from the students considering that the teaching and learning process of TLW was very interesting.

Developing the engineering students’ <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> in analyzing and debating on literary and non-literary texts, in arguing for or against certain theories and ideas pertaining to literature, science and technology generates motivation to make linguistic progress and brush up on the foreign language...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} {{the writer and}} Argentine Ricardo Piglia {{profesor}} stands {{at the center of}} the academic debate on literary education based on the idea that his poetic reading hypothesis provides a framework capable to build viable research on the formation of the reading and <b>literary</b> <b>competence.</b> His ideas about circuits of knowledge production about reading, types of readers, the debate on the canon narrative and intertextuality, are considered fundamental to the discussion and to contribute to the discussion on how we should teach literature in a context governed by new technologies and the new reading...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{literary}} socialization in upper-secondary schools, adolescents learn to respond to literature {{in accordance with the}} examination syllabus. Two of the major problems teachers of literature have to deal with are 1) how they can deliver instructions and implement their goals to different reading abilities and attitudes of their students, and 2) how they can observe progress in the longitudinal process. In order to tie in with teaching practice, we have opted for basing the description of levels on the 'pedagogical content knowledge' of a diverse group of six expert teachers. This panel identified six levels, from students with a very limited <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> in grade 10 to very sophisticated students in grade 12. By means of questionnaires, the panel identified which books and tasks are appropriate for a particular level. Next we interviewed the panel in a focus group about why certain books or tasks are appropriate, or are relatively too difficult or easy for a certain level. In this way, we collected teachers' cognitions about the <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> of students, about the complexities of literary texts and about the educational relevance of tasks at six ascending levels. The activities at each level can be characterized as a certain kind of reading and interpretation. The results of this study are supported by both developmental theory and practice of literature teaching, which means that the model of literary development explored here seems reliable...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the promotion of}} reading classics among pre-university students with the presentation of a work proposal from the play by Federico Garcia Lorca, Yerma, due to the relevance and timeliness of the topics covered. The qualitative research results presented demonstrate that literature creates spaces that allow students to imagine, believe possible worlds, share their reading experiences with the group and play with the literary text. In addition, students develop a <b>literary</b> <b>competence,</b> reflect with the group and discuss a reality where there are many cultures and different opinions. Furthermore, a bimodal methodological perspective that emphasizes the relevance of this literary text in the XXI century is included...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} stylistic {{features}} of literary texts deautomatize perception {{is central to}} a tradition of literary theory from Coleridge through Shklovsky and Mukaiovslj to Van Peer. Stylistic variations, known as foregrounding, hypothetically prompt defamiliarization, evoke feelings, and prolong reading time. These possibilities were tested in four studies in which segment by segment reading times and ratings were collected from readers of a short story. In each study, foregrounded segments of the story were associated with increased reading times, greater strikingness ratings, and greater affect ratings. Response to foregrounding appeared to be independent of <b>literary</b> <b>competence</b> or experience. Reasons for considering readers ’ response to foregrounding as a distinctive aspect of interaction with literary texts are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|This article aims at {{identifying}} {{the kind of}} American and British literature tests that can be designed to allow students who enter a bilingual education program at a private university in Colombia to have their previous knowledge in these two subjects accredited through a proficiency test. Students' needs, opinions, beliefs, existing commercial tests, the University's (specifically, the one where the study was conducted) literature programs, several anthologies, and competences required in the education program were all taken into consideration. Then the tests were developed, piloted, and validated with a focus group composed of ten students of said program. The results indicated that students require previous knowledge, <b>literary</b> <b>competence,</b> and command of the English language because those are determining factors in successfully passing the tests...|$|E
