[...] The industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept, where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant increase in profits.

Kwariani had just broken away from his partnership with Vince McMahon, Sr. Rocca then set the post-World War II record for wrestling-attendance at Madison Square Garden's 49th-50th Street <b>location,</b> <b>drawing</b> 21,950 fans in a singles match against an obscure wrestler named [...] "The Amazing Zuma", aka [...] "Argentina Zuma", on 2 January 1960, as was reported by The New York Times. This {{was part of a}} series of three matches between the two held during a four-month period, when the pair earlier drew, on another night, almost as many fans to the Garden. The Times called the largest turnout of these three matches the all-time record for wrestling attendance at Madison Square Garden, although there is some question whether a Jim Londos-led event in the 1930s drew a few hundred more fans. Rocca had also been provided with new professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino as a tag team partner and second-banana in tag team matches. However, when this team failed to sell-out the Garden, the pair was split up to wrestle each other in the hopes that business would pick up, but it did not. Eventually McMahon Sr. took the New York territory back and built it by first featuring [...] "Nature Boy" [...] Buddy Rogers and then, a few years later, the by-then charismatic Sammartino as its champion.|$|E

Uses of such classification and implications for further research are also discussed. general practitioner typology attitudes...|$|E

Findings include an initial retrogressive effect on greenfield subsidiaries' technological evolution as a result of competence-creating overlaps, which, over time diminishes to become positive {{after more than a decade}} of overlap exposure. Thus, we add to the theory of subsidiary evolution by expanding the view of the archetypal subsidiary that has so far been constrained to evolve without operational overlaps.

40|$|Using Location-aware Multimedia Messaging (LMM) {{systems as}} a {{research}} testbed, this paper presents an analysis of how ‘fun or playfulness’ can be studied and designed for under mobile and ubiquitous environments. These LMM systems allow users to leave geo-tagged multimedia messages behind at any <b>location.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on previous efforts with LMM systems and an envisioned scenario illustrating how LMM can be used, the authors discuss what playful experiences are and three problems that arise in realizing the scenario: how playful experiences can be inferred (the inference problem), how the experience of capture can be motivated and maintained (the experience-capture maintenance problem), and how playful experiences can be measured (the measurement problem). In response {{to each of the}} problems, three design considerations are drawn for playful Human-Computer Interaction: 1) experiences can be approached as information-rich representations or as arising from human-system interaction 2) incentive mechanisms can be mediators of fun and engagement, and 3) measuring experiences requires a balance in testing methodology choice...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{changing}} job characteristics of strategic planners {{in the face}} of long-run increases in environmental turbulence since the 1960 s. We build on contingency theory to examine how growing turbulence may have impacted three aspects of strategic planner jobs: temporal range, processes, and organizational <b>location.</b> <b>Drawing</b> upon job advertisement data between 1960 and 2003, we compare strategic planner jobs over time and relative to a similar managerial function, marketing. We find that the secular increase in environmental turbulence is negatively associated with forecasting (temporal range), economics and analysis (processes) and centralization (organizational location), especially when compared with marketing. These findings broadly support contingency theory in a domain that has so far lacked empirical consensus. We contribute further by introducing a fine-grained methodology that allows a detailed approach to contingency theory studies of managerial roles, and opens a bridge to the Strategy as Practice tradition of research. Our findings also have implications for participation in strategic planning in firms, for the role of analysis in management education, and for research attention to strategic planning as an enduring strategy practice...|$|E
