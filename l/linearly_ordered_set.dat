50|$|Infinite divisibility {{does not}} imply gap-less-ness: the rationals do not enjoy the least upper bound property. That means that {{if one were to}} {{partition}} the rationals into two non-empty sets A and B where A contains all rationals less than some irrational number (π, say) and B all rationals greater than it, then A has no largest member and B has no smallest member. The field of real numbers, by contrast, is both infinitely divisible and gapless. Any <b>linearly</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set</b> that is infinitely divisible and gapless, and has more than one member, is uncountably infinite. For a proof, see Cantor's first uncountability proof. Infinite divisibility alone implies infiniteness but not uncountability, as the rational numbers exemplify.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a new {{perspective}} under which branching-time semantics can be viewed.

Properties of trees and of bundled trees can be expressed in topological terms. In particular, we can consider the new notion of topological validity for Ockhamist temporal formulae. It will be proved that this notion of validity is equivalent to validity with respect to bundled trees...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the concept of a net, first {{introduced}} by E. H. Moore and H. L. Smith in 1922, is to generalize the notion of a sequence so as to confirm the equivalence of the conditions (with [...] "sequence" [...] being replaced by [...] "net" [...] in condition 2). In particular, rather than being defined on a countable <b>linearly</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> a net is defined on an arbitrary directed set. In particular, this allows theorems similar to that asserting the equivalence of condition 1 and condition 2, to hold in the context of topological spaces that do not necessarily have a countable or linearly ordered neighbourhood basis around a point. Therefore, while sequences do not encode sufficient information about functions between topological spaces, nets do because collections of open sets in topological spaces are much like directed sets in behaviour. The term [...] "net" [...] was coined by Kelley.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of order theory, a continuum or linear continuum is a generalization {{of the real}} line. Formally, a linear continuum is a <b>linearly</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set</b> S {{of more than one}} element that is densely ordered, i.e., between any two distinct elements there is another (and hence infinitely many others), and which [...] "lacks gaps" [...] in the sense that every non-empty subset with an upper bound has a least upper bound. More symbolically: S has the least-upper-bound property, and For each x in S and each y in S with x < y, there exists z in S such that x < z < yA set has the least upper bound property, if every nonempty subset of the set that is bounded above has a least upper bound. Linear continua are particularly important in the field of topology where they can be used to verify whether an ordered set given the order topology is connected or not.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} the monoid of endomorphisms of the ordered set (Q,≤) of rational numbers. We show that for any countable <b>linearly</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set</b> Ω, there are uncountably many maximal subgroups of End(Q,≤) isomorphic to the automorphism group of Ω. We characterise those subsets X of Q that arise as a retract in (Q,≤) in terms of topological information concerning X. Finally, we establish that a countable group arises as the automorphism group of a countable <b>linearly</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> and hence as a maximal subgroup of End(Q,≤), if and only if it is free abelian of finite rank...|$|E

An important example: reflexive coequalizers are sifted colimits. Generalized varieties are defined as free completions of small categories under sifted-colimits (analogously to finitely accessible categories which are free filtered-colimit completions of small categories). Among complete categories, generalized varieties are precisely the varieties.
