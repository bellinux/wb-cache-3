5000|$|In {{the colonial}} period, tin was worked for its {{functional}} rather than aesthetic value. It was created {{and sold in}} standard sheets, which were then cut, folded and joined to make various objects. These sheets also became a traditional base for folk ex votos. Today, tin and other sheet metals, often from industrial waste, is still used to create decorative and functional objects such as castles, churches, masks, airplane models, saints, nativity scenes, contains, mirror frames, chandeliers, <b>lamps,</b> <b>trays</b> and plates. Another important line is toys, which are painted in bright enamels, especially in Celaya and San Miguel de Allende. Other important centers include Oaxaca, Irapuato, Mexico City, Puebla, Tlaxcala and Tlaquepaque [...]|$|R

2500|$|In a rare {{manuscript}} from Kashan {{compiled by}} Abulqassim in 1301, {{there is a}} complete description of how faience production was carried out. [...] Frit was made of ten parts of powdered quartz, one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made wheel throwing of the faience easier, and allowed {{a better quality of}} work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity. [...] The glaze itself is “formed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts. [...] These act as a flux and cause the quartz to vitrify at a manageable temperature. [...] The two alone will produce a transparent glaze”. Lane compared this material with the French pâte tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century. [...] This body material and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability. [...] This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, <b>lamps,</b> candlesticks, <b>trays,</b> tiles and so on. [...] These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.|$|R
5000|$|Ford also {{released}} another variant {{in certain}} countries which was marketed as the Wildtrak.

5000|$|Hispano-Moresque ware {{emerged in}} Al-Andaluz in the 13th century, {{probably}} after potters escaped the instability {{after the fall}} of the Fatimids. It introduced lustreware manufacture to Europe and from the start was widely exported to the elites of Christian kingdoms. The first centre was Málaga, producing wares in traditional Islamic styles, but from the 13th century Muslim potters migrated to the reconquered Christian city of Valencia, outlying suburbs of which such as Manises and Paterna became the most important centres, manufacturing mainly for Christian markets in styles increasingly influenced by European decoration, though retaining a distinct character. The potters were mostly still Muslim or Morisco. In a rare manuscript from Kashan compiled by Abulqassim in 1301, there is a complete description of how faience production was carried out.

40|$|L ocated on an {{unremarkable}} street, the storefront's simple appearance defies classification. Stencilled {{onto the}} front window in plain white font is "Flood: " (and then in smaller type) "A Volunteer Network for Active Participation in Realthcare. " Below, in the same lettering, this pro-nouncement is helpfully re-printed in Spanish: "Diluvio: Una Red de Voluntarios para Participation Activa en el Cuidado de Salud. " Through the glass, a plain white room can be seen, its centre occupied by {{rows and rows of}} carefully ordered plants. Sprouting from individual holes cut in white plastic tubing through which nutrients are fed, each plant reaches slowly towards the two lOoo-watt halide <b>lamps</b> overhead. The <b>trays</b> are suspended three feet above the floor on a basic wood-framed table. "You can wave your arms under the tables like a magician demonstrating the emptiness between two pieces of a woman sawn in half. The connection to the earth is gone, the earth as a source: unlimited, magical, deep. The plants are fed rationally " (Palmer ~oo 8, 58). There is an antiseptic air to the place. Nutrients, excess tubing, and other supplies are stored on one shelf while the opposite wall is full of pamphlets ranging in subject matter from hydroponic gardening to alternative healthcare treatment for RN!AlDS. There are some people tending to the plants inside, others milling about, browsing through material or talking to one another. The question of what this place is seems to hang in the air, ushering visitors in like a welcoming hos...|$|R
