40|$|The Canister Transfer System {{receives}} transportation casks containing {{large and}} small disposable canisters, unloads the canisters from the casks, stores the canisters as required, loads them into disposal containers (DCs), and prepares the empty casks for re-shipment. Cask unloading begins with cask inspection, sampling, and lid bolt removal operations. The cask lids are removed and the canisters are unloaded. Small canisters are loaded directly into a DC, or are stored until enough canisters are available to fill a DC. Large canisters are loaded directly into a DC. Transportation casks and related components are decontaminated as required, and empty casks are prepared for re-shipment. One independent, remotely operated canister transfer line is provided in the Waste Handling Building System. The canister transfer line consists of a Cask Transport System, Cask Preparation System, Canister Handling System, Disposal Container Transport System, an off-normal canister handling cell with a transfer tunnel connecting the two cells, and Control and Tracking System. The Canister Transfer System operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area with the Cask Transport System. The Cask Preparation System prepares the cask for unloading and consists of cask preparation manipulator, cask inspection and sampling equipment, and decontamination equipment. The Canister Handling System unloads the canister(s) and places them into a DC. Handling equipment consists of a bridge crane hoist, DC <b>loading</b> <b>manipulator,</b> lifting fixtures, and small canister staging racks. Once the cask has been unloaded, the Cask Preparation System decontaminates the cask exterior and returns it to the Carrier/Cask Handling System via the Cask Transport System. After the DC is fully loaded, the Disposal Container Transport System moves the DC to the Disposal Container Handling System for welding. To handle off-normal canisters, a separate off-normal canister handling cell is located adjacent to the canister transfer cell and is interconnected to the transfer cell {{by means of the}} off-normal canister transfer tunnel. All canister transfer operations are controlled by the Control and Tracking System. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading and subsequently seals the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal Waste Handling Building (WHB) support systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} stability monitoring for a radial symmetrical hexapod robot under dynamic conditions. The force-angle stability margin (FASM) measure method has been chosen as the stability criterion. This is because it is suitable for the stability analysis, in terms of external forces or <b>manipulator</b> <b>loads</b> acting on the body. Considering that a radial symmetrical hexapod robot can tumble along the contact point besides tip-over axis, this paper proposes an improved FASM measure method. Furthermore, it provides the method for calculating the stability angle of contact point and simplifies the algorithm of FASM. To verify the improved FASM measure method, three potential dynamic situations have been simulated. The simulation results confirm that, under dynamic conditions, the improved FASM is efficient, simple in terms of calculation cost and sensitive to <b>manipulator</b> <b>loads</b> and external disturbances. This means it has practical value in on-line controllers...|$|R

40|$|A robot {{that can}} {{duplicate}} humam motion capabilities in such activities as balancing, reaching, lifting, and moving {{has been built}} and tested. These capabilities are achieved {{through the use of}} real time Model-Based Control (MBC) techniques which have recently been demonstrated. MBC accounts for all manipulator inertial forces and provides stable manipulator motion control even at high speeds. To effectively demonstrate the unique capabilities of MBC, an experimental robotic manipulator was constructed, which stands upright, balancing on a two wheel base. The mathematical modeling of dynamics inherent in MBC permit the control system to perform functions that are impossible with conventional non-model based methods. These capabilities include: (1) Stable control at all speeds of operation; (2) Operations requiring dynamic stability such as balancing; (3) Detection and monitoring of applied forces without the use of <b>load</b> sensors; (4) <b>Manipulator</b> safing via detection of abnormal loads. The full potential of MBC has yet to be realized. The experiments performed for this research are only an indication of the potential applications. MBC has no inherent stability limitations and its range of applicability is limited only by the attainable sampling rate, modeling accuracy, and sensor resolution. Manipulators could be designed to operate at the highest speed mechanically attainable without being limited by control inadequacies. Manipulators capable of operating many times faster than current machines would certainly increase productivity for many tasks...|$|R

This {{inspection platform}} will <b>load</b> a scanning <b>manipulator</b> arm which, in turn, carries a metal detector on its tool centre point. With the integration of both, hexapod robot and scanning manipulator, several test tasks about the search and localisation of antipersonnel mines will be carried out, within a controlled environment. The SCARA configuration of the hexapod robot legs will allow low energy consumption when the robot executes gaits on flat terrain or with reduced slope, due the decoupling of gravitational effects. This legged robot has a mass about 250 kg, and it can bear a high payload up to about 300 kg. Considering this load characteristic then the vibrational effects on the scanning manipulator will be reduced, when this carry out scanning tasks over the terrain. info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP 7 / 284747; The authors acknowledge funding of this work under TIRAMISU Project - Grant Agreement Nº 284747 of the 7 FP, and partial funding from the RoboCity 2030 -III-CM project (Robótica aplicada a la mejora de la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{controlling}} the plane rotational motions of two rigid bodies connected by an elastic rod is studied. One end of the rod {{is attached to the}} support by a hinge with a spring, the latter modelling the elastic compliance of the fastening, and the other end is rigidly joined to the load. The Hamilton principle is used to obtain the integrodifferential equations and boundary conditions describing the motion of the system support — spring — rod — load. The following problem is posed: it is required to rotate the system by a given angle by means of the controlling force moment, with quenching of the relative oscillations of the load elements which appear {{as a result of the}} deformability of the rod and of the elastic torsion of the spring. Similar problem arise in the study of the dynamics and control of the motion of devices used in transporting loads through space (robots, <b>manipulators,</b> <b>load</b> lifting machines, etc.). In computing their control modes a significant part is played not only by the deformability of the elements, but also by the elastic compliance of the connecting joints. Asymptotic methods are used to botain a solution of the control problem in question for two limiting cases: 1) the mass of the load carried is much greater than the mass of the rod and support, and 2) the rod has high flexural rigidity...|$|R

Cryogenic {{high-vacuum}} transfer {{into and out of}} the FIB/SEM was performed via a Quorum PT 2010 cryo-preparation station using the modified specimen transfer shuttle device shown in Fig.  1 e. A silicon micropost array substrate (Cameca Instruments Inc.–APT division, PN 23265) attached to the LEAP-compatible specimen puck was <b>loaded</b> into the <b>manipulator</b> of the transfer shuttle and plunged into a liquid nitrogen (lN 2) slush bath of the Quorum work station. The frozen specimen substrate was then retracted into the specimen isolation chamber and transferred directly onto the cryo-stage within the FIB/SEM. The FIB/SEM stage was precooled to 113  K or colder prior to the transfer into the FIB/SEM. In order to deposit a solid film of MeCpPtMe 3, was introduced as a vapor via the integrated gas injection system (GIS), which is a common accessory with FEI-brand FIB/SEM systems. The deposition of the MeCpPtMe 3 resulted in a thick over coating. To prepare a sharp needle-like morphology with end radius of < 100  nm, 30  kV Ga ion milling in an annular pattern oriented along the long axis of the post was performed. The substrate was then transferred out of the FIB/SEM using the customized specimen transfer shuttle device and loaded onto the liquid nitrogen-cooled specimen carousel of the ETH (Fig.  1 d). The cryo-prepared specimen was then transferred into the LEAP for analysis. Note that the receiving specimen stage within the LEAP analysis chamber was precooled and held at a temperature around 40  K for APT analysis.|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the knee joint behavior is fundamental in many applications, such as joint modeling, prosthesis and orthosis design. In-vitro tests are important in order to analyse knee behavior when simulating various loading conditions and studying physiology of the joint. A new test rig for in-vitro {{evaluation of}} the knee joint behavior is presented in this paper. It represents {{the evolution of a}} previously proposed rig, designed to overcome its principal limitations and to improve its performances. The design procedure and the adopted solution in order to satisfy the specifications are presented here. Thanks to its 6 - 6 Gough-Stewart parallel <b>manipulator</b> <b>loading</b> system, the rig replicates general loading conditions, like daily actions or clinical tests, on the specimen {{in a wide range of}} flexion angles. The restraining actions of knee muscles can be simulated when active actions are simulated. The joint motion in response to the applied loads, guided by passive articular structures and muscles, is permitted by the characteristics of the loading system which is force controlled. The new test rig guarantees visibility so that motion can be measured by an optoelectronic system. Furthermore, the control system of the new test rig allows the estimation of the contribution of the principal leg muscles in guaranteeing the equilibrium of the joint by the system for muscle simulation. Accuracy in positioning is guaranteed by the designed tibia and femur fixation systems,which allow unmounting and remounting the specimen in the same pose. The test rig presented in this paper permits the analysis of the behavior of the knee joint and comparative analysis on the same specimen before and after surgery, in a way to assess the goodness of prostheses or surgical treatments...|$|R
