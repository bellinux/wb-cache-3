They were all white, plain weave, light-weight and commonly-sold <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The experimental fabrics were analyzed for their basic characteristics such as fabric count, weight, thickness, twist and yarn number to find out the possible relationship which existed between these characteristics and the serviceability properties. Standard test methods of the American Society for Testing Materials and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists were conducted under the standard atmospheric conditions. Analysis of variance and correlation coefficients were calculated for data obtained from all tests. Lining fabrics were ranked in terms of fiber content for each fabric performance test. Polyester showed great resistance to abrasion, high yarn and fabric breaking strength and little dimensional change. Rayon showed great resistance to tearing and good yarn and fabric breaking strength. Cotton had good resistance to abrasion and the least yarn slippage at the seams. Acetate consistently ranked the lowest in the majority of serviceability tests. Since linings with different fiber components did not always rank in the same order in all tests, it would be desirable for the consumer to determine what serviceability qualities she desires most...|$|R

5000|$|A fashionable garment in {{the early}} 20th century was the [...] "peekaboo waist", a blouse made from broderie anglaise or sheer fabric, which led to {{complaints}} that flesh could be seen through the eyelets in the embroidery or through the thin fabric. In 1913 the so-called [...] "x&#8209;ray dress", defined as a woman's dress that {{was considered to be}} too sheer or revealing, caused similar consternation. In August that year the Chief of Police of Los Angeles stated his intention to recommend a law banning women from wearing the [...] "diaphanous" [...] x‑ray dress on the streets. H. Russell Albee, the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, ordered the arrest of any woman caught wearing an x‑ray dress on the street, which was defined as a gown cut too low at the neck or split to the knee. The following year in 1914, Jean-Philippe Worth, designer for the renowned Paris couture House of Worth, had a client object to the thickness of the taffeta lining of her dress, which was described as [...] "thinner than a cigarette paper". Worth stated that using an even thinner, sheerer <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> would have had the effect of an [...] "x&#8209;ray dress".|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} linings on comfort were {{investigated}} for pleasantness in texture and movement performance in stretch pants. We conducted wearing tests {{in two different}} patterns. At first, comfort of six same stretch pants, five with different <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> and one with no lining, was compared, Then, another waring test was conducted to compare comfort {{in order to obtain}} data on appropriate selection of linings for closer and looser fitting designs, The results were as follows: 1) Stretch pants with linings gained higher evaluation than pants without linings, in terms of pleasantness in texture, slipperiness on the skin and easiness of body movement. The results revealed that the use of <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> improved the comfort of stretch pants. 2) For pants with relatively sufficient ease, it was revealed that the use of supple and smoothsurfaced linings produced more pleasantness to the skin. It was also revealed that easier vertical slipperiness of the lining towards the body deformation improved mobility. Since human body stretches vertically when in action, less vertical friction with the lining yields easier slippage and mobility. 3) For the linings of closer-fitting pants such as stretch pants, we found that elasticity was more effective than slippage on the skin for maintaining mobility...|$|R
30|$|The {{direction}} of pant <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> used was a cross grain (92.3 %, 12 out of 13). This {{is because it}} has several benefits. The cross grain direction has less shrinkage than a lengthwise direction. In addition, the selvage of <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> {{can be used for}} hemming of the pants lining without an additional overlocking process, saving both time and fabric consumption. Interesting results were obtained in contrast to that of the women’s pants and other garments, which used the selvage direction as vertical use of grain in a traditional manner.|$|E
30|$|As {{illustrated}} above, most menswear brands {{provided the}} pants lining pattern to the garment factories. The pants style (suit pants and casual pants), {{as well as}} both circumference and length ease were important factors. The connecting method was overlocking the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> onto the outer shell fabric. The direction of the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> used was crosswise grain line, which {{is in contrast to}} the information for the womenswear manufacturers and designers. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} could be a great asset for new menswear and womenswear manufacturers and fashion designers.|$|E

The sewing method of pants lining has several steps. For example, attaching the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> onto the outer shell fabric using an overlocking stitch must be done first. Then, the sewing of both layers together can be done to construct the remainder of the pant.

30|$|Lining fabrics are {{typically}} {{made in a}} lighter weight and smoother texture than the outer shell fabric. Generally, the lining fabrics do not stretch, but occasionally, a stretchable garment will be lined with a stretch <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> (Knowles 2006). If the degree of stretch in the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> {{is less than the}} outer shell fabric, the lining pattern size is increased from the outer shell pattern (Kim and Suh 2007). The amount of increase in overall size for non-stretch fabric lining patterns from the non-stretch outer shell patterns results in a pattern piece larger than the non-stretch outer shell fabric. The non-stretch outer shell pattern size is larger than the stretch outer shell fabric pattern size to accommodate for more ease in the garment.|$|E

30|$|Depending on {{the area}} of the garment, the lining should be larger and longer than the outer shell, so that the lining has {{sufficient}} ease. If there is not sufficient ease, the constant pulling and friction that the lining is subject to, will cause tears in the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> (Cabrera 1996). Previous research showed that the jacket lining is 2.4 – 5.6  cm larger than the outer shell pattern in the chest circumference (Kim 2014). Along with the consideration of circumference ease when developing a pants lining pattern, length ease from the waist to the hem is also important when over-locking is performed in the sewing process. This is due to the general placement of the lining in the front area of the pant only. Thus, the circumference ease and length ease of the pant lining would be different from the jacket lining ease.|$|E
30|$|The {{thermal barrier}} {{prevents}} the environmental heat from entering into the body. This layer consists of flame resistant fibres and their blends, {{which can be}} of nonwoven, spun-laced, quilted-batting, laminated woven, <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> or knitted fabric.

The inner liner protects the direct contact of fire-fighter with the thermal barrier. The fabric is prepared from fine yarn of Nomex and other fibres (93 % Nomex/ 5 % Kevlar/ 2 % antistatic carbon fibre). The use of finer yarns improves the softness and tactile comfort of the fire-fighter and they feel slight slick, which makes donning and doffing easier.
