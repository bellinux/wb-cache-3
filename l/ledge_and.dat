5|$|Thomee (1986) mapped {{the habitat}} {{occupied}} by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The snails occupied {{an area of}} 53.7m2 {{at the base of}} the Falls, with most snails found in an area of 11.4m2. More intense studies from 2002 to 2004 have further defined the occupied habitat. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found on a ledge beginning at 4m from the eastern edge of the Falls and extending to 16m from the Falls. In addition, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis can be found on the middle ledge 4m above the primary <b>ledge</b> <b>and</b> in the talus as far as 3m downslope from the primary ledge.|$|E

5|$|Geologists and the {{official}} Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series of}} small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a <b>ledge</b> <b>and</b> drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.|$|E

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon became {{an endangered species}} primarily due {{to the use of}} organochlorine pesticides, especially DDT, the breakdown of which lowered estrogen levels in the bloodstream of female {{peregrine falcon}}s and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to grow thinner by up to 20 percent. Since peregrine falcons lay their eggs on rocky ledges rather than nests, the thinned shells break under the stress of both the rocky <b>ledge</b> <b>and</b> the weight of the parents during incubation. Following 1970, recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon population have been successful. The agricultural use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, and recovery teams in the eastern United States were successful in breeding and training peregrines in captivity to later release to the wild, a procedure called hacking. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E

25|$|The {{island of}} St. Thomas {{was the hardest}} hit by the storm, where about 80% of the homes and {{businesses}} were damaged or destroyed, including the hospital and the water desalination plant; five people were killed. Storm surge in the Charlotte Amalie harbor beached the USCGC Point <b>Ledge</b> <b>and</b> damaged many smaller boats. Elsewhere in the territory, there was moderate to severe damage on St. Croix and St. John. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimated $1billion in losses, while an economic research group in the U.S. Virgin Islands set the damage toll at $3billion. Additionally, losses on St. Thomas were about $1.5billion.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she hired William Lawrence Bottomley {{to create a}} unique {{addition}} known as the Finger Bowl, an outdoor dining area consisting of a raised pool surrounded by a flat ledge.

In the late 1930s, Gifford Pinchot started the White Pine Plantation to reforest some old farmland near the mansion. He was particularly interested in that species since it was the dominant tree in the forests of Pike County and had been heavily harvested during the previous century.|$|E

25|$|Common murres {{breed in}} colonies at high densities. Nesting pairs {{may be in}} bodily contact with their neighbours. They make no nest; their single egg is {{incubated}} on a bare rock ledge on a cliff face. Eggs hatch after ~30 days incubation. The chick is born downy and can regulate its body temperature after 10 days. Some 20 days after hatching the chick leaves its nesting <b>ledge</b> <b>and</b> heads for the sea, unable to fly, but gliding for some distance with fluttering wings, accompanied by its male parent. Chicks are capable of diving {{as soon as they}} hit the water. The female stays at the nest site for some 14 days after the chick has left.|$|E
25|$|The art is {{commonly}} found in rock shelters (protected by a natural <b>ledge)</b> <b>and</b> shallow caves in which sunlight can penetrate easily. There is no clear preference as to {{what part of the}} rock shelter is used for art, it can be placed high or half-way up the walls. The sites were not used for habitation, and lack the organic remains of hearths and rubbish deposits which would help dating. Many sites are heavily decorated with figures superimposed, while other apparently suitable locations nearby have no images at all. The sites are often in ravines in steep valleys that would be relatively little use to farmers, but perhaps ideal for hunting by ambush and stampeding animals into a dead end.|$|E
25|$|The climate {{became more}} humid later in Triassic time. Slow-moving, southwestward flowing braided streams laid down thin-bedded layers of sand, silt, mud and cobbles in channels, across low flood plains and in lakes. Fossilized {{footprints}} of dinosaurs and the crocodile-like tritylodonts {{can be found}} in this 350foot (107m) thick ledgy-slope forming formation, called the Kayenta. The Kayenta weathers into three units; a lower <b>ledge</b> <b>and</b> middle cliff that are dominated by cross-bedded sandstone and an upper slope that has relatively more siltstone. It is often difficult to spot the contact between the Windgate and Kayenta due to their similar color and grain size. One place where the contact is easiest to discern is west of State Route 24 along the Fremont River at mile marker 82.|$|E

25|$|Designs by Duarte D'Armas (1509-1510) show {{a castle}} with {{circular}} barbican and rounded western entrance with machillitons. The southern battlements were decorated with parralleleptical merlons, {{while in the}} north (which {{was in a state of}} semi-ruin) was a false gate. To the south of the entrance was a cylindrical corbel with two orders of cruciform battlements, without merlons and with intermittent vaults. The castle, also circular, was circuited by various towers and corbels of varying sizes and forms. In the extreme east, alongside the false gate is a rectangular tower of two registers, with ceiling tile, two small windows in the north and another in the south, a balcony with machillotians, with another two crowning the walls linking to the tower keep. The rectangular keep tower with facade crack, is marked by merlons with three balconies with machilliations; Duarte D'Armas indicated in the legend that the tower was four registers, with a last floor topped with vaulted ceiling. Following this is a smaller pentagonal tower, crowned with machialliations. On the right of the principal gate is a hexagonal corbel with balcony and machicolations and surmounted by two bell towers with two iron crosses, one with two bells and another referred to as d'El-Rei. On the left is a taller octagonal tower with comparable damage, crowned by machicolations with merlons. In the north is a hexagonal corbel, followed by a semi-circular corbel, rectangular <b>ledge</b> <b>and</b> a new hexagonal corbel with balcony and machicolations. In the castle courtyard are two cisterns. On the outside of the castle, to the west, are town homes, the parochial church in the east (with a Manueline doorway), the Church of Santa Maria de Vilar in the west and farther to the north, the Chapel of São Brás. In the east are cultivatable lands, extending to the Douro River and the Castilian castle of Vilibestre.|$|E
