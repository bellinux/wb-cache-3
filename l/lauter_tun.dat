50|$|Smaller breweries {{will often}} use a boil kettle or a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> for mashing. The latter case either limits the brewer to single-step {{infusion}} mashing or leaves the brewer with a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> {{that is not}} completely appropriate for the lautering process.|$|E
50|$|The {{false bottom}} in a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> has thin (0.7 to 1.1 mm) slits {{to hold back}} the solids and allow liquids to pass through. The solids, not the false bottom, form a {{filtration}} medium and hold back small solids, allowing the otherwise cloudy mash to run out of the <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> as a clear liquid. The false bottom of today's <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> is made of wedge wire, which can provide a free-flow surface of up to 12% of the bottom of the tun.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> is a {{separate}} vessel from the mash tun, the mash is transferred to the <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> at this time. If the brewery has a combination mash-lauter tun, the agitator is stopped after mash-out temperature is reached and the mash has mixed enough to ensure a uniform temperature.|$|E
50|$|Recirculation {{consists}} of drawing off wort {{from the bottom}} of the mash, and adding it to the top. <b>Lauter</b> <b>tuns</b> typically have slotted bottoms to assist in the filtration process. The mash itself functions much as a sand filter to capture mash debris and proteins. This step is monitored by use of a turbidimeter to measure solids in the wort liquid by their opacity.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{investment}} {{has seen a}} new full <b>lauter</b> mash <b>tun</b> installed, replacing the old traditional tun with its geared rakes. The mash is now continually sparged as opposed to adding separate waters. The worts however are transferred to traditional wooden wash backs for fermentation.The distillery's floor maltings were decommissioned in the 1960s with the malt being supplied by large industrial maltings. However, worm tubs were retained for the cooling of the distillate.|$|R
50|$|Breconshire Brewery was {{established}} when beer distributing company C.H. Marlow decided {{to expand into}} beer production. Marlow established the brewery {{in a part of}} their warehouse in Brecon. The brewery's copper, mash tun, <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> and fermenters came thirdhand from Pembrokeshire Brewery.|$|E
50|$|There must be {{a system}} for {{introducing}} sparge water into the <b>lauter</b> <b>tun.</b> Most systems have a ring of spray heads that ensure an even and gentle introduction of the sparge water. The watering system should not beat down on the grain bed and form a channel.|$|E
50|$|A {{good quality}} <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> has {{rotating}} rake arms {{with a central}} drive unit. Depending {{on the size of}} the <b>lauter</b> <b>tun,</b> there can be between two and six rake arms. Cutting blades hang from these arms. The blade is usually wavy and has a plough-like foot. Each blade has its own path around the tun and the whole rake assembly can be raised and lowered. Attached to each of these arms is a flap which can be raised and lowered for pushing the spent grains out of the tun. The brewer, or better yet an automated system, can raise and lower the rake arms depending on the turbidity (cloudiness) of the run-off, and the tightness of the grain bed, as measured by the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the grain bed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> is the {{traditional}} vessel used for separation of the extracted wort.While the basic principle of its operation has remained the same since its first use, technological advances have led to better designed lauter tuns capable of quicker and more complete extraction of the sugars from the grain.|$|E
50|$|The brewery uses {{converted}} equipment, the <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> was {{a peanut}} butter hopper from Quaker Oats cereal, the mash/boil kettle was a yeast starter for a sour dough bread company, their pilot system's kettle was a 100-gallon coffee maker. They have a six kettle brew {{on the premises}} {{that allows them to}} make experimental beers.|$|E
50|$|Sparging is {{trickling}} water through the grain to extract sugars. This {{is a delicate}} step, as the wrong temperature or pH will extract tannins from the chaff (grain husks) as well, resulting in a bitter brew. Typically, 1.5 times more water is used for sparging than was for mashing. Sparging is typically conducted in a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, sahti is brewed using a long step {{infusion}} mash {{that may}} {{last up to}} six hours, after which the wort is lautered through the kuurna. Unlike most beers, traditional sahti wort goes straight from the <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> to the fermenter without boiling. This gives it a relatively short shelf-life and may cause some characteristic sour flavors to develop from Lactobacillus bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Large breweries have {{self-closing}} inlets on {{the bottom}} of the tun through which the mash is transferred to the <b>lauter</b> <b>tun,</b> and one outlet, also {{on the bottom}} of the tun, into which the spent grains fall after lautering is complete. Craft breweries often have manways on the side of the mash tun for spent grain removal, which then must be helped along to a large extent by the brewer.|$|E
50|$|Liquid adjuncts {{are either}} sucrose syrups or syrups from a grain (maize, rice or wheat), are added {{directly}} to the wort kettle and therefore {{can be used to}} reduce loading on the mash and <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> and effectively increase the brewhouse capacity. Liquid adjuncts may also be added after fermentation as primings sugars to give sweetness to the beer for secondary fermentation as in cask or bottle conditioning.|$|E
50|$|Lautering is the {{separation}} of the wort (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun,</b> or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls. The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating rakes or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel. The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates {{at each end of the}} structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.|$|E
50|$|Mashing is {{the process}} of mixing milled, usually malted, grain with water, and heating it with rests at certain {{temperatures}} to allow enzymes in the malt to break down the starches in the grain into sugars, especially maltose. Lautering is the separation of the extracts won during mashing from the spent grain to create wort. It is achieved in either a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun,</b> a wide vessel with a false bottom, or a mash filter, a plate-and-frame filter designed for this kind of separation. Lautering has two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract that remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water.|$|E
40|$|This paper analyses, in a {{full-scale}} industrial process, the flavonoids, non-flavonoids, tannins and non tannins in all malt worts and in maize adjunct worts and their fate during the main brewing steps. The effect on wort phenols {{of two different}} wort separation technologies, a mash filter (Meura 2001) and a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> (Steinecker FVAS 26), were also investigated. The results obtained showed that total phenols are lower in maize-adjunct, than in all-malt worts (542 mg/L and 730 mg/L, respectively), and that non tannins are the main phenolic components: 91 % of the total in all-malt and 82 % in maize-adjunct worts, respectively. The overall brewing process reduces the initial content of total phenols by 50 %, and the highest reduction is on tannins and flavonoids. After the brewing process, total phenols in beer were 336. 5 mg/L in all-malt and 280 mg/L in maize adjunct. In moderate drinkers they contribute to 10 – 20 % of the total phenolic daily intake accounting for around 4 – 8 % of the total antioxidant capacity of the diet. As regards the influence of <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> and mash filter on phenols, our results showed their great depletion when using <b>lauter</b> <b>tun,</b> and suggested that the brewing process may be adapted in order to overcome the high impact of <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> on phenols...|$|E

40|$|Brewing with unmalted barley {{can reduce}} the use of raw materials, thereby {{increasing}} {{the efficiency of the}} brewing process. However, unmalted barley contains several undesired components for brewing and has a low enzymatic activity. Pearling, an abrasive milling method, has been proposed as a pre-treatment for barley to remove some of its undesired components, while maintaining its β-amylase activity. The potential of combining pearling with using barley/malt mixtures for brewing was studied. Filtration was performed either in a mash filter or in a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun.</b> The effects of the different barley/malt ratios, degree of pearling and two different filter types on compositional and quality parameters were assessed. It was concluded that a mash filter is optimal for this type of process, and a window of operation could be identified in which optimal use is made of the raw materials while maintaining the end product quality, judged on basis of four quality parameters. </p...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis investigates performance parameters of unit operations in the brewery. It describes effects of the parameters temperature and agitation during mashing on mash properties. Mainly two properties are influenced by these parameters, the viscosity and the particle size distribution in the fines. It could be shown that both factors have significant influence on filterability of mash. In pilot scale and laboratory trials particle size effects in mash were investigated systematically. The importance of fine particles for lautering performance could be confirmed and quantified. The precipitation and aggregation of fine particles with increasing temperatures in the mash could be monitored for the first time. It could be shown that this parameter is not malt dependent. Mashes from different malts react in the same way. In laboratory trials it could be proved that the particle size parameter {{is more important than}} viscosity for filterability of mash. The parameters described above have been quantified and correlated with mash filtration parameters. This work provided a basis {{for the development of a}} computer model which describes mash separation in a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun...</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite of a well kept {{tradition}} over {{centuries to}} use oat as malted {{raw material for}} wort and beer production today this brewing cereal has been displaced almost completely. Ten different oat varieties where examined for their acceptability as brewing cereals and malted. The most favourable sample has even been used to brew different types of beer in pilot scale. The pilot maltings of these samples {{have been done in}} a 1 kg scale with 45 % moisture content, isotherm at 14, 5 °C (8 and 9 d vegetation time) and with a kilning temperature of 80 °C/ 3 h. The beer was brewed either in a 1, 5 kg or a 10 kg pilot plant. In both cases a <b>lauter</b> <b>tun</b> was used for solid-liquid-separation. Hot break was separated with a whirlpool. The wort was pitched at 10 °C with top fermenting wheat beer yeast (< 5 % dead cells, methylenblue-test) which was been cultivated several times in oat wort. After three days of main fermentation a maturation step at 16 °C and a two week storage time at 0 °C followed. The resulting beers have not been stabilised or filtered. The varieties differed only little. The malt with the extended malting time of one day demonstrated better levels of enzymatic activities and modification. Therefore the batch which was used for the brewing trials was malted with nine day vegetation time. All ten oat varieties had low levels of extract caused by the high level of husk material, which requires quite high proportion of water for mashing. The high portion of fatty acids was degraded only to a small amount. The low foam levels could be explained by the presence of fatty acids since they are not assimilated completely by the yeast. In addition fatty acids {{have a negative effect on}} flavour stability. In comparison to barley malt oat malt have considerably lower levels of enzymatic activity. On this account the enzymatic rests during mashing where noticeable laboured. Saccharification and lautering took place in a fast way. Main fermentation, maturation and storage ran smooth and efficient. All three beer types produced (Schank-, Voll- und Starkbier) offered a pleasant top fermenting aroma which still differ from the familiar southern german wheat beer aroma. The trials demonstrate that the cereal oat does contain a potential to produce a drinkable pleasing beer. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E
