[...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and <b>live</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E

There's a side to the record when you listen to it that talks about what is the gold– what really is that? It's valuing whom you have in your life, the relationships you’ve built.

2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you <b>live</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> not the way you speak." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Living</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life</b> was Belouis Some's first studio {{album in}} six years, and {{would also be}} his last (as of 2014).
