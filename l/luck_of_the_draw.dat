5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it's totally the <b>luck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> whether that person is into us or not. It just seems wildly unfair, I think.|$|E
5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of {{multiplayer}} game modes available. This sentiment was shared by other reviewers who thought the multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still apprehensive about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode was an interesting twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for purchasing card packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the <b>luck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw.</b> Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the randomness and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E

25|$|The GT variant {{kept the}} twin driving lights, but reverted to a bonnet {{blackout}} with no stripes {{at all on}} the vehicle. The front guards received fake 'vents' just behind the indicators, and NACA ducts were added to the bonnet. Steel 12-slot wheels were reintroduced, although some GTs received the five-spoke Globe 'Bathurst' wheels, which had been ordered for the GT-HO Phase IV and now needed to be used. The GT's rear suspension featured radius rods to help locate the elliptical-spring solid rear axle. Other performance parts from the aborted Phase IV found their way onto GTs, including larger fuel tanks and winged sumps. These GTs are generally referred to as RPO83s after the option code covering the additional parts, although what parts any given RPO83 received seem to have been governed by the <b>luck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> rather than any specific process.|$|E
500|$|Close to the Bone {{was written}} in {{collaboration}} with the Indigenous students at the EORA Centre for Performing and Visual Arts in Redfern, and first produced there in September 1991. <b>Luck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Draw</b> was produced by the Darwin Theatre Company in May 1999 and was the first play written by a non-Indigenous writer to be produced by Kooemba Jdarra theatre company in Brisbane. Last One Standing was performed at Sydney theatre the Old Fitzroy in 2007. Manning played lead character Joe in the Old Fitzroy production; The Sydney Morning Herald's reviewer Bryce Hallett described his performance as [...] "terrific", providing the play [...] "with an emotional anchor", but considered the play itself to be predictable, lacking in depth and with [...] "nothing revelatory on offer"; The Sun-Herald reviewer was of a similar view.|$|E
500|$|One {{means of}} {{fundraising}} that Harvest Campaign administrators decided on was to counterstamp {{some of the}} coins for sale at premium prices. [...] The letters and numbers {{are believed to have}} been punched by the Association, as they are almost entirely uniform. [...] Some were given a state abbreviation and a number, and were sent to be auctioned in various towns. [...] Gibbes reported that the counterstamped pieces sent to South Carolina sold for an average of $23, ranging from $10 to $110, and recommended that the auctions be preceded with the account of the sale of one in Bradenton, Florida, for $1,300. Which town got which number was the <b>luck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw.</b> Others were marked with [...] "U.D.C." [...] and a state abbreviation, together with a number which probably represents a membership or chapter number. [...] These were intended for presentation to members deserving of special honor, such as an outgoing president. [...] They did not sell well, as the Association had alienated many UDC members over the firing of Borglum. [...] The Association also announced a program for sale to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, although whether any coins were sold under this program is unclear, as none have been identified. [...] Pieces marked [...] "G.L." [...] and [...] "S.L." [...] were puzzled over by collectors for many years; A. Steve Deitert in the January 2011 edition of The Numismatist identified the markings as [...] "Gold Lavalier" [...] and [...] "Silver Lavalier". These coins were given to county winners and runners-up in a selling competition for young women.|$|E
