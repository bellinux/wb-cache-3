40|$|The {{computation}} of radiative energy <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> {{a finite}} size QCD medium with dynamical constituents {{is a key}} ingredient for obtaining reliable predictions for jet quenching in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. It was previously shown that energy <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> dynamical QCD medium is significantly higher compared to static QCD medium. To understand this difference, we here analyze magnetic and electric contributions to energy <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> dynamical QCD medium. We find that the significantly higher energy <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the dynamical case is entirely due to appearance of magnetic contribution in the dynamical medium. While for asymptotically high energies, the energy <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> static and dynamical medium approach the same value, {{we find that the}} physical origin of the energy <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> these two cases is different.

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of the Solar Tower Receiver (STR) affects significantly {{the efficiency of the}} entire solar power generation system and minimizing the heat loss of the STR plays a dominant role in increasing its performance. Unlike the other thermal losses the convective heat <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> STR has direct relation with wind conditions. In this study a Simulation tool ANSYS ® FLUENT ® was used to determine the convection heat <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> both cavity and externalSTR at wind speed varies from(2) to (10) /. A fixed tilt angle (= 	 90 °) for the cavity receiver is adopted. The results show that the convection heat <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> both receivers increases with increase of wind speed. The absolute values are considerably lower {{in the case of the}} cavity with comparison to the external type. Furthermore, the radiative heat <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the external and the cavity receivers is investigated. The results show that for the same absorbed area, the radiation <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the cavity is lower by almost (80 %) than the radiation <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the external...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} blade {{discharge}} angle {{on the performance}} of a standard industrial centrifugal oil pump of type 65 Y 60 &# 13; were investigated experimentally as the pump handled both water and viscous oil. A one-dimensional hydraulic loss&# 13; model was established to identify such effects mathematically. The effects have been estimated analytically by using&# 13; the model at various viscosities. The results showed that the blade discharge angle has significant but equal influence&# 13; on the head, shaft power and efficiency of the centrifugal oil pump at various viscosity conditions. For any viscosity,&# 13; the total hydraulic <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the impeller and volute rises with increasing blade exit angle. The diffusion <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> and&# 13; behind the impellers as well as the friction <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the volute are noticed in the pump, especially for highly viscous&# 13; liquids. The hydraulic <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the impellers is about 0. 8 - 0. 6 times the <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the volute. In order to improve the pump&# 13; performance, the hydraulic <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the volute must be kept as small as possible...|$|R
