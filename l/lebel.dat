5|$|On October 11, 1945 Justice <b>LeBel</b> issued {{his report}} that {{essentially}} exonerated Drew and Blackwell. Due to Jolliffe presenting only circumstantial evidence that linked Drew to Dempster, Murray and Sanderson, the Commissioner found the information unconvincing, even though <b>LeBel</b> believed Dempster's interaction with Sanderson and Murray was inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|Also in March 2007, Bloc Québécois MP {{and former}} BQ House Leader Michel Gauthier {{announced}} that he would not run in the next federal election. He resigned his seat of Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean on July 29, 2007. Gauthier was replaced in a by-election on September 17, 2007, by newcomer Conservative candidate and former Roberval mayor Denis <b>Lebel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Time: In a {{study on}} {{preferences}} for initials, Stieger and <b>LeBel</b> {{found that people who}} had changed their name after marrying continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Lebel's</b> {{diminutive}} sights, while accurate, {{were low}} and small thus {{not easy to}} align and unprotected against shocks.|$|R
5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. <b>LeBel</b> and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E

60|$|While Chauvelin spoke, {{a look of}} furtive terror {{had crept}} into <b>Lebel's</b> eyes; his cheeks became the colour of lead. But even so, {{he tried to keep}} up an air of incredulity and of amazement.|$|R
50|$|Sunstone was a RISC-like {{processor}} {{that was}} to be released shortly after the Ivory. It was designed by Ron <b>Lebel's</b> group at the Symbolics Westwood office. However, the project was canceled the day it was supposed to tape out.|$|R
60|$|He {{had spoken}} {{with so much}} {{concentrated}} fury, and the hatred and contempt expressed in his pale eyes were so fierce that an involuntary ice-cold shiver ran {{down the length of}} <b>Lebel's</b> spine. But, even so, he would not give in; he tried to sneer and to keep up something of his former surly defiance.|$|R
25|$|The main {{infantry}} {{weapons were}} Carcano rifles, Beretta M1934 and M1935 pistols, Bodeo M1889 revolvers, Breda 30 light machine guns, Breda M37 and Fiat–Revelli Modello 1935 heavy machine guns, and Beretta Model 38 submachine guns. Second line units frequently {{made use of}} captured equipment such as <b>Lebel</b> Model 1886 rifles and, for colonial troops, Schwarzlose MG M.07/12s and Steyr-Mannlicher M1895 rifles, provided by Austria as war reparations after World War I.|$|E
25|$|The Rifle Grenade {{variant of}} the No 2 comes in two forms, 7mm and 8mm. The 7mm model was {{produced}} for Mexico and is designed {{to fit into the}} M95 Mauser rifle used by the Mexican Army, while the 8mm model is designed {{to be used in the}} <b>Lebel</b> Rifle. The only difference between the models is that the 7mm Model has a clip attached to it to make it properly fit the M95, while the 8mm model doesn't.|$|E
25|$|The French {{entrusted}} the {{war effort}} against Dahomey to Alfred-Amédée Dodds, an octoroon colonel of the Troupes de marine from Senegal. Colonel Dodds arrived with a force of 2,164 men including Foreign Legionnaires, marines, engineers, artillery and Senegalese cavalry known as spahis plus the trusted tirailleurs. These forces were armed with the new <b>Lebel</b> rifles, which would prove decisive in the coming battle. The French protectorate kingdom of Porto-Novo also added some 2,600 porters {{to aid in the}} fight.|$|E
50|$|Only {{three of}} <b>Lebel's</b> works survive, all motets. Two, a {{setting of the}} Ave verum corpus and Sancta Maria succurre miseris, are for five voices, and the other, Puer natus est, is for six. Stylistically they are typical of the {{generation}} before Palestrina, during which the Franco-Flemish rather than Italians dominated the musical scene in Rome.|$|R
50|$|After regaining independence, the Polish Army {{was armed}} with weapons {{left over from}} the nations that {{occupied}} Poland during the Partition Era, including Russian M91 Mosin-Nagants, Austrian Steyr-Mannlichers, and German Gewehr 98s. French Berthiers and <b>Lebels</b> from the soldiers of the Blue Army were also on hand, as well as guns from Great Britain such as the Lee-Enfield and Japanese Arisaka.|$|R

25|$|Fletcher was re-elected in the 2011 General Election, after {{capturing}} 58 {{percent of}} votes. As Minister of State for Transport, Fletcher’s new responsibilities {{fall within the}} larger portfolio of the Honourable Denis <b>Lebel,</b> Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. In addition to continuing to serve on Treasury Board, Minister Fletcher also serves on the Cabinet Committee on Economic Prosperity and Sustainable Growth. “When it comes to Canada’s transportation systems, our Government is committed to protecting the safety and security of Canadians,” said Fletcher.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 1963, {{the entire}} campus {{with all of}} its {{facilities}} and faculty became known as the University of Windsor. As a 'federated member', Assumption University remained as an integrated institution, granting degrees only in its Faculty of Theology. Father Eugene Carlisle <b>LeBel</b> from Assumption became the inaugural president of the University of Windsor, and Frank A. DeMarco, who had been holding both positions of Principal, as well as Dean of Applied Science at Essex College, became the inaugural Vice President. The University's coats of arms were designed by Alan Beddoe.|$|E
25|$|The Polish Army {{was made}} up of {{soldiers}} who had formerly served in the various partitioning empires, supported by inexperienced volunteers and recruits. Logistics were a nightmare, relying on whatever equipment was left over from World War I and could be captured. The Polish Army employed guns made in five countries, and rifles manufactured in six, each using different ammunition. Before the Battle of Warsaw the 1st Legions Infantry Division comprised three regiments, one of which was armed with German Mauser rifles, a second with French <b>Lebel</b> rifles (carbines), while the third used Russian Mosin–Nagant rifles. Each make of weapon took ammunition of a different caliber.|$|E

In this work, we applied a new phase labeling scheme we recently proposed to simultaneously correct both artifacts in DWI images. The artifacts in resultant phantom images are largely corrected, demonstrating that the proposed method can effectively remove both Nyquist ghost and geometric distortion in the DW-EPI images through a phase <b>lebeling</b> acquisition and post-processing...|$|R
5000|$|In 1938, the Turkish Army at peacetime {{strength}} {{consisted of}} 174,000 soldiers and 20,000 officers forming 11 army corps, 23 divisions, one armoured brigade, 3 cavalry brigades and 7 frontier commands. It was ill-equipped with primarily World War I era weapons. The rifles used were a mixture including Mausers, Mannlichers, Lee-Enfields, Martinis, <b>Lebels</b> and others. As late as February 1940, the [...] British Foreign Office noted: [...] "The Turkish Army is very short of rifles and has {{asked us to}} supply 150,000".|$|R
50|$|Vedette of the Crazy Horse Saloon, Renoir was, between 50's and 60's, one of {{the most}} famous European strip-teasers. In 1964 Renoir was chosen by Michelangelo Antonioni to play the role of Emilia in The Red Desert, and the {{following}} year she made her theatrical debut in René de Obaldia's Du vent dans les branches de sassafras, alongside Michel Simon. In 1967 Renoir was the lead actress in Jean-Jacques <b>Lebel's</b> representation of the Pablo Picasso's drama Le Désir Attrapé par la Queue (Desire Caught by the Tail).|$|R
25|$|The first {{semi-automatic}} rifle adopted and widely issued {{by a major}} military power (France) was the Fusil Automatique Modele 1917. This is a locked breech, gas-operated action which is very similar in its mechanical principles to the future M1 Garand in the United States. The M1917 was fielded during the latter stages of World War I {{but it did not}} receive a favorable reception. However its shortened and improved version, the Model 1918, was much more favourably received during the Moroccan Rif War from 1920 to 1926. The <b>Lebel</b> bolt-action rifle remained the standard French infantry rifle until replaced in 1936 by the MAS-36 despite the various {{semi-automatic rifle}}s designed between 1918 and 1935.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1945, the {{regiment}} destroyed German bunkers {{to cross the}} Rhine at Germersheim, and in that days that followed, it fought pockets of German troops around Weingarten entrenched in towns and armed with tanks and anti-tank weapons. On April 16, the 2nd Dragoon Regiment returned across the Rhine to attack the remaining German forces in the Black Forest. The 2nd Squadron joined the Groupement <b>Lebel,</b> which chased a German force through the Black Forest {{and as far as}} Konstanz, while the rest of {{the regiment}} cut off the northeast of the Black Forest around Freudenstadt and Schwenningen. When news came of German surrender on 7 May, the squadrons of the regiment had reunited and were staying at Schloss Heiligenberg. In the months after the war, the regiment garrisoned the French zone in the occupation of Austria, at Innsbruck and Schwaz.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} {{capacity}} of War Minister that Boulanger gained most popularity. He introduced reforms {{for the benefit of}} soldiers (such as allowing soldiers to grow beards) and appealed to the French desire for revenge against Imperial Germany—in doing so, he came to be regarded as the man destined to serve that revenge (nicknamed Général Revanche). He also managed to quell the major workers' strike in Decazeville. A minor scandal arose when Philippe, comte de Paris, the nominal inheritor of the French throne in the eyes of Orléanist monarchists, married his daughter Amélie to Portugal's Carlos I, in a lavish wedding that provoked fears of anti-Republican ambitions. The French Parliament hastily passed a law expelling all possible claimants to the crown from French territories. Boulanger communicated to d'Aumale his expulsion from the armed forces. He received the adulation of the public and the press after the Sino-French War, when France's victory added Tonkin to its colonial empire. He also vigorously pressed for the accelerated adoption, in 1886, of the new and technically revolutionary <b>Lebel</b> rifle which introduced for the first time smokeless powder high-velocity ammunition.|$|E

50|$|The Eastern Division {{first got}} on the board {{in the bottom of}} the second inning against Matt Carasiti of the Bristol Collegiate Baseball Club. The leadoff hitter that inning, New Bedford Bay Sox first baseman Matt Chavez, was hit by pitch and {{advanced}} to third base when Laconia Muskrat Casey Kalenkosky reached on shortstop Mike <b>LeBel’s</b> fielding error. The Navigators’ Tyler Kuehl then hit into a fielder’s choice that allowed Chavez to score. After Lowell All-American Matt Miller singled to push Kuehl to second base, Kuehl scored on Navigator Matt Avery’s RBI single. Miller then scored on Sanford Mainer Anthony Gomez’s groundout to make the score 3-0.|$|R
25|$|Several Chancellors of the {{university}} had previously held positions such as Governor General of Canada, or the Viceregal consort of Canada. Examples include Pauline Vanier, 46th viceregal consort of Canada, Gabrielle Léger, the 48th viceregal consort of Canada, Maurice Sauvé, the 50th viceregal consort of Canada, and Michaëlle Jean, the 27th Governor General of Canada. A number of alumni have also gained prominence serving in government. Four heads of government attended {{the university}}, including Edward Morris, 1st Baron Morris, the 2nd Prime Minister of Newfoundland, Paul Martin, the 24th Prime Minister of Canada, Philémon Yang, the 8th Prime Minister of Cameroon, and Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, the 17th Prime Minister of Somalia. The 36th Argentinian Vice Presidents, Gabriela Michetti had also taken career specialization courses at the university. Premiers include Paul Okalik, 1st Premier of Nunavut, and Dalton McGuinty, 24th Premier of Ontario. Six graduates have been appointed puisne justices, with one moving {{on to become a}} Chief Justice of Canada. Puisne justices include Louise Arbour, Michel Bastarache, Louise Charron, Louis <b>LeBel,</b> Richard Wagner and Gérald Fauteux. Fauteux would later become a Chief Justice of Canada.|$|E

40|$|When moth {{follicular}} cells synthesize the characteristic, low-molecular-weight chorion (eggshell) proteins, {{they contain}} {{at least two}} groups of 8 - 9 S RNAs which appear to be chorion mRNA. This class of RNA yields a characteristic radiolabeled profile on polyacrylamide slab gels. The same profile is obtained irrespective of whether <b>lebeling</b> is performed in vivo or in organ culture, and whether the RNAs are purified from whole cells or specifically released from polysomes. Polysomes contain putative chorion mRNA only when the cells actually synthesize chorion protein. The RNA size is correlated {{with the size of}} the chorion proteins: two month species differing in the size distribution of their chorion proteins show a corresponding difference in the size distribution of the RNAs...|$|R

40|$|A {{challenging}} {{issue is}} the derivation of finite test suites with well-defined fault coverage for conformance testing of communication systems modeled by labeled transition systems (LTSs) {{with respect to a}} particular conformance relation. It is shown in this paper that this problem can be solved by translating an LTS specification into an input/output finite state machine (FSM) for trace or failure semantics, respectively, subsequently applying existing FSM-based methods for test derivation, and finally converting the obtained tests back to the LTS formalism. It is also demonstrated that the obtained tests can be optimized or the existing FSM-based methods can be adapted for generating optimized tests by taking into account the specifics of the FSMs which are obtained from the given LTSs.
