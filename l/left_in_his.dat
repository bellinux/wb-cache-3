5|$|Kippenberger {{finally arrived}} on the Western Front in September 1916, as a private in the 1st Canterbury Regiment. His arrival at the front coincided with the Somme Offensive. He {{took part in the}} Battle of Flers-Courcelette which began on 15 September and {{remained}} in the front lines for over three weeks before the regiment was withdrawn. His unit suffered heavy casualties during this time; Kippenberger was one of just five soldiers <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> platoon after the battle ended.|$|E
5|$|Olmstead won {{two more}} Stanley Cups in the 1956–57 and 1957–58 seasons.

As a result of this prognosis, the Canadiens left Olmstead unprotected in the Intra-League Draft, and he was claimed by Billy Reay, the head coach of the Canadiens' chief rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
5|$|The £5,000 <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{estate was}} quickly {{taken up by}} expenses, mostly on his funeral. His will stipulated that £100,000 {{should be left to}} Whitby and £25,000 each to his butler, Thomas Foley, and his chauffeur; however it is unknown whether they were ever paid. A trust fund had been set up for Frederick, but his half-sisters {{received}} nothing.

5|$|While the {{previous}} two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe, Goldfinger was chosen by Eon for the third film, with the American cinema market in mind. Because Terence Young was refused {{a share of the}} profits, he declined to direct Goldfinger and worked on The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead, although he had done some pre-production work before he <b>left.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> place, Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct; he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series, have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Oram Davidson (born December 31, 1949, in Rome, New York) is an American equestrian who competes in {{the sport}} of eventing. He {{grew up in a}} family uninterested in horses, but began to compete in Pony Club events after a family friend {{introduced}} him to riding. He began college at Iowa State University, but <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> third year to train full-time with the United States Equestrian Team. In 1974 he married, and his two children were born in 1976 and 1977. His son, Bruce Davidson, Jr., has followed in his footsteps to become a top eventing rider.|$|E
5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, he did not take a degree.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Davidson {{was born}} to Francis and Annette Davidson, the former a {{businessman}} and the latter a concert pianist. He was the third of four children, and had little opportunity to be around horses until {{his family moved to}} Westport, Massachusetts, when he was a child. A family friend introduced Davidson to horses, and he began attending Pony Club events. He bought, trained and sold horses until he found a championship horse in Irish Cap, the horse that took him to his first gold medal at the 1974 World Eventing Championship. Davidson went to college at Iowa State University with a veterinary major, but <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> third year to train with the United States Equestrian Team (USET).|$|E
5|$|Tini {{discovers that}} Tono has been having an affair, and is furious. She then goes to meet Yah. However, {{after a long}} talk she decides that Yah is better for Tono and tells the former prostitute to marry him; Tini then moves back to Surabaya, leaving Tono in Batavia. However, Yah feels that she would only ruin Tono's {{respected}} status as a doctor because of her history. She decides to move to New Caledonia, leaving a note for Tono {{as well as a}} record with a song recorded especially for him as a way of saying goodbye. On the way to New Caledonia, Yah pines for Tono and hears his voice calling from afar, giving a speech on the radio.

5|$|McCreary's senate {{term was}} set to expire in 1908, {{the same year as}} Beckham's second term as governor. Desiring {{election}} to the Senate following his gubernatorial term, Beckham persuaded his Democratic allies to choose the party's nominees for governor and senator by a primary election held in 1906 – a year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. This ensured that the primary would occur during his term as governor, when he still wielded significant influence within the party. McCreary now allied himself with J. C. S. Blackburn, Henry Watterson, and other Beckham opponents, and sought to defend his seat in the primary. During the primary campaign, he pointed to his record of dealing with national issues, contrasting it with Beckham's youth and inexperience at the national level. Beckham countered by citing his strong stand in favor of Prohibition, as opposed to McCreary's more moderate position, and by touting his support of a primary election instead of a nominating convention, which he said gave the voters a choice in who would represent them in the Senate. Ultimately, Beckham prevailed in the primary by an 11,000-vote margin, rendering McCreary a lame duck with two years still <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> term.|$|E
