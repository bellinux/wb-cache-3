5|$|Because {{the names}} of the eight players had been kept secret, the general public was not {{informed}} that Bruce Smith, who had developed into one of the best defensive players in the country, {{would not be able to}} participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl. Only when Smith filed suit to force Virginia Tech and the NCAA to allow him to play in the game was the situation revealed. Dr. Cecil Lloyd, chairman of the Independence Bowl, announced at the time of the <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> had he known about the restrictions on Smith, he likely would not have invited Tech to play in the game.|$|E
5|$|Bell alleged in his 2003 <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> the {{government}} employees had actually planted an illegal GPS tracking device {{in his car}} months before the one ostensibly allowed by the October 2000 warrant, at least as early as Bell's April 2000 release from prison. The information from that prior device could not be used, however, {{because there was no}} warrant allowing it to be planted. Bell also alleged that federal government employees had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter in a vehicle he drove in June 1998, one which {{the government}} never disclosed. Bell further stated that his defense lawyers colluded to keep Bell from being able to demand disclosure of all such secretly planted devices.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, {{construction}} of the building began, with a design by Der Scutt, of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, and development by Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company (renamed the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company in 2004). Although it is in one of Midtown Manhattan's special zoning districts, the tower was approved because {{it was to be}} built as a mixed-use development. Trump was permitted to add more stories to the tower because of the atrium on the ground floor. There were controversies during construction, including the destruction of historically important sculptures from the Bonwit Teller store; Trump's alleged underpaying of contractors; and a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> Trump filed because the tower was not tax-exempt.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas {{was born}} in Seville in 1484, on 11 November. For centuries, Las Casas's birthdate was {{believed}} to be 1474; however, in the 1970s, scholars conducting archival work demonstrated this to be an error, after uncovering in the Archivo General de Indias records of a contemporary <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> demonstrated he was born a decade later than had been supposed. Subsequent biographers and authors have generally accepted and reflected this revision. His father, Pedro de las Casas, a merchant, descended from one of the families that had migrated from France to found the town of Seville; his family also spelled the name Casaus. According to one biographer, his family were of converso heritage, although others refer to them as ancient Christians who migrated from France. Following the testimony of Las Casas's biographer Antonio de Remesal, tradition has it that Las Casas studied a licentiate at Salamanca, but this is never mentioned in Las Casas's own writings. As a young man, in 1507, he journeyed to Rome where he observed the Festival of Flutes.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{was born}} in New York City on December 6, 1841, to George Hatfeild Gossip, an Englishman, and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip, of New York. When he was sixteen months old, his mother died; about two years later, {{he and his father}} moved to England. His aunt, Mrs. Reaston Rodes, raised him, {{apparently}} with little involvement by his father. Gossip grew up at Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire (the Rodes family seat) and at Hatfield, in Yorkshire. Both the Gossip and Rodes families are listed in Burke's Landed Gentry. He was educated at Windermere College, Westmorland, and won a scholarship to Oxford University, but was unable to attend as his father, uncle, and aunts lost a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> ruined them financially. As a result, Gossip had to support himself through his own labors.|$|E

5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> exposed the corruption of the NHL's pension plan.|$|E
5|$|In West Virginia, 27river gauging {{stations}} were 1 in 100year events, mostly along the Potomac and Monongahela basins. As most of West Virginia's liveable land is along flood plains, the river flooding caused heavy {{damage in the}} state, mostly in the eastern portion. High waters washed away topsoil and thousands of trees, and over 13,000homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in the state. Damage was estimated at nearly $700million, making it West Virginia's costliest flood, and there were 38deaths. Flooding also affected Maryland, although {{to a lesser degree}} than neighboring Virginia, with $21million in damage and one death. There was also tidal flooding in the state along the Chesapeake Bay from the storm, which washed away beaches just weeks after Hurricane Gloria affected the coastline. In Pennsylvania, flooding was worst along the Monongahela River in the state's southwest portion. During the storm, a power company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn dam along the river to preserve its integrity, triggering a class action <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> ultimately failed. The floods damaged or destroyed 3,349houses in Pennsylvania, causing $83million in damage, as well as one death.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, {{and except for}} briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H.

5|$|The Seahawks {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Kingdome from their 1976 inaugural season until 1999. In 1995 a {{proposal}} was made to issue county bonds to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner Ken Behring threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built {{and said that the}} team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the state legislature to hold a special statewide referendum on a proposal to finance a new stadium. Allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns. With Allen agreeing to pay the $4million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997 but in May a Seattle resident filed a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>that</b> claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote. The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997, with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against. The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle's northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the eastern portion of the state. In October, a Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public's interest, and he dismissed the pending lawsuit. The Washington Supreme Court upheld the decision that December.|$|E
