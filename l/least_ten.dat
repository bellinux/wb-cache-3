5|$|Hurricane Charley {{affected}} at <b>least</b> <b>ten</b> U.S. states, {{resulting in}} five total deaths and $15 million in damage (1986 USD).

The system also produced light to moderate rainfall across Georgia and South Carolina, which proved beneficial as the region was in a major drought. However, its heaviest rainfall remained over open waters.|$|E

Antibubbles with a lifetime of at <b>least</b> <b>tens</b> of hours can be produced by adsorbing colloidal particles at the air-water interfaces of the antibubble.|$|R
