Methods: Mature male Wistar rats were exposed to systematic +Gx acceleration (9 G, 10 min daily, 10 times). Morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thymus</b> was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy. Results: Analysis <b>of</b> changes in <b>the</b> <b>thymus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mature rats under systematic exposure to +Gx acceleration showed marked structural transformation, which {{is characterized by a}} process of accidental involution and microcirculatory disturbances caused by <b>the</b> systematic action <b>of</b> gravitational forces.

40|$|When <b>the</b> <b>thymus</b> is autoplastically {{transplant}}ed into <b>the</b> marrow cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tibia <b>of</b> a guinea pig, {{the transplant}} degenerates, regenerates, and finally atrophies.

In the abdominal wall <b>the</b> <b>thymus</b> regenerates and persists apparently indefinitely. Abdominal wall thymus transplants more than a year old have been observed. In the bone marrow cavity, the regeneration, which is slower and less abundant, is followed by an atrophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gland, and finally its complete disappearance.

That <b>the</b> genetic character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transplanted tissue {{has much to do with}} <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transplantation in the marrow, is evident from the fact that some other tissues regenerate without encapsulation, even though they may finally disappear.
