5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the <b>lunar</b> <b>core</b> and the present angular momentum of the Earthâ€“Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with that}} of Earth, the Moon has only a very weak {{external}} magnetic field. Other major differences are that the Moon does not currently have a dipolar magnetic field (as would be generated by a geodynamo in its core), and the magnetizations that are present are almost entirely crustal in origin. One hypothesis holds that the crustal magnetizations were acquired early in lunar history when a geodynamo was still operating. The small size of the <b>lunar</b> <b>core,</b> however, is a potential obstacle to this hypothesis. Alternatively, {{it is possible that}} on airless bodies such as the Moon, transient magnetic fields could be generated during impact processes. In support of this, it has been noted that the largest crustal magnetizations appear to be located near the antipodes of the largest impact basins.|$|E
40|$|Processing of <b>lunar</b> <b>cores</b> includes: (1) careful {{dissection}} {{for study}} of loose fines, and (2) stabilization of the residue by peeling and impregnation. The newly developed technique for preparing thin peels of <b>lunar</b> <b>cores</b> requires {{application of the}} methacrylate adhesive to a backing strip, before taking the peel. To ensure complete impregnation of the very fine, dry lunar soil, the low-viscosity epoxy, Araldite 506, is gently flowed onto the core, under vacuum...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for calculating cosmic ray production profiles below reworking zones. The method uses an input reworking depth determined from data such as signatures in the depth profile of ferromagnetic resonance intensity and input cosmic ray production profiles for an undisturbed surface. Reworking histories are simulated using Monte Carlo techniques, and depth profiles {{are used to}} determine cosmic ray exposure age limits with a specified probability. It is shown that the track density profiles predict cosmic ray exposure ages in <b>lunar</b> <b>cores</b> {{that are consistent with}} values determined by other methods. Results applied to neutron fluence and spallation rare gases eliminate the use of reworking depth as an adjustable parameter and give cosmic ray exposure ages that are compatible with each other...|$|R
40|$|The in situ {{reworking}} (gardening) of {{the lunar}} surface by impacting projectiles creates an in situ reworking zone extending horizontally over the entire regolith surface and extending vertically from the surface to a depth which varies from place-to-place on the moon. On the basis of available evidence, the 'high-maturity' zones observed {{at the top of}} the <b>lunar</b> <b>cores</b> have resulted from the in situ reworking of the present-day lunar surface. The temporal variation of the in situ reworking depth was investigated using depths inferred from maturity I sub s/FeO and Al- 26 profiles of Apollo cores.

50|$|The {{existence}} of a <b>lunar</b> <b>core</b> is still debated; however, if {{it does have a}} core it would have formed synchronously with the Earth's own core at 45 million years post-start of the Solar System based on hafnium-tungsten evidence and the giant impact hypothesis.

Analyses of samples from the Apollo 15 and 16 drill stems together with authors' previously published results (1974, 1976), and the Battelle Na- 22 and Al- 26 data, indicate that in three of the four cases studied the regolith was measurably disturbed within the last 10 m. y. Activities measured in the uppermost 2 g/sq cm indicate frequent mixing within this depth range. The Monte Carlo gardening model of Arnold (1975) was used to derive profiles for the gardened moon-wide average of Mn- 53 and Al- 26 {{as a function of}} depth. The Mn- 53 and Al- 26 experimental results agreed with theoretical predictions, but the calculated depths of disturbance appeared too low...|$|R
40|$|Meteorites and lunar samples {{have been}} {{irradiated}} by high energy cosmic rays, typically {{for millions of}} years. In addition to producing isotopic changes, the irradiation creates ionization which may be recorded {{in the form of}} stored thermoluminescence (TL) in certain minerals, the most important of which is feldspar. One aspect of interpreting the TL of these samples is the effect of 'shielding' or depth control, which is particularly important for meteorites, since they have lost an unknown amount of mass during atmospheric entry. Here we report theoretical calculations which we compare with samples from <b>lunar</b> <b>cores</b> for which we have excellent stratigraphic control. We then discuss the implications for these results for the TL of meteorites, which have a different irradiation geometry. We find that, in general, calculated profiles are similar to those observed in lunar samples and meteorites. Additional effects, such as orbital (thermal) history and terrestrial age must also be considered in the case of meteorites...|$|R

The practical benefits of this are more stable long-term orbits and better fuel efficiency.

40|$|Depth {{profiles}} of Na- 22 and Al- 26 {{in the upper}} portions of five <b>lunar</b> <b>cores</b> are analyzed. From the analyses, it is concluded that the natural gardening processes on the lunar surface result in mixing of the regolith {{to a depth of}} 2 - 3 cm over a time period which is short compared with the half-life of Al- 26 (0. 73 m. y.). It is also concluded that the rotary drill processes which were used to obtain the deep drill samples generally resulted in loss and/or mixing of the upper portions of the cores. In contrast, the near-surface regions of the drive tube cores appear to have a well-preserved stratigraphy. Analysis of Mn- 53 in samples of six lunar rocks helps substantiate the accuracy of age date estimates by other means, and provides definite information that the total lunar surface exposure of two of these rocks has occurred during a single surface event which continued to their collection...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} two types of measurements. The first deals {{with the use of}} Al- 26 to define regolith gardening processes which have occurred in the upper portion of the <b>lunar</b> <b>cores</b> that were collected both by the deep drilling and drive tube operations. The second portion of the study involves the use of Mn- 53 and Al- 26 concentrations to determine the surface exposure histories of individual rocks over the past ten million years. It is found that during the past two million years, 15011 has had a history of simple gardening with an accumulation rate of 2 cm/m. y. The Apollo 15 Station 2 boulder appears to have been in place for about five million years. The 'shadowed' soil (75237) shows a shielding effect of about 40 %. The Apollo 16 Station 9 boulder appears to have been in place for about four million years and thus is apparently not related to the South Ray Crater event...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnder the {{limitation}} of rockets carrying capacity, the rated torque and power offered by drilling rigs, Therefore, the optimizations of auger driller's structure size and drilling parameters are necessary to realize deep <b>lunar</b> <b>coring</b> drilling under qualified condition. Study {{results indicate that the}} bit inner diameter is determined by target sampling mass and the density of drilling objects. Outer diameters of the bit and the helical blades are determined by the required power and torque for auger driller's restart from its state buried. To utilize the accommodated capacity of cuttings and dissipating the heat produced by bit during drilling process as much as possible, the lead angle is recommended to be 15 Â°âˆ¼ 20 Â°. The helical blade width should be obtained after other drill pipe parameters are determined. Feeding rate should be determined at first, and rotation speed is decided by the auger driller's structure size and feeding rate. Rotational speed will be enough as long as it can satisfy the normal discharge of the cuttings, otherwise its increasing would significantly increase drilling power...|$|R

Other major differences are that the Moon does not currently have a dipolar {{magnetic field}} (as would be generated by a geodynamo in its core) and the varying magnetization that is present is almost entirely crustal in origin. One hypothesis holds that the crustal magnetizations were acquired early in lunar history when a geodynamo was still operating. An analysis of magnetized moon rocks brought to Earth by Apollo astronauts showed that the moon must have had a strong magnetic field at least 4.25 billion years ago, which then slowly diminished up until 3.1 billion years ago. The small size of the <b>lunar</b> <b>core,</b> however, is a potential obstacle to promoting that hypothesis to the status of theory. Alternatively, it is possible that on an airless body such as the Moon, transient magnetic fields could be generated during large impact events. In support of this, it has been noted that the largest crustal magnetizations appear to be located near the antipodes of the giant impact basins. It has been proposed that such a phenomenon could result from the free expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud around the Moon in the presence of an ambient magnetic field. [...] For example, the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft mapped a [...] "mini-magnetosphere" [...] at the Crisium antipode on the moon's far side, using its Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument. The mini-magnetosphere is 360 km across at the surface and is surrounded by a 300-km-thick region of enhanced plasma flux that results from the solar wind flowing around the mini-magnetosphere.|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{regarding}} the past {{activity of the}} sun {{in the form of}} nuclear particle tracks in lunar samples and meteorites produced by heavy ions in galactic cosmic rays and solar flares is reviewed. Observations of track-rich grains found in deep <b>lunar</b> <b>cores</b> and meteorite interiors are discussed which demonstrate the presence of solar flare activity for at least the past 4 billion years, and the similarity of track density profiles from various lunar and meteoritic samples with those in a glass filter from Surveyor 3 exposed at the lunar surface for almost three years is presented as evidence of the relative constancy of the solar flare energy spectrum over the same period. Indications of a heavy ion enrichment in solar flares are considered which are confirmed by recent satellite measurements, although difficult to quantify in lunar soil grains. Finally, it is argued that, despite previous claims, there exists as yet no conclusive evidence for either a higher solar activity during the early history of the moon or a change in galactic cosmic ray intensity, average composition or spectrum over the last 50 million years...|$|R

40|$|Geophysical and geochemical {{observations}} {{point to}} the presence of a light element in the <b>lunar</b> <b>core,</b> but the exact abundance and type of light element are poorly constrained. Accurate constraints on <b>lunar</b> <b>core</b> composition are vital for models of <b>lunar</b> <b>core</b> dynamo onset and demise, core formation conditions (e. g., depth of the lunar magma ocean or LMO) and therefore formation conditions, as well as the volatile inventory of the Moon. A wide range of previous studies considered S as the dominant light element in the <b>lunar</b> <b>core.</b> Here, we present new constraints on the composition of the <b>lunar</b> <b>core,</b> using mass-balance calculations, combined with previously published models that predict the metal-silicate partitioning behavior of C, S, Ni, and recently proposed new bulk silicate Moon (BSM) abundances of S and C. We also use the bulk Moon abundance of C and S to assess the extent of their devolatilization. We observe that the Ni content of the <b>lunar</b> <b>core</b> becomes unrealistically high if shallow (3 GPa) LMO scenarios are considered for S and C. The moderately siderophile metal-silicate partitioning behavior of S during <b>lunar</b> <b>core</b> formation, combined with the low BSM abundance of S, yields only < 0. 16 wt% S in the core, virtually independent of the pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions during core formation. Instead, our analysis suggests that C is the dominant light element in the <b>lunar</b> <b>core.</b> The siderophile behavior of C during <b>lunar</b> <b>core</b> formation results in a core C content of ~ 0. 6 - 4. 8 wt%, with the exact amount depending on the core formation conditions.
