5000|$|In the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, held in Brussels and London during August 1903, Lenin and Julius Martov {{disagreed}} {{over the}} membership rules. Lenin wanted members [...] "who recognise the Party Programme and support it by material means and by personal participation {{in one of}} the party's organisations." [...] Julius Martov suggested [...] "by regular personal assistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations." [...] Lenin advocated <b>limiting</b> <b>party</b> membership to a smaller core of active members, as opposed to [...] "card carriers" [...] who might only be active in party branches from time to time or not at all. This active base would develop the cadre, a core of [...] "professional revolutionaries", consisting of loyal communists who would {{spend most of their time}} organising the party toward a mass revolutionary party capable of leading a workers' revolution against the Tsarist autocracy.|$|E
40|$|Can electoral rules be {{designed}} to achieve political ideals such as accurate representation of voter preferences and accountable governments? The academic literature commonly divides electoral systems into two types, majoritarian and proportional, and implies a straightforward trade-off by which having more of an ideal that a majoritarian system provides means giving up an equal measure of what proportional representation (PR) delivers. We posit that these trade-offs are better characterized as nonlinear and that one can gain most of the advantages attributed to PR, while sacrificing less of those attributed to majoritarian elections, by maintaining district magnitudes in the low to moderate range. We test this intuition against data from 609 elections in 81 countries between 1945 and 2006. Electoral systems that use low-magnitude multimember districts produce disproportionality indices almost on par with those of pure PR systems while <b>limiting</b> <b>party</b> system fragmentation and producing simpler government coalitions...|$|E
40|$|Very {{preliminary}} version. Comments welcome. 2 Can electoral rules {{be designed}} to achieve political ideals such as accurate representation of voter preferences, accountable governments, or solid economic performance? The academic literature commonly divides electoral systems into two types, majoritarian and proportional (PR), and asserts that the choice between these implies a straightforward trade-off by which having more of an ideal that majoritarian systems provide implies less of something that PR delivers, in equal measure. We posit that these trade-offs can be better characterized as a maximization problem, and that one can gain most of the advantages attributed to PR, while sacrificing less of those attributed to majoritarian elections, by maintaining district magnitudes in the low to moderate range. We test this intuition against data from elections 618 election outcomes in 81 countries between 1945 and 2006. Electoral rules that modify proportionality {{in an effort to}} mitigate party system fragmentation produce disproportionality indices not much worse than those of pure PR systems while <b>limiting</b> <b>party</b> system fragmentation considerably, producing simpler government coalitions, and surpassing both majoritarian and pure PR systems on some indicators of economic performance. 3 1.
