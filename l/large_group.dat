40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschool children means lower quality of child development and learning. From six preschool teachers perspective we also wanted to find out the <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of children positive and negative sides. The reason behind our choice of purposes is both our own experiences of mostly negative opinions of <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of children among preschool teachers, as well as the news reports about the negative consequences that <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers may cause. The study draws on a approach of the term constructionism in the understanding of the teachers’ perceptions of <b>larger</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers. We applied a qualitative method based on interviews with six preschool teachers working on two different preschools. The result of our study shows that the interviewed preschool teachers sees mostly advantages rather than disadvantages with <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers. The preschool teachers describe that to be able to work with <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers there has to be a good structure and organization guaranteeing that the pedagogues have the right competence and that the preschools environment is well designed. The conclusion we have been able to draw is that the preschool teachers in our study is not sharing the same negative view that previous research and media reports have shown. Instead the preschool teachers in our study sees more positive than negative aspects of <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers, as long as there is a good structure and organization...|$|R

40|$|Olson’s {{analysis}} {{argues that}} the free-rider problem makes <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> less effective. In this paper, we challenge this view of group action with a contest game that exhibits a bilateral interplay between intergroup interaction and within-group organization. In a static setting, because of the free-riding incentives, the <b>larger</b> <b>group</b> is disadvantaged in the competition with its rival. When groups interact in a dynamic environment, individuals within each group {{may be able to}} achieve cooperation. We then show that the <b>larger</b> <b>group</b> has more chance to enforce within-group cooperation. In accordance with many informal and formal observations, the <b>larger</b> <b>group</b> can thus produce a higher level of collective action...|$|R
50|$|The book {{noted that}} <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> will face {{relatively}} high costs {{when attempting to}} organize for collective action while small groups will face relatively low costs, and individuals in <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> will gain less per capita of successful collective action. Hence, {{in the absence of}} selective incentives, the incentive for group action diminishes as group size increases, so that <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> are less able to act in their common interest than small ones.|$|R

The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces would arrive shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E
5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually <b>large</b> <b>group</b> was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E

40|$|An {{intriguing}} {{aspect of}} social foraging behavior is that <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> are often no better at capturing prey than are small groups, {{a pattern that}} {{has been attributed to}} diminished cooperation (i. e., free riding) in <b>large</b> <b>groups.</b> Although this suggests the formation of <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> is unrelated to prey capture, little is known about cooperation in <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> that hunt hard-to-catch prey. Here, we used direct observations of Yellowstone wolves (Canis lupus) hunting their most formidable prey, bison (Bison bison), to test the hypothesis that <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> are more cooperative when hunting difficult prey. We quantified the relationship between capture success and wolf group size, and compared it to previously reported results for Yellowstone wolves hunting elk (Cervus elaphus), a prey that was, on average, 3 times easier to capture than bison. Whereas improvement in elk capture success leveled off at 2 – 6 wolves, bison capture success leveled off at 9 – 13 wolves with evidence that it continued to increase beyond 13 wolves. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hunters in <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> are more cooperative when hunting more formidable prey. Improved ability to capture formidable prey could therefore promote the formation and maintenance of <b>large</b> predator <b>groups,</b> particularly among predators that specialize on such prey...|$|R
