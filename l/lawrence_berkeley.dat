5|$|Just 23 {{days after}} his death, the Regents of the University of California voted to rename two of the university's nuclear {{research}} sites after Lawrence: the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> National Laboratory. The Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award was established in his memory in 1959. Chemical element number 103, discovered at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> National Laboratory in 1961, was named lawrencium after him. In 1968 the Lawrence Hall of Science public science education center was established in his honor. His papers are in the Bancroft Library at the University of California in Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbolBk and atomic number 97. It {{is a member}} of the actinide and transuranium element series. It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory) where it was discovered in December 1949. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Orlando Lawrence (August 8, 1901– August 27, 1958) was a {{pioneering}} American nuclear scientist and {{winner of the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939 for his invention of the cyclotron. He {{is known for his}} work on uranium-isotope separation for the Manhattan Project, as well as for founding the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked closely}} with Nobel Prize-winning {{experimental}} physicist Ernest O. Lawrence and his cyclotron pioneers, helping them understand the data their machines were producing at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> National Laboratory. In 1936 Berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of $3300 per annum. In return {{he was asked to}} curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{scientists}} at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> National Laboratory claimed the discovery of element 102, now called nobelium. At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same curium target used with nitrogen-14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as the target was destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with decay energy around (9±1)MeV and half-life around s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, other possibilities could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for 257Lr (alpha decay energy 8.87MeV, half-life 0.6s), the evidence obtained in this experiment fell {{far short of the}} strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103. Later, in 1960, the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding 252Cf with 10B and 11B. The results of this experiment were not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied {{engineering}} at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant {{professor of physics at}} the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. After a visit to Ernest O. <b>Lawrence's</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory's cyclotron deflector in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. After careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, which was the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.|$|R

5|$|After marrying, Segrè {{sought a}} stable job and became {{professor}} of physics {{and director of the}} Physics Institute at the University of Palermo. He found the equipment there primitive and the library bereft of modern physics literature, but his colleagues at Palermo included the mathematicians Michele Cipolla and Michele De Franchis, the mineralogist Carlo Perrier and the botanist Luigi Montemartini. In 1936 he paid a visit to Ernest O. <b>Lawrence's</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Radiation Laboratory, where he met Edwin McMillan, Donald Cooksey, Franz Kurie, Philip Abelson and Robert Oppenheimer. Segrè was intrigued by the radioactive scrap metal that had once been part of the laboratory's cyclotron. In Palermo, this was found to contain a number of radioactive isotopes. In February 1937, Lawrence sent him a molybdenum strip that was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. Segrè enlisted Perrier's help to subject the strip to careful chemical and theoretical analysis, {{and they were able to}} prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element. In 1947 they named it technetium, as it was the first artificially synthesized chemical element.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of {{rutherfordium}} were produced in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the former Soviet Union and at <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> National Laboratory in California. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, {{and it was not}} until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as the official name for the element.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{had access}} to the nuclear chemists at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the {{technique}} of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see {{with the unaided eye}} (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the state of California.|$|E

He became convinced that audio cables could be engineered to improve audio quality by conducting electricity more efficiently. Using a borrowed portion of somebody's booth at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, he did demonstrations of his cables in comparison to standard wires. After a positive reception at CES, he quit his job at <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Lab and started Monster Cable Products with $250,000 in bank financing. Monster's first cables were manufactured by Lee by hand and sold door-to-door.|$|E
5|$|The element {{seaborgium}} {{was named}} after Seaborg by Albert Ghiorso, E. Kenneth Hulet, and others, who also credited Seaborg as a co-discoverer.

Asian Wood took on other gigs around Hawaii for 18 months before breaking up.

Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber.
