40|$|Neoplasia {{resembling}} human malignant <b>lymphoma,</b> <b>reticulum</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sarcoma</b> type, {{occurred in}} cottontop marmosets inoculated with materials containing Epstein-Barr virus. One of four monkeys that received autologous cells transformed in vitro by Epstein-Barr virus developed lymphoma in mesenteric lymph nodes 7. 5 months after inoculation. Three of four marmosets inoculated with cell-free Epstein-Barr virus developed lymphoma. The latent period for detectable tumor formation after addition of virus was 31 - 46 days. Immunosuppressive drugs given {{with the virus}} accelerated the course of disease. Nevertheless, malignant lymphoma occurred in an animal given only cell-free virus. Six of eight marmosets inoculated with the virus demonstrated antibodies to the virus. Four marmosets not exposed to the virus, including two that received immunosuppressive drugs, developed neither tumors nor antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus. Virus antigen detectable by immunofluorescence was found in 5 % of cells shed from one tumor maintained in organ culture. These results imply that Epstein-Barr virus is capable of inducing malignant lymphoma {{in at least one}} primate species. Additional evidence is required before its oncogenic capacity in this host can be accepted without reservation...|$|E
40|$|An immunoglobulin-enzyme bridge {{technique}} has been employed for the selective localization of immunoglobulin-producing cells in spleen, lymph nodes, and lymphoreticular tumors fixed highly for optimal immunocytochemistry or processed routinely for surgical diagnosis. Immunostaining for immunoglobulin was encountered consistently in the specially fixed tissues and {{was observed in}} some of the surgical specimens in areas where presumably fixation was satisfactory. Many, but not all, of the tumor cells in histocytic <b>lymphoma</b> (<b>reticulum</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sarcoma)</b> of spleen and of brain stained for IgG, but none evidenced reactivity for IgM or IgA. In Hodgkin's tumors, the prevalence of IgG-reactive stromal immunocytes in or between tumor areas was greatest in the nodular sclerosing form of the disease, abundant in mixed cellular, and least in lymphocyte-predominant and lymphocyte-depleted types. Immunocytes showing reactivity for IgG greatly exceeded those staining for IgM or IgA. Hodgkin's tumor cells immunostained frequently for IgG, infrequently for IgM, not at all for IgA, and in one instance, stained for k but not for lambda light chains. Individual tumor cells failed to stain for more than one type of Ig or light chain. The proportion of Ig reactive vs. unstained tumor cells correlated with the prevalence of immunocytes in the different Hodgkin's categories. Reed-Sternberg cells differed in their fine structure in ways which possibly correspond with {{the presence or absence of}} Ig shown at the light microscope level.

40|$|SUMMARY. -Chromosome {{studies were}} carried out, by a direct method, in 28 {{subjects}} with malignant lymphomas. Lymph node cells were analysed in 24, ascitic fluid sediments in 3 and bone marrow cells in 1. Chromosome abnormalities, both numerical and structural, {{were found in}} 12 of 14 cases of well differentiated and poorly differentiated lymphocytic <b>lymphomas,</b> and <b>reticulum</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> and in 8 of 14 cases with Hodgkin's disease.

40|$|The {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) heavy (H) {{and light}} (L) chain gene rearrangements {{of the high}} incidence SJL <b>lymphomas</b> (<b>reticulum</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> RCS) have been analyzed. Both primary and transplanted RCS show rearrangements of H and kappa L chains, demonstrating that these tumors are of B cell origin. These data are consistent with previous results indicating that these tumors are a mouse model for follicular lymphoma. A long-term transplanted line and the in vitro line derived from it, cRCS-X, have a single rearranged JH-C gamma 2 a fragment and one rearranged C alpha gene fragment which does not hybridize with a probe for the JH gene segments. These cell lines also have two rearranged J kappa-C kappa fragments. Primary tumors and early passages are more heterogeneous with respect to Ig gene rearrangements, possibly because more than one B cell clone is present. Although no synthesis of IgG 2 a, or of any Ig, could be detected by the in vitro cRCS-X cells, these cells contain abundant poly(A) + RNA that hybridize with gamma 2 a and kappa probes as well as lesser amounts of alpha and epsilon RNA. None of these H chain RNA hybridized with probes for the JH gene segments. The epsilon and alpha RNA are {{the same size as}} transcripts of germ-line CH genes which have been identified in other systems. However, the gamma 2 a RNA are smaller than previously described germ-line C gamma 2 a RNA and appear to be transcribed from aberrantly rearranged JH-C gamma 2 a genes...|$|R
40|$|The MHC class II I-A(s) {{positive}} B <b>cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> <b>reticulum</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (RCS) {{that arise}} in > 90 % of SJL mice {{by the age of}} 12 months have superantigen-like stimulating properties. In the present study, therefore, RCS cell lines were examined for abnormal expression of endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) proviruses. Extraordinarily high expression of a 1. 8 kb mRNA hybridizing with the long terminal repeat (LTR) of MMTV was found in both primary lymphomas and in vitro RCS lines, but not in an SJL B cell lymphoma, NJ 101, that does not stimulate syngeneic T cells, or in LPS activated SJL B cells. A cDNA was cloned from cRCS- 2 and sequenced. A 31 mer oligonucleotide probe, prepared based on the unique C-terminal sequence of this RCS-Mtv LTR, detected the 1. 8 kb mRNA in all RCS lymphomas, while a similar probe for the C-terminal sequence of Mtv- 8 LTR hybridized with the larger mRNA present in normal B cells and in NJ 101. Preincubation with 19 mer antisense S-oligonucleotides, prepared based on the sequences of the first two potential translation initiation sites common to both Mtv- 8 and the RCS-Mtv LTR, significantly reduced the ability of RCS cells to stimulate syngeneic T cells. Moreover, transfection of NJ 101 cells with the cloned RCS-MMTV cDNA conferred V beta 16 T cell stimulating properties on to these cells. It is concluded that expression of the product of this MMTV-LTR mRNA provides RCS with the strong T cell stimulating properties that it needs for its growth. These results thus identify a novel oncogenic property of MMTV-LTR...|$|R
40|$|Our {{recently}} proposed functional {{approach to}} and classification of the malignant lymphomata {{based upon the}} T and B cell systems, lymphocyte transformation and their development as blocks or a "switch on" in lymphocyte transformation has been reviewed. This functional classification contains 5 major groups: (a) U cell or undefined for those proliferations without specific markers; (b) T cell; (c) B cell; (d) histiocytes as macrophages; (e) unclassifiable for those technically insufficient for specific cytological classification. Retrospective study of several case populations indicates {{that the majority of}} non-Hodgkin's lymphomata exhibit features of follicular centre cell (FCC) lymphomata of either cleaved or non-cleaved types. The prognostically favourable status of nodular lymphomata seems to result from the retained capability of follicle formation by FCC types with limited abnormality. Lymphomata of large cell types previously classified as histiocytic <b>lymphoma</b> or <b>reticulum</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sarcoma</b> predominantly resemble transformed lymphocytes and rarely exhibit features of histiocytes as macrophages. They are designated "immunoblastic sarcoma" when they occur as large transformed lymphocytes and may have either T or B cell immunological markers. Immunoblastic sarcoma has been observed to develop in individuals with chronic abnormal immune states, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, alpha chain disease, in patients on immunosuppression therapy for graft rejection and in senescence. There is accumulating evidence of lymphomata of T cells but none are firmly established. These include SÃ©zary's syndrome, mycosis fungoides and the convoluted lymphocyte type, prev-ously included designated as acute lymphocytic leukaemia with mediatinal mass. The results of initial functional studies provide support for the proposed classification and indicate that the modern pathological investigative approach requires the collection of fresh lymphomatous tissue and an integrated immunocytochemical and morphological approach for the precise characterization of human lymphoma cell types...|$|R
40|$|Most {{humans in}} the United States have been {{infected}} with BK virus (BKV), a human papovavirus. Because BKV has oncogenic properties, we have investigated whether {{it may be a}} cause of human cancer. Basic principles of tumor virology imply that BKV-induced tumors should contain BKV DNA sequences. Therefore, we assayed (by molecular hybridization) DNA from human tumors and malignant cell lines for BKV DNA, using BKV [32 P]DNA as probe. The BKV [32 P]DNA was labeled in vitro (nick translation) to specific activities of 1 to 2 × 108 cpm/μg. The BKV DNA used to prepare our probes had the properties expected of authentic BKV genomes, including density of superhelical DNA, sedimentation velocity in alkaline and neutral sucrose gradients, production of one fragment by endonuclease EcoRI cleavage and four fragments by endonuclease Hin II + III cleavage and reassociation properties. From these studies we conclude that our BKV probes hybridized well, and represented bona fide BKV DNA. Using three different BKV [32 P]DNA probes, i. e., from three distinct plaque isolates, we have analyzed DNA from BKV-transformed cells, normal human tissues, and a large number of human tumors. All human DNAs (cell lines, normal tissues, tumors) hybridized 5 % with BKV DNA. Hybridization analysis of BKV-transformed hamster cell DNA indicated 5 - 6 copies of at least 88 % of the BKV genome per cell. No BKV DNA sequences were detected (above the normal 5 % hybridization to all human DNAs) in the following normal human tissues: 10 kidney (BKV is usually isolated from urine), 3 spleen, 13 lung, 23 colon, 2 rectum, 1 ileum, and 1 skin. No BKV-specific DNA was found in 166 tumors, including 5 carcinomas (Ca) of stomach, 3 Ca small intestine, 26 Ca colon, 9 Ca rectum, 31 Ca lung, 9 adenocarcinomas and 5 oat cell carcinomas of lung, 17 melanomas, 5 Ca prostate, 4 Ca bladder, 6 Wilms tumors, 4 hypernephromas, 15 Ca kidney, 7 brain tumors, 5 Hodgkin lymphomas, 10 lymphomas (immunosuppressed patients have a high incidence of <b>lymphomas),</b> 2 <b>reticulum</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sarcomas</b> (spleen), and 3 skin tumors. We have also analyzed 7 human malignant cell lines (melanoma, lung, rhabdomyosarcoma, and glioblastomas), including several clones of a lung melanoma line; no BKV DNA sequences were detected. Because our probes could detect one copy of BKV DNA if only 10 % of the cells were tumor cells, our results are very strong evidence that the tumors we analyzed did not have a BKV etiology. The tumors we tested represent about 50 % of all cancers in the United States; {{there is no evidence that}} BKV is involved in the etiology of these types of tumors...|$|R
