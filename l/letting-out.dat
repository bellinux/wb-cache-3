50|$|Since the Government of India is {{considering}} {{to hand over}} the historical 'Kangla Fort' measuring about 237.62 acre, after its vacation by the Assam Rifles, on 20 November 2004 in presence of the Prime Minister of India, the State Cabinet has recently approved the draft 'Kangla Fort Ordinance, 2004'. It is proposed to promulgate this 'Ordinance' soon after the possession of the 'Kangla Fort' is handed over to the State Government by the Assam Rifles. Once the proposed law comes into force, the administration and management of the 'Kangla Fort' would vest in the 'Kangla Fort Board' under the Chairmanship of the Hon'ble Chief Minister, Manipur. In the proposed law, specific provision has been made to prohibit sale, lease, <b>letting-out,</b> transfer or alienation of entire land under 'Kangla Fort' in any form whatsoever.|$|E
