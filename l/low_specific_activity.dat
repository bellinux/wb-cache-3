40|$|Understanding the postmortem {{changes at}} ambient aquatic {{temperature}} {{can be useful}} for estimating {{the time of death}} in environmental forensic studies when little information is available. Muscle degradation was investigated in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in terms of the <b>specific</b> <b>activities</b> of cathepsins (B, H and L) and the scavenging activities and thermal transition properties of myosin and actin, to assess postmortem changes with time (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48  h after death). The study results are relevant to ambient temperatures in Thailand, (about 30  °C). The <b>specific</b> <b>activities</b> of the three cathepsin enzymes increased significantly with postmortem time (p <  0. 05) and had a highly significant positive relationship (r =  0. 987 − 0. 997, p <  0. 01, n =  32). Cathepsin H had the <b>lowest</b> <b>specific</b> <b>activity</b> and exhibited a different type of time profile. Its <b>lowest</b> <b>specific</b> <b>activity</b> was observed at 8  h, which indicated a significant role {{at this point in time}} after death.

The thermal properties of myosin and actin were observed up to a 24  h delay. The degradation of each protein fluctuated with the delay time; actin was more sensitive to postmortem delay than myosin. Overall, the findings from the current study might be used as primary data to estimate the time of death of an aquatic animal.

Since the incubation times are much shorter using the protocol for purification via functionalized magnetic beads, {{it was suggested that}} the hydantoinase was maybe exposed to proteolytic digestion during the incubation of the crude cell extract with the Ni Sepharose beads in spite of the added protease inhibitor.
