5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never <b>laid</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna {{takes the form of}} the beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E

On 3 October she departed Spithead to join Vice-Admiral Nelson's fleet blockading Villeneuve's combined fleet in Cádiz.

Succeeding in evading the French, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron on 13 October, and when Nelson <b>laid</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the approaching ship he reportedly exclaimed: [...] "Here comes that damned fool Berry!

Villa the reincarnation of the old legend; Villa as Providence, the bandit, that passes through the world armed with the blazing torch of an ideal: to rob the rich and give to the poor. It was the poor who built up and imposed a legend about him which Time itself was to increase and embellish as a shining example from generation to generation." [...] However, a little later, one character distrusts the rumors: [...] "Anastasio Montañéz questioned the speaker more particularly.

That kind of shakes the starch out of the brotherly love and New Jerusalem business. You go through the mill, and you'll have a bigger grudge against every old shellback that dirties his plate in the three oceans than the Bank of California could settle up.
