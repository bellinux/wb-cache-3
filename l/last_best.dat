5|$|The {{railways}} {{would not}} build across the western frontier without settlement {{as it would}} be too costly to provide train service across a barren wilderness. The Clifford Sifton immigration policy encourages settlers to arrive. Western settlement began and immigration encroached across the Manitoba boundary into the North-West Territories, later to become Saskatchewan. Immigration settlement to the <b>last</b> <b>best</b> west and the highway early beginnings began in the southeast. The federal government survey crew reached this southeastern area of the District of Assiniboia, North-West Territories in 1880. In 1881, the province of Manitoba expanded to its present boundaries and land could be purchased for $10 an acre. U.S. President Lincoln's Homestead Act was passed in 1862 and lands there were taken. In 1872, Canada passed the Dominion Lands Act, attracting homesteaders to the West.|$|E

25|$|There is no agreed {{view on the}} net {{impact of}} {{immigration}} in current times. Historically, Canada's unusually high immigration rates {{can be traced to}} the nation's unique economy. One factor is that Canada has one of the world's largest supplies of natural resources such as oil, metals, and lumber. It also has a sparse population spread over a vast landscape. Canada has thus faced acute labour shortages and has responded by actively searching for immigrants. In the late 19th century this included bringing Chinese migrants to build the Canadian Pacific Railway and actively advertising in Europe to find farmers with the <b>Last</b> <b>Best</b> West campaign. Today similar recruitment efforts are needed to staff the oil sands projects in Alberta.|$|E

25|$|Long an {{advocate}} of free silver and currency reform, Flower came out strongly for the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan during the heated election of 1896. Flower portrayed Bryan as the defender of freedom, prosperity, and the Republic. Flower urged Arena readers to support Bryan as the <b>last</b> <b>best</b> chance to stave off encroaching plutocracy in America. The year 1896 {{marked the end of}} Flower's first stint at the helm of The Arena, with the magazine being transferred to the editorship of historian John Clark Ridpath and the writer Helen Hamilton Gardener. Under its new editors, Flower's magazine continued to pursue the same political and ethical mission originally envisioned by its founder. Flower continued to contribute articles to the journal regularly throughout the subsequent interval.|$|E
25|$|The {{railways}} {{would not}} build across the western frontier without settlement {{as it would}} be too costly to provide train service across a barren wilderness. The Clifford Sifton immigration policy encourages settlers to arrive. Western settlement began and immigration encroached across the Manitoba and United States borders into the North West Territories which later became Saskatchewan.

25|$|Bieber {{suffered}} a serious loss at industrial equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc., however. The UAW struck Caterpillar in 1982, a strike that (by 1993) {{was the longest}} in UAW history and which had severely drained the union's strike fund. But by 1989, the UAW was praising the Caterpillar contract. But Caterpillar began a restructuring program that reduced its workforce by 30 percent while building new plants in the non-union Deep South. By 1991, only 25 percent of its workforce belonged to the UAW. The UAW had negotiated a new contract with John Deere, the giant agricultural machinery manufacturer, and it asked Caterpillar for the same terms. Caterpillar refused, instead demanding major concessions such as a two-tier wage system, the right to subcontract work out to non-union companies, the imposition of 12-hour work shifts, weaker safety rules, a weaker grievance system, greatly scaled back health benefits, {{and the right to}} impose flexible work schedules on workers. About 1,870 workers in Decatur, Illinois, struck on November 3, and Caterpillar instituted a nationwide lockout (even in those plants not on strike). Soon more than 13,400 Caterpillar workers were walking the picket line. Caterpillar ended the lockout on March 16, 1992, but few employees went back to work. Caterpillar tendered what it called its <b>last,</b> <b>best</b> offer to Bieber three days later, but he rejected the proposal. Caterpillar announced an impasse on March 5, and on April 1 sent all workers a letter demanding that they return to work by April 6 or the company would permanently replace them. Between 400 and 1,200 workers crossed the picket line to return to work (estimates very widely). At the urging of federal mediators, Bieber met one-on-one with Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Donald V. Fites. Bieber left the meeting convinced that the UAW had no alternative but to accept Caterpillar's offer. UAW members back to work on the company's terms.|$|E

500|$|Astronomers and {{stargazers}} appreciate Cherry Springs State Park for {{the darkness}} and clarity of its skies, which make it [...] "perhaps the <b>last</b> <b>best</b> refuge of the natural night sky" [...] in {{the eastern half of}} the United States. The sky at Cherry Springs has been classified as a 2on the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, meaning it has almost no light pollution. Such [...] "truly dark, starry skies are unavailable to two-thirds of the world's population, including 99percent of people in the continental U.S. and Western Europe". With optimum conditions, 10,000stars are visible with the naked eye at the park, clouds appear only as black holes in the starry sky, and the Milky Way is so bright that it casts a discernible shadow. In contrast, big city residents can see a few dozen stars at best, and even those in rural areas can typically only see 2,000–3,000stars. The Milky Way cannot be seen by most in the eastern US, even when there is no moonlight to obscure it.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, What's So Amazing About Grace? placed 17th on Christianity Todays list {{of fifty}} books that had most shaped Evangelicals. That year, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, {{compared}} What's So Amazing About Grace? to Chuck Swindoll's book The Grace Awakening, calling both [...] "wonderful books on grace [...] did {{a valuable service}} rescuing the doctrine of grace from the legalists who say that we must earn our salvation". Christian professor Craig Detweiler writes in his 2008 book A Purple State of Mind: Finding Middle Ground in a Divided Culture that, {{if he could have}} given his students a graduation present, {{it would have been a}} copy of What's So Amazing About Grace? because many of his Christian students were more concerned with avoiding the forbidden than they were with enjoying the permitted. Detweiler writes that Christianity was founded on forgiveness and that Christians should not bear the burden of guilt, and he therefore agrees with Yancey that [...] "grace" [...] is [...] "our <b>last</b> <b>best</b> word".|$|E
500|$|In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey {{discusses}} grace, {{calling it}} [...] "our <b>last</b> <b>best</b> word". The book's thesis is that, although people crave grace {{and it is}} centrally important to the gospel, many local churches ignore grace {{in their quest to}} exterminate immorality. Yancey uses the word [...] "ungrace" [...] to describe actions that fail to demonstrate grace. According to the author, the greatest gift the Christian Church can give the world is grace, but the church sometimes offers ungrace instead. Yancey writes that there are secular analogues to most Christian activities benefiting the world, such as social justice work and community service, but that [...] "grace is theological; it comes from God. It's one thing the church can offer that isn't found anywhere else". He describes his experiences attempting to make grace part of the way he lived and not just part of his theology. Yancey quotes Christian counselor David Seamands: [...] "The two major causes of most emotional problems among Evangelical Christians are these: the failure to understand, receive and live out God's unconditional grace and forgiveness; and the failure to give out that unconditional love, forgiveness, and grace to other people".|$|E
