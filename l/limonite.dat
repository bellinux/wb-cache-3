5|$|Use {{of nickel}} (as a natural {{meteoric}} nickel–iron alloy) has been traced {{as far back}} as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), that personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore <b>limonite,</b> which often contains 1–2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore minerals include garnierite, and pentlandite. Major production sites include the Sudbury region in Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, and Norilsk in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Nickel {{mineralisation}} in the regolith, in {{the upper}} saprolite typically exists as goethite, hematite, <b>limonite</b> and {{is often associated with}} polydymite and violarite, nickel sulfides which are of supergene association.

25|$|The {{limestone}} flux for the furnaces was largely shipped from local quarries. A mixture of about 75% <b>limonite</b> and 25% magnetite ore {{was used to}} supply the furnace. Most of the <b>limonite</b> was mined locally: the first batch of ore smelted at the furnace was supplied by Henry Hoch's mine (also referred to as Rice's mine) in Schoenersville nearby, and the mine was an important supplier of the ironworks for years, being worked from 1840 to 1908. Some magnetite came from the Wieand mine (also {{referred to as the}} Mann mine) at Vera Cruz, but it was principally shipped from the Irondale-area, Byram, and Dickerson Mines in New Jersey. Anthracite came from the LC's mines, shipped by canal boat for many years, and later by rail.|$|E

40|$|The Grevillea deposit is a newly {{discovered}} Pb-Zn-Ag stratabound sediment-hosted deposit in the Lawn Hill Region of NNW Queensland. It lies {{in part of}} the Mount Isa Inlier which {{has been described as}} one of the richest mineral provinces in the world. The study undertook varied geochemical analyses for determining element variations and the relationships, and elemental partitions in the regolith units. It was found that TI, Pb, Si, Fe are surface indicators of mineralisation for the Grevillea deposit. Two types of rock units dominated the regolith, which overlies the massive pyrite zone: the jarosite <b>limonites</b> and the hematite <b>limonites,</b> and both act as sponges for metals derived from the ore. The jarosite types in the area are likely plumbojarosite and argentojarosite. Textures were also studied in outcrop, on a handspecimen scale, and on microscopic scales to search for evidence of primary sulfides. Sections of ore sample were studied and some links were made to surface textures. These included sedimentary features, bladed and platey hematite, and framboidal structures. Light rare earth minerals (monazites) in the core were an unexpected unusual find as they are not normally associated with sedex style deposits. The monazites may have useful application in dating the deposit or gossan formation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe SOLSA project (www. solsa-mining. eu) aims {{to develop}} an on-line-on-mine expert system {{coupling}} sonic drilling, chemical and mineralogical analyses and data treatment. In a first place, this expert system is planned for lateritic profiles of New Caledonia, known to held nickel. The latter is found in two forms in these profiles. First, nickel can be adsorbed on the surface or inserted {{in the structure of}} goethite (α-FeOOH) present in the <b>limonites</b> and saprolites. Second, Ni may substitute Mg in different silicates of saprolite, like in garnierite, known to be nickel-rich and corresponding to a mixture of phyllosilicates usually occurring as vein or porosity filling. The SOLSA system will combine several analytical techniques, such as XRD, XRF, Raman spectroscopy, RGB or hyperspectral, and the data collected will be compared to an internal library in order to identify the several minerals present in the lateritic profiles. Therefore, the elaboration of a comprehensive library, taking into account the influence of chemistry on the different signals, is mandatory. Thus, our study focuses on the evolution of the hyperspectral signal (400 - 2500 nm) with the quantity of nickel for several Ni-bearing silicates present in the lateritic profile. Among the results, nickel influences the behaviour of the doublet in the 1380 - 1405 nm region for the specific mineral association constituting the garnierite. References: Faust, G.

40|$|The exotic orebodies {{related to}} cal-alkaline {{porphyry}} copper deposits. are sub-horizontal lenticular bodies of secondary copper minerals that impregnate Tertiary gravels and bedrock of different ages. They lie immediately downslope of the porphyry copper deposits, {{that is to}} say. they {{are related to the}} propylitic halo of the main deposits, and are considered to have originated with the deposition of copper minerals from solutions that overflowed during the secondary enrichment process. Supergene alteration took place between the late Oligocene and Miocene, by which time both orehodies (exotic and porphyry copper) were established. The paucity of tile denudation since the Miocene in the Andean segment from 21 º to 26 º latitude S. due to the dominance of a hyperarid climate explains the remarkable preservation of the shallow porphyry copper systems, supergene enriched blankets and associated deposits. This is reflected in the <b>limonites,</b> where the typical boxworks have been partially or totally destroyed on surface by the superleaching. As a result of the lateral migration of the copper-bearing solutions, the exotic deposits show a zonation. alteration and mineralization whose characteristics depend among other factors. on the reactivity of the bedrocks and the Cu/S ratio of the mother deposit. In these deposits three zones can be recognized: Proximal (0 to 2 km Intermediate (2 to 3) and Distal (3 to 8 - 14 km) with palaeodrainage control. The associations and mineralogical abundance are related to the climate (rain. temperature). In some deposits two important units are detected and they are the Cu-phosphates and Cu-lixiviable (to sulphuric acid) units. The size of tile Chilean exotic deposits varies between 100 and 3. 500. 000 tons of copper, with a total known resource of 8 M tons of copper. The large exotic deposits are comparable to the resources of a medium-sized porphyry copper- type deposit. The discovery of the exotic deposits is related to the exploration of porphyry copper deposits, where a mass balance of the leached column must be done. Moreover the lithology and alteration of the propylitic halo. permeability, structures, geophysics and geochemistry should be considered. The diorite model is not compatible with a supergene enrichment process, expressed by the absence of colour anomalies, exotic deposits and in the presence of secondary minerals like jarosite, which is coherent with the pyrite deficiency of the system. The projects are for exploitation of reserves by open pit methods. The projects plan to extract and to crush copper oxide ore which will he pre-treated with concentrated sulphuric acid prior to heap leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning. The copper output varies between 10, 000 and 50, 000 ton per year of catilode copper. The total investment varies between 20 and 100 millions dollars. For project calculations, estimation of 65 % - 82 % copper recovery and 37 - 40 kg/ton net acid consumption can be used {{due to the nature of}} ore. The leaching time is estimated as 30 to 180 days for heaps of 4, 5 to 30 metres high. As a result of this, the plant capacity is determined by an annual equivalent of 10, 000 to 25, 000 ton Cu per year. Pit planning has heen carried out using diverse software on the basis of 5 x 5 x 5 m and 10 x 10 x 10 m block models, evaluated using a kriging package built into the program, giving an overall waste/ore ratio (induding pre-stripping) of 0 : I (in an outcrop) to 3 : I. The location of the mine and plant sites are associated with the porphyry copper in production, for this the already installed facilities can be used. So there is no need to build a new mine camp or access.

25|$|As a {{secondary}} mineral, turquoise forms by {{the action of}} percolating acidic aqueous solutions during the weathering and oxidation of preexisting minerals. For example, the copper may come from primary copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite or from the secondary carbonates malachite or azurite; the aluminium may derive from feldspar; and the phosphorus from apatite. Climate factors appear {{to play an important role}} as turquoise is typically found in arid regions, filling or encrusting cavities and fractures in typically highly altered volcanic rocks, often with associated <b>limonite</b> and other iron oxides. In the Southwestern United States turquoise is almost invariably associated with the weathering products of copper sulfide deposits in or around potassium-feldspar-bearing porphyritic intrusives. In some occurrences alunite, potassium aluminium sulfate, is a prominent secondary mineral. Typically turquoise mineralization is restricted to a relatively shallow depth of less than , although it does occur along deeper fracture zones where secondary solutions have greater penetration or the depth to the water table is greater.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of the region that has strongly influenced the mode of life there ever since the Iron Age is its abundance of metals, in particular of iron. The settlers began then to combine agriculture with iron extraction. This exploitation has left numerous traces inside the park. Certain zones in the park were themselves used as extraction sites, such as Tinäset, where <b>limonite</b> was extracted from the marsh. The iron industry in the region necessitated a huge consumption of wood which initially justified silviculture in the park. Accordingly, the woods of Tinäset, for example, were heavily logged to feed the silver mine of Sala. At the end of the 19th century, many mills were constructed along the river: they were used for timber rafting. This activity ceased upon the creation of dams along the river. Gysinge has a timber rafting museum. The wettest forests largely escaped the logging industry, thereby serving as sanctuaries of biodiversity during this period of exploitation.|$|E

2500|$|Nevada is the country's {{other major}} producer, {{with more than}} 120 mines which have yielded {{significant}} quantities of turquoise. Unlike elsewhere in the US, most Nevada mines have been worked primarily for their gem turquoise and very little has been recovered as a byproduct of other mining operations. Nevada turquoise is found as nuggets, fracture fillings and in breccias as the cement filling interstices between fragments. Because of the geology of the Nevada deposits, {{a majority of the}} material produced is hard and dense, being of sufficient quality that no treatment or enhancement is required. While nearly every county in the state has yielded some turquoise, the chief producers are in Lander and Esmeralda counties. Most of the turquoise deposits in Nevada occur along a wide belt of tectonic activity that coincides with the state's zone of thrust faulting. It strikes about N15°E and extends from the northern part of Elko County, southward down to the California border southwest of Tonopah. Nevada has produced a wide diversity of colours and mixes of different matrix patterns, with turquoise from Nevada coming in various shades of blue, blue-green, and green. Some of this unusually coloured turquoise may contain significant zinc and iron, which is the cause of the beautiful bright green to yellow-green shades.
