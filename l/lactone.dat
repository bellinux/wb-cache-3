40|$|Novozym 435 -catalyzed {{ring-opening}} of a {{range of}} w-methylated <b>lactones</b> demonstrates fascinating differences in rate of reaction and enantioselectivity. A switch from S- to R-selectivity was obsd. upon going from small (ring sizes ? 7) to large <b>lactones</b> (ring sizes 2 ̆ 6 gt;= 8). This was attributed to the transition from a cisoid to a transoid conformational preference of the ester bond on going from small to large <b>lactones.</b> The S-selectivity of the ring-opening of the small, cisoid <b>lactones</b> was low to moderate, while the R-selectivity of the ring-opening of the large transoid <b>lactones</b> was surprisingly high. The S-selectivity of the ring-opening of the small, cisoid <b>lactones</b> combined with the established R-selectivity of the transesterification of (aliph.) secondary alcs. prevented polymn. from taking place. Ring-opening of the large, transoid <b>lactones</b> was R-selective with high enantioselectivity.

5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} <b>lactone</b> {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E

40|$|Lipase-catalyzed {{ring-opening}} polymerizations of <b>lactones</b> {{with various}} ring sizes (6 - to 13 - and the 16 -membered ring) employing Novozym 435 demonstrate fascinating {{differences in their}} polymerization rates. These differences cannot be related to variations in physical properties such as the dipole moment of the <b>lactones</b> only. For example, 10 -decanolactone, 11 -undecanolactone, and 12 -dodecanolactone show dipole moments of around 1. 9 D, but the initial rate constant of their Novozym 435 -catalyzed polymerization {{was found to be}} 0. 10, 0. 38, and 4. 91 h- 1, respectively. The Michaelis-Menten constants KM and Vmax were measured for all <b>lactones,</b> and this revealed that the KM was more or less independent of the ring size, suggesting similar affinities of the lipase for all <b>lactones,</b> while no obvious trend could be discerned for Vmax. However, conformational strain and transannular interactions present in medium ring <b>lactones</b> (ring size 8 - 12) affect the reactivity of these <b>lactones</b> in lipase catalysis in a similar way as was previously described for the alkaline hydrolysis of <b>lactones,</b> rationalizing the low reactivity of the 10 - 12 -membered rings and the high reactivity of the 8 -membered ring. To our surprise, there is a large discrepancy in lipase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerizations compared to the alkaline hydrolysis reactions with respect to the relative reactivity of <b>lactones</b> possessing a cisoid conformation of the ester bond: while the ratio in rates between -valerolactone and 12 -dodecanolactone in a alkaline hydrolysis is 9400, the ratio in rates using Novozym 435 -catalyzed polymerization is only 3. In fact, in the latter case <b>lactones</b> possessing a cisoid conformation are less reactive than large ring <b>lactones</b> possessing a transoid conformation. This mechanistic study also furnished polyesters with an increasing number of methylenes in their repeat unit. The polyesters can be readily prepared in reasonable molecular weights (2 ̆ 6 gt; 10 000 g/mol).
