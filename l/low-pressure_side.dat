50|$|Each {{side of the}} {{locomotive}} had its own separate engine, as with conventional locomotives. This eliminated the connections between sides characteristic of cross-compound engines, where the low- and high-pressure cylinders were on opposite sides. The direct flow of steam between the high- and low-pressure cylinders {{on each side of}} {{the locomotive}} eliminated the need for a receiving chamber to store the steam. It also avoided subjecting the locomotive frame to unequal forces from separate high- and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>sides.</b> The whole package was compact and took up little more space than conventional equipment. Indeed, at first glance from the side the Vauclain compound can be mistaken for a conventional simple locomotive; the only giveaways are the unusual arrangement of the crosshead and (viewed from the front) the extra cylinder.|$|R

40|$|Many flows can be {{characterized}} as leakage flows from high-pressure <b>sides</b> to <b>low-pressure</b> <b>sides,</b> resulting in increased inefficiency. This paper experimentally explores reducing leakage flows using periodic excitation. A synthetic jet actuator was used as the periodic excitation source in this experiment. The synthetic jet when excited periodically produces momentum but no net mass flux. Two speakers were used in these experiments as actuators: a high-frequency compression driver and a low-frequency woofer. The speaker exit cavity was covered with plates leaving only a small rectangular orifice exit for the synthetic jet. An airtight plexiglass box with a small gap was used to create a simulated leakage flow. The synthetic jet was then directed normally into the leakage flow to reduce the effective gap. The variables considered were as follows: the momentum flux ratio of the actuator over the leakage flow, the reduced frequency, the ratio of the height of the clearance gap over the thickness of the gap, and the ratio of the width of the orifice exit over the thickness o...|$|R

50|$|Gifford-McMahon (GM) coolers {{have found}} {{widespread}} application in many low-temperature systems; e.g., in MRI and cryopumps. Fig. 5 is a schematic diagram. Helium at pressures in the 10 to 30 bar range is the working fluid. The cold head contains a compression and expansion space, a regenerator, and a displacer. Usually the regenerator and the displacer are combined in one body. The pressure {{variations in the}} cold head are obtained by connecting it periodically to the high- and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>sides</b> of a compressor by a rotating valve. Its position is synchronized with {{the motion of the}} displacer. During the opening and closing of the valves irreversible processes take place, so GM-coolers have intrinsic losses. This is a clear disadvantage of this type of cooler. The advantage is that the cycle frequencies of the compressor and the displacer are uncoupled so that the compressor can run at power-line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) while the cycle of the cold head is 1 Hz. In this way the swept volume of the compressor can be 50 (60) times smaller than of the cooler. Basically (cheap) compressors of domestic refrigerators can be used, but one must prevent overheating of the compressor as it is not designed for helium. One must also prevent oil vapor from entering the regenerator by high-quality purification traps.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} illustrations {{depict the}} type of reed typical of harmonicas, pitch pipes, accordions, and reed organs as it goes through a cycle of vibration. One side of the reed frame is omitted from the images for clarity; in reality, the frame completely encloses the reed. Airflow over {{one side of the}} reed creates an area of low pressure on that side (see the Bernoulli's principle article for details), causing the reed to flex towards the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>side.</b> The reed frame is constructed so that the flexing of the reed obstructs the airflow, which reduces or eliminates the low pressure area and allows the reed to flex back.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between how high-pressure and low-pressure steam engines {{work is the}} source of the force that moves the piston. In Newcomen's and Watt's engines, it is the condensation of the steam that creates most of the pressure difference, causing atmospheric pressure (Newcomen) or low-pressure steam (Watt) to push the piston; the internal pressures never greatly exceed atmospheric pressure. In a high-pressure engine, most of the pressure difference is provided by the high-pressure steam from the boiler; the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the piston may be at atmospheric pressure or, if it is connected to a condenser, this only provides a small proportion of the pressure difference.|$|E
50|$|For {{getting the}} cooling, {{the source of}} the {{pressure}} variations is unimportant. PTRs for temperatures below 20 K usually operate at frequencies of 1 to 2 Hz and with pressure variations from 10 to 25 bar. The swept volume of the compressor would be very high (up to one liter and more). Therefore, the compressor is uncoupled from the cooler. A system of valves (usually a rotating valve) alternatingly connects the high-pressure and the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the compressor to the hot end of the regenerator. As the high-temperature part of this type of PTR is the same as of GM-coolers this type of PTR is called a GM-type PTR. The gas flows through the valves are accompanied by losses which are absent in the Stirling-type PTR.|$|E
30|$|Another {{possible}} {{option is}} the feed pump {{driven by the}} shaft of the main turbine. The pump can be joined to the turbine shaft either at the high- or <b>low-pressure</b> turbine <b>side.</b> Both solutions {{were used in the}} past, but both increased costs and the turbo set complexity. A gear had to be applied because of the difference in the speed of the turbo set and the pump. As these solutions involved a bigger investment outlay and higher operational costs, they are no longer used. Their substantial drawback was also the forced and extremely unfavorable location of the feed pump in the powerhouse which caused additional construction problems.|$|R
50|$|The SACS {{system uses}} high volumes of engine oil aimed at {{strategic}} {{points of the}} engine, like {{the top of the}} combustion chamber, which are not typically well served by air cooling alone. In order to provide enough oil for both cooling and lubrication, the system uses a double-chamber oil pump, using the high-pressure side for lubrication of the parts (crankshaft, connecting rods, valvetrain), while the <b>low-pressure,</b> high-volume <b>side</b> provides oil to the cooling and filtering circuit. The oil removes heat from hot engine parts through direct contact, is pumped away and subsequently routed through the oil filter, followed by routing through an oil cooler before being returned to the main sump.|$|R

The high- and low-pressure cylinders were originally lagged with timber strips held on by brass bands, {{but most of the}} timber has rotted away. The high-pressure cylinder bore is about 15 inches (381 mm) in diameter while the low-pressure cylinder bore is about 24 inches (610 mm) in diameter. The stroke of both cylinders was 36 inches (914 mm), while the flywheel is 10 feet (3048 mm) in diameter, and 21 inches (533 mm) wide. The engine is mounted on a concrete base, with a concrete trough for the flywheel.|$|R
5000|$|The Joule-Thomson (JT) cooler {{was invented}} by Carl von Linde and William Hampson so it is also called the Linde-Hampson cooler. Basically {{it is a very}} simple type of cooler which is widely applied as {{cryocooler}} or as the (final stage) of liquefactors. It can easily be miniaturized, but it is also used on a very large scale in the liquefaction of natural gas. A schematic diagram of a JT liquefier is given in fig. 8. It consists of a compressor, a counterflow heat exchanger, a JT valve, and a reservoir. In fig. 8, the pressures and temperatures refer to the case of a nitrogen liquefier. At the inlet of the compressor the gas is at room temperature (300 K) and a pressure of 1 bar (point a). The compression heat is removed by cooling water. After compression the gas temperature is ambient temperature (300 K) and the pressure is 200 bar (point b). Next it enters the warm (high-pressure) side of the counterflow heat exchanger where it is precooled. It leaves the exchanger at point c. After the JT expansion, point d, it has a temperature of 77.36 K and a pressure of 1 bar. The liquid fraction is x. The liquid leaves the system {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir (point e) and the gas (fraction 1 − x) flows into the cold (<b>low-pressure)</b> <b>side</b> of the counterflow heat exchanger (point f). It leaves the heat exchanger at room temperature (point a). In order to keep the system in the steady state gas is supplied to compensate for the liquid fraction x that has been removed.|$|E

40|$|An inviscid, {{analytical}} model is provided for shocktube performance {{when there is}} a large, abrupt contraction in the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>side</b> of a tube. The analysis is independent of initial high-pressure side conditions. Only the ratio of specific heats of the low-pressure gas, the large-diameter tube’s incident shock Mach number, and the contraction ratio are needed for a nondimensional solution of the transmitted flow in the small-diameter tube. This solution is unique, readily evaluated, and various limits and constraints are discussed. Parametric calculations establish the increased magnitude of the transmitted shock Mach number relative to the shock Mach number for a tube without contraction. The Mach number increase, then increases the pressure and temperature downstream of the small-diameter tube’s incident and reflected shocks, again relative to a tube without a contraction.

The mass flow rate of the fluid injected into the blade wake is selected to reduce the momentum deficit of the wake to correspondingly increase the time-mean velocity of the wake and decrease the turbulent velocity fluctuations of the wake. With this fluid injection, reduction of both propagating broad band and tonal acoustic components of noise produced by interaction of the blade wake with a turbomachine component downstream of the rotating blade is achieved.

40|$|Abstract: Rectangular {{elastomeric}} seals used on {{reciprocating piston}} rods in high-pressure hydraulic actuators often suffer from extrusion damage at the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the actuators. The extrusion {{takes place at}} the narrow clearance between the rod and the actuator, where the seal develops a `nip’ under conditions of high sealed pressure and/or high friction with the rod, which is ampli®ed {{in the absence of a}} back-up ring. This form of strain can lead to permanent damage of the seal and impair the sealing performance of the system. This paper deals with the modelling of this kind of seal extrusion. Algebraic equations were developed to describe the shape and contact pressure of the extruded part of the seal with the rod. A study is presented about the effects of various operating parameters on the extent of seal extrusion in order to minimize the risks of damage.

The third mode (the LF discharge perturbed by an HF field) is observed when a small HF voltage is applied to the burning LF discharge. The range of parameters within which the first mode of the combined discharge may be extinguished by the LF voltage increase is shown to be limited by the HF discharge extinction curve from the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>side</b> as well as the lowest HF voltage for the transition of the discharge from the first mode to the second one...|$|E
