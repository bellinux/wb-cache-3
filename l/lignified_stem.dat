Surprisingly, MUR 1 mutation induced an enrichment of resistant interunit bonds in lignin and triggered the overexpression of many genes involved in lignified tissue formation and in jasmonic acid signaling. The defect in GDP-fucose synthesis induced a loss of cell adhesion at the interface between stele and cortex, as well as between interfascicular fibers. This {{led to the formation of}} regenerative xylem, where tissue detachment occurred, and underlined a loss of resistance to mechanical forces. Similar observations were also made on bor 1 - 3 mutant stems which are altered in boron xylem loading, leading us to suggest that diminished RG-II dimerization is responsible for regenerative xylem formation...|$|E

It allows statements on tension and pressure stability of plant stems and a direct comparison of stems with different anatomy. The multiplication of the Bic-value by an energy value (construction cost or energy content of the plant organ) results in a dimensionless constructive expenditure value, which is comparable to the value of the construction economy in architecture. This value may then be related to the average lifespan of the plant organ. Stems of Ephedra foeminea, Pachysandra terminalis, and Taxus baccata as well as flower stalks of Cyclamen persicum and Taraxacum officinale are investigated to show the applicability of the method. The lowest Bic- values (highest mechanical stability) are found for the <b>lignified</b> <b>stems</b> of Ephedra and Taxus. The constructive expenditure values are higher in herbaceous than in woody axes; in relation to the average life span the long-living lignified tissues show by far the lowest values.

The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative N-terminal signal peptide for mitochondrial targeting. The polypeptide is similar to other δ-OATs from plants, yeast, and mammals and encoded by a single-copy gene in pine. PsδOAT encodes a functional δ-OAT as determined by expression of the recombinant protein in Escherichia coli {{and analysis of the}} active enzyme. The expression of PsδOAT was undetectable in the embryo, but highly induced at early stages of germination and seedling development in all different organs. Transcript levels decreased in later developmental stages, although an increase was observed in <b>lignified</b> <b>stems</b> of 90 -d-old plants. An increase of δ-OAT activity was observed in germinating embryos and seedlings and appears to mirror the observed alterations in PsδOAT transcript levels. Similar expression patterns were also observed for genes encoding arginase and isocitrate dehydrogenase. Transcripts of PsδOAT and the arginase gene were found widely distributed in different cell types of pine organs. Consistent with these results a metabolic pathway is proposed for the nitrogen flow from the megagametophyte to the developing seedling, which is also supported by the relative abundance of free amino acids in embryos and seedlings. Taken together, our data support that δ-OAT {{plays an important role in}} this process providing glutamate for glutamine biosynthesis during early pine growth...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{walls are}} {{comprised}} of networks of entangled polymers that differ considerably between species, tissues and developmental stages. The cell walls of grasses, {{a family that}} encompasses major crops, contain specific polysaccharide structures such as xylans substituted with feruloylated arabinose residues. Ferulic acid {{is involved in the}} grass cell wall assembly by mediating linkages between xylan chains and between xylans and lignins. Ferulic acid contributes to the physical properties of cell walls, it is a hindrance to cell wall degradability (thus biomass conversion and silage digestibility) and may contribute to pest resistance. Many steps leading to the formation of grass xylans and their cross-linkages remain elusive. One explanation might originate from the fact that many studies were performed on <b>lignified</b> <b>stem</b> tissues. Pathways leading to lignins and feruloylated xylans share several steps, and lignin may impede the release and thus the quantification of ferulic acid. To overcome these difficulties, we used the pericarp of the maize B 73 line as a model to study feruloylated xylan synthesis and crosslinking. Using Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy and biochemical analyses, we show that this tissue has a low lignin content and is composed of approximately 50 % heteroxylans and approximately 5 % ferulic acid. Our study shows that, to date, maize pericarp contains the highest level of ferulic acid reported in plant tissue. The detection of feruloylated xylans with a polyclonal antibody shows that the occurrence of these polysaccharides is developmentally regulated in maize grain. We used the genomic tools publicly available for the B 73 line to study the expression of genes within families involved or suggested {{to be involved in the}} phenylpropanoid pathway, xylan formation, feruloylation and their oxidative crosslinking. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the feruloylated moiety of xylans originated from feruloylCoA and is transferred by a member of the BAHD acyltransferase family.

40|$|The water {{transport}} pipeline in herbs {{is assumed to}} be more vulnerable to drought than in trees due to the formation of frequent embolisms (gas bubbles), which could be removed by the occurrence of root pressure, especially in grasses. Here, we studied hydraulic failure in herbaceous angiosperms by measuring the pressure inducing 50 % loss of hydraulic conductance (P 50) in stems of 26 species - mainly European grasses (Poaceae). Our measurements show a large range in P 50 from - 0. 5 to - 7. 5 MPa, which overlaps with 94 % of the woody angiosperm species in a worldwide, published dataset, and which strongly correlates with an aridity 52 index. Moreover, the P 50 values obtained were substantially more negative than the midday water potentials for five grass species monitored throughout the entire growing season, suggesting that embolism formation and repair are not routine and mainly occur under water deficits. These results show that both herbs and trees share the ability to withstand very negative water potentials without embolism formation in their xylem conduits during drought stress. In addition, structure function trade-offs in grass stems reveal that more resistant species are more lignified which was confirmed for herbaceous and closely related woody species of the daisy group (Asteraceae). Our findings could imply that herbs with more <b>lignified</b> <b>stems</b> will become more abundant in future grasslands under more frequent and severe droughts, potentially resulting in lower forage digestibility...|$|R

Loquat undergoes lignification not only in vegetative tissues but also in flesh of postharvest fruit, which adversely affects consumer acceptance. Thus, researches on lignin biosynthesis and regulation are important to understand loquat fruit lignification. In loquat, a gene encoding an enzyme in the lignin biosynthesis pathway, Ej 4 CL 1, {{was reported to be}} regulated by transcription factors, including EjMYB 1, EjMYB 2, EjMYB 8 and EjAP 2 - 1, knowledge of this process is still limited. With the aim of identifying novel transcriptional factors controlling lignin biosynthesis in loquat, the promoter of Ej 4 CL 1 was utilized to screen a cDNA library by yeast one hybrid assay. A novel R 2 R 3 MYB, named EjODO 1, was identified. Real-time PCR analyses indicated that EjODO 1 is highly expressed in <b>lignified</b> <b>stems</b> and roots. During fruit development, expression of EjODO 1 decreased along with the reduction of lignin content and became undetectable in mature ripe fruit. Thus, EjODO 1 is likely to be involved in lignification of vegetative organs and early fruit development but not in mature fruit or postharvest lignification. Dual-luciferase assay indicated that EjODO 1 could trans-activate promoters of lignin biosynthesis genes, such as EjPAL 1, Ej 4 CL 1 and Ej 4 CL 5 and transient overexpression of EjODO 1 triggered lignin biosynthesis. These results indicate a role for EjODO 1 in regulating lignin biosynthesis in loquat which is different from the previously characterized transcription factors...|$|R

Light and transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the vascular system during plant growth; cellulose, lignin and callose were detected by cytochemistry. The innermost cortical layer differentiated as a starch sheath during primary growth. The outermost parenchymatous layers of the interfascicular region lignified the walls {{at the onset of}} fascicular cambium activity. The secondary structure formed during silique production. In the internodes, the interfascicular cambium was mainly produced by starch sheath cells. In the interfascicular arcs of the internode, the secondary xylem mainly consists of xylem parenchyma whereas in the bundle region, it comprises vessels. Secondary phloem and xylary fibres were produced in limited quantities. Medullary sheath and phloem cap cells also became lignified.

We assessed near-infrared reflec-tance spectroscopy (NIRS) as a high-throughput technique to measure cell wall (CW) degradability in {{a large number of}} <b>lignified</b> alfalfa <b>stem</b> samples. We also used a powerful immu-nological approach, glycome profiling, and chemical analyses to increase our knowledge of the composition of CW poly-saccharides of alfalfa stems with various levels of degradabil-ity. NIRS accurately predicted CW degradability in four different alfalfa cultivars, as assessed by glucose released following enzymatic saccharification (R 200. 94). There was a large genetic diversity for enzyme-released glucose. The 10 genotypes with the highest (D+) and 10 genotypes with the lowest (D−) amounts of enzyme-released glucose of a biomass-type (Orca) and a winterhardy-type (54 V 54) cultivar were further characterized. Glycome profiling showed that there were very few differences in CW polysaccharide com-position between the two groups, although the D+ genotypes were at least 35 % more degradable than the D − genotypes. Determination of CW composition by chemical analyses showed that a higher lignin content of the D − genotypes was closely related to their lower enzyme-released glucose (R 0 − 0. 83). In each cultivar tested, 20 D+ genotypes and 20 D − genotypes were intercrossed to generate D+ and D − pop-ulations. Assessment of CW enzyme-released glucose in the progenies showed that this trait is genetically inherited.

Geminivirus disease incidence and severity of symptoms were most abundant on leaves of plants from cuttings of field-symptomatic (I) stems of the moderately-resistant TMS 4 (2) 1425 (63. 2 %) and the susceptible TMS 60506 (51. 1 %) genotypes while those from apparently symptom-free (H) stems of the resistant genotype TMS 30001 recorded significantly the least disease (0 %).

The degradation of tissue cell walls was evaluated for each fermentation time interval against a nondegraded mirror control section by light microscopy. Cell-wall thickness of lucerne stem tissues was measured using scanning electron microscopy for both control and fermented sections. Rate and extent of cell-wall degradation were calculated from these measurements. Non-lignified epidermis, collenchyma, chlorenchyma, cambium and primary xylem parenchyma were rapidly and completely degraded within the first 8 h of fermentation.

The phenomenon has been reported widely for both herbaceous and woody plants, and has implications for how plants adjust their size and form to survive in mechanically perturbed environments. While this response is {{an important aspect of}} the plant's architecture, little is known about how mechanical properties of the inflorescence stem are modified or how its primary and secondary tissues respond to mechanical perturbation. Methods: Plants of the Columbia- 0 ecotype were exposed to controlled brushing treatments and then submitted to three-point bending tests to determine stem rigidity and stiffness. Contributions of different tissues to the inflorescence stem geometry were analysed. Key Results: Perturbed plants showed little difference in stem diameter, were 50 % shorter, 75 % less rigid and 70 % less stiff than controls. Changes in mechanical properties were linked to significant changes in tissue geometry – size and position of the pith, lignified interfascicular tissue and cortex – as well as a reduction in density of <b>lignified</b> cells. <b>Stem</b> mechanical properties were modified by changes in primary tissues and thus differ from changes observed in most woody plants tested with indeterminate growth – even though a vascular cambium is present in the inflorescence axis. Conclusions: The study suggests that delayed development of key primary developmental features of the stem in this ecotype of Arabidopsis results in a ‘short and flexible' rather than a ‘short and rigid' strategy for maintaining upright axes in conditions of severe mechanical perturbation. The mechanism is comparable with more general phenomena in plants where changes in developmental rate can significantly affect the overall growth form of the plant in both ecological and evolutionary context...|$|R

Dry weight loss in alfalfa was similar for whole ruminal fluid and streptomycin-penicillin treatment, whereas that with streptomycin-penicillin treatment was significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 05) than that with cycloheximide treatment. In Bermuda grass, dry weight loss was significantly higher with streptomycin-penicillin than that with whole ruminal fluid and cycloheximide treatment, which were equal. Both peak load (Newtons) and peak stress were less (P ≤ 0. 05) for streptomycin-penicillin treatment than with other treatments in both forages. Fungi colonized the lignified ring in alfalfa and tended to reduce the width of cell walls in this tissue, but a large number of fungal penetrations through cell walls was not observed. In contrast, fungal rhizoids frequently penetrated into and through cell walls in the lignified ring of Bermuda grass, often expanding the pit fields between the cells. Ruminal fungi disrupt <b>lignified</b> tissues in <b>stems,</b> and their activity results in a weakened residue more amendable to physical degradation.

30|$|Under higher {{top-dressing}} N application conditions, the W 3668 cultivar's {{mechanical tissue}} and vascular bundle sheath exhibited a remarkably loose structure (Figs. 3 and 5), and the ALVB and ASVB decreased (Table  2), suggesting a cell wall modification (either cellulosic or <b>lignified)</b> and a <b>stem</b> {{with a lower}} mechanical strength. These results can be explained as follows. Firstly, in our previous study, {{a large amount of}} non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) content was accumulated in the lower stem of the W 3668 cultivar, but the structural carbohydrate (cellulose, lignin content) was quite low (Zhang et al., 2015). Secondly, the poor lignin accumulation in the basal culm and the weak stem strength under high N application were the results of lower related enzymes activities, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), tyrosine-ammonia-lyase (TAL) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) (Wang et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2014). Additionally, the AAC of the W 3668 cultivar was increased by 9.0  % with a higher top-dressing N rate (Table  2), and it was negatively and significantly correlated with the breaking strength (Table  3). This result {{can be explained by the}} fact that high N levels are usually accompanied by low water oxygenation in a swamp environment (Camargo and Alonso 2006). The good development of aerenchyma in plants may represent an adaptation to the hypoxic conditions induced by N enrichment as it improves gas diffusion through the plant, thus increasing the respiration rate (Hussner et al., 2009; Ryser et al., 2011). However, the aerenchyma is a mechanically weak tissue providing little stiffness to the plant (Striker et al., 2007).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn M. sativa cv. Gabès plants {{treated with}} 150 mM NaCl, {{the height of}} the stem is {{decreased}} and the internode number, length and diameter are reduced. This depressive effect on growth, but also on photosynthetic activity and water balance, is accompanied by structural changes. In the upper internodes, NaCl treatment increases cambium development, so that the vascular ring is initiated earlier than in controls. In the lower internodes, the number of lignified phloem fibers is increased by NaCl, and their wall thickness is augmented, compared to controls; in the phloem complex, the nacreous layer is enlarged, the number of internal wall ingrowths is increased, but companion cells are damaged. In the treated lower internodes, few vessels occur in the secondary xylem, which is by contrast rich in lignified fibers and in wide vessels grouped in the metaxylem area; protoxylem parenchyma and adjacent pith are also lignified. In addition, in treated lower internodes, starch grains are less abundant than in controls, and this variation might be related to the decrease of photosynthesis. When taken together, qualitative and quantitative results indicate that the saline stress has a marked morpho-anatomical impact on the M. sativa Gabès stem. In particular, variations of secondary derivative distribution, increased wall thickening, lignification of phloem and xylem fibers and damage in the phloem complex are NaCl-induced responses, and are more expressed in the lower than in the upper internodes.

We hypothesized that stem hypolignification should {{be associated with}} extensive phenolic accumulation and used metabolomics and transcriptomics to characterize these two tissues. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance clearly distinguished inner and outer stem tissues and identified different primary and secondary metabolites, including coniferin and p-coumaryl alcohol glucoside. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry aromatic profiling (lignomics) identified 81 phenolic compounds, of which 65 were identified, to our knowledge, {{for the first time}} in flax and 11 {{for the first time in}} higher plants. Both aglycone forms and glycosides of monolignols, lignin oligomers, and (neo) lignans were identified in both inner and outer stem tissues, with a preponderance of glycosides in the hypolignified outer stem, indicating the existence of a complex monolignol metabolism. The presence of coniferin-containing secondary metabolites suggested that coniferyl alcohol, in addition to being used in lignin and (neo) lignan formation, was also utilized in a third, partially uncharacterized metabolic pathway. Hypolignification of bast fibers in outer stem tissues was correlated with the low transcript abundance of monolignol biosynthetic genes, laccase genes, and certain peroxidase genes, suggesting that flax hypolignification is transcriptionally regulated. Transcripts of the key lignan genes Pinoresinol-Lariciresinol Reductase and Phenylcoumaran Benzylic Ether Reductase were also highly abundant in flax inner stem tissues.

Lignin precursors are known to be synthesized in the cytoplasm by complex biosynthetic pathways, after which they are transported to the apoplastic space, where they are polymerized via free radical coupling reactions into polymeric lignin. However, the lignin deposition process and the factors controlling it are unclear. In this study, the biochemical and developmental dependencies of lignification were investigated using a click-compatible monolignol analog, 3 -O-propargylcaffeyl alcohol (3 -OPC), which can incorporate into both in vitro polymerized lignin and Arabidopsis thaliana tissues. Fluorescence labeling of 3 -OPC using click chemistry followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy enabled the detection and imaging of 3 -OPC incorporation patterns. These patterns were consistent with endogenous lignification observed in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis stems. However, the concentration of supplied monolignols influenced where lignification occurred at the subcellular level, with low concentrations being deposited in cell corners and middle lamellae and high concentrations also being deposited in secondary walls. Experimental inhibition of multiple lignification factors confirmed that 3 -OPC incorporation proceeds via a free radical coupling mechanism involving peroxidases/laccases and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the presence of peroxide-producing enzymes determined which cell walls lignified: adding exogenous peroxide and peroxidase caused cells that do not naturally <b>lignify</b> in Arabidopsis <b>stems</b> to <b>lignify.</b> In summary, 3 -OPC accurately mimics natural lignification patterns in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis stems and allows for the dissection of key biochemical and enzymatic factors controlling lignification...|$|R
