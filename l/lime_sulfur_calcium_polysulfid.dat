50|$|Bonsai enthusiasts use {{undiluted}} <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> to bleach, sterilise, {{and preserve}} deadwood on bonsai trees while giving an aged look. Rather than spraying the entire tree, {{as with the}} pesticidal usage, <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> is painted directly onto the exposed deadwood, and is often colored {{with a small amount}} of dark paint to make it look more natural. Without paint pigments, the lime-sulfur solution bleaches wood to a bone-white color that takes time to weather and become natural-looking. Because the <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> does not contact the leaves or needles, this technique can be used on evergreen trees as well as other types of trees.|$|R

50|$|<b>Lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> is {{believed}} to be the earliest synthetic chemical used as a pesticide, being used in the 1840s in France to control grape vine powdery mildew Uncinula necator, which had been introduced from the USA in 1845 and reduced wine production by 80%. In 1886 it was first used in California to control San Jose scale. Commencing around 1904, commercial suppliers began to manufacturer lime sulfur; prior to that time, gardeners were expected to manufacture their own. By the 1920s essentially all commercial orchards in western countries were protected by regular spraying with <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur.</b> However by the 1940s, <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> began to be replaced by synthetic organic fungicides which risked less damage to the crop's foliage.|$|R

Of the nine trials, four had enough disease to evaluate in the spring and at harvest in 1999. Lack of disease pressure, and wide treatment and site variability, precluded any definitive results; however, data from the four sites provided no evidence that the fall treatments enhanced control compared to an effective spring program alone. Data from one orchard in Potter Valley showed much greater disease in tops versus bottoms of trees, indicating the need for better coverage. Suggestions for future trials include 1) test a more limited number of treatments, 2) test exactly the same treatments at each site, 3) increase the number of sites, and 4) test a combination of <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> and urea to achieve the dual result of inhibiting fungal growth on dead leaves while simultaneously speeding up leaf breakdown to destroy fungal food base.

40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi verificar a influência dos resíduos de calda sulfocálcica sobre a eficiência de acaricidas empregados no controle de Brevipalpus phoenicis. Inicialmente, o experimento foi instalado em um pomar de citros, em que foram selecionadas 10 plantas que continham frutos com verrugose. Realizou-se a aplicação de calda sulfocálcica (8 g i. a. L- 1 de água) em cinco plantas e as outras cinco plantas permaneceram sem aplicação de produto fitossanitário. Protegeram-se, com copos de plástico transparente de 500 mL, 64 frutos nas plantas tratadas com calda e 64 frutos nas plantas não-tratadas, totalizando 128 frutos protegidos. Decorridos 30 dias da aplicação, os frutos foram colhidos e levados para o laboratório. Estes frutos foram parcialmente parafinados, deixando-se em cada fruto uma arena de 2, 5 cm de diâmetro com verrugose e sem parafina, delimitada com cola entomológica. Em seguida, procedeu-se à aplicação sobre os frutos em Torre de Potter dos seguintes acaricidas nas concentrações expressas em mg de ingrediente ativo por litro de água: {{propargite}} a 720 mg, óxido de fenbutatina a 400 mg, cyhexatin a 250 mg, azocyclotin a 250 mg, fenpyroximate a 50 mg, dicofol a 960 mg e dinocap a 738 mg e a testemunha sem aplicação de acaricida. Após 1, 7 e 16 dias da aplicação, transferiram-se para cada fruto 10 ácaros B. phoenicis para avaliar a mortalidade. Constatou-se que os resíduos de calda sulfocálcica não prejudicaram a eficiência dos acaricidas avaliados no controle de B. phoenicis. The {{objective was}} to assess the influence of <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> residues on the acaricidal efficiency against Brevipalpus phoenicis mite. Initially, the experiment was conducted in a citrus orchard where 10 plants presenting scab fruits were selected. Secondly, the application of <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> (8 mg a. i.

Next <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> application, 64 fruits in the plants with <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> application were protected with plastic cups and others 64 fruits also were protected in the plants without <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> application with plastic cups. After 30 days of field application, fruits were harvested and transported to the laboratory. These fruits were partially waxed, leaving an arena of approximately 2. 5 cm in diameter with scab and without paraffin and entrapped with entomological glue. Afterwards, acaricides application were done following the concentration expressed in mg of active ingredient per liter of water: propargite (720 mg), fenbutatin oxide (400 mg), cyhexatin (250 mg), azocyclotin (250 mg), fenpyroximate (50 mg), dicofol (960 mg), dinocap (738 mg) and control treatment by using the petri dish-Potter tower method. After 1, 7 and 16 days of application, ten B. phoenicis were transferred per fruit, in order to evaluate their mortality, 24 and 48 hours after the transferences.

40|$|The citrus leprosis {{control in}} São Paulo state is {{performed}} exclusively by acaricides {{to control the}} vector mite, Brevipalpus phoenicis, which increases the production costs and may affect the beneficial organism's population. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} trial was to evaluate during four seasons, the effects of acaricides recommended to control the mite B. phoenicis in conventional and organic citrus over evolution of citrus leprosis and over phytoseiids' population. The experiment was installed in October of 2003 in a citrus orchard in Reginopolis city, state of São Paulo. The experimental design used randomized blocks, the dosages was expressed as mL c. p. / 100 L of water and the treatments were the following: spirodiclofen (20 mL); cyhexatin (50 mL) (used in rotation), <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> (4, 000 mL) and control (without pesticide application). However, the rotation between spirodiclofen and cyhexatin began in September 2006. Prior to that time, only spirodiclofen had been used. Surveys were conducted every 15 days on the B. phoenicis, Iphiseioides zuluagai, and Euseius populations. The control level adopted by the B. phoenicis was 8. 3 %, and the pesticide applications were conducted using tractor-sprayers. During the 2007 - 08 seasons, 10 infected fallen fruits per plot were collected and the number of leprosis lesions was quantified by each fruit. By the end of the 2007 - 08 seasons, the productivity, harvest losses, the disease incidence and severity were evaluated. It was found that the lesions' location over the fruit is more important in determining its drop than the lesions' number. The more intense the mite infestation, the greater is the number of lesions, resulting in increased premature fruit drop. A strategy using acaricides spirodiclofen and cyhexatin in rotation promoted more efficient control of B. phoenicis compared to <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur,</b> resulting in greater productivity, lower fruit losses and severity levels. The <b>lime</b> <b>sulfur</b> applications reduced the mite population incidence below the control level; however it did not prevent the lesions' occurrence.
