Also, many businesses are struggling to remain competitive in terms of quality and productivity due to intense competition within markets.

This is beneficial for management as it could lead to effective teams being created thus resulting in innovative ideas which is beneficial for the business.

40|$|Abstract: Early in the 1990 s, the {{introduction}} of economic reforms in Russia created expectations of a substantial reallocation of labour; "old" jobs {{in the state and}} former-state sector were to be shed and "new" jobs created in new private firms. Although the labour market experienced relatively heavy flows, they did not occur in the expected pattern. Most of the separations were quits rather than lay-offs and former-state enterprises continued to hire at relatively high rates. This paper takes a fresh look at the developments in <b>labour</b> <b>turnover</b> and the relationship between the components of <b>labour</b> <b>turnover</b> and various enterprise characteristics. National-level aggregate statistics are used to gain insights concerning the scale and structure of <b>labour</b> <b>turnover</b> in medium and large enterprises.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a project that {{attempts}} to reveal the way labour market institutions, human capital and labour productivity are interconnected. First we discuss two approaches in the human capital theory, stressing some difficulties that could be solved if the approaches are combined. It is argued that the Nelson-Phelps approach could be improved by adding elements from the Lucas model. We think that the production factor of human capital needs a more detailed description than usual in empirical research, e. g. further schooling and training, experience and external effects. Empirical tests show that the frequently obtained conclusion that investments in higher education are too low are doubtful. The tests also show the importance of further education and training, especially on-the-job training. human capital, <b>labour</b> productivity, specificity, <b>turnover,</b> <b>labour</b> markets, education, off-the-job training, on-the-job training, models, experience, learning by doing...|$|R
