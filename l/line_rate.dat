The work {{describes}} in detail {{the way in which}} the dynamic <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> is determined, basing the process solely on measurement of the weather conditions. Some aspects related to selection of the numerical values of the coefficients present in the heat model of the power-lines, which is being used to determine the dynamic <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> and the distance between the ground and the conductor, have been described. Subsequent stages of implementation of the system used to determine the dynamic <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> of the power lines have also been described. These include selection of the critical spans of the overhead lines, in case of which risk of exceeding the distance to the crossed-over objects is higher than in case the of the other spans of the very same power line. Additionally, optimal displacement of the weather-reporting stations, that are the source of the data used to determine the dynamic <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> of the <b>lines,</b> has been described. The work also deals with applications of the dynamic <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> for the power line related to the dangerous situation in case of which rime (ice) would be accumulated on the conductors. The forecasting procedures, regarding the load imposed on the power-lines, within a defined time period are also considered by the present paper. Forecasting the permissible load for the power lines is one of the main elements of planning an energy transmission system.

40|$|Wind power {{generation}} has indicated an exponential increase during {{last two decades}} and existing transmission network infrastructure is increasingly becoming inadequate to transmit remotely generated wind power to load centres in the network. The dynamic <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> (DLR) {{is one of the}} viable solutions to improve the transmission line ampacity during high wind penetration without investing on an additional transmission network. The main objective {{of this study is to}} identify the basic differences between two main <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> standards, since transmission network service providers (TNSPs) heavily depend on these two standards when developing their <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> models. Therefore, a parameter level comparison between two <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> models is a timely requirement, in particular for high wind conditions. Study has shown that roughness factor causes a significant difference between both standards. In particular, the IEEE model indicates more conservative approach due to this parameter. In addition, solar heat-gain calculation has also resulted in significant difference in ampacity ratings between two standards. A case study was developed considering a wind rich network and it has shown that by implementing DLR in wind rich regions, it can effectively reduce line overloading incidents and accommodate wind power flows in the network without any curtailment. Moreover, ability of DLR to reduce network energy losses is also demonstrated and emphasised the importance of selecting suitable DLR candidates to minimise energy losses in the network. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} heterogeneity and the growing volume of traffic, telecom backbone networks are going through new innovations and paradigm shift. The wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks may cost-effectively support the growing heterogeneity of traffic demands by having mixed <b>line</b> <b>rates</b> (MLR) over different wavelength channels. The coexistence of wavelength channels with different <b>line</b> <b>rates</b> in the same fiber brings up the important issue of {{the choice of the}} channel spacing that one can have in these MLR networks. The channel spacing affects the signal quality in terms of biterror rate (BER), and hence affects the maximum reach of the lightpaths, which is a function of <b>line</b> <b>rates.</b> Various approaches to set an opportunistic width of the channel spacing can be considered: i) on a practical side, one may choose uniform fixed channel spacing specified by the ITU-T grid (typically 50 GHz); ii) alternatively, to optimize the usage of the fiber spectrum, one can explore different channel spacing for different <b>line</b> <b>rates,</b> also referred to as the “one-size-does-not-fit-all” approach; iii) else an optimal value of channel spacing that leads to minimum cost can be sought. In this work, we investigate the third case by evaluating the cost of a MLR network for different channel spacings. Our results show that, even under the assumption of uniform channel spacing for a MLR network, it is possible to identify optimal values of channel spacing for a minimum-cost MLR network design...|$|R

This allows the transport of substantially larger amounts of energy over that line that when a static ampacity value is used. It is shown in this paper that the use of such dynamic <b>line</b> <b>rating</b> allows more wind power to be connected to the grid, i. e. it results in an increase of the hosting capacity. For the numerical example presented in the paper, the hosting capacity is increase from 214 to 390 MW. There are different types of risk associated with the introduction of dynamic <b>line</b> <b>rating,</b> some of which are discussed in this paper. Two main types of risk are distinguished.  Risks associated with possible overload of components, even when the ampacity is exactly known.  Additional risks due to the difference between the actual and the estimated ampacity.

The risk of overload carried by all customers is replaced by the risk of temporality being disconnected for the wind-park owner.
