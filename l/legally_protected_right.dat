As a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Macau enjoys {{a high degree of}} autonomy, except in defense and foreign affairs, and its citizens have basic freedoms and enjoy <b>legally</b> <b>protected</b> <b>rights.</b> The Macau Basic Law is the SAR's constitution, promulgated by PRC's National People's Congress (NPC) in 1993. The 1987 Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Basic Law specify that the SAR is to continue to enjoy substantial autonomy and its economic system and way of life are to remain unchanged for the first 50 years under PRC sovereignty. The government is led by a chief executive, chosen by a 300-member election committee, which, in turn, is chosen by a preparatory committee composed of 60 SAR and 40 mainland representatives appointed by the NPC.|$|R
50|$|In England and Wales {{a public}} {{footpath}} is a path {{on which the}} public have a <b>legally</b> <b>protected</b> <b>right</b> to travel on foot and in some areas public footpaths form a dense network of short paths.

50|$|Mandamus may be {{a command}} to do an {{administrative}} action or not to take a particular action, and it is supplemented by legal rights. In the American legal system {{it must be a}} judicially enforceable and <b>legally</b> <b>protected</b> <b>right</b> before one suffering a grievance can ask for a mandamus.

It includes {{a brief description of}} Hong Kong’s political history, a brief profile of its economic policies, and discusses a variety of concerns regarding the potential economic consequences for the United States and California of Hong Kong’s reversion to China. Currently, Hong Kong is a free society with <b>legally</b> <b>protected</b> <b>rights.</b> It has a market economy, with very liberal investment and trade policies. Hong Kong is a key Asian financial and trade center, with a freely convertible currency, a developed financial structure, and a working legal system. The strong position of Hong Kong as a trade center is the result of its economic policies. Next month, after almost 100 years of British rule, Hong Kong rule will revert to China. The British had acquired this territory through a combination of wartime concessions, and a 99 -year lease negotiated and signed with China, which expires on July 1, 1997. According to an agreement signed after a series of negotiations between Britain and China, control of Hong Kong is scheduled to be transferred to China on July 1, 1997. Th...|$|R

They say that under the FMA, {{they are allowed to}} stream {{filtered}} movies to customers as long as the movie is an authorized copy watched in the privacy of the home, and no permanent filtered copy is created. VidAngel buys a physical disc of each movie they offer. They contend that the FMA provides an exemption from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) for the purpose of filtering, allowing VidAngel to legally decrypt discs. As noted below, all these arguments have been rejected by the courts.|$|R
50|$|In England and Wales, {{other than}} in the 12 Inner London Boroughs and the City of London, public rights of way are paths on which the public have a <b>legally</b> <b>protected</b> <b>right</b> to pass and re-pass. The law in England and Wales differs from that in Scotland in that rights of way only exist where they are so {{designated}} (or are able to be designated if not already) whereas in Scotland any route that meets certain conditions {{is defined as a}} right of way, and in addition there is a general presumption of access to the countryside. Private rights of way or easements also exist.|$|E
50|$|In England and Wales, public {{footpaths}} are {{rights of}} way on which pedestrians have a <b>legally</b> <b>protected</b> <b>right</b> to travel. Other public {{rights of way}} in England and Wales, such as bridleways, byways, towpaths, and green lanes are also used by pedestrians. In Scotland there is no legal distinction between a footpath and a bridleway and it is generally accepted that cyclists and horse riders may follow any right of way with a suitable surface. The law is different in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and there are far fewer rights of way in Ireland as a whole (see Keep Ireland Open).|$|E

50|$|Before the Convention on the Nationality of Married Women, no {{legislation}} existed to <b>protect</b> married women's <b>right</b> {{to retain}} or renounce national citizenship {{in the way}} that men could. Women's rights groups recognized a need to <b>legally</b> <b>protect</b> the citizenship <b>rights</b> of women who married someone from outside their country or nationality. The League of Nations, the international organization later succeeded by the United Nations, was lobbied by women's rights groups during the early 20th century to address the lack of international laws recognizing married women's rights of national citizenship. The Conference for the Codification of International Law, held at The Hague in 1930, drew protests from international women's rights groups, yet the League declined to include legislation enforcing married women's nationality rights. The League took the position that it was not their role, but the role of member states, to deal with equality between men and women.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in the 1970s, the United States Congress passed several Acts to <b>legally</b> <b>protect</b> the <b>right</b> of {{children}} and adults with disabilities {{to be included in}} schools and the workforce, first with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and then the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975. In 1986, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) was put into force in the United States, which ended the exclusion {{of children}} with disabilities from publicly funded school systems. With the integration of children with disabilities into public schools, educators, librarians and publishers took a new interest in children's literature that dealt with disability in a balanced, accurate, and constructive way. An overall growth in public awareness of disability and its portrayal in media has supported a trend towards more detailed medical descriptions of conditions in juvenile literature. Barbara Holland Baskin and Karen H. Harris conducted influential research into the portrayal of disability in children and youth literature in the late 1970s. They published the seminal study Notes from a Different Drummer (1977), followed by More Notes from a Different Drummer (1984). Today, disability in juvenile literature is a standard topic included in bibliographies, research, criticism, and review sources. Several bibliographies and studies reviewing fiction and non-fiction have been produced in the years since.|$|R

5000|$|In England and Wales {{the public}} has a <b>legally</b> <b>protected</b> <b>right</b> to [...] "pass and repass" [...] (i.e. walk) on footpaths, bridleways and other routes which have the status of a public right of way. Footpaths {{typically}} pass over private land, but if they are public rights of way they are public highways with the same protection in law as other highways, such as trunk roads. Public rights of way originated in common law, but are now regulated by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. These rights have occasionally resulted in conflicts between walkers and landowners. The rights and obligations of farmers who cultivate crops in fields crossed by public footpaths are now specified in the law. Walkers can also use permissive paths, where the public does not have a legal right to walk, but where the landowner has granted permission for them to walk.|$|E
40|$|Immigration Criminal Law {{should be}} more {{appropriately}} called “Criminal Law of the Irregular Immigrant”, since it shows to essentially {{be based on the}} criminalization of mere subjective “status”, rather than offensive managements of legal goods. Indeed, behind the protective shelter of an apparent balance between the need to <b>legally</b> <b>protect</b> human <b>rights</b> and the interest in controlling the migratory flow, the system of incriminations in this sector seems to be deeply imbalanced towards the punishment of types of perpetrators who are socially dangerous. It is namely a matter of model of criminal law very similar to the well known standard of “ Criminal Law of the Enemy”. The inspiring “ratio” of the discipline hasn’t even changed following its adjustment due to the obligation forced by the 2008 / 115 /CE European legislation, decided with Law n. 129 of August 2 nd 2011. As a matter of fact this didn’t determine a total improvement of the system in a form of compliance to the fundamental principles of legal law, but on the contrary it expanded the ancillary function of criminal law towards the legal action of repatriation, without, on the other hand, removing the irrational aspects of the repressive decisions made by the Italian legislator...|$|R

40|$|Suicide can {{be defined}} as either the {{decision}} to die when death is not imminent, or the choice to die in the circumstances of an already fatal and severely debilitating disease. End-of-life decision making has become more and more intertwined with the modern medical practice, as interest in assisted suicide has continually grown all over the world, especially in first-world countries that have high standards of medical care. Paradoxically, increasing focus on assisted suicide parallels the expanding capabilities of modern medicinal technologies to preserve life in situations of imminent death. It is evident that public policy and legal issues are closely tied with ethical problems posed by the relevant practice, and similarities surrounding the problems underlying the practice of assisted suicide are common to many countries. However, due to a variety of historical, cultural and political factors, the legal responses vary between these first-world countries in regards to the treatment of assisted suicide. The controversial topic results in responses that oscillate between the Hippocratic tradition that forbids any physician to actively bring about the death of a patient to legislation allowing assisted suicide as part of a <b>legally</b> <b>protected</b> patient <b>right.</b> Amidst the variety of legislative action and numerous rights-based arguments presented by both sides of the debate, it is evident that some form of legalization of assisted suicide is necessary, and should be allowed for not only patients who are in terminal conditions.
