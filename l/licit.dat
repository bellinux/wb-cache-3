The possible use of several distinct synthetic vaccines in prophylaxis would be facilitated by the availability of fully synthetic immunogens. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 135 to 155 (P 135 - 155) of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) failed to elicit in free form anti-peptide antibodies or anti-HBs. However, polymers of P 135 - 155 (prepared by linking to diaminoalkanes) and synthetic onjugates prepared by binding P 135 - 155 to liposomes or polylysine were immunogenic. A poor correlation was observed between anti-peptide and anti-HBs responses <b>licited</b> by these conjugates. Glutaraldehyde-fixed liposomes appeared to be the carriers of choice for inducing anti-HBs. The generation of antibodies to proteins by immunization with short peptides having the amino acid sequence corresponding to the sequence of preselected protein fragments appears to be a frequent event (Niman et al., 1983).

Six of these epitopes (E-la, E-lc, E-ld, E- 3, E- 4 a, E- 4 b) were identical to those previously demonstrated onSLE virus. Two new epitopes (E- 5 and E- 6) were also identified.

40|$|The {{interpersonal}} {{theory of}} personality {{has been applied}} to explain depressed people's dilemma: The depressed person's submissive behavior invites dominating reactions from other people, and those reactions ustain the depressed person's depression. Experiments I and 2 showed that self-derogations connote submissiveness but are generally judged to be neutral in affiliation. Experi-ment 3 tested implications for the behavior of dysphoric and nondysphoric Ss as they interacted with a self-derogating, other-derogating, or nonderogating confederate partner. Ss selected a topic from a list and talked about it for 1 rain; the confederates script was fixed. The S's judgments ofthe confederate, choice of topics, satisfaction with the interaction, and actual responses were analyzed. Self-derogators were judged to be submissive, <b>licited</b> dominating reactions, and selected more topics with negative content. The interpersonal theory of personality (Horowitz & Vitkus, 1986; Kiesler, 1983; Orford, 1986; Wiggins, 1982) organizes in-terpersonal behaviors along two dimensions [...] a dimension of affiliation that ranges from hostile (cold) to friendly (warm) be-havior and a dimension of power or status that ranges from submissive to dominating behavior. Scolding, for example, lies in the quadrant that reflects hostile dominance, and helping lies in the quadrant that reflects friendly dominance.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ribosome}} inactivating proteins (RIPs) are a {{group of}} proteins {{that are able to}} inactivate eukaryotic protein synthesis by attacking the 28 S ribosomal RNA. Recent studies have shown that some RIPs possess strong anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. In this study, several common plant RIPs including agrostin, gelonin, luffin, α-momorcharin, β-momorcharin, saporin and trichosanthin were examined for the ability to interfere with HIV- 1 replication in a variety of mechanistic assays in vitro. These assays included the CD 4 /gp 120 interaction assay, HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) assay, HIV- 1 protease assay and HIV- 1 integrase assay. At the concentration of 100 nM, all RIPs appeared to enhance the CD 4 /gp 120 interaction by about 50 %. These RIPs exhibited a very weak suppressive effect on HIV- 1 RT and on HIV- 1 protease. In contrast, with the exception of agrostin, all the RIPs tested could strongly inhibit HIV- 1 integrase, the extent of inhibition ranging from 26. 1 to 96. 3 % in an ELISA-based assay. Two RIPs, saporin and luffin, which <b>licited</b> over 90 % inhibition in the ELISA-based assay, were further characterized in a radiometric assay.

Twenty-three studies were identified in which neutrally clothed infant stimuli were labeled male in some conditions and female in other conditions.

In particular, work carried out in our laboratory on the relative roles of the macrophage plasma membrane receptor (CR 3) for the cleaved third complement component (iC 3 b) and the mannosyl/fucosyl receptor (MFR) in binding, ingestion and respiratory burst (RB) response <b>licited</b> by promastigotes versus amastigotes of L. donovani, is discussed. In the absence of serum, soluble inhibitors (e. g. mannan) of the MFR cause a dose-dependent reduction in promastigote binding to murine resident peritoneal macrophages and {{in the proportion of}} bound parasites eliciting a RB response. For amastigotes, no consistent reduction in binding in the presence of mannan is observed but the proportion of parasites eliciting a RB is reduced. Serum-independent binding of promastigotes, which are good activators of the alternative complement pathway, is also inhibited by the anti-CR 3 monoclonal antibody M 1 / 70, by Fab anti-C 3, and by an inhibitor of C 3 fixation, sodium salicyl hydroxamate. With amastigotes, which are poor activators of the alternative pathway, a lesser effect is observed. These results provide strong evidence that cleaved macrophage-derived C 3 (iC 3 b) mediates promastigote binding to CR 3. Modulation experiments in which either CR 3 or MFR are rendered inaccessible demonstrate that both receptors must be present on the segment of macrophage membrane with which the promastigote makes contact to mediate binding and ingestion. These receptor interactions may be important determinants of the infectivity and survival of Leishmania parasites in the vertebrate host...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the nineties}} {{a range of}} factors, not least the series of suicides at Cornton Vale women's prison, {{highlighted}} concerns about how {{the criminal justice system}} deals with female offenders in Scotland. There has been a review of community-based disposals and the use of custody for women (Scottish Office, 1998 a), an Inspection of Cornton Vale was conducted (HMI, 2001), and a Ministerial Group on Women's Offending was set up (Scottish Executive, 2002 a). Despite this concern the numbers of female offenders being sentenced to custody has continued to rise. This study sought to examine the nature of criminal justice social work services delivered to female offenders {{and the way in which}} ideological and policy shifts have impacted on it. Differences relating to gender, with regard to both practitioners and clients, within the context of criminal justice social work in Scotland,w ere considered. T his included a consideration of the impact of the policy shift from the "welfare" to the "justice" model. Thirty-five interviews were conducted with criminal justice social work staff and material was drawn from 420 Social Enquiry Reports. The study examined practices and policies which relate to how women are supervised, how these relate to the presentation of information in social enquiry reports, and in turn how this may relate to the final court disposal imposed. A discrepancy between policy and practice was identified in that the latter draws on the "welfare" model more than is endorsed by formal policy. This greater emphasis on the "welfare" model applies to work with female offenders in particular. There were concerns amongst criminal justice social work staff that such a difference in approach might be discriminatory. A new "welfare" model of supervision appears to have been adopted in the supervision of female offenders. This model emphasised the importance of the working relationship, between supervisor and client, within which women offenders should be allowed scope for negotiation. Information on female offenders derived from both interviews with criminal justice staff and the data obtained from SERs is used to review social control theory (Hirschi, 1969), as it exists, as an explanation of female offending. Carlen's study (1988) of female offenders suggested that integral to their involvement in offending was a rejection of the controls to which they are subjected and of their gender roles. By contrast the profile of women offenders as identified in this study suggests that women are offending partly in an endeavour to conform to, or at least cope with, their gender roles. Female offenders were reported as having experienced greater adversity and this appears to havee <b>licited</b> a protective response from social workers. This protection began in women's childhoods and is evident in their treatment as adults. The organisation of community service is considered by female social workers to have an inherent gender bias which renders it less suitable for female offenders. These concerns appear to have foundation in terms of an apparent gender bias in the operation of community service schemes. Female offenders sentenced to community service were more likely to have had their SERs compiled by male SER writers, while female offenders sentenced to probation were more likely to have their SERs compiled by female SER writers. Female social workers specifically appear to adopt a stronger welfare orientation when compiling reports on female offenders apparently motivated by an inclination to protect. This has implications for gender specific allocation of work. The effect is not protection if reports arc undermining community service as a possible alternative to custody for women, as appears to be the case when the SER writer is female...|$|R
