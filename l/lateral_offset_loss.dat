40|$|The vast {{majority}} of underwater wireless optical communication systems use collimated blue/green laser beams to deliver high-speed data over a transmission range of a few metres to tens of metres. However, such systems are extremely susceptible to misalignment of the transmitter and the receiver. The mitigation techniques for misalignment {{reported in the literature}} are complex and costly at times. In this study, the authors consider the simple approach of increasing the divergence angle of the transmitted Gaussian beam to mitigate misalignment. Both plane and spherical beams are considered as the limitation cases. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the authors show that an optimum divergence angle for the maximum acceptable <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> exists with respect to the receiver sensitivity in clear waters while this is not an efficient method in harbour waters. Results demonstrate that there is a design trade-off between acceptable <b>lateral</b> <b>offset,</b> power <b>loss</b> and channel bandwidth. Furthermore, the authors show how the proposed scheme of beam divergence affects the maximum allowed link span as well as the channel bandwidth for a given distance...|$|R
40|$|A {{majority}} of aircraft {{are now using}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for navigation. This {{has led to an}} effect of reducing the magnitude of lateral deviations from the route center line and, consequently, increasing the probability of a collision, should a loss of vertical separation between aircraft on the same route occur. The International Civil Aviation Organiza- tion (ICAO) has introduced Strategic <b>Lateral</b> <b>Offset</b> Procedures (SLOP) that allow suitably equipped aircrafts to fly with 1 nmi or 2 nmi <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> to the right of airway centerline in oceanic airspace. Very few aircraft, how- ever, are using the SLOP procedure {{because of the lack of}} understanding of its safety benefits and implementation issues in identifying correct <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> that can reduce the collision risk. This paper proposes an Evolution- ary Computation framework using Differential Evolution process to identify optimal <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> for each airway in a given airspace such that it reduces the overall collision risk. Airway specific <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> are then correlated with airway-traffic features using Multiple Regression models to identify which features can explain the optimal <b>lateral</b> <b>offset.</b> The proposed approach establishes a generic mapping that can suggest optimal <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> for a given airspace based on airway-traffic features to mitigate colli- sion risk. The proposed methodology is applied to Collision Risk assessment of one-day traffic data (710 flights) in Bahrain Upper Airspace (FL 290 -FL 410) o estimate optimal <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> that resulted in significant reduction of collision risk. Further, the number of flights and crossings on an airway were identified as key features affecting optimal <b>lateral</b> <b>offset...</b>|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{forces of}} a {{cylinder}} shape bulk high-temperature superconductor (HTS) over a permanent magnet guideway (PMG) are studied mathematically. One cylindrical bulk HTS with {{a diameter of}} 30 [*]mm and 15 [*]mm in height is used. Two types of PMG are employed for external magnetic fields consideration. The relationship of magnetic forces of bulk HTS under different <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> over PMG is studied with 3 D-model finite element method (FEM). The calculation {{results show that the}} maximum magnetic levitation force of bulk HTS over PMG is tightly related to the applied magnetic field distribution. For the symmetrical PMG, the maximum magnetic levitation force decreases linearly with the increase of <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> of the bulk sample.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} levitation transportation system {{is one of}} the potential applications of high- T c superconducting (HTS) maglev system. The prototype HTS {{magnetic levitation}} system is composed of one HTS bulk and a permanent magnet railway (PMR). The maglev transportation system performance is influenced by the maximum levitation force, the maximum guidance force and the maximum of external applied magnetic flux density. The applied magnetic field dis tribution also needs to be considered carefully. In the paper, the magnetic levitation force of cylindrical HTS bulk over PMR is experimentally studied. During the experiment, symmetrical PMR and Halbach PMR are used separately. The levitation force-gap loops of different <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> of the HTS bulk above PMRs are obtained experimentally. The re sults show that the HTS bulk levitation performance is tightly relative to the external applied magnetic field distribution. The maximum magnetic levitation forces of HTS bulk above symmetrical PMR decrease linearly with the <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> increasing. When the <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> changes from 0 mm to 25 mm, the maximum magnetic levitation forces of HTS bulk above Halbach PMR increase with the <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> increasing.

Generally, <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> can be specified in increments of 1 NM up to 20 NM. When a <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> is activated in the RNAV system, the RNAV aircraft will depart the defined route and typically intercept the offset at a 45° or less angle.

Numerous conflict points exist at highway access points {{as a result of}} access and through traffic. Higher speeds and <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> variation cause greater risk of potential crashes. This research aimed to formulate a new method of access weight calculation that would show the speed and <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> variation characteristics of various access types under the same traffic conditions. Seven access types commonly found on highways in China were considered and analyzed for their safety performance. Data for a vehicle’s <b>lateral</b> <b>offset,</b> speed, acceleration, and deceleration rate were collected by means of a driving simulation method. Both field tests and simulation tests were compared to validate the accuracy of the simulation results from the viewpoint of vehicle speed and trajectory. Finally, access density, derived from the proposed access weighting model, was analyzed and correlated with crash rates on National Highway G 205 (South Nanjing section). Spearman correlation results showed that the access rated crash rates have a high correlation.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionResurfacing {{shoulder}} arthroplasty {{is proposed}} in primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder. The present study compared resurfacing versus 3 rd generation stemmed hemiarthroplasty {{in terms of}} survival, functional results and implant positioning effects. Materials and methodsSeventy eight patients underwent arthroplasty for primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder: 41 by resurfacing and 37 by stemmed hemiarthroplasty. The two populations were comparable on all baseline variables. Minimum follow-up was 2 years. The principal assessment criterion was survivorship with surgical revision as end-point. Secondary criteria were functional results on Constant, quick-DASH, Neer and SSV scores, and implant positioning effects assessed on radiology. ResultsAt a mean 44 months’ follow-up (range, 24 – 118 months), {{there were no significant}} differences in functional scores. Radiologic analysis found greater varus positioning and <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> of the humeral head in resurfacing compared with stemmed hemiarthroplasty (128 ° vs 138 °, P< 0. 01; 6. 5 ± 2 vs 4. 6 ± 1. 6 mm, P< 0. 01). Survivorship without revision was significantly poorer in resurfacing, with 4 revision procedures for glenoid wear (9. 8 %), versus none in hemiarthroplasty (P= 0. 02). There was no correlation between humeral head size, positioning or <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> and revision. ConclusionRevision-free survival was significantly lower in resurfacing than in hemiarthroplasty. Greater humeral head size may increase <b>lateral</b> <b>offset,</b> accelerating glenoid wear.

Systematic dissection of a 50 -m-long, 15 -m-wide, 5 -m-deep volume of earth, centered on the fault, enables documentation in three dimensions of fault patterns, <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets,</b> and vertical deformation associated with large earthquakes of the past. The excavations expose evidence for 12 earthquakes that occurred between about 260 and 1857 A. D., with an average recurrence interval of about 145 years. Prehistoric slip events that occurred in 1720 ± 50, 1550 ± 70, 1350 ± 50, 1080 ± 65, and 845 ± 75 A.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a nested PID {{steering}} control in vision based autonomous vehicles is designed and experimentally tested to perform path {{following in the}} case of roads with an uncertain curvature. The control input is the steering wheel angle: it is designed {{on the basis of the}} yaw rate, measured by a gyroscope, and the <b>lateral</b> <b>offset,</b> measured by the vision system as the distance between the road centerline and a virtual point at a fixed distance from the vehicle. No lateral acceleration and no lateral speed measurements are required. A PI active front steering control based on the yaw rate tracking error is used to improve the vehicle steering dynamics. The yaw rate reference is computed by an external control loop which is designed using a PID control with a double integral action based on the <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> to reject the disturbances on the curvature which increase linearly with respect to time. The proposed control scheme leads to a nested architecture with two independent control loops that allows us to design standard PID controls in a multivariable context (two outputs, one input).
