5|$|Corvus brachyrhynchos hesperis – western crow: Western North America except arctic north, Pacific Northwest {{and extreme}} south. Smaller overall with a {{proportionally}} more slender bill and <b>low-pitched</b> voice.|$|E
5|$|Mother-cub vocalisations: Apart from chirping, mothers {{use some}} other sounds to {{interact}} with their cubs. A repeated ihn ihn is used to gather the cubs, while a prr prr is used to guide them on a journey. A <b>low-pitched</b> alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still {{in the presence of}} danger.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals {{have a large}} larynx {{and thus}} a <b>low-pitched</b> voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) where the larynx can take up the {{entirety}} of the thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the <b>low-pitched</b> roars of big cats. The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to increase the volume of sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} contains three sandstone fireplaces, and the countertops {{are finished}} with hand-painted tiles from Mexico. Myrtlewood is used inside as trim and for doors. Bedroom closets were constructed with drawers, shelves, and ironing boards built-in. Inside the two-level building are amenities such as dumbwaiters and a sewing room. On the outside raked cedar was {{used on the}} eaves of the <b>low-pitched</b> roof-line building. The exterior sandstone is tan, rose, and blue in color.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in 1878, the Foster–Payne House is {{a two-story}} {{home with a}} <b>low-pitched</b> multi-gabled roof. The house has a single story open porch on the western side, a kitchen ell that {{projects}} from the rear and a single-story bay window that projects from the western bay of the front facade. The house is distinguished by its clapboard exterior and wooden trim under the gable peaks, the window trim and the porch brackets. There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two-over-two windows.|$|E
5|$|Mulberry House is a late Georgian {{building}}, {{dated to}} 1818. It served as Bentworth's rectory {{and became a}} Grade II listed building on 31 July 1963. The house has stucco walls, with painted brickwork and a slate roof. It is a square two-storey building, with a symmetrical front consisting of three windows, a doric columned porch, half-glazed doors and a <b>low-pitched</b> hipped roof, with a raised lead flat in the centre. The current rectory is a smaller, modern house {{on the other side}} of the main road through the village, opposite Mulberry House.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred pattern on its back. Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. It lives in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual <b>low-pitched</b> call different to subspecies boobook. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new <b>low-pitched</b> instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E

5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a <b>low-pitched</b> hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows {{on the sides of}} the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E
5|$|Within {{its native}} Northern Hemisphere range, the first-year male common {{blackbird}} of the nominate race may start singing {{as early as}} late January in fine weather {{in order to establish}} a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male's song is a varied and melodious <b>low-pitched</b> fluted warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive seee, a pook-pook-pook alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various chink and chook, chook vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives chink-chink calls in the evening in an (usually unsuccessful) attempt to deter other blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight. During the northern winter, blackbirds can be heard quietly singing to themselves, so much so that September and October are the only months in which the song cannot be heard. Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high seee alarm call for threats from birds of prey since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers do {{not have}} such {{a wide range of}} songs and calls as do {{passerine}} birds, and the sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief high-pitched notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal churrs, screams and wails. These calls are used by both sexes in communication and are related to the circumstances of the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes and alarm calls. Each species has its own range of calls, which tend to be in the 1 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted, <b>low-pitched</b> calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging-calls from inside their nest cavity. The wrynecks have a more musical song and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived Eurasian wryneck is considered to be the harbinger of spring. The piculets either have a song consisting of a long descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the birds, as they are easily overlooked.|$|E
5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a <b>low-pitched</b> trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E
25|$|Flat {{locked and}} {{soldered}} seam roofing systems are typically used on flat or <b>low-pitched</b> roofs. They {{are also used}} on curved surfaces such as domes and barrel vaults.|$|E
25|$|The two-story Classic Revival edifice {{features}} an exterior with alternating layers {{of concrete and}} rusticated pink native stone. Six doric columns enclose recessed pedimented porticoes {{on each of the}} northern and southern faces of the building. From the building's slab-on-grade foundation to the sill of the first-story windows is a base composed of a poured-in-place water table. Above that is the layered concrete and volcanic stone exterior walls most of which is slightly recessed from concrete block quoins. Above the second story windows begins a painted, decorative sheet metal entablature capped with a prominent cornice. Above the central portion of each of the building's four sides is a wood-framed, <b>low-pitched,</b> cross-gabled roof with pediments at each end covered with asphalt shingles. The four corner sections have <b>low-pitched</b> roofs with external gutters.|$|E
25|$|On a more {{domestic}} scale, {{the suburbs}} of cities like Dunedin and Wellington spread out with modest, but handsome suburban villas with Italianate details such as <b>low-pitched</b> roofs, tall windows, corner quoins, and stone detailing, all rendered in wood. A good example is {{the birthplace of the}} writer Katherine Mansfield.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosodic}} {{system of}} Koshikijima, {{like that of}} mainland Kagoshima, is characterized as a two-pattern pitch accent. It differs, however, in {{the placement of the}} accent. In this system, the primary high tone falls on a mora and is always preceded by a <b>low-pitched</b> syllable. Any other syllables preceding the low one will automatically bear a high tone.|$|E
25|$|Prepulses {{could be}} {{attended}} or ignored, and attention affects the outcome. In one study, normal college students {{were instructed to}} attend {{to one of the}} kind of prepulses, high- or <b>low-pitched,</b> and ignore the other. Attended prepulse caused significantly greater inhibition at the 120 ms interval compared to the ignored one, and significantly greater facilitation at the 2000 ms interval.|$|E
25|$|Tiny and Lou are two Asian {{elephant}}s. Of all {{the animals}} Tiny and Lou are the most immature. Tiny is blue and has a high-pitched voice as Lou is yellow and has a <b>low-pitched</b> voice. It is unknown if Tiny and Lou are brothers. They {{do not like to}} give elephant rides unless Willa wants them to. Tiny and Lou sleep in the garage.|$|E
25|$|The mill complex {{consists}} of three sections. The north and south wings are both {{three and a half}} stories tall with gabled roofs, corbeled cornices and a square tower rising from their 24-bay west facades. The seven-bay central section, built later, comes to a full four stories. Both of its facades project slightly. It has a <b>low-pitched</b> gable roof and a modillioned cornice. There are two outbuildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} calls are a loud pia-ow or may-awe. The {{frequency}} of calling increases before the Monsoon season {{and may be}} delivered in alarm or when disturbed by loud noises. In forests, their calls often indicate {{the presence of a}} predators such as the tiger. They also make many other calls such as a rapid series of ka-aan..ka-aan or a rapid kok-kok. They often emit an explosive <b>low-pitched</b> honk! when agitated.|$|E
25|$|Italianate was reinterpreted {{to become}} an {{indigenous}} style. It is distinctive by its pronounced exaggeration of many Italian Renaissance characteristics: emphatic eaves supported by corbels, <b>low-pitched</b> roofs barely discernible from the ground, or even flat roofs with a wide projection. A tower is often incorporated hinting at the Italian belvedere or even campanile tower. Motifs drawn from the Italianate style were incorporated into the commercial builders' repertoire and appear in Victorian architecture dating from the mid-to-late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The main church {{building}} {{consists of three}} separate sections, now joined. At the north, set back from East Main, is the original church, a three-by-five-bay structure faced in rock-cut limestone blocks with smooth-faced trim. A square bell tower pierces the wood-shingled <b>low-pitched</b> gabled roof. Just to the south, the lower Sunday school wing, also of limestone, has two cross-gables on its roof. A two-story hyphen connects it to the wood frame Memorial Service Building, a one-story structure topped by a high hipped roof with broad overhanging eaves.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{determine}} the sound a drum produces, including the type, shape {{and construction of}} the drum shell, the type of drum heads it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different drum sounds have different uses in music. Take, for example, the modern Tom-tom drum. A jazz drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and <b>low-pitched.</b> Since these drummers want different sounds, their drums are constructed and tuned differently.|$|E
25|$|The William H. Copeland House {{is a home}} {{located in}} the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. In 1909 the home {{underwent}} a remodeling designed by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The original, Italianate home {{was built in the}} 1870s. Dr. William H. Copeland commissioned Wright for the remodel and Wright's original vision of the project proposed a three-story Prairie house. That version was rejected and the result was the more subdued, less severely Prairie, William H. Copeland House. On the exterior the most significant alteration by Wright was the addition of a <b>low-pitched</b> hip roof. The house has been listed as a contributing property to a U.S. Registered Historic District since 1973.|$|E
25|$|During the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, a small Nippon Tea House {{was built}} near the North pond that was {{designed}} in a loose version of the sukiya-style. Harper's Weekly, a national magazine, ran an article in March 1893 showing {{the construction of the}} Japanese contributions to the exhibition. The Chicago-based magazine Inland Architect also devoted two articles to it in the winter of 1892/3 so it is likely that local architects were familiar with the work. The historian Dmitri Tselos first identified the Nippon Tea House as a possible influence on Frank Lloyd Wright, suggesting that the <b>low-pitched</b> double roof forms of the Prairie Houses as having similar forms as the teahouse roof.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} is {{a robust}} single storey timber-framed building clad in chamferboards. Standing on a red-coloured concrete slab on fill it {{is covered by}} a <b>low-pitched</b> hipped corrugated sheet roof with half round ridge tiles and quad gutters, all of asbestos cement. Verandahs located on {{the north and east}} sides are supported on pairs of 150mm square posts finished with skirtings and capitals on capped concrete upstands. Along the verandahs, projecting porches with gabled hips distinguish the entrances when viewed from the main garden and driveway. The verandah walls and interior partition walls have exposed frames lined with vertical v-jointed tongue and groove boards and ceilings are lined with asbestos cement sheeting finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
25|$|Since Dame Rosanna {{had close}} and {{intimate}} {{ties with the}} colonial government, there had been rumours before the transfer of sovereignty {{that she would not}} be allowed to serve in the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's Executive Council, or even the Housing Authority. Yet, the fact was that Wong once served in the colonial Executive Council with the future Chief Executive, Tung Chee Hwa and Tung was impressed by her <b>low-pitched</b> image. Finally in 1997, although Tung chose veteran politician Sir Sze Yuen Chung as Convenor, Wong, along with Raymond Ch'ien Kuo Fung, was invited to stay as unofficial member in the new Executive Council. Wong continued to remain as chairperson of the Housing Authority as well.|$|E
25|$|The front (east) {{elevation}} {{is framed}} by two octagonal towers {{and the entire}} structure is clad in a pink-colored brick. The building's hip roof features overhanging eaves, an element common to Prairie style architecture. The entire structure rests upon a stepped, limestone water table. The main feature of the front facade, besides the octagonal towers, is the 20ft (6.10 m) X 20ft, one-story sun porch projecting from the building. The sun porch has a <b>low-pitched</b> hip roof with an eave that projects over the front door, which is centered {{on the porch and}} flanked by two pairs of casement windows. Above the sun porch, on the second floor, is a pair of art glass doors which open onto a balcony between the two octagonal towers.|$|E
25|$|The Copeland House was {{designed}} around 1873 {{by an unknown}} architect and cast in the Italianate style. Wright's 1909 remodel work included exterior and interior alterations. A new tile roof was added above the decorative brick work; the roof was removed in the 1950s because of its maintenance expenses. The work fused Wright's Prairie style with the traditional Italiante style through the building's exterior lines. The new <b>low-pitched</b> hip roof that Wright designed, along with the wrap-around porch and overhanging eaves are all elements found in the Copeland House {{which can be found}} on other Prairie style homes Wright designed. The remodeling work also replaced the original doors with doors, frame, sidelights and a transom window all of Wright's own design.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{who study}} {{perception}} and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations. Depth perception consists of processing {{over half a}} dozen visual cues, {{each of which is}} based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very <b>low-pitched</b> sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the EEA. For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the EEA, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, {{as is the case with}} the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.|$|E
500|$|A {{subwoofer}} (or sub) is a woofer, or {{a complete}} loudspeaker, which {{is dedicated to}} the reproduction of <b>low-pitched</b> audio frequencies known as bass. The typical frequency range for a subwoofer is about 20–200Hz for consumer products, below 100Hz for professional live sound, and below 80Hz in THX-approved systems. Subwoofers are intended to augment the low frequency range of loudspeakers covering higher frequency bands. While the term [...] "subwoofer" [...] technically only refers to the speaker driver, in common parlance, the term often refers to a subwoofer driver mounted in a speaker enclosure (cabinet).|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Puff is an {{anthropomorphic}} blowfish {{who owns}} the underwater boating school that SpongeBob attends. Despite her efforts, she has been unsuccessful at teaching SpongeBob how to drive a boat. He is her most committed student, and knows the answer to every question on the oral exam, but panics every time he takes the driving part of her course. He often crashes her vehicles and causes town wide destruction in the process. Mrs. Puff displays the blowfish's inflation defense mechanism when she is scared or when SpongeBob crashes, akin to an air bag deploying, each time uttering a <b>low-pitched</b> postmortem [...] "Oh, SpongeBob, WHY?." ...|$|E

The guitar {{is accompanied by a}} [...] "light" [...] drum section and <b>low-pitched</b> vocals from Madonna and also features a cello {{in the first part of}} the song, while gospel music comes in at the later half. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] is written in the time signature of common time with a moderately slow tempo of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major with Madonna's voice spanning from F3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of Gm–F–E–B–Gm as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|The title character, {{played by}} Rowan Atkinson, is a childish buffoon who brings various unusual schemes and contrivances to {{everyday}} tasks. He lives {{alone at the}} address of Flat 2, 12 Arbour Road, Highbury, and is almost always seen in his trademark tweed jacket and a skinny red tie. He also usually wears a digital calculator watch. Mr. Bean rarely speaks, and when he does, it is generally only a few mumbled words which are in a comically <b>low-pitched</b> voice. His first name (he names himself [...] "Bean" [...] to others) and profession, if any, are never mentioned. In the first film adaptation, [...] "Mr." [...] appears on his passport in the [...] "first name" [...] field, and he is shown employed as a guard at London's National Gallery.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi, her longtime collaborators, and recorded at their recording studio, Maan Studios, located in Constanța, Romania. Stan made {{the release of}} new material public through her Facebook account; she later released an audio version of a new track, [...] "All My People", on Soundcloud. The track portrays a featuring with Prodan's fictional character, Manilla Mancias, who provides <b>low-pitched</b> and distorted vocals for the refrain. Musically, the single is of the electro dance genre, featuring an alert rhythm and minimal lyrics. Upon {{the release of the}} single, Romanian website Urban.ro pointed out the evolution of Stan's artistry, with them confessing that the instrumentation of [...] "All My People" [...] was club-friendly, unlike her 2012 single, [...] "Lemonade", which featured [...] "sweet beats".
