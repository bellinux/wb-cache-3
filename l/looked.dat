5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they <b>looked</b> at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they <b>looked</b> at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they <b>looked</b> at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) <b>looked</b> at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>looking</b> time is used {{to assess}} infant perceptual and {{cognitive}} processing, {{little is known about}} the temporal structure of infant <b>looking.</b> To shed light on this temporal structure, 127 three-month-olds were assessed in an infant-controlled habituation procedure and presented with a pre-recorded display of a woman addressing the infant using infant-directed speech. Previous individual <b>look</b> durations positively predicted subsequent <b>look</b> durations over a six <b>look</b> window, suggesting a temporal dependency between successive infant <b>looks.</b> The previous <b>look</b> duration continued to predict the subsequent <b>look</b> duration after accounting for habituation-linked declines in <b>look</b> duration, and when <b>looks</b> were separated by an inter-trial interval in which no stimulus was displayed. Individual differences in temporal dependency, the strength of associations between consecutive <b>look</b> durations, are distinct from individual differences in mean infant <b>look</b> duration. Nevertheless, infants with stronger temporal dependency had briefer mean <b>look</b> durations, a potential index of stimulus processing. Temporal dependency was evident not only between individual infant <b>looks</b> but between the durations of successive habituation trials (total <b>looking</b> within a trial). Finally, temporal dependency was evident in associations between the last <b>look</b> at the habituation stimulus and the first <b>look</b> at a novel test stimulus. Thus temporal dependency was evident across multiple timescales (individual <b>looks</b> and trials comprised of multiple individual <b>looks)</b> and persisted across conditions including brief periods of no stimulus presentation and changes from a familiar to novel stimulus. Associations between consecutive <b>look</b> durations over multiple timescales and stimuli suggest a temporal structure of infant attention that has been largely ignored in previous work on infant <b>looking...</b>|$|R
