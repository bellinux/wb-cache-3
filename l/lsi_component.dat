The most significant driver is the need for an overall end-to-end data system management technology. Maximum use of <b>LSI</b> <b>component</b> technology and trade-offs between hardware and software are manifest in most all considerations of technology needs. By far, the greatest need for data handling technology was identified for the space Exploration and Global Services themes. Major advances are needed in NASA's ability to provide cost effective mass reduction of space data, and automated assessment of earth looking imagery, with a concomitant reduction in cost per useful bit. A combined approach embodying end-to-end system analysis, with onboard data set selection, onboard data processing, highly parallel image processing (both ground and space), low cost, high capacity memories, and low cost user data distribution systems would be necessary...|$|E

It needed characteristics that permitted easy interface to standard SSI and MSI components. It needed a moderate instruction set. It needed to be easy to incorporate into a design. The design needed to put the maximum number of computer components and circuits into the <b>LSI</b> <b>components</b> to minimize the package count.

40|$|The {{structure}} of microprogrammed processors is largely {{determined by the}} state of (semiconductor) technology and the requirements of the task of emulation. We discuss the impact of <b>LSI</b> <b>components</b> on micruprogrammable processors and in par-ticular, the effect of large memory arrays, LSI microprocessors (bit-slices), programmable logic arrays, and high-speed shifters. A secondary theme of this article is that microprogramming differs very little from &quot;regular &quot; programming. We argue that the right approach to understanding microprogramming is to recognize that it is primarily applied to the task of emulation. We review the requirements of the emulation (interpretation) task and indicate what capabilities a microprogrammable processor needs to have {{in order to make the}} process of emulation efficient. We conclude with a taxonomy of microprogrammable processors...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{comprehensive}} evaluation of two supervised feature selection methods for dimensionality reduction is performed- Latent Semantic Indexing (<b>LSI)</b> and Principal <b>Component</b> Analysis (PCA). This is gauged against unsupervised techniques like fuzzy feature clustering using hard fuzzy C-means (FCM). The main {{objective of the}} study is to estimate the relative efficiency of two supervised techniques against unsupervised fuzzy techniques while reducing the feature space.

40|$|Numerical {{techniques}} for data analysis and feature extraction are discussed using {{the framework of}} matrix rank reduction. The singular value decomposition (SVD) and its properties are reviewed, and the relation to Latent Semantic Indexing (<b>LSI)</b> and Principal <b>Component</b> Analysis (PCA) is described. Methods that approximate the SVD are reviewed. A few basic methods for linear regression, in particular the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method, are presented, and analyzed as rank reduction methods. Methods for feature extraction, based on centroids and the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), {{as well as an}} improved LDA based on the generalized singular value decomposition (LDA/GSVD) are described. The effectiveness of these methods are illustrated using examples from information retrieval, and 2 dimensional representation of clustered data. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} {{eigenvector}} decomposition {{can be used}} to extract a term taxonomy from a given collection of text documents. So far, methods based on eigenvector decomposition, such as latent semantic indexing (<b>LSI)</b> or principal <b>component</b> analysis (PCA), were only known to be useful for extracting symmetric relations between terms. We give a precise mathematical criterion for distinguishing between four kinds of relations of a given pair of terms of a given collection: unrelated (car-fruit), symmetrically related (car- automobile), asymmetrically related with the first term being more specific than the second (banana- fruit), and asymmetrically related in the other direction (fruit- banana). We give theoretical evidence for the soundness of our criterion, by showing that in a simplified mathematical model the criterion does the apparently right thing. We applied our scheme to the reconstruction of a selected part of the open directory project (ODP) hierarchy, with promising results...|$|R
30|$|Grouped by {{filtering}} techniques, numeric rating based CF is broadly classified into: memory-based or neighbourhood-based and model-based. In memory-based approaches, {{recommendations are}} developed from user or item neighbourhoods, i.e. proximity (or deviation) measures between the ratings, e.g. cosine similarity, Euclidean distance and various statistical correlation coefficients. Memory-based CF {{can also be}} distinguished into: user-based and item-based. In the former, CF is performed using neighbourhood between users computed from the ratings provided by them. In item-based schemes, prediction is obtained using item neighbourhoods, i.e. proximity (or deviation) of ratings between various items. In model-based approaches, the original user-item ratings dataset is used to train a compact model, which is then used for prediction. The model is developed by methods borrowed from artificial intelligence, such as Bayesian classification, latent classes and neural networks; or, from linear algebra, e.g. singular value decomposition (SVD), latent semantic indexing (<b>LSI)</b> and principal <b>component</b> analysis (PCA). Model-based algorithms are usually fast to query but relatively slow to update.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Study 1 : The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (FVM), Utrecht University, applies three {{selection}} methods {{with the}} aim of selecting motivated and well-performing students: ‘direct admission’, ‘weighted lottery procedure’ (both based on secondary school GPA) and ‘decentralised selection procedure’ (based on non-cognitive criteria). As the weighted lottery will be repealed as a selection procedure in 2017, new selection methods are needed for the assessment of applicants’ study motivation and future academic performance. In this context, the first aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the outcomes of the current FVM admission procedures, in terms of students’ study motivation and academic performance. The second aim was to examine whether types and level of study motivation were related to academic performance, and hence whether these measurements could contribute to a selection procedure. Data from two cohorts (i. e., second- and third-year bachelor-students) at the FVM (n = 186) were obtained, including admission procedure, study motivation (measured by the Academic Motivation Scale(AMS)) and several academic outcome measures. Various univariable - and multivariable analyses were performed to examine differences in study motivation and academic performance between the three admission-groups. Spearman’s correlations and linear regression were applied to examine the relationship between study motivation and academic performance. All multivariable analyses were controlled for the effect of age and gender, if significant. The only difference in study motivation between the admission-groups regarded a stronger extrinsic motivation (EM) in lottery-admitted students, compared to decentralised selected students (P < 0. 05). Directly admitted students outperformed students from the other two admission-groups on several academic outcome measures (P < 0. 05). Only level of motivation was related to academic performance (P < 0. 05). Considering the predictive value for study success, selection based on secondary school GPA is supported; selection based on only non-cognitive criteria, however, is not recommended. The use of type of motivation as a selection criterion is not supported, considering the insignificant correlation with past academic performance. Future research should investigate the predictive validity of type of motivation for academic performance, and should reveal whether research findings are confirmed among larger samples. Abstract Study 2 : The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (FVM), Utrecht University, applies three selection methods {{with the aim}} of selecting motivated and well-performing students: ‘direct admission’, ‘weighted lottery procedure’ and ‘decentralised selection procedure’. As the weighted lottery will be repealed as a selection procedure in 2017, new selection methods are needed for the assessment of applicants’ study motivation and future academic performance. In this context, this study examined whether parts of the Learning Style Inventory (LSI) by Vermunt could contribute to a selection procedure. The first aim was to investigate the stability of learning components during the bachelor; the second aim was to investigate whether learning components in year 1 were related to study motivation, respectively academic performance during the bachelor. Data from two cohorts (i. e., second- and third-year bachelor-students) at the FVM (n = 177) were obtained, including scores on learning components from year 1 and year 3 of the curriculum, study motivation and several academic outcome measures. Paired T-tests were performed to examine the stability of learning components during the bachelor. Several analyses were applied to examine the relationship between learning components and study motivation, respectively academic performance, including Spearman’s correlations and linear regression. All multivariable analyses were controlled for the effect of age and gender, if significant. An increase was found in ‘deep processing’ and ‘concrete processing’ during the bachelor; a decrease was found in ‘stepwise processing’ and ‘external regulation’ (P < 0. 05). ‘Self-regulation’, ‘deep processing’ and ‘stepwise processing’ were positively related to study motivation (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, ‘self-regulation’ and ‘stepwise processing’ were positively related to academic performance (P < 0. 01), and ‘concrete processing’ and ‘no regulation’ were negatively related to academic performance (P < 0. 05). If the aim of using learning components as a selection criterion is ‘to select students with specific learning components’, selection based on these learning components is not recommended, due to the instability of these components. However, selection or rejection of students with specific learning components because of its relationship with study motivation or academic performance is supported. Future research should reveal whether similar conclusions can be drawn about the entire <b>LSI</b> (including four <b>components</b> of learning), and whether research findings are confirmed among larger samples...|$|R
