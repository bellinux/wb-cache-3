25|$|Weston {{mentioned}} he {{had just}} that morning written a letter to Ansel Adams, looking for someone seeking to learn photography in exchange for carrying his bulky <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> {{and to provide a}} much needed automobile. There was a swift meeting of creative minds. For the remainder of 1947 through the beginning of 1948, Dody commuted from San Francisco on weekends to learn from Weston the basics of photography. In early 1948, Dody moved into “Bodie House,” the guest cottage at Edward's Wildcat Hill compound, as his full-time assistant.|$|E
2500|$|James Baker {{developed}} the optics for a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> {{to be used}} in the U-2 while working for Perkin-Elmer. The new camera had a resolution of [...] from an altitude of [...] The aircraft was so crowded that when Baker asked Johnson for six more inches of space for a lens of [...] focal length, Johnson replied [...] "I'd sell my grandmother for six more inches!"; Baker instead used a [...] f/13.85 lens in a 13×13in (33×33cm) format for his final design.|$|E
50|$|His {{use of an}} 8&times;10 <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> and {{extremely}} long exposures has garnered Sugimoto {{a reputation as a}} photographer of the highest technical ability. He is equally acclaimed for the conceptual and philosophical aspects of his work.|$|E
50|$|Standard lenses for <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras</b> are {{generally}} of the Plasmat type, as are many macro lenses. Convertible lenses for large-format photography often consist of Plasmat cells.|$|R
2500|$|In 1986, the Butchers' son {{was killed}} when a drunk driver hit the car {{in which he was}} a passenger. Butcher retreated to the {{wilderness}} for solace and restoration. He put aside color photography and became a black-and-white landscape photographer using <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stephen DiRado (born 1957) is an American photographer. His work {{is mostly}} black-and-white, {{and he makes}} {{frequent}} use of <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras.</b> He is most noted for his portraiture, night-astronomical photography, and semi-composed group photography, and for the extensive length of his projects.|$|R
50|$|A Lens Board Adapter {{accessory}} {{permits the}} use of <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> lenses fitting Linhof Technika type lens boards, but the shutter of these lenses is not controlled by the Fuji GX680, so only Bulb speed can be used.|$|E
50|$|Jumonji photographed Matsumoto Kōshirō IX for a {{collection}} of black-and-white portraits of the same title; in 2005 he published a second volume, Nippon Geki-gan, of monochrome portraits of actors taken with a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> shortly before or after performance.|$|E
5000|$|As the 1944 Christmas season approached, French {{took several}} weeks’ {{leave from the}} Seattle P-I, {{and set up a}} photo {{concession}} jointly with Frederick & Nelson. French used a hidden <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> and captured [...] "candid" [...] portraits of children visiting with Santa in black and white. It was wildly successful, so French did it again in 1945.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, the Butchers' son {{was killed}} when a drunk driver hit the car {{in which he was}} a passenger. Butcher retreated to the {{wilderness}} for solace and restoration. He put aside color photography and became a black-and-white landscape photographer using <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Many {{photographers who}} use <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras</b> and sheet film {{do their own}} film processing. Some more professionally {{oriented}} photographic labs will process color negative and positive sheet film, but the [...] "corner drug store" [...] photolab generally can not. There are multiple methods that can be used.|$|R
5000|$|Stoškus {{works with}} medium- and <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras</b> to create {{detailed}} black-and-white {{photographs of the}} unspoiled parts of the old town of central Vilnius. Cars, advertising, signs of tourism, and even the presence of pedestrians [...] - [...] all are minimized {{in order not to}} detract from the architecture, his main interest.|$|R
50|$|This Land is {{a series}} of {{photographs}} depicting the interiors of high-end automobiles with tranquil scenes such as sunsets or oceans outside. The interior and exterior components were separately photographed in great detail by using a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> and then digitally combined, resulting in hyperrealistic imagery. Massey references tropes of car advertising and positions the luxury car as the epitomie of modernism.|$|E
50|$|To use sheet film, the {{photographer}} places {{a sheet of}} film, emulsion side out, into a film holder in the dark, and closes the dark slide over the loaded film. Next, the holder is inserted into a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera,</b> and the dark slide {{is removed from the}} holder. The exposure is made, the dark slide is replaced, and the film holder is removed from the camera.|$|E
50|$|Hornstra {{prefers to}} work with film, in medium format or large format:It takes me {{quite a bit of}} time to set up my Mamiya medium-format camera and Horseman <b>large-format</b> <b>camera.</b> And that allows me to shoot more {{spontaneous}} pictures. Yes, it sounds contradictory. But snapshots aren't always so spontaneous by any means. When people have to pose for a long time, they eventually relax. Then you can really take nice pictures of them.|$|E
50|$|Adams and Fred Archer {{developed}} the Zone System {{as a way}} to determine proper exposure and adjust the contrast of the final print. The resulting clarity and depth characterized his photographs. He primarily used <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras</b> because the large film used with these cameras (primarily 4x4 and 8x10) contributed to sharpness in his prints.|$|R
50|$|Český dřevák was a {{group of}} Czech photographers that existed in 2000-2008. Its members were not {{connected}} by a common manifesto, but by the technical way of creating photographs. All of them worked with wooden <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras</b> (using negative formats such as 13x18 - 24x30 cm) and their resulting photographs were usually contact prints.|$|R
50|$|Landauer worked {{predominantly}} {{in black}} and white; although he worked with colour photography later in his career, he always felt it was relatively inferior to black-and-white photography. Similarly, he felt that <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras</b> provided better-quality photographs than light, automated equipment. It was only in his later years, due to health concerns, that he switched to lighter equipment.|$|R
50|$|Glass {{plates were}} later {{replaced}} by sheet film {{in a dark}} slide for sheet film; adaptor sleeves were made to allow sheet film {{to be used in}} plate holders. In addition to the ground glass, a simple optical viewfinder was often fitted. Cameras which take single exposures on sheet film and are functionally identical to plate cameras were used for static, high-image-quality work; much longer in 20th century, see <b>Large-format</b> <b>camera,</b> below.|$|E
5000|$|His {{work has}} {{specialised}} in documenting life in Hackney, depicting local issues and sensationalist news headlines with compositions {{borrowed from the}} Old Masters. For instance, his photograph of a squatter, Woman Reading a Possession Order, references Johannes Vermeers Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window. This photograph won the Kobal Photographic Portrait Award in 1998. Of the photograph, which was shot with a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> and printed in Ilfochrome process, Hunter said: ...|$|E
50|$|Recognized for his playful {{interaction}} of light, Sato uses a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> for exposures that last {{from one to}} three hours, while he moves through the space creating points of light or illuminated lines drawn with flashlights or flashes made by reflecting mirrors. The results are detailed photographs interrupted by patterns of light. And because of the long exposures, Sato’s movements across the scene remain undetectable by the camera; the photograph captures his presence but not his image.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1975, Takashi Amano visited {{tropical}} rain{{forests in}} Amazon, Borneo and West Africa and pristine forests in Japan, creating {{a series of}} photos focusing on [...] "untouched nature" [...] with <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras.</b> He captured minute details of nature on extra large size films (up to 8×20 inches). His works have been introduced internationally through several exhibitions and publications.|$|R
50|$|Interchangeable-lens cameras with {{a central}} shutter within the lens body require that each lens has a shutter built into it. In {{practice}} most cameras with interchangeable lenses use a single focal plane shutter in the camera body for all lenses, while cameras with a fixed lens use a central shutter. Many medium-format and most <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras,</b> however, have interchangeable lenses each fitted {{with a central}} shutter. A few interchangeable-lens cameras have a behind-the-lens leaf shutter. <b>Large-format</b> press <b>cameras</b> often had a focal-plane shutter. Some had both a focal-plane shutter (for lens interchangeability) and a lens with central shutter (for flash synchronisation); one shutter would be locked open.|$|R
50|$|Steve Giovinco is an American photographer. He {{created a}} {{hand-held}} <b>large-format</b> (8x8") <b>camera</b> in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|He {{embarked}} on {{his career with}} the exhibition Den gådefulde by (The Enigmatic City) at Copenhagen's Galleri Gari in 1988, simultaneously publishing the series in book form. The black-and-white photographs, taken with a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera,</b> cover the city's parks, cemeteries and areas around museums and monuments. But the city he presents appears empty, distant and alienated. The photographs have an almost metaphysical dimension as the [...] "invisible" [...] aspects of the town come over in a new, mysterious light.|$|E
5000|$|James Baker {{developed}} the optics for a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> {{to be used}} in the U-2 while working for Perkin-Elmer. The new camera had a resolution of 2.5 ft from an altitude of 60000 ft. The aircraft was so crowded that when Baker asked Johnson for six more inches of space for a lens of 240-inch focal length, Johnson replied [...] "I'd sell my grandmother for six more inches!"; Baker instead used a 180-inch f/13.85 lens in a 13" [...] by 13" [...] format for his final design.|$|E
50|$|Pope {{traveled}} for {{two years}} through Italy and Greece, where he studied, sketched and made measured drawings of more Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance structures than he did of the remains of ancient buildings. Pope {{was one of the}} first architectural students to master the use of the <b>large-format</b> <b>camera,</b> with glass negatives. Pope attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1896, honing his Beaux-Arts style. After returning to New York in 1900, he worked for a few years in the office of Bruce Price before opening his own practice.|$|E
50|$|Branko Cvetkovic (born 1951), a Slovenian {{photographer}} {{known for}} his philosophically conceptualized approach to photography. Working mostly with <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras,</b> his architecture photography is minimalistically structured. From symmetry he opens up the space perspective to deconstructivism, and in art there is a transition to a non-perspective suprematist plane, thus coinciding with abstract expressionism. Besides space, his main concern is the phenomenon of light itself, the two basic postulates in photography.|$|R
50|$|Digital backs {{which are}} used {{in place of the}} normal film back are {{available}} for most medium and all <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras</b> with adaptors which can allow the same digital camera back to be used with several different cameras, allowing a photographer to choose a body/lens combination best suited for each application rather than using a body/lens system which represents a compromise of design to fit a variety of applications.|$|R
50|$|A {{digital camera}} back is {{a device that}} {{attaches}} {{to the back of}} a camera in place of the traditional negative film holder and contains an electronic image sensor. This lets cameras that were designed to use film take digital photographs. These camera backs are generally expensive by consumer standards (US$5000 and up) and are primarily built to be attached on medium- and <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras</b> used by professional photographers.|$|R

50|$|In 1988 Killip was {{commissioned}} by Pirelli UK which thought that he might photograph its tire factory in Burton; agreement on this was reached in April the next year, whereupon Killip started work. Attempting to use available light in a darkened factory in which work was done on a black product, he was at first unsuccessful, but in June he switched to flash and a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> and photographed for three more months. The resulting work was exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum (London) in September 1989; {{it was published in}} book form by Ute Eskildsen/Steidl in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Newman {{is often}} {{credited}} {{with being the}} first photographer to use so-called environmental portraiture, in which the photographer places the subject in a carefully controlled setting to {{capture the essence of}} the individual's life and work. Newman normally captured his subjects in their most familiar surroundings with representative visual elements showing their professions and personalities. A musician for instance might be photographed in their recording studio or on stage, a Senator or other politician in their office or a representative building. Using a <b>large-format</b> <b>camera</b> and tripod, he worked to record every detail of a scene.|$|E
50|$|Panchromatic {{black-and-white}} {{photographic printing}} papers {{are sensitive to}} all wavelengths of visible light. They were designed for the printing of full-tone black-and-white images from colour negatives; this is not possible with conventional orthochromatic papers. Panchromatic papers {{can also be used}} to produce paper negatives in <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras.</b> These materials must be handled and developed in near-complete darkness. Kodak Panalure Select RC is an example of a panchromatic black-and-white paper; it was discontinued in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most popular}} {{rollfilm}} {{is the type}} 120 film format, which is used in most medium-format cameras and roll film magazines for <b>large-format</b> <b>cameras.</b> Until the 1950s, 120 roll film was also used {{in what was then}} the most simple of snapshot cameras, and box cameras. The use of roll film in consumer cameras was largely superseded by 135 and 126 cartridges, but 120 and 220 (double length) film are still commonly used in medium-format cameras.|$|R
