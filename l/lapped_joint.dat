Due to this variety, many researchers have developed a model to predict {{the performance of the}} CLT panel (Okabe et al. [4], Oh et al. [5]). Also because there are very varied connections, several models to predict the shear performance of CLT shear wall connection have been developed. Filiatrault and Folz [6] applied a kinematic model for seismic design of wood frame building. FPInnovations and Binational Softwood Lumber Council [7] described a kinematic model, in which the performance of the CLT wall could be predicted by the properties of connection under the assumption that the CLT panel is a rigid body. Gavric et al. [8] developed an analytical model and analyzed the CLT wall made of two horizontally connected panels. Yasumura [9] formulated the CLT wall connected by horizontally connected panels and validated the formula. But the connection for vertically extending has not been investigated.|$|E

In this technique, the percentage of material loss is determined by comparing the signal from the defective joint with a reference signal. Ultrasonic tests based on pulse-echo technique {{can also be used to}} detect thickness reduction in <b>lap</b> <b>joints.</b> However both of these methods require that the sensor be directly above the defects, thus making their practical implementation extremely time consuming. Improving the efficiency of <b>lap</b> <b>joint</b> inspection is one of the most critical tasks currently facing the NDE community.

40|$|Abstract. The railway carbody {{structure}} for commuter and suburban train services in Japan is often made of austenitic stainless steel, {{which is used}} in the form of thin metal sheets manufactured by cold rolling. Spot welding and laser welding at lapped joints are used in the construction of such carbodies, {{but it is difficult to}} observe the strain distribution around these weld zones, which represent the critical area of the body structure’s strength. The objective of this study is to ascertain the strain distribution in the stainless steel around the weld zone of the carbody structure. To enable observa-tion of this distribution, a strain scanning method using high-energy synchrotron radiation was ap-plied to the strain measurement of austenitic stainless steel. The transmission method was applied in order to observe the internal weld zone. Using this method, we can measure the strain distribution from the surface to the inside of the weld zone. A <b>lapped</b> <b>joint</b> specimen, prepared by welding 2 -mm-thick plates using the laser welding method, was used for measurement. Austenitic stainless steel generally poses problems in the measurement of strain due to its coarse grain and crystal texture. The gage volume in this measurement had a width of 3 mm and a height of 0. 15 mm. The meas-urement provides the strain distribution of both residual strain and strain under loading, and the results obtained successfully show the distribution of strain in the weld zone.

40|$|Lapped joints of cold-formed steel (CFS) Z-shaped purlins are {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} building roof systems. The {{research that has}} been carried out so far for these lapped connections is primarily focused on connections with round holes. However, the lapped connections with vertical slotted holes are extensively used in current construction practice to simplify the erection of continuous Z-shaped roof purlins. There is no design guideline or recommendation available for CFS Z-purlin lapped connections with vertical slotted holes. Presented in this paper are the results of an experimental study and analysis of the structural behaviour of lapped CFS Z-shaped purlin connections with vertical slotted holes. 42 flexural tests were performed on lapped CFS Z-shaped purlins with vertical slotted connections with different lap lengths, purlin depths, thicknesses and spans. The flexural strength and deflection of each specimen were measured. The characteristics of moment resistance and flexure stiffness of the lapped purlins were computed. The test results show that the lapped purlins with vertical slotted holes may be more flexible than the lapped purlins with round holes or continuous purlins without <b>lapped</b> <b>joint.</b> Thus, the slotted connections may need greater lap lengths to achieve full stiffness of continuous purlins. The results also indicate that the characteristics of moment resistance and flexural stiffness in the slotted connections are dependent on the ratio of lap length to purlin depth, the ratio of lap length to purlin thickness, the ratio of purlin depth to purlin thickness, and the ratio of lap length to span.

In this study, fracture mechanics is used to analyze the failure mechanism of the <b>lap</b> <b>joint</b> and evaluate the thickness effect on strength of the <b>lap</b> <b>joint.</b> Generally, the adhesive material is softer than the substrates and the crack in the adhesive layer is constrained by the rigid boundaries.

Constant effective fracture toughness is proposed for better strength prediction by considering of the non-singular stress term ahead of the crack tip. For elastic-plastic material, CTOA is proven to be insensitive to the constraining of the rigid boundaries and can be used as the failure criterion for fracture analysis.

Conventional design procedures of riveted <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> {{are based on the}} assumption that all rivets carry equal load. As this assumption is not entirely valid as found in research literature associated with fatigue and fracture, it is important to investigate this point in terms of the static strength of the riveted joint as well. Hence, in the present study, riveted joint’s static strength experiments and numerical studies are carried out on four different (single and multi-row) riveted <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> with strain gauges placed at specified locations. The experiments show that all the riveted <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> sustained the estimated ultimate load and failed only after reaching or exceeding the joint failure load. All these riveted <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> are analyzed by non-linear finite element method, considering the rivet yielding, plate yielding, geometrical nonlinear and secondary bending effects of the <b>lap</b> <b>joint.</b> The analysis of riveted <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> shows that though there is unequal load distribution among the rivets in the elastic regime, once the rivets start yielding, significant redistribution of the load takes place among the rivets and the load sharing between the rivets is nearly equal at the failure load of the joint. The agreement between the finite element analysis strains and experimental strains is reasonably good at the failure load and this in conjunction with the aforementioned experimental finding proves that the rivets share nearly equal load at the joint failure load and justifies the conventional design methodology of riveted joints. To the authors’ knowledge no previous research evidence for such correlation was found and this paper confirms conventional design procedures are adequate, though complex interactions between the plate and rivets tend to exist based on non-linear behavior. ...|$|R
5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt <b>joint,</b> <b>lap</b> <b>joint,</b> corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. <b>Lap</b> <b>joints</b> are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a <b>lap</b> <b>joint</b> geometry.|$|R
