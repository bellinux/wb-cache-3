40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the administration of}} Native affairs by the Liberal Government from 1893 to 1906. In 1893, just {{two years after the}} Liberals came to power the Native Department was dismantled, with the Justice Department forced to take over the majority of its work. However, as this thesis argues, such attempts to administer Native affairs without a single, focussed agency failed. Accordingly the department was re-established in 1906. This thesis begins by discussing how the newly-elected Liberal Government set about abolishing the Native Department in 1893, and describes the transfer of the department's functions to a range of other state agencies. The dismantling of the department was seen as the logical result of several decades of attempts made by other Ministries to wind down the department. However, the decision to abolish the Native Department was taken by the Liberals against a background of sharply divided opinion, among both Māori and Europeans, as to the appropriateness of the measure. For a period of thirteen years Maori were denied the right of a specialist Government agency working in their interests. The thesis describes how other agencies managed Native affairs, and especially points to the problems that arose following the fragmenting of Native affairs administration. This was especially evident after James Carroll became Native Minister in 1899. Soon after his appointment, a Māori <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>Department</b> was established, whose purpose was to service in a limited way the new Māori land administration councils. However, in the context of increasing activity in the area of land administration, and {{in the light of the}} perceived failure of the councils, and of the Māori <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>Department,</b> the Department of Native Affairs was re-established in 1906. This thesis discusses the context for this re-establishment of the agency so determinedly abolished in 1893, and draws some broad conclusions concerning Liberal Māori policy, especially land policy during the period...|$|E

In response to this need, an International SDI Short Course held by the Centre for SDIs and <b>Land</b> <b>Administration,</b> <b>Department</b> of Geomatics, The University of Melbourne from 19 - 21 November 2003. The course was conducted as a result of Resolution 5 (Capacity Building) of the 16 th United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific (UNRCC-AP) and was further endorsed at the 9 th Permanent Committee on GIS Infrastructures for Asia and the Pacific (PCGIAP) meeting in Okinawa, Japan, July 2003. The focus of the course was on Developing Spatial Data Infrastructures. It introduced the concept and hierarchical nature of SDIs as well as discussing some SDI applications, issues and challenges for future SDI initiatives. The structure over the three days was based on the book Developing Spatial Data Infrastructures: from concept to reality, Taylor and Francis, UK. The course provided an understanding of the concept and application of SDI, with a range of speakers giving different perspectives to the concept of SDIs. The practical sessions and discussions throughout the course allowed participants to share knowledge, and were a good opportunity to discover the other participants use and understanding of SDIs in their different jurisdictions and organisations. The key issues that were highlighted concerned data availability, accessibility, and applicability as well as the importance of partnerships among of stakeholders and securing funding for the development, and of ensuring SDIs were user driver, interoperable and integratable.

40|$|The Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) {{is under}} {{development}} within the Technical Committee 211 (TC 211) of the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) and identified as ISO 19152. Within the LADM classical cadastral concepts as “parcel” and “boundary” have {{been extended to}} be able to include spatial representations of overlapping tenures or claims and also multidimensional objects (3 D and 2 D/ 3 D, combined with temporal dimensions). Furthermore, a series of new representations are possible apart from topologically well structured parcels (here called spatial units). Text based, sketch based, point based, line-based, polygon based, or topological based representations of spatial units are possible. The topological spatial units are defined by a consistent topological structure (with no gaps, overlaps or intersections), which is in contrast with a set of polygons, where a consistent topological structure is not guaranteed. A line-based spatial unit is represented by a collection of lines which may be collected from different sources or surveys. A point-based spatial unit contains only the coordinates of the unit’s reference point. A text based spatial unit is not represented by coordinates, but has a spatial unit description in words, e. g. the metes and bounds system (a spatial unit description in terms of distance, direction, and landmarks). All these spatial units may have a 3 D representation, and a provision is made for a mixture of 2 D and 3 D spatial units to co-exist. A level is a collection of spatial units with a geometric or thematic coherence. The concept of level is related to the notion of “legal independence” from ‘Cadastre 2014 ’. This allows for the flexible introduction of spatial data from different sources and accuracies, including utility networks, buildings and other 3 D spatial units, such as mining claims, or construction works. The paper explores the LADM spatial component, which is further based on ISO standards, combined with new concepts as “boundary face string” and partially unbounded primitives. Spatial profiles and the different spatial representations are used to demonstrate the flexibility of spatial representations of this domain model; for formal and non formal land administrations systems alike. The first trial implementation of the Queensland (Australia) Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) for 2 D parcel encoding using the line-based spatial profile will be discussed in detail, together with the polygon based spatial profile for the spatial units of the Portuguese <b>land</b> <b>administration.</b> <b>Department</b> of GIS TechnologyOTB Research Institut...|$|E

40|$|On December 26, 2004, {{the world}} has {{evidenced}} {{one of the most}} horrible tragedies in history of humankind. <b>Land</b> <b>administration</b> sector was also badly influenced by the catastrophe. The cadastral offices in Province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) and Nias were severely damaged by the tsunami. Most of cadastral records were lost or destroyed. The ground benchmarks, natural and man-made objects were also destroyed by tsunami and/or clearing out works in the tsunami affected areas. With nothing left on the ground, the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> processes should be started from the scratch. The Government of Republic of Indonesia (GoI) was quickly responding by publishing five-year master plan of rehabilitation and reconstruction of NAD and Nias, especially on the spatial layout and land affairs. Unfortunately, many have criticised the GoI’s master plan. Besides its macro scale (Kamil, 2005), Fitzpatrick (2005) underlined the relocation camps and coastal buffer zones proposals as promoting disquiet among Acehnese. Many of Acehnese just wanted to go home and resettled their houses in the exactly same location as their previous houses that are swapped by tsunami (Montlake, 2005). NAD is well-know by its uniqueness among other Indonesian provinces since NAD has entirely different cultural background. As most of Indonesian region used to be ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdom, NAD had only been ruled by several Islamic sultanates in different periods of time. Therefore, NAD has a strong Islamic culture. The implementation of Syariah, Islamic Law, has been strengthening the Islamic background of NAD. Besides its strong Islamic background, Acehneses have also different customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system than other Indonesian provinces. The Acehneses’ customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is basically originated from the Islamic culture. The Acehneses’ customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is basically intending to maintain sustainable development and promoting equality for every Acehneses to enjoy the outcome of development. In order to focus on efforts of rehabilitating and reconstructing Banda Aceh, this study only highlights two out of three components of <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> which are <b>land</b> tenure and land use. Land valuation, which is another component of <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> is not included within this study due to the collapse of local governmental institution that is in charge in the valuation of land, as well as due to the prohibition of land transfer before the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system in Banda Aceh is working properly. In this study of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh, the effectiveness of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh is being evaluated. The evaluation of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh is performed with special references to the Acehneses’ customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system, <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theories and cases, Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> policy and regulation and progress on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh. During the performance of this research, interviews and literature study were held to gather information on above mentioned special references. Interviews were held in Banda Aceh, Jakarta and Bandung and covered {{the point of view of}} the decision maker, professional and intellectual on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> field, as well as the aspiration of Acehneses and particularly the citizens of Banda Aceh. On the other hand, the literature study was particularly performed for collecting information on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theories and cases in post conflict areas. Moreover, information regarding Indonesian general and special <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> laws, regulations and policies for Banda Aceh was gathered during the performance of the literature study. Additionally, the aspiration of Acehneses, particularly the citizens of Banda Aceh was also acquired from the literature study, to complete the information gathered by interviews. Having evaluated the contribution of Acehneses’ customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system, it is concluded that the customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is still wanted to be applied in Banda Aceh, even though the Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system has been applied in there for almost half of a century. Some immediate actions on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh that are not in accordance with the customary background of Acehneses, such as titling the land under Indonesian land tenure regime, could still be applied during the phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction. However, the customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is still wanted by the Acehneses and particularly citizens of Banda Aceh to be applied in Banda Aceh in the future. For evaluating effectiveness of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh, a <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system performance evaluation framework is developed in this study. The evaluation framework in this study is developed based on conventional <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theories, as well as adopting the cadastral evaluation framework of Soft System Theory (see Barry, 1999; Augustinus and Barry, 2004). The <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system performance evaluation framework comprises of three evaluation frameworks, which are evaluating the compliance level of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system and its components to the needs and wants of Banda Aceh citizens, as well as the fulfilment of objectives of the higher system of <b>land</b> <b>administration.</b> Having compared the Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system and its implementation to the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theories, as well as to the state of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh, Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is lack of compliance with the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> problems in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh. Several basic problems have been identified, such as dualism of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> regime and lack of fulfilment of land registration features that are simplicity, security, affordability, currency and sustainability, as well as lack of realism, binding power, participation/consultation and human resource in Indonesian land use system. Due to existence of previously mentioned basic problems, which leads to bad-operated and ineffective <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system in Indonesia, immediate efforts are needed to address the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> problem in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh. GoI, its representative and its partners in rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh therefore have formulated regulations and guidelines regarding the rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh. Having evaluated the policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh, it is concluded that the main problems of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in post-disaster areas, which are insecurity of land tenure and needs to address the effect of the catastrophe and disaster mitigation in spatial plan of Banda Aceh, have almost been solved. The policy of GoI on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh also provides a means to fill the gap in Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> regulatory framework, which could be employed as well in the future for advancing Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system. Nevertheless, adoption of breakthroughs proposed by and performed under the policy of GoI on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh might not be able to fully fill the holes left by Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system, such as the recognition of Acehneses’ customary land tenure (known as Hak Ulayat in Indonesian land tenure system) and no binding power mandated to relevant governmental institutions to enforce the implementation of spatial plan. Without efforts to address the basic problems in Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system, the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> state in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh might return to its initial state, even after fully accommodating the previously mentioned breakthroughs in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh. Therefore, besides adopting breakthroughs in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh, this study recommends the government to provide supportive regulations to adapt to the customary background of Acehneses and Indonesia in general, as well as supportive regulations and procedures for accelerating the rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system in Banda Aceh. This study also recommends GoI to train and educate <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> professionals for ensuring the good performance of <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> as well as to address the basic Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> problems.

To administer land matters in Malaysia, the Department of Surveying and Mapping Malaysia uses eKadaster and Land Office has eTanah which are different e-systems. Currently, Malaysia does not have a standard model for <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> and standardisation is one of the important aspects in a <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> process. This research proposed a country profile model using international standards based on <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> Domain Model. This research also attempted to generate strata object model via <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> Domain Model which would be useful for Malaysia and countries with similar <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> systems. In this proposed model, spatial data modelling using secondary data from the aforementioned two <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> units in Malaysia and Unified Modelling Language application were used to develop the conceptual and the technical models. The developed model was evaluated and verified by the Department of Surveying and Mapping Malaysia and Land Office. These units agreed and were satisfied because the model fits their requirements by being more comprehensive as it included three-dimensional lots and two-dimensional topology. In addition, the proposed model facilitated the management of spatial and non spatial objects such as customary areas, reserved lands, lots, strata objects, utilities and the related attributes to be better managed by the two units. The development of Malaysian <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> Domain Model country profile is unique because it can support a very wide range of spatial units. Besides that, the profile included the contents of the various code lists as they are important aspects of standardisation. Furthermore, the model was developed to help establish a national Spatial Data Infrastructure or Malaysian Information Infrastructure. To conclude, the developed Malaysian <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> Domain Model is a standardised model {{that could be used for}} local and international exchange of information concerning <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> matters...|$|R

The evidence on such interventions is however remarkably mixed. This paper discusses {{a number of}} challenges and derives related guidelines for the impact evaluation of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> programs. We focus on four types of challenges: 1) a conceptual challenge related {{to the need to}} unbundle property rights and to establish the plausible causal chain for <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> interventions; 2) the existence of other binding constraints on productivity, implying the need to consider the complementarity between property rights and other productive interventions; 3) methodological challenges related to the causal identification of the impacts of such interventions; 4) practical and operational challenges for good impact evaluation on <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> which are often operationally complex and politically sensitive. The paper is specifically written with a focus on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> projects in Latin America, and draws from experiences and lessons learned from impact evaluations designed for the IDB, and other donors-funded <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> projects in the region. ...|$|R

Just like social issues benefit from proper <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> systems themselves benefit from proper data standards. In many countries the responsibilities and tasks in <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> are distributed among different organisations. Sometimes those organisations deal with different administrative territories. All of which may have subdivisions again: central, regional and local responsibilities, with either public or private roles. As a result, the governance and quality aspects of the data sets vary. <b>Land</b> <b>administrations</b> worldwide are often incomplete, data are not up-to-date and not fit for purpose. At the same time, new <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> Systems (LASs) are being developed all over the world again and again. Sometimes countries even have more than one IT-system for <b>land</b> <b>administration.</b> The wheel keeps being re-invented. This has a huge impact on the continuity and effect of LASs. Internationally, the wish emerged for a widely accepted data model (domain) standard, making use of the knowledge already existing worldwide. This wish was supported by UNHABITAT, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the UN and the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG). This data model should be able to function as the core of any <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system. The standard should be flexible, widely applicable and function as a gathering point of a state-of-the-art international knowledge base on this theme. This common standard has now been designed and is currently proposed for implementation. It is called the <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> Domain Model, in short: LADM. It is available since December 1 st 2012 as a formal International Standard, published as ISO 19152 : 2012. This paper analyses the impact of the standard with regard to the development of (and information exchange) between <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> Systems. Real impact is already visible in open source software development for <b>land</b> <b>administration.</b> The continuum of land rights is supported. There is also a continuum of accuracy, of land recordation’s, of types of spatial units, of types of parties involved, and of data acquisition approaches. All this is supported in LADM – allowing for a flexible, step by step approach in {{the development of a}} <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> based on the needs, priorities and requirements of users and society. This can be combined in a natural way with organisational development with a proper alignment to ICT development. This makes the concept of LADM a basis for strategic development in <b>land</b> <b>administration.</b> OTB ResearchOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|R

Central to this objective is the privatisation of lands and the establishment of efficient land markets. To this end the EU and many other countries and international organisations have committed significant resources to support <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> and particularly cadastral projects, in Central Europe since 1992. This paper reviews the role that the establishment of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> systems is playing in the accession of CEC to the EU. Other {{key requirements}} for accession to the EU are the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of human rights, environmental sustainability and institution building. The paper also considers the role that <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> plays in supporting these objectives and develops a generic framework for <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> projects in support of accession to the EU. As background the paper uses examples to highlight the historical context of land, the evolution of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Central Europe, the reconstruction of property rights and the justification of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> projects in the context of AGENDA 2000 for a wider Europe.
