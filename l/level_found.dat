25|$|Among {{the various}} gardens and parks {{located in the}} country, Singapore's Singapore Botanic Gardens, Jurong Bird Park and Gardens by the Bay are most popular amongst tourists. The Singapore Botanical Gardens, a UNESCO World Heritage Site is a 52 {{hectares}} tropical garden, among its main attractions includes the National Orchid collection with over 3000 types of orchids growing. Jurong Bird Park, is a bird zoo with extensive specimens of exotic bird life from around the world, including a flock of one thousand flamingos. The bird park is {{largest in the world}} in terms of the number of birds. Gardens By The Bay, designed as a series of large tropical leaf-shaped gardens, each with its own specific landscaping design, character and theme. Its main attractions are the two conservatories, the Flower Dome, which replicates a mild, dry climate and features plants found in the Mediterranean and other semi-arid tropical regions, and the Cloud Forest, which replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions between 1,000 metres (3,300ft) and 3,000 metres (9,800ft) above sea <b>level,</b> <b>found</b> in South-East Asia, Middle- and South America. Other main attractions include the Supertree Grove, which features tree-like structures, known as Supertrees that dominate the Gardens' landscape. They are vertical gardens that perform a multitude of functions, which include planting, shading and working as environmental engines for the gardens.|$|E
500|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{an active}} Fire Management Program which {{recognize}}s that forest fires are {{a natural part}} of the ecosystem, but this was not always the case. The 1987 forest plan did not recognize fire as an ecosystem process or as a tool for ecosystem management; this was rectified in the 2012 forest plan. Previous firefighting efforts, which emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, caused dead and dying trees to accumulate well in excess of the <b>level</b> <b>found</b> when fires are allowed to burn out naturally. Historically speaking, fires became more common in parts of the SNRA after the development of lodgepole pine forests, which occurred prior to 1450AD. Between 1989 and 1998 there were on average 50 fires per year, with 58 percent of them caused by lightning. The Smoky Mountains of Idaho were named from the frequent forest fires, and in 2007 the Castle Rock Fire burned [...] of the Smoky Mountains near Ketchum. In 2005 the Valley Road Fire burned [...] in the White Cloud Mountains after being ignited from embers that came from a trash barrel which were blown out on a windy day. In August 2013 the Beaver Creek Fire and the Kelley Fire were both ignited by lightning and burned [...] and , respectively, of the Fairfield and Ketchum ranger districts. Another lightning-caused fire, the McCan Fire, burned [...] of the Fairfield Ranger District and other lands north of Fairfield in 2013. Both natural and prescribed fires are used as a tool to maintain desired vegetation and fuel levels. While the forest's fire plan operates within historical fire regimes, locally fire is actively suppressed to protect human life, investments, and resources.|$|E

2500|$|The Schiller Piano Company factory building's rear, Franklin Street, wing was {{constructed}} in 1893. The entire [...] industrial structure sits {{on the west bank}} of the Rock River. Around 1900 the rest of the Piano Company's main complex was added to the existing structure. The main (west) facade of the Schiller Piano Company factory building faces Third Street with no setback from the street and its secondary facade, along with the rest of the exterior, features an exposed basement because the elevation lowers as the terrain slopes toward the Rock River. The rear facade exhibits a U-shape while maintaining the exposed basement <b>level</b> <b>found</b> throughout much of the rest of the structure. The front facade features seven bays, demarcated by wooden trim between the stucco panels, entrances are located on each of the even numbered panels. The roof is an unusual multi-gabled, low pitch roof, which is still original in its form. The building features two windows over each of the entrance bays. After Dale Dye purchased the facility the stucco cladding was added to the exterior in 1977-1978, covering all original windows and walls; they remain extant beneath the stucco, and some show up in post-2005 photographs.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought of}} it every day; but he {{thought of it}} without bitterness. It {{might have been an}} unfortunate affair for his poor dad, and the whole story threw a queer light upon the social and {{political}} life of Costaguana. The view he took of it was sympathetic to his father, yet calm and reflective. His personal feelings had not been outraged, {{and it is difficult to}} resent with proper and durable indignation the physical or mental anguish of another organism, even if that other organism is one's own father. By the time he was twenty Charles Gould had, in his turn, fallen under the spell of the San Tome mine. But it was another form of enchantment, more suitable to his youth, into whose magic formula there entered hope, vigour, and self-confidence, instead of weary indignation and despair. Left after he was twenty to his own guidance (except for the severe injunction not to return to Costaguana), he had pursued his studies in Belgium and France with the idea of qualifying for a mining engineer. But this scientific aspect of his labours remained vague and imperfect in his mind. Mines had acquired for him a dramatic interest. He studied their peculiarities from a personal point of view, too, as one would study the varied characters of men. He visited them as one goes with curiosity to call upon remarkable persons. He visited mines in Germany, in Spain, in Cornwall. Abandoned workings had for him strong fascination. Their desolation appealed to him like the sight of human misery, whose causes are varied and profound. They might have been worthless, but also they might have been misunderstood. His future wife was the first, and perhaps the only person to detect this secret mood which governed the profoundly sensible, almost voiceless attitude of this man towards the world of material things. And at once her delight in him, lingering with half-open wings like those birds that cannot rise easily from a flat <b>level,</b> <b>found</b> a pinnacle from which to soar up into the skies.|$|E
