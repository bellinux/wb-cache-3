En 1872, he {{signed an agreement with}} Ludvig Nobel, who <b>furnished</b> the <b>machine</b> tools. Under his direction, more than 400,000 Berdanka guns were produced. He created the #4 line carbine. The first telegraph office was opened there. The factory was re-supplied by rail. It was during these years (with production starting of the Berdan rifle) that the division of labour and machine tool production of all the gun mechanism pieces came into its own. The Kalashnikov was invented and manufactured at Ijevsk. The carbine no4 underwent a baptism of fire during the Russo-Turk War. Von Bilderling personally visited the front to evaluate of the effectiveness of this weapon. He was later awarded the right to bear the arms of St George for his actions on the Danube.

40|$|All {{conventional}} paper machines {{exhibit a}} profile of cross-machine direction (CD) shrinkage which is developed during the drying stage of production. This paper suggests {{a new approach to}} the understanding of these profiles by suggesting that CD shrinkage at a point in the paper depends on the distance of that point from both edges of the sheet and also on the length of the unsupported draws in the dryer section. The nature of the func-tion is unimportant as long as it can be made to fit data for one combination of machine width and effective draw length; substi-tuting other values will then change the shape appropriately. In this paper, a simple exponential decay of shrinkage with distance from the edge is used successfully. This approach is initially demonstrated for laboratory results from the literature, where it successfully predicts changes pro-duced by varying the length, width and by reversing the MD/CD orientation of samples. It is then shown to be consistent for changes of paper <b>machine</b> <b>furnish,</b> press section draw and sheet grammage produced in a series of trials on M-real, New Thames PM 6.

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is focused on}} developing simple parametric models of the unbalanced magnetic pull produced in eccentric-rotor electrical machines. The influence of currents circulating in the parallel paths of the stator winding on the unbalanced magnetic pull is given the main attention. The interaction between these currents and those circulating in the rotor cage/damper winding is also considered. First, a parametric force model for an eccentric-rotor salient-pole synchronous machine is developed. The effects of the parallel stator windings are not considered in this model. Next, a low-order parametric force model is built for electrical machines equipped with parallel stator windings but operating without the rotor cage/damper winding. This force model is applicable to salient-pole synchronous machines {{as well as to}} induction motors. And finally, a special force model is developed for electrical <b>machines</b> <b>furnished</b> with parallel paths both in the rotor and stator windings. This model accounts for the equalising currents circulating in the rotor and stator windings and also for the interaction between these currents. This third force model can be applied to a salient-pole synchronous machine and to an induction machine. The parameters of the force models are estimated from the results of numerical simulations applying a soft-computing-based estimation program. All the developed force models with the estimated parameters demonstrate a very good performance in a wide whirling frequency range. The effects of parallel paths in the rotor and stator windings on the unbalanced magnetic pull are investigated numerically. The acquired results reveal that the total unbalanced magnetic pull and its constituents related to the fundamental magnetic field and slotting are strongly affected by the presence of parallel paths in the stator winding. However, unlike the rotor cage, parallel stator windings may instigate anisotropy in the unbalanced magnetic pull. In such cases, the results of the numerical impulse response test may differ significantly from the conventional calculation results. It is also shown that, {{despite the fact that the}} number of parallel paths in the stator is often substantially lower than the number of parallel paths in the rotor, parallel stator windings may still provide a more efficient UMP mitigation than the rotor cage/damper winding. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Specific <b>machines</b> <b>furnish</b> the {{contemporary}} socio-technical imaginary: ‘Robot companions’ that supposedly herald {{the age of}} robots, an age that is signified by the realization of robot technologies that are taking over labor from humans in every sphere of ‘everyday human lives’. How do we want these robot companions to work and look {{and how do we}} want to live with these machines?  This thesis explores the engineering of relating humans and machines in the specific context of contemporary robotics from a queer feminist technoscience perspective. The ways in which such engineering processes implement ‘human-likeness’ in realizing the figure of the robot companion are of special concern. At the heart of this study is one robot model: Armar, developed at the Institute for Anthropomatics and Robotics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Participating in the local everyday practices of establishing the efficient robot-human interface in the kitchen laboratory, this study investigates the ways in which Armar is made domestic as a prospective care service provider and companion in the kitchen. This study applies a posthumanist frame of research to investigate the practices of making anthropomatic kitchen robots. It employs an understanding of this making in terms of ‘performing the kitchen’. This further entails querying the ways in which norms of ‘humanness’ are translated into the human-like robot as well as the idea of pre-figured embodied entities with individual properties that meet in the laboratory. Thus, this thesis maps the labors and reciprocities of learning to see and experience this specific robot model as a future human-like companion for humans by analyzing the apparatuses of bodily co-production between human and machine that are at work in the kitchen laboratory. Avhandlingen undersöker sociotekniska processer inom samtida robotik som både upprätthåller och skapar människa – maskin relationer ur ett feministiskt teknovetenskapligt perspektiv. Speciellt undersöks hur ingenjörer skapar robot-människa gränssnitt för hushållsrobotik och implementerar människolikhet i skapandet av framtidens robotsällskap. En specifik robotmodell, Armar, och dess utveckling följs vid Institutet för Antropomatik och Robotik, Tekniska Högskola i Karlsruhe i södra Tyskland. Armar ”bor” och verkar där i ett kökslaboratorium, en simulerad vardagsyta utvecklad för forskning och offentliga demonstrationer. Men hushållsrobotar har också en speciell plats i vår kulturella föreställningsvärld. I denna studie undersöks det sociotekniska och kulturella processen att domesticera robotar och ge dem status som prospektiva hjälpredor och sällskap i köket. Som en sådan kartläggning av ömsesidigt människa-maskin skapande teoretiserar studien den kroppsproducerande apparaten (Haraway 1991) som sätts i spel i detta kökslabb och i robot-människa gränssnittet. I studien utforskas ickemänsklig agens och posthumanistisk performativitet (Barad 2003) samt gränsdragningsarbetet mellan Jaget och Andra, människa och maskin, subject och objekt. Avhandlingen gör ett bidrag till förståelsen av kroppsliga normer och socio-materiella ömsesidigheter i skapandet av förmänskligat robotsällskap. Ob in Medienberichten oder Kinofilmen – aktuell prägen Maschinen das sozio-technische Imaginäre, die nach menschlichem Vorbild entwickelt werden, um in das ‘alltäglich-menschliche’ Leben einzutreten und dieses nachhaltig zu verändern. In ihrer Allgegenwärtigkeit künden sie das Zeitalter der Roboter an, das verspricht, den Lebensstandard, den sich der globale Norden zuschreibt, zu verbessern. Im Fokus dieser Studie steht ein spezifisches Robotermodell, Armar, das am Institut für Anthropomatik und Robotik des Instituts für Technologie in Karlsruhe (Deutschland) entwickelt wird. In der Analyse von Interviews, teilnehmender Beobachtung sowie Fotomaterial untersucht diese Studie die alltäglichen Praktiken im Robotik-Küchenlabor, durch die Armar zur Begleiter_in und Care-Arbeiter_in in der Küche wird. Die posthumanistische, queer-feministische Rahmung der Analyse erlaubt es, die Herstellung des anthropomatischen Küchenroboters als ein Performing the Kitchen zu verstehen. Die Arbeit fokussiert damit auf die Bedingungen und die Akteur_innen – sowohl menschliche als auch nichtmenschliche – und fragt nach den Normen des Menschlichen, die bei dem Arbeiten an einer,menschenähnlichen‘ Maschine produziert, aber auch verändert werden. Dabei zeichnet sie nach, dass Entitäten mit verkörperten Eigenschaften nicht präexistieren, sondern aus komplexen Mensch-Maschine-Verhältnissen der Ko-Produktion hervorgehen...|$|R
