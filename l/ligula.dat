5|$|External parasites include chewing lice of {{the genus}} Saemundssonia, feather lice and fleas such as Ceratophyllus borealis. Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite {{different}} species. Internal parasites include the crustacean Reighardia sternae, and tapeworms such as <b>Ligula</b> intestinalis {{and members of the}} genera Diphyllobothrium and Schistocephalus. Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry Haemoproteus species. An exception is the brown noddy, which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|In mandibulate mouthparts, the labium is a quadrupedal structure, {{although}} it is formed from two fused secondary maxillae. It {{can be described as}} the floor of the mouth. With the maxillae, it assists with manipulation of food during mastication or chewing or, in the unusual case of the dragonfly nymph, extends out to snatch prey back to the head, where the mandibles can eat it. The labium is similar in structure to the maxilla, but with the appendages of the two sides fused by the midline, so they come to form a median plate. The basal part of the labium, equivalent to the maxillary cardines and possibly including a part of the sternum of the labial segment, is called the postmentum. This may be subdivided into a proximal submentum and a distal mentum. Distal to the postmentum, and equivalent to the fused maxillary stipites, is the prementum. The prementum closes the preoral cavity from behind. Terminally, it bears four lobes, two inner glossae, and two outer paraglossae, which are collectively known as the <b>ligula.</b> One or both pairs of lobes may be absent or they may be fused to form a single median process. A palp arises from each side of the prementum, often being three-segmented.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Ligulae</b> intestinalis is a {{parasitic}} cestode, {{which has}} the economic-health importance in fishery industries. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of this parasite in Mazandaran. The effects of habitat temperature and kind of pool (sandy-cement) were considered as well. Methods: In this study, 103 fish samples were obtained in all stages; the samples (male and female) were divided into 3 groups based on length of fish, temperature, origin of cultured fish, kind of pool, height from sea and sex. Macroscopic and microscopic observations were carried out in all stages of the parasite (procercoid, plerocercoid and adult). Chi-square and Pearson's double square tests (P< 0. 05) were conducted in order to evaluate the prevalence and determination of reliability in six sampling areas, respectively. Results: Total rate of the parasites were 9. 7 % in all groups. There was significant difference between parasitism rate and height of sea level, kind of pool (maximum in sandy pools) and high temperature. The multi analyses regarding to above-mentioned three criteria also indicated meaningful difference between these criteria and parasitism rate. Seasonal conditions enhance the prevalence of <b>ligulae</b> intestinalis. Conclusion: Flexibility in parasite's life cycle and choosing different hosts makes it challenging case in fishery industry; moreover its prevalence could be predicted according to environmental conditions so choosing the minimal at risk place for salmonids farming. Further studies are recommended for evaluating the problems in fish fertility and probable risk for infected fish consumers...|$|R

2500|$|The silver {{tableware}} in the hoard comprises three strainers and 33 spoons, of two types. [...] Seventeen of the spoons are cochlearia, {{with long}} tapered handles, {{and the other}} sixteen are the larger <b>ligulae</b> or cigni, with bowls {{about the size of}} a modern dessert spoon and short, coiled handles ending in birds' heads. [...] Many of the spoons bear pagan inscriptions to Faunus, a minor Roman god who had many characteristics in common with the Greek Pan. [...] There is no overtly Christian symbolism in the hoard, though one spoon is decorated with the figure of a fish, which can often be an oblique reference to Christianity. [...] Bacchic iconography is obvious in the group, and was traditional in Roman culture, but in the late Roman period, many Bacchic motifs were adopted and given new interpretations by Christians. Nevertheless, at this date, the end of the 4th century AD, there was no obstacle to placing unequivocally Christian symbols and inscriptions on personal possessions, so that their absence here is noteworthy. The openly, and probably exclusively, pagan iconography remains one of the most interesting and unusual aspects of the assemblage.|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 310 {{individuals}} (124 males, 185 females, 1 indeterminate) of the octopod Octopus salutii caught {{throughout the year}} by bottom trawlers from 25 to 800 m depth in the western Mediterranean were analysed to study some general aspects of its biology. Octopus sizes ranged from 4. 0 to 13. 0 cm ML and 3. 5 to 16. 5 cm ML in males and females, respectively. The species inhabits the lower continental shelf and upper slope, primarily between 250 and 500 m depth. The scarcity of small-sized individuals in the samples and the predominance {{of males and females}} > 8 and > 9 cm ML, respectively, suggest two interpretations: (1) juveniles inhabit grounds inaccessible to, or unsampled by, trawlers, or they avoid capture owing to behavioural aspects; or (2) the species meet in the trawling grounds for reproduction, because in the sizes described the majority of individuals have begun sexual maturation. The reproductive period was found to occur during spring and summer. The stomach content analysis revealed a diet composed of 33 different prey items belonging to three major taxonomic groups (crustaceans, fishes and cephalopods). Quantitatively, crustaceans (Decapoda Reptantia and Natantia groups) were the most important prey, appearing in 87 % of the stomachs, followed by fish (25 %) and cephalopods (10 %). Finally, the paper presents data on mantle length–total weight, gonad weight–total weight and <b>ligulae</b> length–total weight relationships, and utilises different indexes (gonadosomatic, hepatosomatic, fullness weight and emptiness) to describe changes through the three maturity stages of both sexesPublicado...|$|R

40|$|Abstract -Fourteen {{species of}} Aster were {{characterized}} for morphological traits of commercial interest, chromosome number and genetic diversity by AFLP markers to exploit this material {{not only for}} breeding purposes but also as source of pharmaceuticals. The variation observed among the Aster species for five morphological traits was summarized by means of discriminant analysis. Three significant canonical variables, accounting for about 96 % of total variance, were mainly correlated with capitulum diameter, number of <b>ligulae</b> and leaf length. The morphological variation appeared related to ploidy level of the species. A diploid chromosome number ranging from 10 to 18 was evident in seven species whereas the other species are polyploids with variable chromosome numbers up to 52. The pollen production and stainability were quite variable among Aster species. Furthermore, seven species produced big pollen grains besides normally-sized ones, at a frequency ranging from 1 to 12 %, possibly due to 2 n pollen production. The possibility that evolution of Aster genus could be driven by 2 n gametes and sexual polyploidization is discussed. Implications of 2 n gametes for Aster breeding are also mentioned. AFLP analysis of the fourteen Aster species based on six primer combinations revealed a total number of 421 polymorphic amplified DNA fragments. The genetic similarities estimated between the Aster species, based on both shared and unique amplification products ranged from 0. 335 to 0. 604 across all species and revealed a geographically based clustering within the genus. The highest similarity was detected between A. alpinus and A. amellus with Eurasian origin...|$|R

40|$|Medicine {{and the art}} of {{painting}} are intertwined when speaking of medical instruments and equipment, since in Serbian Medieval art they were used as a common utility in iconography by the saintly doctors (saintly physicians). Given the fact they have not been subject to specific scientific research, the paper identifies the specific medical instruments and equipment, not only in regard to painting images, but also taking into account archaeological remains. The remains are mainly dating back to the Antique times, more precisely Roman and Late Roman, whereas the findings of the medical instruments used by Byzantine doctors are quite rare. Although the list of examples is not exhausted, the paper encompasses the majority of images preserved in Serbian paintings during the Medieval times, including the unavoidable limitations imposing the degree of preservation of particular works of art. Thereby, it is to be concluded that a very limited number of medical instruments was selected as the saintly doctor’s attribute. Most frequently displayed instrument is the lancet or phlebotomum, while the probes (auriscalpia and cyathiscomelae), spoons (<b>ligulae)</b> and tweezers (vulsellae, volsellae) were more rarely painted. One instrument with special pur purpose has not been identified. When speaking of doctors’ boxes which contained instruments and medicaments, we are presented with the diversity of their shapes. With this aim, the square-like and cylindrical boxes were used. The square-like boxes varied: with the lid which was jointed into the groove (loculis depromit eburnis type), with compartments with the lid which could be lifted (arca, arcula type) or the boxes with no compartments and quite diverse in their form. Cylindrical boxes were elongated and narrow with the lid which could be pulled on (theca vulneraria or specillotheca type) or the round ones, polygonal and elongated with the cylindrical, pyramidal or the halfshaped lid (scrinum, capsa/capsula, cista type). The case – etui, was also used, which is most commonly depicted in Serbian art. The medical oils and healing fluids were kept in glass vessels of various shapes. The significance of these images, together with the literary sources and archaeological materials, {{is to be found in}} their documentary value and the immediate testimony on the way of life and its diverse aspects of the specific time, in this case the Medieval Serbia...|$|R
