500|$|The {{youngest}} {{sister of}} the [...] "precious Jackson clan", Janet Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael {{and the rest of}} the Jackson family. Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that [...] "he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys." [...] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, [...] "or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a [...] "superstar" [...] in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while [...] "successfully [...] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult." [...] By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the [...] "Queen of Pop". Klein argued that [...] "stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet—Miss Jackson, if you're nasty—would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.".|$|E
500|$|A Love Surreal {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 11 reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman said Bilal had improved {{as a producer}} and songwriter while remaining [...] "supernaturally skilled and creative" [...] as a vocalist, [...] "swooping, diving, wailing, and sighing, all with complete command." [...] Paste magazine's Evan Rytlewski said [...] "for {{the first time in}} his career, Bilal no longer sounds <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> with entirely too much to prove; he's just a great singer, backed by great players he puts to good use on a set of sticky, deceptively inventive songs". Writing for NPR, Ann Powers said that A Love Surreal [...] "cultivates the stratospheric vibe" [...] of Coltrane's A Love Supreme while Bilal's ambition is [...] "grounded in fierce intelligence and a commitment to letting stories unfold all the way to their sometimes sorrowful, sometimes orgasmic end." [...] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it [...] "bracingly good", [...] "compelling music" [...] that allows Bilal's [...] "falsetto to bring the intimate lyrics to life." [...] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said his [...] "full-fledged" [...] voice [...] "needs no studio aid" [...] on songs that [...] "tease and insinuate" [...] with [...] "meanderings [...] lead somewhere." [...] Pitchfork journalist Jayson Greene was less impressed. He said it was a [...] "joy" [...] to listen to Bilal [...] "warp his voice into improbable shapes", but believed the music lacked any prominent melodies. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was more critical of the closing series of slow jams and [...] "atmospheric clutter", while writing that the album's best songs [...] "warrant the increased attention" [...] in Bilal.|$|E
2500|$|To {{depict the}} essence {{of the life of the}} peasant and their spirit, Van Gogh lived as they lived, he was in the fields as they were, {{enduring}} the weather for long hours as they were. [...] To do so was not something taught in schools, he noted, and became frustrated by traditionalists who focused on technique more so than the nature of the people being captured. [...] So thoroughly was he engaged in living the peasant lifestyle, his appearance and manner of speech began to separate himself from others, but this was a cost he believed he needed to bear for his artistic development. [...] Of getting along better with [...] "poor and common folk" [...] than cultured society, Van Gogh wrote in 1882, [...] "after all, it's right and proper that I should live <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> in the surroundings I'm sensitive to and am trying to express." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album has {{generally}} met with positive reviews. Mariano Prunes from Allmusic gave the (Italian edition) album 4/5 stars, praising [...] "its stylistic and thematic consistency and, of course, Zucchero's emotive singing". The [...] "first three songs, for instance, constitute almost a mini-suite of quiet, hymn-like ballads {{that set the}} mood {{for most of the}} album", and it [...] "is only when the day reaches noon that loud guitars and soul background vocals come back to announce a double dose of old-school Zucchero", with [...] "the last three tracks progressively slow things down, drawing closed a perfect circle". He concluded that as [...] "the list of collaborators is both impressive and key to the album's success", Zucchero [...] "looks <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> capable of reinventing himself in a poignant and dignified manner". The experienced Italian musical reviewer Franco Zanetti from Rockol also gave the Italian album 4/5 stars, and praised the production, musicians and Zucchero's singing.|$|E

She had invested great and desperate hopes in the cake, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> working on a great piece of art, and in her mind, she failed. Laura catalogues what she will do to keep busy {{for the rest of the}} day: prepare for Dan's party. She knows Dan will be happy with whatever she prepares. This slightly annoys her. She realises her husband's happiness [...] "depends only on the fact of her, here in the house, living her life, thinking of him". She tries to tell herself this is a good thing and that she is being difficult but is suddenly hit by the image of Virginia Woolf putting a stone into the pocket of her coat and walking into a river. This psychic connection to another ‘desperate housewife’ is interrupted by a tap on the back door.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Lionel Wigram {{remarked that}} for around ten years, {{he had been}} {{thinking}} of new ways to depict Sherlock Holmes. [...] "I realized the images I was seeing in my head [...] were different to the images I'd seen in previous films." [...] He imagined [...] "a much more modern, more bohemian character, who dresses more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> or a poet", namely Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. After leaving his position as executive for Warner Bros. in 2006, Wigram sought a larger scope to the story so it could attract a large audience, and amalgamated various Holmes stories to flesh it out further. Some sequences in the movie were more than suggested by uncredited incidents found in a 1979 novel Enter the Lion: A Posthumous Memoir of Mycroft Holmes. Lord Blackwood's character was developed as a nod to Victorian interests in spiritualism and the later influence of Aleister Crowley. The producer felt he was [...] "almost clever" [...] pitting Holmes, who has an almost supernatural ability to solve crimes, against a supposedly supernatural villain. The plot point, moreover, nods to the Holmesian tale of The Hound of the Baskervilles, where a string of seemingly supernatural events is finally explained through intuitive reasoning and scientific savvy. Wigram wrote and John Watkiss drew a 25-page comic book about Holmes {{in place of a}} spec script.|$|E

That I was a burden, an intolerable burden to my wife, at times--many times--I must admit--but she understood and was charitable. She defended me {{as best she could}} from interruption and smoothed my daily course with deft hand. Slowly my novel began to take shape and as I drew farther away from the remorseful days which made my work seem selfish and vain, I recovered an illogical cheerfulness.|$|E
