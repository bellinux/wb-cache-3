40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> in Italian, i. e. complex predicates formed by a verbal base and a modifying post-verbal particle. In recent years {{a lot of}} {{interest}} has been devoted to these constructions in the Germanic languages, and investigation has been focusing mostly on their structure. Recently, some studies have shown that similar constructions also exist in the Italian language. Our contribution adopts a constructionist approach and aims at improving our knowledge of the properties <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> in Italian with particular reference to semantics and Aktionsart. The paper shows that Italian post-verbal particles contribute to the Aktionsart <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions.</b> Even though Italian does not present a coherent system of actional particles, there are nonetheless some traces of regularity. One case in point is the emergence <b>of</b> a specific <b>verb-particle</b> <b>construction</b> with via ‘away’ that developed an actional function. The paper also discusses the diachronic and synchronic relationship between verbal prefixes and post-verbal particles, trying to determine whether these two strategies cooperate or compete in the expression of locative and aspectual meanings...|$|R

From a diachronic perspective, {{it allows us to}} analyze the phases of the grammaticalization process from <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> to preverbs.

40|$|Previous {{computational}} work {{on learning}} the semantic properties <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> (VPCs) {{has focused on}} their compositionality, and has left unaddressed the issue of which meaning of the component words is being used in a given VPC. We develop a feature space for use in classification of the sense contributed by the particle in a VPC, and test this on VPCs using the particle up. The features that capture linguistic properties of VPCs {{that are relevant to}} the semantics of the particle outperform linguistically uninformed word co-occurrence features in our experiments on unseen test VPCs. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> are {{generally}} regarded as a peculiar property of Germanic languages. In this paper we show that <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> also exist in Italian. The presence <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> in Romance languages seems to contradict Talmy’s generalization about “frame-based languages ” and “satellite-based languages”, which makes these constructions a rather interesting typological issue. Further, the typological perspective {{raises the question of}} the development of these complex verbs in the Italian language. The paper briefly deals with these typological and diachronic issues and then focuses on the semantic properties of these constructions in present-day Italian. In particular, we will analyse the actional properties of Italian post-verbal particles. The results of the analysis allow us to outline the diachronic and synchronic relationship between verbal prefixes and post-verbal particles, which turn out to cooperate in the expression of locative and aspectual meanings...|$|R

We analyse possible ways of identifying regular patterns using different resources.

40|$|This paper investigates, {{in a first}} stage, some {{methods for}} the {{automatic}} acquisition <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> (VPCs) taking into account their statistical properties and some regular patterns found in productive combinations of verbs and particles.

In a second stage we also study whether the combination of statistical and linguistic properties can provide some indication {{of the degree of}} idiomaticity of a given VPC. The results obtained show that such combination can successfully be used to detect VPCs and distinguish idiomatic from compositional cases. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions,</b> discussing their characteristics and their availability {{for use with}} NLP systems. Combinations automatically extracted from corpora greatly improve the coverage of available resources.

40|$|The {{current work}} uses memory errors {{to examine the}} mental {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> (VPCs; e. g., make up the story, cut up the meat). Some evidence suggests that VPCs are represented by a cline in which {{the relationship between the}} VPC and its component elements ranges from highly transparent (cut up) to highly idiosyncratic (make up). Other evidence supports a multiple class representation, characterizing VPCs as belonging to discretely separated classes differing in semantic and syntactic structure. We outline a novel paradigm to investigate the representation of VPCs in which we elicit illusory conjunctions, or memory errors sensitive to syntactic structure. We then use a novel application of piecewise regression to demonstrate that the resulting error pattern follows a cline rather than discrete classes. A preregistered replication verifies these findings, and a final preregistered study verifies that these errors reflect syntactic structure. This provides evidence for gradient rather than discrete representations across levels of representation in language processing...|$|R
40|$|The papers {{investigate}} constructions with P(repositional) {{elements in}} German. It aims at a comprehensive {{theory of the}} syntax-semantics interface for the different verbal constructions in German, including verb plus prepostional phrase, (separable) particle verbs, and (inseparable) prefix verbs. The constructions are given syntactic representations following minimalist principles as known from Distributive Morphology (DM) according to which a single syntactic engine drives formation of both words and phrases. Among the syntactic principles the Split-P hypothesis plays a central role. A crucial feature of the approach is that the syntactic structures are used as input to the computation of semantic representations according to principles of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). Several challenges that present themselves for a compositional theory of word- and phrase- formation with P-elements in German are accounted for in the paper: syntactic separability <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> vs non-separability <b>of</b> prefix-verbs; semantic restrictions in the P-elements to build constructions of the former and the latter type; syntactic alternations w. r. t. the realisation of figure and ground arguments and the semantic basis of these alternations. A particular challenge are {{the differences in the}} conceptual and aspectual contribution of the same prepositional root in different syntactic contexts...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{identify}} the position for particles in English and prefixes in Russian {{in the context of the}} nature of the prepositional phrase. In order to solve this problem I examine the nature <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> and prefixed verbs in English and Russian respectively. I show that particles and prefixes have much in common. Russian prefixes as well as English particles build up together with the verb either compositional or idiomatic meanings. Russian prefixes as well as English particles license the presence of objects and prepositional phrases. I present the previous analyses for <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> (the ‘small clause structure’ approach and the ‘complex head structure’ approach) and highlight the problems associated with these as outlined by Ramchand and Svenonius (2002). In order to examine <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> in English I adopt the analysis proposed by Ramchand and Svenonius which I later use for Russian prefixed verbs. Outlining the similarities between particles and prefixes I argue that particles and prefixes occupy the same position in the syntactic structure. Before studying the position of particles and prefixes in the context of the prepositional structure, I present the approaches to the prepositions and prepositional phrases offered in the literature and illustrate the nature of the prepositions cross-linguistically. I introduce PathP and PlaceP within a prepositional phrase (following Svenonius 2003), which according to the analysis, influence the assignment of case in Russian. In trying to define the position of particles and prefixes in the context of prepositional phrases in English and Russian respectively, I came to the conclusion that these elements require additional projections, which I refer to as DirP. The analysis introduced in this thesis shows that both English particles and Russian prefixes exhibit the same syntactic features and occupy the same position in the syntactic structure...|$|R
40|$|Languages of {{the world}} are {{considerably}} different with respect to the lexicalization patterns to express motion events. This domain can hardly be explored without mentioning Talmy’s theoretical framework, according to which languages can be divided into ‘verb-framed’ and ‘satellite-framed’ (Talmy, 1991). According to this classification, Italian is considered a verbframed language (1), whereas Chinese is classified as satellite-framed (2). However, Chinese has been also classified as ‘equipollently-framed’ (Slobin, 2004, 2006) and Italian cannot categorically be classified as ‘verb-framed’, considering the productive system <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> (Jezek 2002, Masini, 2005). The cross-linguistic variation has been approached by different perspectives and frameworks. In particular, narrative texts have been used to confirm the validity of typological classification (Chen and Guo, 2008) and to elicit the different information about motion events provided by the translated versions of the same source text (Slobin, 2005). This paper focus on the differences between Chinese and Italian in expressing motion events by comparing translated narrative texts. To this end, a corpus consisting of Chinese translated texts and Italian translated texts, all belonging to contemporary literature has been collected and analyses. The results confirm the loss of information regarding the manner and the omission of deictic elements, especially in Italian target texts, and show, at the same time, the rendering and specification, by added information, of the motion events in Chinese target texts’ descriptions...|$|R
40|$|The {{automatic}} extraction <b>of</b> <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> (VPCs) is <b>of</b> particular inter-est to the NLP community. Previous stud-ies {{have shown}} that word alignment meth-ods {{can be used with}} parallel corpora to successfully extract a range of multi-word expressions (MWEs). In this paper the technique is applied to a new type of cor-pus, made up of a collection of subtitles of movies and television series, which is par-allel in English and Spanish. Building on previous research, it is shown that a preci-sion level of 94 ± 4. 7 % can be achieved in English VPC extraction. This high level of precision is achieved despite the dif-ficulties of aligning and tagging subtitles data. Moreover, many of the extracted VPCs are not present in online lexical re-sources, highlighting the benefits of using this unique corpus type, which contains a large number of slang and other informal expressions. An added benefit of using the word alignment process is that trans-lations are also automatically extracted for each VPC. A precision rate of 75 ± 8. 5 % is found for the translations of English VPCs into Spanish. This study thus shows that VPCs are a particularly good subset of the MWE spectrum to attack using word alignment methods, and that subtitles data provide a range of interesting expressions that do not exist in other corpus types. ...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} {{discussed}} about the challenges posed by Multiword Expressions (MWEs) given their idiosyncratic, flexible and heterogeneous nature. Nonetheless, children successfully learn to use them and eventually acquire a number of Multiword Expressions {{comparable to that of}} simplex words. In this paper we report a wide-coverage investigation of a particular type <b>of</b> MWE: <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> (VPCs) in English and their usage in child-produced and child-directed sentences. Given their potentially higher complexity in relation to simplex verbs, we examine whether they appear less prominently in child-produced than in childdirected speech, and whether the VPCs that children produce are more conservative than adults, displaying proportionally reduced lexical repertoire of VPCs or of verbs in these combinations. The results obtained indicate that regardless of any additional complexity VPCs feature widely in children data following closely adult usage. Studies like these can inform the development of computational models for language acquisition. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theories}} {{have proposed that}} processing difficulty affects both individuals’ choice of grammatical structures {{and the distribution of}} these structures across languages of the world (Hawkins, 2004). Researchers have proposed that performance constraints, such as efficiency, integration, and storage costs, drive languages to choose word orders that minimize processing demands for individual speakers (Hawkins, 1994; Gibson, 2000). This study investigates whether three performance factors, adjacency, dependency, and complexity, affect reading times <b>of</b> sentences with <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions.</b> Results indicate that it is more difficult to process dependent verb-particles in shifted sentences that contain more complex intervening noun phrases. These findings demonstrate how performance factors interact and how the relative weight of each affects processing. The results also support the notion that processing ease affects grammaticalization, such that those structures which are more easily processed by individuals (subject relatives and adjacent dependent constituents) are more common across languages (Keenan & Hawkins, 1987) ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{standard}} Romance languages, following the classical Latin tradition, employ prefixes – more or less opaque – and make a restricted use <b>of</b> verb-locative (or <b>verb-particle)</b> <b>constructions,</b> in order to express spatial information with verbs. 2 Italian, French, Spanish, Romanian, Catalan and Portuguese grammars and dictionaries register prefixed verbs, and only marginally the corresponding analytic constructions, with a verb followed by a locative, forming one lexical element. 3 Differently, analytic constructions (called in English “phrasal verbs”, in German “trennbare Verben”) are very common in Germanic languages. 4 However, the evolution of the Latin syntactical type SOV into the present SVO type – which was fundamental to the weakening of the case system and has {{led to the formation of}} prepositions to express syntactical relations – has affected the pre-fix system too, making it less transparent and less productive. 5 Thus, when we look to diatopic 6, diachronic 7, diaphasic and diastratic 8 varieties of Romance, we note that they frequently substitute prefixed verbs with verbs plus locative constructions.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} programme is to investigate the feasibility <b>of</b> automatically extract-ing <b>verb-particle</b> <b>constructions</b> (VPCs) from parallel bilingual corpora using word alignment methods. VPCs are a subset of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) - combinations of two of more words whose meanings cannot be inferred directly from their constituent tokens- a phe-nomena which has long plagued the NLP community. VPCs consist of a verb and a particle, such as look up, as in Things were finally looking up, or step down, as in After {{five years in the}} job, the chairman decided to step down.

By working on bilingual corpora, the present study will also aim to find acceptable translations of VPCs as they are extracted. In this way the current research will facilitate the creation of both mono- and bilingual dictionaries. This work builds heavily on that of Caseli et al.
