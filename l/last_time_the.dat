5|$|Following Germany's capitulation, the Allies {{demanded that}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. On 21 November 1918, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, the ships sailed from their base in Germany for the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Once the ships were interned, their breech blocks were removed, which disabled their guns.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Morrow {{was chosen}} as the Republican {{candidate}} for the Senate seat of Thomas Paynter. Paynter had decided not to seek re-election, and the Democrats nominated Ollie M. James of Crittenden County. The General Assembly was heavily Democratic and united behind James. On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105–28. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment the next year, this was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky legislature would elect a senator.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June 1953 Beria {{was arrested}} at a Presidium meeting, {{following}} extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies.

5|$|This was Arsenal's eighth Charity Shield appearance; {{prior to}} the game they had won five Shields (1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938), and lost two (1935, 1936). By {{contrast}} Manchester United were undefeated in the Charity Shield; the club won their previous two appearances, in 1908 and 1911. Manchester United had beaten Arsenal 1–0 the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> two clubs met at Highbury, for a league fixture on 30 August 1948; Charlie Mitten scored the only goal of the match.|$|E
5|$|Abdül Kadir {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople in October 1892. By 1895, the steel frames for her hull had been erected, but work {{proceeded}} very slowly and frequently stopped, primarily due to the chronically tight Ottoman budget. In 1897, for instance, work had been halted for some time, and the contemporary journal Navy and Army Illustrated predicted that the ship would not be finished. Similar large-scale building projects during this period also fell apart {{due to lack of}} funds; a major construction program launched {{in the aftermath of the}} Ottoman Navy's poor performance in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 stalled after funds could not be appropriated for the new ships. By 1906, when work on Abdül Kadir stopped for the <b>last</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> hull had been only partially plated. By this time, the blocks that supported the hull during construction had shifted, which destroyed the keel. As a result, the unfinished ship was broken up on the slipway in 1909.|$|E

5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from {{the centre of the}} Empire may seem extraordinary (the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E
5|$|As {{champion}} of the 1997 edition, the club qualified for the 1998 Copa CONMEBOL. Atlético eliminated Paraguayan side Cerro Corá on penalties in the first round, and Bolivia's Jorge Wilstermann in the quarterfinals with a 41 aggregate score. In the semi-finals, Atlético faced Rosario Central {{for a third time}} in continental football, and was eliminated after a 11 draw at the Gigante de Arroyito and a 10 defeat at home. It was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> club participated in the Copa CONMEBOL, as the competition's final edition was played in 1999, and Atlético did not qualify.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew White for a 17–14 lead. However, {{this would be the}} <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Crimson Tide led in the game as a pair of turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted in a pair of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and returned it to the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who returned it to the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide was able to get into field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E

5|$|Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits (also {{known as}} Eurovision's Greatest Hits) was a live {{television}} concert programme organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and {{produced by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to commemorate the Eurovision Song Contest's 60th anniversary. The concert took place on 31 March 2015 at the Eventim Apollo, in Hammersmith, London. Guy Freeman was the executive producer and Geoff Posner the director, both of whom held the same positions as the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> BBC hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998. Simon Proctor was the senior producer and David Arch was the musical director for the concert. Tickets for the event went on sale at 10am on 6 February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} {{the closing of the}} Montreal Forum, the Canadiens played its first game at the Molson Centre (since renamed the Bell Centre). With a {{capacity}} of 22,500, the Bell Centre claims to be the largest indoor arena in North America. In the inaugural game, Montreal defeated the Rangers 4–2, with the first goal scored by Vincent Damphousse. The Canadiens qualified for the playoffs but struggled to achieve playoff success in the new arena during the arena's first three seasons. The Habs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs by the Rangers in six games in 1996 and by the New Jersey Devils in 1997, respectively. In 1998, they won their first playoff series since their 1993 championship by defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games; however, they would get swept by the Buffalo Sabres in the second round of the playoffs.

5|$|Following the {{armistice}} with Germany in November 1918, {{the majority of}} the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Bayern was listed as one of the ships to be handed over, though Baden initially was not. The battlecruiser , which the British believed to be completed, was requested instead. When it became apparent to the Allies that Mackensen was still under construction, Baden was ordered to replace it. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, sailed from their base in Germany for the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow.

5|$|In January 1566 Suleiman {{went to war}} for the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> {{siege of}} Szigetvár was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and, though it {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory, there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle—Zrinski in the final charge and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes. More than 20,000 Turks had fallen during the attacks {{and almost all of}} Zrinski's 2,300 man garrison was killed, with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day. Although the battle was an Ottoman victory, it stopped the Ottoman push to Vienna that year. Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} Richland, M-89 meets up with M-43, {{and the two}} share a brief routing {{together}} for a mile (1.6km) as M-43 heads southwest out of Richland while M-89 heads east, passing {{to the south of}} Gull Lake. After passing the lake, the highway turns southeast towards Battle Creek. As M-89 begins to enter the outskirts of Battle Creek it follows Michigan Avenue. It passes through the neighborhoods of Level Park-Oak Park and Urbandale, the first residential areas of the city. As the highway continues towards Battle Creek it has a junction with M-37. M-89 continues on Michigan Avenue until an intersection with Washington Avenue where the route turns to the southwest where it crosses the Kalamazoo River one <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> trunkline terminates a few blocks later at Dickman Road, otherwise known as the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94).|$|E
