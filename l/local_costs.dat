40|$|A major {{challenge}} for global query optimization in a multidatabase system (MDBS) {{is lack of}} <b>local</b> <b>cost</b> information {{at the global level}} due to local autonomy. A number of methods to derive <b>local</b> <b>cost</b> models have been suggested recently. However, these methods are only suitable for a static multidatabase environment. In this paper, we propose a new multi-states query sampling method to develop <b>local</b> <b>cost</b> models for a dynamic environment. The system contention level at a dynamic local site is divided into a number of discrete contention states based on the costs of a probing query. To determine an appropriate set of contention states for a dynamic environment, two algorithms based on iterative uniform partition and data clustering, respectively, are introduced. A qualitative variable is used to indicate the contention states for the dynamic environment. The techniques from our previous (static) query sampling method, including query sampling, automatic variable selection, regression analy [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the distributed solution of dynamic programming (DP) problems by policy iteration. We envision {{a network of}} processors, each updating asynchronously a local policy and a <b>local</b> <b>cost</b> function, defined on {{a portion of the}} state space. The computed values are communicated asynchronously between processors and are used to perform the <b>local</b> policy and <b>cost</b> updates. The natural algorithm of this type can fail even under favorable circumstances, as shown by Williams and Baird [WiB 93]. We propose an alternative and almost as simple algorithm, which converges to the optimum under the most general conditions, including asynchronous updating by multiple processors using outdated <b>local</b> <b>cost</b> functions of other processors.

40|$|We {{consider}} the convergence rates of two convex optimization {{strategies in the}} context of multi agent systems, namely the Newton-Raphson consensus optimization and a distributed Gradient-Descent opportunely derived from the first. To allow analytical derivations, the convergence analyses are performed under the simplificative assumption of quadratic <b>local</b> <b>cost</b> functions. In this framework we derive sufficient conditions which guarantee the convergence of the algorithms. From these conditions we then obtain closed form expressions {{that can be used to}} tune the parameters for maximizing the rate of convergence. Despite these formulae have been derived under quadratic <b>local</b> <b>cost</b> functions assumptions, they can be used as rules-of-thumb for tuning the parameters of the algorithms in general situations...|$|R

50|$|According to VEWIN, the {{association}} of water companies, the average water tariff for all cities in the Netherlands in 2008 was slightly lower at €1.49/m³ but without sanitation.
