5|$|Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, {{where it}} is {{determined}} {{that he has the}} alien virus in his blood. The Black-Haired Man (Scott Eberlein) kidnaps him soon after, and brings him to the power plant. They find the alien, who attacks the Black-Haired Man but not Gibson, as witnessed by Mulder from outside the <b>locked</b> <b>door.</b> Mulder and Scully are ordered to not associate with the X-Files and are reassigned under Assistant Director Kersh. Spender is visited by The Smoking Man in his office. Mulder continues to work on restoring the X-Files, and is told by Scully that Fowley's report does not reflect what really happened. Scully tells Mulder that the alien virus DNA is also part of all human DNA, but in Gibson the DNA is active. In the power plant, Gibson is trapped inside with the alien, which sheds its skin, revealing the traditional grey alien form.|$|E
5|$|Thief {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a 3D environment, with the game's story taking place over {{a series of}} missions, in which the player character is able to perform various actions such as leaning, crouching, swimming, climbing, running and fighting, amongst other abilities. Levels are largely unscripted, and allow for emergent gameplay; while non-player characters (NPCs) may either remain stationary or walk about on a patrol route, players {{have the freedom to}} choose how to get around them and the obstacles in a level's environments in order to complete specific tasks, such as getting through a <b>locked</b> <b>door.</b> In each level, the player is given a set of objectives to complete, such as stealing a specific object, which they must complete in order to progress to the next level; the player can choose to play on one of three difficulty settings before starting a level, which they can change between missions, with higher difficulties adding additional objectives such as not killing human NPCs or stealing a certain amount of loot from the amount available in a level, changing the amount of health the player character has, and changing how sensitive a NPC is to their environment. In some missions, players may find objectives being changed or new ones being added, due to certain circumstances they encounter, while failing a key objective or dying, will fail a level, forcing a player to either replay it or load up a previous save.|$|E

25|$|To keep Bhutan from disintegrating, Ngawang Namgyal's {{death in}} 1651 {{apparently}} was kept a carefully guarded secret for fifty-four years. Initially, Ngawang Namgyal {{was said to}} have entered into a religious retreat, a situation not unprecedented in Bhutan, Sikkim, or Tibet during that time. During the period of Ngawang Namgyal's supposed retreat, appointments of officials were issued in his name, and food was left in front of his <b>locked</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

They were not detected and the crowd left after destroying what else they could find. The panels were then moved to the town hall, and only returned to view in 1569, by which time the elaborate frame had disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Bertha fell mysteriously ill, {{suffering}} the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a specially ordered priestly doctor, the General realized that Bertha was being visited by a vampire.

He leapt from his hiding place and attacked the beast, which {{took the form of}} Millarca. She fled through the <b>locked</b> <b>door,</b> unharmed. Bertha died immediately afterward.|$|E

Peter Nash lay {{down on top of}} his wife to hide her from Bryant. Bryant moved into the gift shop area where several people, trapped with nowhere to go, were crouched down in the corners. Gwen Neander, trying to escape through the door, {{was shot in the head}} and killed.|$|E
25|$|Leo (Adam Levine) and Teresa (Jenna Dewan-Tatum) are two horror junkies visiting reputedly haunted {{sites on}} their honeymoon. They explore the Briarcliff Manor Sanitarium, an {{abandoned}} mental institution {{and once a}} tuberculosis hospital where many thousands died. Teresa having a fetish for the haunted, the couple begins having intercourse inside of the building. Teresa interrupts the session after hearing something move inside of the asylum, promising {{to make it up}} to Leo if they go investigate. They track down the sound to a <b>locked</b> <b>door</b> with a food hatch, through which Leo sticks his arm where it is severed by an undetermined cause.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing {{his face with}} a wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, the train station and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway {{at the back of the}} building, where a <b>locked</b> <b>door</b> had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E

25|$|Players have to {{complete}} various puzzles {{in order to}} gain access to previously restricted areas. The majority of these puzzles require players to retrieve an object from a certain location in order to bypass an obstacle in another location. For example, an early puzzle involves locating a key in order to open the <b>locked</b> <b>door</b> for a cabin. Occasionally puzzles {{take the form of a}} quick time event (QTE), in which players must swipe across the screen in a certain direction in a short span of time, or else the puzzle is failed and must be retried. Players can only complete puzzles in a certain order, meaning the game world opens up gradually as the story progresses. Upon completion of the story a free roam option is unlocked, allowing players to freely explore the game world.|$|E
25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the <b>locked</b> <b>door</b> as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|Belle {{has learned}} that the monster that took Robin was a Fury. Someone had used magic in Camelot to save Robin and did not pay the price, which is a life, and the monster has arrived to collect Robin's soul as payment. It {{will return to the}} Underworld when the moon reaches its zenith, but can be stopped if someone gives their life in his place. Regina confronts Emma, believing that she had summoned the Fury, but Emma reveals that Regina was the one {{responsible}} for its appearance. That night near the pond, the Fury begins pulling out Robin's soul, and Charon the boatman appears as the moon reaches its zenith. Regina sacrifices herself for Robin, and is joined by Mary Margaret, David, Leroy and Arthur. As all five band together, they successfully pull Robin from the Fury (and since the price of a single soul was equally divided among them), which disappears back into the underworld with Charon. While everyone celebrates this latest victory at Granny's, a worried Mary Margaret notes that if they win, Emma will lose. At Granny's, Henry introduces himself to Violet again and shows her what a jukebox is, and plays the same song he had played in Camelot, which, somehow, seems familiar to her. At her house, Emma opens the <b>locked</b> <b>door</b> and goes downstairs, at the behest of Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, revealing the stone with the sword Excalibur in it. Rumplestiltskin, the manifestation of her darkness, says that she can make it whole again and use it to vanquish all of the light forever. Emma tries to pull the sword from the stone but fails, being repelled by the sword's magic. After this failed attempt, the Dark One taunts her, and tells her that in order to complete the task, she will have to pay the price, and it will cost someone dearly.|$|E

500|$|Two guardsmen, Miomandre and Tardivet, each {{separately}} {{attempted to}} face down {{the crowd and}} were overpowered. [...] The violence boiled over into savagery as Tardivet's head was shorn off and raised aloft on a pike. As battering and screaming filled the halls around her, the queen ran barefoot with her ladies to the king's bedchamber and spent several agonizing minutes banging on its <b>locked</b> <b>door,</b> unheard above the din. In a close brush with death, they barely escaped through the doorway in time.|$|E
500|$|Roguelikes {{generally}} have complex interacting systems {{that allow the}} player to complete certain goals in multiple ways, creating emergent gameplay. For example, {{to get through a}} <b>locked</b> <b>door,</b> the player may attempt to pick the lock, kick it down, burn down the door, or even tunnel around it, depending on their current situation and inventory. A common phrase associated with NetHack is [...] "The Dev Team Thinks of Everything" [...] in that the developers seem to have anticipated every possible combination of actions that a player may attempt to try in their gameplay strategy, such as using gloves to protect one's character while wielding the corpse of a cockatrice as a weapon to petrify enemies by its touch.|$|E
500|$|In the {{illustration}} of Peter {{standing by the}} <b>locked</b> <b>door,</b> the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident {{in the moment of}} the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, [...] "Peter began to cry" [...] is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter’s emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader’s identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony. Scott suggests Potter’s tale has encouraged many generations of children to [...] "self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living." ...|$|E

500|$|... 24s minigames {{serve as}} interludes {{from the main}} mission, and are {{primarily}} interrogation sequences or computer puzzles. They are presented both as single puzzles in third-person missions, and as timed stand-alone missions. The computer puzzles include maze puzzles, where a player must select a coloured path from a starting box to an ending box and sometimes a second and third box, are used to represent bypassing locks and other computer functions. Letter sequence puzzles, where a player swaps adjacent pairs {{of a series of}} random letters until they are in the correct sequence, are used to represent code-breaking such as for encrypted files or a <b>locked</b> <b>door.</b> Colour/symbol matching puzzles, where a cursor randomly moves across a field of coloured squares and the player must press the controller button that corresponds to that coloured square, are used to represent unscrambling files from hard drives and other similar functions. A number of other puzzles are used only once, including puzzles to simulate transferring files over a damaged network, infrared scanning of buildings, radar-like scanning of areas, and creating a network link across the entire planet.|$|E
500|$|UK {{magazines}} Computer and Video Games and its spin-off Mean Machines – in the latter's premiere issue – {{gave the}} game positive reviews. Computer and Video Games praised the animation {{in particular and}} called it the best game of its type on that platform, using phrases such as [...] "familiar air of polish and ingenuity" [...] and [...] "piles of addiction guaranteed". Mean Machines [...] Matt Regan said it [...] "ranks {{as one of the}} greatest Sega Master System games ever!"; he compared the gameplay to the Mario series of video games and praised the game's depth, saying that [...] "there's always something new to discover, be it a key to a previously <b>locked</b> <b>door</b> or even a secret room!" [...] Julian Rignall praised the game's graphics and the huge world players can explore, which he says contributes to the game's addictiveness. He said that [...] "the combination of adventuring, shooting and platform action results in one of the best games of its type available on any console". Collectively, they praised the game overall presentation and graphics, saying that the sprites complement the background. While they additionally praised its playability for being [...] "accessible from the word go" [...] and longevity, they criticized its sound, saying that it [...] "could have been much better".|$|E
500|$|Riley, meanwhile, learns of Dr. Walsh's {{death and}} his comrades Forrest (Leonard Roberts) and Graham (Bailey Chase) suspect Buffy {{to be her}} murderer. Extremely {{agitated}} and showing signs of drug withdrawal, he follows Buffy and demands {{to know the truth}} in [...] "Goodbye Iowa". None of them are aware of Adam until he re-emerges in the underground laboratories of the Initiative, killing Dr. Walsh's assistant and another soldier. He tells Riley that he knows Dr. Walsh created them both, that she gave Riley chemicals to strengthen him, which makes them brothers. When Riley refuses to acknowledge their bond, Adam skewers Riley, and knocks Buffy across the room while Forrest and Graham are trying to enter the <b>locked</b> <b>door.</b> Adam leaves and the Initiative are tasked with hunting him down and killing him. When one of Sunnydale's residents, Jonathan Levinson (Danny Strong), casts a spell making him the center of everyone's attention in [...] "Superstar", Adam is the only character in town who realizes it is an illusion. He explains his insight by saying he is [...] "aware". His uniqueness has set him apart. Adam is interested in how the illusion will play out, however, and watches it unfold. During the illusion, Jonathan—temporarily a part of the Inititative—discovers Adam's only weakness: a uranium power core source which, effectively, will never allow him to die.|$|E
