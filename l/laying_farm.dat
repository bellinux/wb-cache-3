50|$|Early {{experience}} can influence severe feather pecking in later life. Commercial egg-laying hens have often already begun feather pecking {{when they are}} transferred to the egg <b>laying</b> <b>farm</b> from the rearing farm at approximately 16-20 weeks of age, and plumage quality can then rapidly deteriorate until peak lay at approximately 25 weeks of age. Severe feather pecking can either begin or persist beyond this age although it rarely begins after 40 weeks of age.|$|E
40|$|Feather pecking still {{presents}} {{a major problem}} in organic laying hen farming. In order to identify important risk factors during the laying period as well as during the rearing period in an exploratory epidemiological approach, we followed birds from 23 organic rearing units in Austria and Germany to 46 laying units. Management and housing conditions were recorded during one day visits in the 16 th to 18 th and 30 th to 40 th week of age, respectively. As an indicator of feather pecking, feather conditions of random samples of 30 hens per <b>laying</b> <b>farm</b> were assessed. Average feather scores from 0 (best) to 3 (worst) were calculated. The average score of 0. 73 (± 0. 44) was not significantly different from the score of 0. 77 (± 0. 33) from 54 conventional farms assessed in the same way (p= 0. 247). 73 % of the total variance in feather score between the different organic farms could be explained by 6 variables. About 79 % of the explained variation was due to rearing conditions. The major risk factors for poor plumage were little elevated perch space, few drinking places and no regular scattering of grain during the rearing period, as well as poor litter quality during the laying period. It is concluded that these are feasible starting points for improved prevention strategies against feather pecking...|$|E
40|$|Feather pecking {{is one of}} {{the most}} obvious welfare {{problems}} in laying hens. It is seen in all types of housing systems. Although banned in some countries, beak trimming is generally used to reduce the damage caused by this behaviour. In organic farming, where beak trimming is prohibited, the animals are being kept in a less intensive way than in conventional farming in order to improve their welfare. However, feather pecking is also seen in organic laying hens. Generally, rearing circumstances play an important role in the development of this behaviour. Therefore, rearing flocks were monitored for feather pecking and the relations between rearing factors and feather pecking at a young and at an adult age were analysed. Also the correlation between feather pecking during the rearing period and feather pecking during adult life was studied. Twenty-eight commercial flocks of rearing hens were monitored. These flocks split into 51 flocks of laying hens. Flocks were scored for signs of feather damage during rearing at the ages of 7, 12, and 16 weeks and on the laying farms at 30 weeks. On the rearing as well as the <b>laying</b> <b>farm,</b> data were collected on the housing system. Logistic regression was used to analyse our data. Feather damage was seen in 13 out of 24 (54 %) of rearing flocks. Logistic regression showed that a higher number of pullets being kept per square meter in the first 4 weeks of life were associated with feather damage during the rearing period (Chi square = 8. 49, df = 1, p = 0. 004). Moreover, the combination of not having litter at the age of 1 – 4 weeks and the absence of daylight at the age of 7 – 17 weeks was a significant predictor of feather damage during the laying period (Chi square = 13. 89, df = 4, p = 0. 008). In 71 % of the cases that pullets did not show feather pecking damage during rearing, they did not show feather pecking damage in the laying period either. When flocks of pullets did show feather damage, in 90 % of the cases they did so during adult life. These results lead to suggestions on how to improve the rearing conditions of laying hens and increase their welfare not only during rearing but also during later life. Although the observations were done on organic farms, the results can be applied for other non-cage systems too...|$|E

40|$|From 2007 – 2008, data {{on animal}} {{health and welfare}} and farm {{management}} during rearing and laying periods were collected from 49 flocks of organic laying hens in the Netherlands. Our aim was to investigate how organic egg farms performed in terms of {{animal health and welfare}} and which farm factors affected this performance. The flocks in our study were kept on farms with 34 to 25, 000 hens (average 9, 300 hens). Seventy-one percent of the flocks consisted of ‘silver hybrids’: white hens that lay brown eggs. Fifty-five percent of the flocks were kept in floor-based housing and 45 % of the flocks in aviaries. No relation was found between {{the amount of time spent}} outdoors during the laying period and mortality at 60 weeks. Flocks that used their outdoor run more intensively had better feather scores. In 40 % of the flocks there was mortality caused by predators. The average feed intake was 129 g/day at 30 weeks and 133 g/day at 60 weeks of age. The average percentage of mislaid eggs decreased from three at 30 weeks to two at 60 weeks. The average mortality was 7. 8 % at 60 weeks. Twenty-five percent of the flocks were not treated for worms in their first 50 weeks. Flubenol© was applied to the flocks that were treated. Ten percent of the flocks followed Flubenol© instructions for use and were wormed five or more times. The other 65 % percent were treated irregularly between one and four times. Sixty-eight percent of the flocks showed little or no feather damage, 24 % showed moderate damage and 8 % showed severe damage. The feather score was better if the hens used the free-range area more intensely, the laying percentage at 60 weeks was higher, and if they were allowed to go outside sooner after arrival on the <b>laying</b> <b>farm.</b> In 69 % of the flocks, hens had peck wounds in the vent area: on average this was 18 % of the hens. Keel bone deformations were found in all flocks, on average in 21 % of the birds. In 78 % of the flocks, an average of 13 % of the hens had foot-sole wounds, mostly a small crust. Combs were darker in flocks that used the range area more intensively. More fearful flocks had lighter combs. We conclude that organic farms are potentially more animal friendly than other poultry systems based on the animal welfare benefits of the free range areas. However, we also observed mortality rates, internal parasites, keel bone deformities, and foot sole lesions on organic farms that were comparable to or worse than in other husbandry systems. It is unclear whether these ‘remaining’ problems can be attributed to housing or if they are the result of keeping high productive genotypes in an artificial environment. Organic farms use the same high productive genotypes as other husbandry systems...|$|E
40|$|Billions {{of laying}} hens are kept worldwide. Severe feather pecking (SFP) is a {{behaviour}} which occurs {{with a high}} prevalence on commercial farms. SFP, the pecking and plucking of feathers of another bird, induces pain and stress and can ultimately lead to cannibalism. Moreover, SFP can occur if a bird is unable to cope with fear and stress and is living in an inappropriate environment. SFP thus reduces the welfare of many laying hens worldwide. To prevent SFP {{it is essential to}} know the risk factors in its development. To that aim, first, two experimental studies were conducted to gain insight in the principles of SFP, and three on-farm studies were conducted to assess the risk factors of SFP under commercial conditions. THE PRINCIPLES Factors which relate to SFP are high fearfulness as young and low levels of brain and peripheral serotonin (5 -HT) and brain dopamine (DA). Furthermore, commercial laying hen lines can differ in SFP tendencies and associated traits indicating that SFP has a genetic component. In chapters 2 and 3, fear response as young and adult, and stress response, 5 -HT and DA brain levels as adult were compared in hens of two lines: the low mortality line (LML) selected on low levels of mortality due to cannibalism and individual performance vs. the control line (CL) which was selected on individual performance only. Hens were exposed to an Open Field (OF) test at 5 weeks of age and a Manual Restraint (MR) test at 33 weeks of age. At 33 weeks of age, levels of corticosterone (CORT) post MR and 5 -HT and DA levels in four brain areas were determined. Hens of the LML were less fearful at both ages and had lower levels of DA in the arcopallium, a somatomotor area involved in fear and motor control, compared to hens of the CL. In chapter 2, it was also shown that fearful chicks had higher levels of CORT and higher activity levels as adult, compared to non-fearful chicks. Moreover, presence of fearful animals in the group was related to average CORT levels of their pen members. Fearful hens may induce social instability in a group, and thereby affecting the stress-sensitivity of their group mates. These results indicate that groups differ in levels of fear and stress-sensitivity, and that fearfulness at a young age can lead to stress-sensitivity as adults, which create a risk for development of SFP. THE PRACTICE In chapters 4, 5 and 6, the laying hen production chain consisting of parent stock, rearing flocks and laying flocks was studied. Risk factors for SFP could originate from previous parts in the chain. Therefore, in all on-farm studies, measurements of SFP, fearfulness, basal CORT and peripheral 5 -HT system were obtained, and related to housing conditions and to previous parts in the chain. Fearfulness was assessed, on a flock level, by distance to a stationary person (SP) test and latency of bird to approach a novel object (NO). Dekalb White (DW) and ISA brown (ISA) crosses whose pure lines differ in levels of fear, CORT, 5 -HT and DA, were compared. First, parent stock (PS) flocks were studied and associations between production performance and measurements of fear, stress and 5 -HT were conducted and related to group size conditions (chapter 4). Second, rearing flocks originating from PS flocks were studied throughout the rearing period (chapter 5). High levels of feather damage, CORT and 5 -HT in the mothers were related to fearfulness and SFP in their offspring at flock level. Especially, a large flock size and limitation and/or disruption in litter supply affected SFP and levels of fearfulness and 5 -HT (chapter 5). Finally, high levels of feather damage during the laying period were related to high SFP rearing, and high fearfulness during rearing and laying (chapter 6). These studies together aimed to determine the risk factors for the development of SFP and the resulting feather damage. The main outcomes of these studies are as follows. Ø Parent stock flocks DW flocks were more fearful of an SP and hens had higher levels of feather damage than in ISA flocks. ISA flocks, in turn, were more fearful of the NO and hens had higher 5 -HT levels than in DW flocks. A small flock size led to higher feed conversion, mortality levels, and smothering events in ISA but not in DW flocks. These results indicate that DW and ISA PS flocks differ in levels of fear and feather damage, and respond differently to their social environment. For both crosses, fear of an SP related to high mortality and fear of the NO related to low hen body weight, egg weight, and feed intake. High basal CORT related to low egg weight. High fear and stress levels in PS flocks may, thus, negatively affect (re) production, and thereby potentially negatively influence the developing embryo. Ø Rearing flocks In the DW cross, high CORT, feather damage, and 5 -HT of mother hens related to high SFP and fearfulness of their rearing flocks at 1 week of age. At 5 weeks of age, a peak in both gentle feather pecking (GFP) and SFP was recorded, coinciding with a disruption in substrate availability (i. e. a temporal absence of substrate) and a limitation of substrate (i. e. limited amounts of substrate provided) in some of the farms. Especially, ISA pullets showed higher SFP under substrate limitation and became more fearful under substrate disruption than DW pullets. ISA pullets had higher 5 -HT levels than DW pullets. Only in the ISA cross, high 5 -HT related to high fearfulness, specifically under substrate disruption. For both crosses, high fearfulness was related to high feather damage. Furthermore, in a level system (floor system where levels are gradually added) higher levels of SFP and feather damage were found compared to an aviary system (a tier-system with cages and litter area). These results highlight that; 1) parental effects exist in the development of fearfulness and SFP, 2) disruption and limitation in substrate availability can lead to high SFP at 5 weeks of age, 3) ISA pullets are more strongly influenced by environmental conditions than DW pullets and 4) a level housing, which coincided with a large group size, increase the risk of SFP and feather damage during rearing. Ø Laying flocks In our sample, 49 % of the laying flocks had severe damage at 40 weeks of age, compared with 71 %, 65 % and 53 % of the rearing flocks at 15, 10 and 5 weeks of age, respectively. High fear of a SP at rearing and high SFP at 5 weeks of age related to high levels of feather damage at lay. In a floor system and at a large flock size higher levels of feather damage were recorded than in an aviary system and at a small flock size. An adjusted management on the <b>laying</b> <b>farm</b> (i. e. aerated blocks, presence of roosters or a radio playing) reduced levels of feather damage compared to standard management. DW flocks were more fearful of the SP and NO than ISA flocks. This study showed that factors during rearing and laying contributed to feather damage at 40 weeks of age. With the knowledge from the experimental and on-farm studies in this thesis, an assessment of the risk factors for SFP could be established. Risk factors for SFP are: high fear, stress and feather damage in DW parent stock, high fear of humans, especially for DW hens, litter disruption or limitation during rearing, large group sizes, and a floor or level system...|$|E

One hundred and ten faecal, ٢٠ manure(dry faeces) and ٤٠ drinking water samples were collected for bacteriological examinations from four <b>laying</b> <b>farms</b> to detect the presence of Salmnonella, two of the farms from which the samples were taken are known to harbuor the infection, while birds in the other two farms were showing no clinical symptoms of salmonellosis. From the total isolates, eighty three non lactose fermenting isolates were recovered and thirty were proved to be Salmonlella. Identification of Salmonlella isolates to the genus level was based on morphological, cultural characteristic and biochemical reactions and confirmation was based on serological test. From the ٣٠ Salmonlella isolates, twelve have been serotyped. Five serotypes have been identified. They were Salmonella gombe, S. bonariensis, S. potsdam and two unclassified salmonella serotypes. Classification to the serotype level was based on serotyping method using specific antisera subgroup (O) and (H). The five isolated serotypes were tested for in vitro antibiotic sensitivity using disk diffusion test. Four antibiotics namely, gentamycin, tetracycline, neomycin and colistin were used. Generally the serotypes showed different responses to different antibiotics. S. bonariesis and S. gombe were sensitive to gentamycin, the two unclassified seroytpes (NS) (N١٩) were found to be sensitive to neomycin while S. potsdam was less sensitive to all antibiotics. In vitro testing using natural plants extracts was carried out for the same serotypes. Acacia nilotica (Cissus quandrugularis) locally named (Garad) and Solensomma largel (laryl) (Del) Hayne locally named (Hargel) were used. Garad extracts in different concentrations were found to be highly effect against all serotypes of salmonella. The methanol extract was found to be more effective compared with chloroform extract. Hargel extracts were found to be of low activity against salmonella serotypes in different concentrations. The epidemiological investigations showed that all farms with good hygiene management have low infection rate with Salmonella, on the other hand, in farms with poor hygiene, high rate of infection occurred. It could be concluded that salmonellosis was endemic in the examined farms and affect the productivity.

Cerro alone were detected in three, one and one <b>laying</b> hens <b>farms,</b> respectively. Foram examinadas caixas de transporte de pintos de um dia com o objetivo de investigar a presença de Salmonella no momento em que chegaram à granja. 1611 caixas foram amostradas em 15 propriedades, sendo uma granja de avós, quatro granjas de matrizes, duas de frangos de corte e seis de aves de postura comercial. Foram feitas 19 visitas a essas granjas e Salmonella foi encontrada em 10 delas. Salmonella Heidelberg foi encontrada em caixas de cinco granjas, S. Heidelberg e S. Mbandaka em caixa de uma granja de matriz. S. Enteritidis somente, S. Enteritidis e S. Mbandaka simultaneamente, e S. Cerro somente, foram detectadas em caixas de três, uma e uma granjas de postura comercial, respectivamente...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} discern the {{contribution}} of poultry farms to the {{contamination of the environment}} with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and therewith, potentially to the spread of these bacteria to humans and other animals. ESBL-producing E. coli were detected at all investigated <b>laying</b> hen <b>farms</b> (n = 5) and broiler farms (n = 3) in 65 % (46 / 71) and 81 % (57 / 70) of poultry faeces samples, respectively. They were detected in rinse water and run-off water (21 / 26; 81 %), other farm animals (11 / 14; 79 %), dust (21 / 35; 60 %), surface water adjacent to farms (20 / 35; 57 %), soil (48 / 87; 55 %), on flies (11 / 73; 15 %), and in barn air (2 / 33; 6 %). The highest prevalence and concentrations in the outdoor environment were observed in soil of free-range areas at <b>laying</b> hen <b>farms</b> (100 % of samples positive, geometric mean concentration 2. 4 × 10 (4) cfu/kg), and surface waters adjacent to broiler farms during, or shortly after, cleaning between production rounds (91 % of samples positive, geometric mean concentration 1. 9 × 10 (2) cfu/l). The diversity of ESBL-producing E. coli variants with respect to sequence type, phylogenetic group, ESBL-genotype and antibiotic resistance profile was high, especially on broiler farms where on average 16 different variants were detected, and the average Simpson's Indices of diversity (SID; 1 -D) were 0. 93 and 0. 94 among flock and environmental isolates respectively. At <b>laying</b> hen <b>farms</b> on average nine variants were detected, with SIDs of 0. 63 (flock isolates) and 0. 77 (environmental isolates). Sixty percent of environmental isolates were identical to flock isolates at the same farm. The highest proportions of 'flock variants' were observed in dust (94 %), run-off gullies (82 %), and barn air (67 %), followed by surface water (57 %), soil (56 %), flies (50 %) and other farm animals (35 %). The introduction of ESBL-producing E. coli from poultry farms to the environment may pose a health risk if these bacteria reach places where people may become exposed...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{poultry red mite}} (PRM), Dermanyssus gallinae (D. g.) is {{a serious}} ectoparasitic pest of poultry and {{potential}} pathogen vector. The prevalence of D. g. and the prevalence of Salmonella spp. within mites on infested <b>laying</b> poultry <b>farms</b> were investigated in Kosovo. Findings In total, 14 populated layer farms located in the Southern Kosovo were assessed for D. g. presence. Another two farms in this region were investigated 6 months after depopulation. Investigated flocks were all maintained in cages, a common housing system in Kosovo. A total of eight farms {{were found to be}} infested with D. g. (50...|$|R
