25|$|At {{this early}} stage the Caledonian Railway saw itself as the future creator of an {{extensive}} network in Scotland, and it set about gaining control of as many other railways as possible. It did so not by purchasing them, but by leasing them. This had the advantage that no payment was required at first, only a periodical payment much later. The Caledonian negotiated with the SCR, the SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway and believed it had captured them, but the SCR had other ideas. Much later the Caledonian found that the periodical lease payments were unaffordable, and it was rescued by the legal opinion that the <b>lease</b> <b>agreements</b> had been ultra vires.|$|E
