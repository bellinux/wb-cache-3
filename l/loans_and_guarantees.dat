Three years earlier, Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election. Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised, though never officially announced. On 18th February 2008, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the failing bank, Northern Rock, would be nationalised, supporting it with <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>guarantees</b> of £50,000,000,000. The bank had been destabilised by the US subprime mortgage crisis the previous year, and a private buyer of the bank could not be found.|$|E

On 8 October, in response to the crisis, the government announced a bank rescue package of £500billion; approximately [...] The plan aimed to restore market confidence, help stabilise the British banking system and provide for a range of short-term <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>guarantees</b> of interbank lending, and up to £50billion of state investment in the banks themselves. Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, said that Brown [...] "defined the character of the worldwide financial rescue effort".|$|E

2500|$|For {{the small}} BMW business, the large orders {{received}} from the Reichswehr for the BMW IIIa engine were overwhelming. Under Karl Rapp, {{only a small number}} of engines had been produced and the manufacturing facilities were not in any way adequate to handle the mass production now required. Not only did BMW lack suitable machine tools but, to a very large degree, skilled manpower as well. However, the most serious drawback was in the small and aging workshops. Nevertheless, under the state-controlled war economy, officials in the relevant ministries were able to give BMW extensive practical support. So in a short time BMW got the skilled workers and machinery it needed. In addition, the Munich company received a high level of financial assistance, which enabled it to build a completely new factory from the ground up, in the immediate vicinity of the old workshops. [...] Due to the share capital being too small, both the building of the new plant and the working capital needed for materials and wages had to be financed with external funds, i.e. bank loans or state assistance. The war ministries of Bavaria and Prussia (then both separate kingdoms within the Kaiser’s Empire) did not, however, wish to go on supporting BMW with <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>guarantees,</b> and therefore urged the flotation of a public limited company.|$|E
