40|$|This thesis explores whether young Protestant {{women in}} Northern Ireland {{are facing a}} crisis of identity. The {{personal}} perceptions of identity for young female Protestants in Belfast, born immediately {{before or after the}} 1998 peace accord, are examined, in relation to both national, religious and political identity. Furthermore, the study aims to investigate whether the women’s identity preferences influence their attitudes toward the other main community in Northern Ireland. The thesis argues that the women show evidence of having progressed significantly, and albeit the traditional attitudes remain, they seem to be breaking away from these. Northern Ireland is still segregated, but despite this, society seemed to have progressed significantly. The majority of the women identified along the traditional divide in terms of national identity, but these seemingly traditional <b>labels</b> <b>masked</b> progressive attitudes. Moreover, the women were inclined to transcend the communal divide politically, as they would vote for Sinn Féin. In terms of religion, the label of Protestantism has arguably diversified {{to such an extent that}} it cannot provide an overarching identification for these women, and they were confused regarding the different interpretations of Protestantism available. Furthermore, identity labels did not affect attitudes towards the other side, and they were all positive towards integrated housing and education, and had friends across the divide. The thesis thus argues that these women show great propensity towards transcending the divide, and that seemingly traditional <b>labels</b> <b>mask</b> new and progressive attitudes...|$|R

40|$|Connected Component Labeling (CCL) {{is a basic}} {{algorithm}} in {{image processing}} and an essential step in nearly every application dealing with object detection. It groups together pixels belonging to the same connected component (e. g. object). Special architectures such as ASICs, FPGAs and GPUs were utilised for achieving high data throughput, primarily for video processing. In this article, the FPGA implementation of a CCL method is presented, which was specially designed to process high resolution images with complex structure at high speed, generating a <b>label</b> <b>mask.</b> In general, CCL is a dynamic task and therefore not well suited for parallelisation, which is needed to achieve high processing speed with an FPGA. Facing this issue, most of the FPGA CCL implementations are restricted to low or medium resolution images (≤ 2048 ∗ 2048 pixels) with lower complexity, where the fastest implementations do not create a <b>label</b> <b>mask.</b> Instead, they extract object features like size and position directly, which can be realized with high performance and perfectly suits the need for many video applications. Since these restrictions are incompatible with the requirements to label high resolution images with highly complex structures {{and the need for}} generating a <b>label</b> <b>mask,</b> a new approach was required. The CCL method presented in this work is based on a two-pass CCL algorithm, which was modified with respect to low memory consumption and suitability for an FPGA implementation. Nevertheless, since not all parts of CCL can be parallelised, a stop-and-go high-performance pipeline processing CCL module was designed. The algorithm, the performance and the hardware requirements of a prototype implementation are presented. Furthermore, a clock-accurate runtime analysis is shown, which illustrates the dependency between processing speed and image complexity in detail. Finally, the performance of the FPGA implementation is compared with that of a software implementation on modern embedded platforms...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the human}} parsing task, namely decomposing a human image into {{semantic}} fashion/body regions, is formulated as an Active Template Regression (ATR) problem, where the normalized mask of each fashion/body item is expressed as the linear {{combination of the}} learned mask templates, and then morphed to a more precise mask with the active shape parameters, including position, scale and visibility of each semantic region. The mask template coefficients and the active shape parameters together can generate the human parsing results, and are thus called the structure outputs for human parsing. The deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to build the end-to-end relation between the input human image and the structure outputs for human parsing. More specifically, the structure outputs are predicted by two separate networks. The first CNN network is with max-pooling, and designed to predict the template coefficients for each <b>label</b> <b>mask,</b> while the second CNN network is without max-pooling to preserve sensitivity to <b>label</b> <b>mask</b> position and accurately predict the active shape parameters. For a new image, the structure outputs of the two networks are fused to generate the probability of each label for each pixel, and super-pixel smoothing is finally used to refine the human parsing result. Comprehensive evaluations on a large dataset well demonstrate the significant superiority of the ATR framework over other state-of-the-arts for human parsing. In particular, the F 1 -score reaches 64. 38 % by our ATR framework, significantly higher than 44. 76 % based on the state-of-the-art algorithm.

Today, winemaking in Bordeaux is a highly controlled process, with widespread use of stainless steel vats for fermentation, cooling apparatus, and a high degree of hygienic discipline. In 1951, chaptalization (adding sugar) became legal (it had likely taken place illegally prior to 1951). The use of chaptalization is common in Bordeaux, except in the warmest of vintages, and especially on the left bank, where Cabernet Sauvignon dominates and ripens later than Merlot.|$|R

40|$|The {{human brain}} can be modeled as a small-world network {{that has the}} {{capability}} of handling complex cognitive function. However, that network as a whole still remains poorly understood partly due to a limited understanding of our non-human primate relatives’ whole brain networks. A significant roadblock regarding non-human primate data {{is the lack of}} reliable cortical region labels, as almost all human whole brain network studies rely on such region-wise <b>labeled</b> brain <b>masks,</b> otherwise known as parcellation masks. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a method to parcellate the cerebral cortex in primate brains independently of any pre-defined cortical region <b>labels.</b> This <b>mask</b> will then be used in future whole brain network analysis, where the connective white matter structures will be reconstructed between each region in the mask. For this study, derived methods were developed using data from our closest living primate relative, the chimpanzee. An initial method included the non-linear transformation of the human automatic anatomical labeling (AAL) cortical template to chimpanzee template space; however, structural and functional mismatches discredited that technique. The derived anatomically independent parcellation (AIP) method employed dynamic region growth of each node derived in the gray/white matter interface mask, and demonstrated high-resolution segmentation of the cortical regions over several inputted node numbers (200, 500, 1000, and 3000). Using the derived parcellation masks in network analysis, future applications of this technique in cross-species comparisons could help gain significant insight into the evolutionary changes in the organization of brain architecture, as well as the origins of some neurodegenerative diseases in both human and non-human primates.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a new method {{to support the}} segmentation of a volumetric MRI- or CT-dataset such that only the components selected by the user are displayed by a volume renderer for visual inspection. The goal is to combine the advantages of direct volume rendering (high efficiency and semi-transparent display of internal structures) and indirect volume rendering (well defined surface geometry and topology). Our approach {{is based on a}} re-labeling of the input volume’s set of isosurfaces which allows the user to peel off the outer layers and to distinguish unconnected voxel components which happen to have the same voxel values. For memory and time efficiency, isosurfaces are never generated explicitly. Instead a second voxel grid is computed which stores a discretization of the new isosurface <b>labels.</b> Hence the <b>masking</b> of unwanted regions as well as the direct volume rendering of the desired regions of interest (ROI) can be implemented on the GPU which enables interactive frame rates even while the user changes the selection of the ROI. ...|$|R
