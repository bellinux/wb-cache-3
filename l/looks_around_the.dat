500|$|In {{the final}} sequence, it is {{revealed}} that the story that Kint had told Kujan is a fabrication, made up of strung-together details culled from a crowded bulletin board in a messy office. The surviving Hungarian describes Söze to a sketch artist: the drawing faxed in {{to the police station}} closely resembles Kint. Kujan realizes the fabrication and pursues Kint, who has already been released, his limp gone. Kint gets into a car, driven by [...] "Kobayashi". As the two drive away, Kujan desperately <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> crowded streets for him.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, Rose, and Adam {{arrive on}} Floor 139 of Satellite 5, {{a space station}} {{orbiting}} Earth in the year 200,000. [...] The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to get Adam and Rose some credits to buy food while he <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> station. The Doctor meets a woman named Cathica, a reporter who tells him that the station is a giant broadcast tower transmitting news across Earth. They are led to a room where she sits down in a chair located {{in the center of}} a round table. The reporters are connected to the computer via a special port installed directly into the brain. The Doctor believes there is a malevolent purpose to the station that is holding back human development. [...] He learns from Cathica that a select few are invited to Floor 500, which is believed to be the highest promotion that can be earned on the station.|$|E
500|$|Juliet is in bed after {{sleeping}} with Goodwin. Afterwards, she is given x-rays of Ben's back, {{and when she}} determines that Ben has a tumor, she confronts him and accuses him of lying about Rachel. He denies lying to her and refuses {{to let her go}} home. The next day, immediately after Flight 815 crashes, Ben takes Juliet to the Flame Station to see Mikhail. Ben tells Mikhail that he wants information on all of the passengers of the plane, then asks him to bring up a live feed. On the screen a newspaper is shown with the current date, September 22, 2004, followed by a shot of Rachel playing with her child (Rachel named her son Julian, presumably after Juliet) in a playground, and Ben explains that her cancer is in complete remission. The final flashback shows Juliet and Ben discussing their plans immediately before the events of [...] "Left Behind". Ben tells her to handcuff herself to Kate and say she was left behind. She is also told that Claire's [...] "implant" [...] has been [...] "activated" [...] and that this will make Claire ill. Juliet is to use drugs left at the drop point to cure her and earn the trust of the survivors; Ben gives her a gas mask and leaves. While setting up her shelter, Juliet <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> camp and ties a final double knot as Jack smiles at her.|$|E

2500|$|Mulan {{tells her}} {{they can still}} track the helm and Merida says if her dad can’t lead without magic, neither can she. Later, Mulan takes the cloak scrap and goes to see the witch {{to get her to}} tell her who the cloak belongs to. She goes into the witch’s house and <b>looks</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> wolf snarls and leaps. Mulan backs away and it follows her outside. Then Mulan smiles at her and says she’s not a wolf, and {{transforms}} into Ruby, who told them that Mary Margaret and Emma told them about Mulan and she says she knows Philip and Aurora too. Mulan gets quiet and says it’s hard to travel between realms then asks how Red ended up here. Its revealed in a flashback after defeating Zelena that Ruby told Mary Margaret that being the only one of her kind in Storybrooke, she wanted to return to the Enchanted Forest to find others like her with a magic bean given to her by Tiny who had managed to grow one. But when she arrived back in the Enchanted Forest, the pack had already left and so she sought help from the witch to find them but instead she turned her back into a wolf to be her guard. When they arrived to the lake and used the spell to bring the helm up, both Arthur and Zelena are stopped by Mulan, Merida, and Ruby. Merida then fights Arthur after finding out he killed her father while Mulan and Ruby use sleeping powder on Zelena as payback. Arthur and Zelena return to Camelot defeated when the clans of DunBroch arrive to aid Merida.|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} the teacher has {{proceeded}} thus far, he finds, as he <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, that the countenances of his pupils are assuming a listless and inattentive air.

Another has reclined his head upon his desk, lost in a reverie, and others are looking round the room, at one another, or at the door, restless and impatient, hoping the dull lecture will soon be over.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} his worship had {{completed}} his toilet, {{and he and}} his colleague took their way to the parlour they had inhabited the preceding evening. Mr. Signsealer was in attendance, much to the real, though concealed, satisfaction of Squire Mountmeadow. Their worships were seated like two consuls before the table, which Mr. Signsealer had duly arranged with writing materials and various piles of calf-bound volumes. Squire Mountmeadow then, arranging his countenance, announced that the bench was prepared, and mine host was instructed forthwith to summon the constable and his charge, together with Peter and the ostler as witnesses. There was a rush among some of the crowd who were nighest the scene to follow the prisoner into the room; and, sooth to say, the great Mountmeadow was much too enamoured of his own self-importance to be by any means a patron of close courts and private hearings; but then, though he loved his power to be witnessed, he was equally desirous that his person should be reverenced. It was his boast that he could keep a court of quarter sessions as quiet as a church; and now, when the crowd rushed in with all those sounds of tumult incidental to such a movement, it required only Mountmeadow slowly to rise, and drawing himself up to the full height of his gaunt figure, to knit his severe brow, and throw one of his peculiar <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> chamber, to insure a most awful stillness. Instantly everything was so hushed, that you might have heard Signsealer nib his pen.|$|E
