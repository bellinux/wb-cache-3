2500|$|On 2 September 1944, a [...] {{cylinder}} {{of highly}} corrosive uranium hexafluoride exploded. Nearby steam pipes ruptured, the steam reacting with the uranium hexafluoride to create hydrofluoric acid. Hoffman {{ran through the}} toxic cloud to rescue Private Arnold Kramish and two civilians, Peter N. Bragg, Jr. (a United Naval Research <b>Laboratory</b> <b>chemical</b> engineer) and Douglas P. Meigs (a Fercleve Corportation employee). Bragg and Meigs died from their injuries but Kramish, Hoffman, and nine others recovered from burns and other injuries.

50|$|Potassium {{chromate}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula (K2CrO4). This yellow solid is the potassium salt of the chromate anion.

50|$|The very lightest, most {{volatile}} {{liquid hydrocarbon}} solvents {{that can be}} bought from <b>laboratory</b> <b>chemical</b> suppliers may also be offered under the name petroleum ether. Petroleum ether consists mainly of aliphatic hydrocarbons and is usually low on aromatics. It is commonly hydrodesulfurized and may be hydrogenated {{to reduce the amount}} of aromatic and other unsaturated hydrocarbons. Petroleum ether bears normally a descriptive suffix giving the boiling range. Thus, from the leading international <b>laboratory</b> <b>chemical</b> suppliers it is possible to buy various petroleum ethers with boiling ranges such as 30-50 °C, 40-60 °C, 50-70 °C, 60-80 °C, etc. In the United States, laboratory grade aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents with boiling ranges as high as 100-140 °C may be called petroleum ether, rather than petroleum spirit.|$|E

A {{diborane}} solution in THF is commercially available as {{is a solution}} of the DMS complex.Gaseous borane, diborane(6) dissolves in polar compounds such as amines and tetrahydrofuran.

50|$|Commercially {{available}} laboratory-based chemical imaging systems {{emerged in}} the early 1990s (ref. 1-5). In addition to economic factors, such {{as the need for}} sophisticated electronics and extremely high-end computers, a significant barrier to commercialization of infrared imaging was that the focal plane array (FPA) needed to read IR images were not readily available as commercial items. As high-speed electronics and sophisticated computers became more commonplace, and infrared cameras became readily commercially available, <b>laboratory</b> <b>chemical</b> imaging systems were introduced.|$|E

50|$|When {{disposing}} hazardous <b>laboratory</b> <b>chemical</b> waste, {{chemical compatibility}} must be considered. For safe disposal, {{the container must}} be chemically compatible with the material it will hold. Chemicals must not react with, weaken, or dissolve the container or lid. Acids or bases should not be stored in metal. Hydrofluoric acid should not store in glass. Gasoline (solvents) should not store or transport in lightweight polyethylene containers such as milk jugs. Moreover, the Chemical Compatibility Guidelines should be considered for more detailed information.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>laboratory,</b> <b>chemical</b> wastes {{are usually}} {{segregated}} on-site into appropriate waste carboys, and disposed by a specialist contractor {{in order to}} meet safety, health, and legislative requirements.Innocuous aqueous waste (such as solutions of sodium chloride) may be poured down the sink. Some chemicals are washed down with excess water. This includes: concentrated and dilute acids and alkalis, harmless soluble inorganic salts (all drying agents), alcohols containing salts, hypochlorite solutions, fine (tlc grade) silica and alumina. Aqueous waste containing toxic compounds are collected separately.|$|E
5000|$|Fume hoods, {{also known}} as <b>laboratory</b> <b>chemical</b> hoods, {{are one of the}} most {{important}} and widely used engineering controls to protect workers in laboratories. Fume hoods were introduced about 100 years ago to safeguard personnel working with hazardous materials. While many changes and improvements have been made, the basic concept and design of fume hoods remains the same. Air is drawn from the workplace, around the worker and into the front of the hood, and is then exhausted out of the laboratory. Most laboratory hoods are described as constant air volume (CAV) hoods because they draw a constant amount of air at all times. Rising energy costs have made these hoods exceptionally expensive to operate. For example, a single six-foot hood operating 24/7/365 costs over $5,000/year to operate. [...] In addition, CAV hoods do not react rapidly to airflow disturbances (turbulence) within the hood or within the laboratory and, hence, their sole purpose of containment and protection can be seriously compromised.|$|E

50|$|The University of Vermont has a {{long history}} toward {{operational}} environmental sustainability on its campus. In 1995, the Environmental Council at UVM was established to fill a gap regarding a bridge between operations and academics on campus greening issues. The first Council project was to hear presentations from the various environmental programs on campus to provide a baseline scan of campus operation environmental impact. Greening UVM was published in 1998 by the Council to establish a baseline on the environmental impact of the campus' operations. During the same year, a Recycled Paper Policy was created and was implemented in 1999. As a community stakeholder in the Lab-XL project, the Environmental Council received an EPA grant to support the Tracking UVM project and publication to assess relative environmental impact and community interest in <b>laboratory</b> <b>chemical</b> waste. Tracking UVM, a follow-up to the Greening UVM report, was published in 2002 and reported on the environmental progress of the university from 1990 to 2000. The University of Vermont's commitment to tracking its environmental performance was recognized in 2004 with Vermont's Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence for this 2002 environmental report card. Tracking UVM {{is one of the first}} report cards that track the environmental impact of campus operations in an institution of higher education.|$|E
5000|$|The Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory in The Bronx, {{built with}} funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, New York State and New York City, and named for its largest private donor, is a major new {{research}} institution at the New York Botanical Garden opened in 2006. The laboratory is a pure research institution, with projects more diverse than research in universities and pharmaceutical companies. The laboratory's research emphasis is on plant genomics, the study of how genes function in plant development. One question scientists hope to answer is Darwin's [...] "abominable mystery"; when, where, and why flowering plants emerged. The laboratory's research also furthers the discipline of molecular systematics, the study of DNA as evidence that can reveal the evolutionary history and relationships of plant species. Staff scientists also study plant use in immigrant communities in New York City and the genetic mechanisms by which neurotoxins are produced in some plants, work that {{may be related to}} nerve disease in humans. A staff of 200 trains 42 doctoral students at a time from all over the world; since the 1890s scientists from the New York Botanical Garden have mounted about 2,000 exploratory missions across the planet to collect plants in the wild. At the plant chemistry <b>laboratory</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds from plants are extracted to create a library of the chemistry of the world's plants and stored in a 768 sq ft DNA storage room with 20 freezers that store millions of specimens, including rare, endangered or extinct species.
