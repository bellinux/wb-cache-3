500|$|The <b>Land</b> <b>Improvement</b> and Agriculturists <b>Loan</b> Act {{passed in}} 1884 {{provided}} {{funds for the}} construction of wells and their utilisation in reclamation projects. In {{the early part of the}} 20th century, the Madras government established the Pumping and Boring Department to drill boreholes with electric pumps. The Mettur Dam, the Periyar Project, the Cudappah-Kurnool canal and the Rushikulya Project were the biggest irrigation projects launched by the Madras Government. Constructed below the Hogenakkal Falls on the Madras-Mysore border in 1934, the Mettur Dam supplied water to the western districts of the Presidency. The Periyar Dam (now known as the Mullaperiyar Dam) was constructed across the Periyar river in Travancore, near the border. This project diverted the waters of the Periyar river to the Vaigai River basin in order to irrigate the arid lands to the east of the Western Ghats. Similarly, the Rushikulya Project was launched to utilise the waters of the Rushikulya river in Ganjam. Under the scheme over [...] of land were brought under irrigation. The British also constructed a number of dams [...] and canals for irrigation. An upper dam was constructed across the Kollidam river near Srirangam island. The Dowlaishwaram dam across the Godavari river, the Gunnavaram aqueduct across the Vaineteyam Godavari, the Kurnool-Cuddapah canal and the Krishna dam are examples of major irrigation works carried out by the British. In 1946–47, the total area under irrigation was [...] acres which yielded a return of 6.94% on capital outlay.|$|R

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>improvements</b> {{with long}} pay-back periods are often delayed on leased {{agricultural}} land, resulting in social costs through land degradation, decreased land productivity and environmental problems. An {{important question is}} thus how landowners would respond to regulations and mandates concerning <b>land</b> <b>improvements.</b> Based on a landowner survey, we analyse landowner choices under certain <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> regulations, using the currently dominant choice of leasing land for agricultural use as the benchmark. The results indicated that land leasing {{will continue to increase}} in the future, but if the landowner mandate to co-finance costly <b>land</b> <b>improvements</b> is increased, landowners are predicted to respond significantly to these mandates and search for other land management options. Three heterogeneous landowner groups were identified based on their land use choices. Current leasers and amenity owners, in particular, were sensitive to <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> mandates, and would avoid compulsory investment expenses by selling or afforesting their land. contingent behaviour, latent class model, landlord, land use, heterogeneity, Land Economics/Use, Q 15, Q 24, Q 28,...|$|R

As the Main construction projects were completed, the purpose of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts Has shifted from facilities construction to operation and maintenance of them. However, the recent social situation has brought great changes in circumstance to <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts. In both urban and agricultural areas around local cities, urbanization has progressed so rapidly and widely that agricultural land has decreased through conversion into urban use. That causes pollution of irrigated water and difficulties in maintenance of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> facilities. In rural moutainous areas, on the other hand, excess Depletion in population has occurred, causing difficulties in proper maintenance of Agricultural <b>land</b> and <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> facilities, which eventually increases the danger of natural disaster. Also, in other agricultural areas, the decline in agriculture of this country has degraded the quality of the production and living environments.

50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>improvement</b> and <b>land</b> {{development}} are general terms {{that in some}} contexts may include infrastructure, but {{in the context of}} a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single parcel of land, and are owned and operated by the land owner. For example, an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered <b>land</b> <b>improvements,</b> not infrastructure.

The dynamic optimisation problem is solved by a stochastic dynamic programming routine with known parameters for one-period returns and transition equations. The model parameters represent Finnish soil quality and production conditions. The farmer's decision rules are solved for alternative likelihood scenarios over {{the continuation of}} the fixed term lease contract. The results suggest that, as the probability for non-renewal of the lease contract increases, farmers quickly decrease investments in irreversible <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> and, thereafter, yields decline gradually. The estimated decision rules are a part of larger set of farmer's decision rules to be taken care when land leasing and environmental legislation is renewed.
