25|$|Epenow {{met with}} visiting Englishman Captain Thomas Dermer in 1619 in a {{peaceful}} meeting on Martha's Vineyard, and <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> he {{told the story of}} his escape from captivity. But on Dermer's second visit in 1620, shortly before the arrival of the Mayflower, Epenow's warriors attacked the captain and his men, and took captive his traveling companion, the celebrated Squanto, before turning him over to Massasoit (the leading Wampanoag sachem). Some of Epenow's company were slain, but all but one of Dermer's crew were killed, and Dermer, severely wounded with fourteen wounds, escaped to Virginia where he died soon afterward.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 Melissa {{published}} a book titled, Shattered Silence: The Untold Story of a Serial Killer's Daughter. Moore lived with her father until her parents' divorce in 1990. Moore noticed her father was different {{when she was in}} elementary school. Their house bordered an apple orchard, and her dad killed stray cats and gophers that wandered nearby. One day she watched, horrified, as he hung stray kittens from the family's clothesline. She ran to get her mother, and when they returned, the kittens lay on the ground dead. He had watched and <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> the kittens clawed each other to escape, then he killed them.|$|E

500|$|Stuart Morris, a {{historian}} who helped to provide research for Steel for the Portland show, commented: [...] "I {{was amazed that}} he should have absorbed so much of the island's history in the short period of time that he had. He joked about the Portland winds, saying that in comparison, islanders wouldn't even have bothered to take out their kites in the face of Hurricane Katrina. He made a few remarks about Portland/Weymouth rivalry and our Weymouth friends present <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> much as the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Schur {{said of the}} episode's plot, [...] "They're very {{confused}} because in Venezuela the government is so powerful; their parks department travels with military escorts and motorcades and stuff. They have {{all the money in}} the world because of their oil and they (don't understand) why Pawnee's parks department is so rinky-dink." [...] A fan of Parks and Recreation since its inception, Armisen said he <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> soon as he read the script, and found it even funnier during the table read with the cast. After working with Armisen, Rashida Jones described him as [...] "one of the funniest people on the planet".|$|E
500|$|... "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on April 1, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Although Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone acknowledged it was a particularly juvenile episode, Parker said it was his favorite show of the season to produce. He said, [...] "I seriously never <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> hard doing retakes, just going shot-by-shot, sitting there in the editing room laughing." [...] During the writing process, the female producers and employees with the show found the script largely unfunny, disgusting and offensive. They reportedly claimed vaginal flatulence would not bloom into a proud women's movement {{as it did in the}} episode, but Parker and Stone insisted that was what made the concept even funnier.|$|E

500|$|Despite her obligations, Hańska was a {{beautiful}} unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night before last I <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851. [...] "Oh, how wonderful it is not to know anyone or have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1973, Rivette {{attempted}} to make Phénix, a film about the early-1900s Paris theatrical world which would have starred Jeanne Moreau. Due to budgetary constraints, {{he was forced to}} abandon the project. Rivette then made his most critically acclaimed film, Céline and Julie Go Boating. [...] "Aller en bateau" [...] ("go boating") is French slang for [...] "caught up in fiction" [...] or [...] "taken for a ride". Rivette met with friends, actresses Juliet Berto and Dominique Labourier, to develop two characters and created a plot and script with collaborator Eduardo de Gregorio. He later said that during this pre-production period, he [...] "never had as much [...] I don’t believe I ever <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> much". Unlike his previous two films, Rivette did not use improvisation during the filming and said that the plot was carefully constructed in advance.|$|E

Wonder Woman and Aquaman look away while the Powerpuff Girls beat up the Legion of Doom, setting the Scarecrow on fire. Notable was Bubbles' double-entendre reply to Wonder Woman's compliment on how they were developing as superheroes: [...] "One day we'll be as developed as you are". Lex Luthor (a villain with a salacious mind) began laughing; his underlings understood the joke and <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> well. When a piece of the Hall of Doom's ceiling fell on Luthor's head, everyone laughed. When the Powerpuff Girls came crashing in, Luthor mispronounced their collective name as [...] "The POWDERpuff Girls", annoying the Powerpuff Girls and causing them to angrily correct him: [...] "It's POWERpuff!" [...] "No D!!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Gabe Konrad writes: [...] "The 1919 winner, van Lerberghe, {{showed up}} on the line in full racing attire but, for some reason, without a bike. He {{borrowed}} one from the brother-in-law of another competitor and, prior to the starting gun, threatened the pack {{that he was going to}} drop them all at their own front doors on the way to victory. Van Lerberghe hadn't had, and would never have, an impressive career, and all the cyclists <b>laughed</b> <b>as</b> he pulled away immediately– never to be caught. Just prior to entering the velodrome for the finish, van Lerberghe stopped off at a pub to take in a few beers. His manager, worrying that he would miss a chance at victory, had to track him down and get him back on the bike. After he had crossed the line and done his lap of honour, van Lerberghe stood in front of the crowd and, in all seriousness, told them 'to go home; I'm half a day ahead of the field.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even <b>laughed.</b> <b>As</b> we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E
2500|$|In the evening, {{at around}} 6 or 7pm, Dan and Joe kidnapped and handcuffed Anton Weekes, a German-Australian market {{gardener}} who lived nearby, reassuring {{him that he}} would not be hurt if he obeyed. They pushed him to the Sherritts' back door and Joe asked Weekes to knock, which he did. Sherritts' young wife asked: [...] "Who is there?", repeated by Sherritt. Prompted by Joe, Weekes replied: [...] "It is me, I have lost my way", to which Sherritt's wife opened the door. Aaron stood framed in the doorway and joked with his German neighbor. [...] "You must be drunk, Anton. You know that it's over that way", he <b>laughed.</b> <b>As</b> Sherritt raised his arm to point the way for Weekes, he almost immediately afterwards made a movement backwards and said, [...] "Who's that?". Two shots were then fired into the house and Sherritt staggered back, having been hit in the left side of the neck, severing his jugular. One of the shots narrowly missed Sherritt's wife. Byrne followed him in and fired again, hitting him in the chest, and Sherritt collapsed. Sherritt died within a few minutes without another saying a word. His mother-in-law, Ellen Barry, testified to the commission that at this point she knelt down by her son-in-law's head, and Byrne called her by her name (they were well acquainted, Ellen Barry had been a particular friend of Byrne's mother) and threatened to shoot her and her daughter if they did not reveal who was in the bedroom. She asked to go outside and when she did, Byrne took off Weekes' handcuffs, telling her [...] "I am satisfied now, I wanted that fellow." [...] Ellen Barry said that she responded [...] "Well, Joe, I never heard Aaron say anything against you." [...] And he replied [...] "He would do me harm if he could; he did his best." ...|$|E
