5|$|Fagrskinna and Heimskringla largely follow Oddr's account but simplify it and diverge {{from it in}} some respects. According to Heimskringla, Sigvaldi sailed from Wendland with Olaf and a {{fleet of}} Wendish ships and <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> the ambush.|$|E
5|$|Hugh de Puiset (c. 1125– 3 March 1195) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Durham and Chief Justiciar of England under King Richard I. He was {{the nephew of}} King Stephen of England and Henry of Blois, who both {{assisted}} Hugh's ecclesiastical career. He held the office of treasurer of York {{for a number of}} years, which <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with Henry Murdac, Archbishop of York. In 1153, Hugh was elected bishop of Durham despite the opposition of Murdac.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E

5|$|Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head {{of human}} resources, {{suggests}} to Vidya {{that her husband}} resembled former employee Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have {{attracted the attention of}} two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> trouble.|$|E
5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E
5|$|Described in the chronicles as a rash and temperamental man, Carrouges {{was also}} a fierce and brave warrior whose death in battle came after a forty-year {{military}} career in which he served in Normandy, Scotland and Hungary with distinction and success. He was also heavily involved in court politics, initially at {{the seat of his}} overlord Count Pierre of Alençon at Argentan, but later in the politics of the Royal household at Paris, to which he was attached as a chevalier d'honneur and Royal bodyguard in the years following the judicial duel. During his life he conducted a long trail of legal and financial dealings which infuriated his contemporaries and may have invited violence against himself and his family. The truth of the events which <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> public mortal combat in the Paris suburbs may never be known, but the legend is still debated and discussed 600 years later.|$|E
60|$|His late {{opponent}} was yet {{a little}} dazed by the hard knocks he had received. Corny <b>led</b> <b>him</b> carefully <b>into</b> a saloon three doors away.|$|R

5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and at ease {{in front of the}} public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool.|$|E
5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
25|$|On his {{recovery}} {{he returned to}} Kidderminster, where he also became a prominent political leader. His sensitive conscience <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> conflict with almost all the contending parties in state and church. An all-day debate on 1 January 1650, with John Tombes at Bewdley ended in confused disorder.|$|E

25|$|In foreign policy, Nabis pursued {{much the}} same policy as his predecessors: {{opposing}} the Achaean League and Macedonia by allying himself with the Aetolians, Elis, and Messene. This <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> an alliance with Rome during the First Macedonian War, signing a peace treaty with Rome in 205 at the Peace of Phoenice.|$|E
25|$|The Greatest Show on Earth was {{the first}} film that {{director}} Steven Spielberg saw and he credits {{it as one of}} the major inspirations that <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> a film career. He pointed out the film's train crash scene as a major influence, and this influence was later reflected in the 2011 science fiction film Super 8, which he produced.|$|E
25|$|Like many German war veterans, Stieve was {{dissatisfied}} with the Weimar Republic and its attempt at a democratic government. He was also a German nationalist, supporting a drive to replace words of non-German origin in the German language, such as April and Mai for those months, with words of German origin. These political beliefs <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> many right-wing political and paramilitary organizations of the time, forerunners of the Nazi Party.|$|E
50|$|Toponce’s {{venture in}} central Idaho <b>led</b> <b>him</b> back <b>into</b> mining, as he {{furnished}} “grubstakes” to hopeful prospectors. Of course, few such investments {{paid off in}} any big way, but Alex did {{have one or two}} good hits.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where is he, {{where is}} he?' shrieked the witches {{when they saw}} her, but she only laughed, {{and ran to the}} hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by the hand she <b>led</b> <b>him</b> out <b>into</b> the {{moonlight}} and began to dance.|$|R
60|$|Horlock came face to {{face with}} Tallente the {{following}} afternoon, in one of the corridors of the House and, scarcely troubling about an invitation, <b>led</b> <b>him</b> forcibly <b>into</b> his private room. He turned his secretary out and locked the door.|$|R
25|$|Even though Arnold was {{nominated}} for the 1974 Fields Medal, which was then viewed as the highest honour a mathematician could receive, interference from the Soviet government led to it being withdrawn. Arnold's public opposition to the persecution of dissidents had <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> direct conflict with influential Soviet officials, and he suffered persecution himself, including not being allowed to leave the Soviet Union {{during most of the}} 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|He {{strongly}} criticised {{the cruel}} treatment and punishment meted {{out to the}} slaves, and became more convinced {{of the need to}} improve their conditions. This <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> involvement in local government, but he was the target of much antagonism and personal attack from the planters, who resented his interference, because of his measures to ameliorate the conditions of the slaves. His letters to the bishop of London illustrate the attitudes of the American colonists in the late 18th century.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} he retired from county cricket {{at the end of}} the 1977 season, Close had {{achieved}} folk hero status in Somerset. He went on to play for Todmorden in the Lancashire League. Close also had a stint as an England selector between 1979 and 1981 and in 1984 he was elected to the Yorkshire committee. He became chairman of the cricket sub-committee, which <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> more controversy and conflict with the captain, Geoffrey Boycott. He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, sir," [...] replied Tommy; {{and going}} to the mayor's stable he put the harness on the nag and then <b>led</b> <b>him</b> head-first <b>into</b> the shafts, instead of backing <b>him</b> <b>into</b> them, as is the usual way. After {{fastening}} the shafts to the horse, he mounted upon the animal's back, and away they started, pushing the cart before the horse.|$|R
6000|$|The next letter affords a {{pleasant}} variation. Without doubt it was [...] written on realizing that good nature and enthusiasm had <b>led</b> <b>him</b> [...] <b>into</b> indiscretion. This was always happening to him, and letters [...] {{like this are}} not infrequent, though generally less entertaining.|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} ladies retired. His aunt, with a good-natured {{smile on her}} face, come to him as she was leaving the room, {{the last of the}} bevy, and putting her hand on his arm, <b>led</b> <b>him</b> out <b>into</b> a small unoccupied chamber which opened from the grand saloon.|$|R
25|$|While in Ireland, Arne {{began to}} pursue alchemy {{once more and}} he took a house at Clontarf in the hopes of {{discovering}} the philosopher's stone. His pursuits again <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> debt and he was arrested and confined to a Dublin sponging-house. While there he was assisted by the father of Michael Kelly, later a famous tenor, who provided him with a piano in return for young Kelly’s daily lesson. In this way Arne was able to teach students and thereby earn money to pay off his creditors.|$|E
25|$|Caird's {{focus on}} {{linguistics}} also inevitably <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> {{the area of}} Biblical translation. According to James Barr, since Caird {{was out of the}} country at the time, he was unable to contribute to the translation of the New English Bible (begun by his mentor C. H. Dodd in 1946, the year Caird moved to Canada); but he returned to England in time to serve (along with his close friend and colleague C. F. D. Moule) on the translation panel of the New English Bible's Apocrypha in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Siringo {{continued}} to pursue Bogan, a trek which <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> Utah, then to New Mexico Territory, {{where he came}} into contact with Lem Woodruff, an old Panhandle friend to Bogan. According to Woodruff, Bogan was last known to be heading for New Orleans, Louisiana, intending on taking a ships passage to South America, stating he was tired of living on the run. The last he was heard of, Bogan sent a letter addressed to Tom Hall in Cheyenne, from New Orleans, indicating he was heading to Argentina.|$|E
60|$|They didn't {{understand}} 'im at fust, but at {{last they}} see wot 'e meant, and arter explaining to Bill, who was still giving little jumps, they <b>led</b> <b>'im</b> up <b>into</b> a corner and coaxed <b>'im</b> <b>into</b> dressing 'imself agin. He wanted to fight the conjurer, but 'e was that tired 'e could scarcely stand, and by-and-by Smith, who 'ad said 'e wouldn't 'ave {{anything to do with}} it, gave way and said he'd risk it.|$|R
60|$|Our amateur surgeon {{dropped the}} bandage indignantly and {{followed}} the negro, who <b>led</b> <b>him</b> down <b>into</b> the hold, at the further and dark end of which he saw several wounded men lying, and beside them one or two whose motionless and straightened figures seemed to indicate that death had relieved them from earthly troubles.|$|R
50|$|While Elisabeth {{was away}} Gibbings moved into Saint Patrick's Hall, an all male hall of {{residence}} at the university, and settled into a bachelor life that he found very congenial.
