40|$|Objective: To explore factors {{influencing}} perceptions and viewpoints on {{the responsibility for}} the presence of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food, on enforcement of laws and regulations that control human exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food, and on the effectiveness of such regulations. Methods: An online survey was completed by 740 individuals from several parts of Spain (median age, 47 years; 67 % were women; 70 % had completed university studies). Results: Over 87 % of respondents said that it was possible that throughout their lives they could have accumulated in their body <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> potentially dangerous to their health. The attribution of the responsibility for <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food to a larger number of social groups was more frequent among respondents who consulted information about the problem more often (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 92), who correctly identified factors that increase the likelihood of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food being harmful to human health (OR: 2. 86), who better knew the health problems that may be caused by such substances (OR: 2. 48), and who recognised more food groups that tend to have concentrations of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> potentially harmful to health (OR: 2. 92) (all p values < 0. 001). Women were 65 % less likely than men to answer that regulations on <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food are effective (p <  0. 001); and so were participants who identified more food groups with potentially toxic concentrations. Conclusions: Among study participants there was a widespread scepticism and distrust towards the enforcement and effectiveness of laws and regulations that in Spain aim to control human exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the actual}} and {{potential}} effects of <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> pollution upon human health, the United States Congress has never enacted a comprehensive victim compensation system. The {{approach of the}} Congress, to date, has been limited by a concern about legislating on a topic fraught with scientific uncertainty [...] the actual causation of injury or death by <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> pollution Individuals who believe they have been injured by <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> often bring their claims in state courts, where they face {{the difficult task of}} proving causation. Industry is principally concerned with the high cost of a compensation system, not the public health issue of scientific causation. From a policy standpoint, legislation is needed that produces information and standards on causation which assist both victims and industry. Congress has the opportunity to craft legislation that will deal rationally with an epic problem. To do so, however, the Congress must recognize scientific uncertainty as an omnipresent element of causation in cases of <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> pollution. This starting point, a comprehensive system of compensating victims of <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> pollution, can be drafted to address the values of data collection, data interpretation, prevention, conservation of economic resources, and fairness. <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> pollution victim compensation causation law and legislation...|$|R
40|$|The {{blood of}} closed {{duodenal}} loop dogs is not toxic to normal dogs. The blood of dogs {{that have been}} fatally poisoned with duodenal loop fluid is likewise non-toxic to normal dogs. The mucosa of closed or drained duodenal loops contains a <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> quite similar to the toxic material found in the lumen of the closed loops. This <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> is absorbed from the mucosa itself and not from the lumen of the drained loops. The same is probably true of the closed loops which have an intact mucosa. It seems highly probable that the poison is formed by the mucosa and is in great part absorbed directly from it by the blood. Normal intestinal mucosa contains no <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> nor can it neutralize in vitro the <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> produced in the closed loops. There {{is no evidence that}} the toxic material when given intravenously is excreted by the intestine or held by the intestinal mucosa in any demonstrable form. The <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> is not absorbed from the normal intestinal tract. Destruction of the mucosa in a closed loop by means of sodium fluoride prevents the formation of the <b>toxic</b> <b>substance.</b> This fact furnishes the final proof that the mucosa is the essential factor in the elaboration of the poisonous material...|$|R

40|$|Changing {{curriculum}} {{of science and}} biology intervened on the human impact to the environment which are represented in the curriculum in elementary School. Content of biology and science are very sparsely represented or even not in elementary School from 1998. In the sixth grade, human impacts on the environment are represented {{in the context of}} anthropogenic ecosystems in the seventh grade in natural ecosystems (forests, air) and in the eighth grade topics are human impact on the environment interwoven with themes of ecology. However, as the curriculum changed and upgraded in 2011, I would like to verify whether the changes affected the pupil’s awareness of hazardous wastes and <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> on daily basis. The purpose of the thesis was to verify the general awareness of students in seven, eight and nine classes of hazardous wastes and <b>toxic</b> <b>substances.</b> In this thesis we are wondering what sources of information students will be referred to as the principal about hazardous and <b>toxic</b> <b>substances.</b> The results of the analysis showed that pupils are properly informed of hazardous waste and <b>toxic</b> <b>substances.</b> We conclude that students awareness on environmental issues from the curriculum has increased. The results show that girls have more knowledge on hazardous waste and <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> than boys, but the differences are small. Students stated as their main source of information on hazardous waste and <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> came from family and school. ...|$|R
