50|$|On 23 January 2006, the Thai Telecommunication Act (2006) became effective, {{raising the}} <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> foreign <b>holdings</b> in telecom {{companies}} to 49 percent. The act replaced the Telecom Business Law, which took effect in November 2001, {{that put the}} foreign investment cap at 25 percent. At the time, AIS was 49 percent owned by the Shinawatra family. Competitors DTAC and TA Orange were 40 percent owned by Norway's Telenor and 49 percent owned by France's Orange. The law was not retroactive, thus DTAC and TA Orange criticised the government for discriminating against foreign investors and urged it to increase the cap.|$|R
50|$|Mobilization {{for land}} reform {{was the key}} {{priority}} of the CPI(M). At the time the legal <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> land <b>holdings</b> was 25 acres, {{but in many cases}} landlords held more lands under fake names. CPI(M) organised groups of 5-10 cadres in the country-side to organise poor peasants seize lands above the legal limit. At times groups of over 10,000 peasants would congregate to seize lands. The groups of cadres also organised sharecroppers to demand from landowners that their shares be paid in full. By late 1969 the CPI(M) peasant front, the Krishak Samiti, claimed 939,000 members in West Bengal. Through popular mobilisation 300,000 acres of land was redistributed, according to government sources, but widespread confrontations provoked a chaotic situation across the state. Clashes occurred between members of different political parties.|$|R
40|$|During {{the long}} debate about media {{ownership}} rules in Australia, the Coalition Government {{argued for the}} repeal of cross-media restrictions. It did not achieve this. The law passed in October 2006 retains <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> cross-media <b>holdings</b> but they are less restrictive than their predecessors. 1 When the Federal Communications Commission (‘FCC’) last reviewed media ownership rules in the United States, it too proposed loosening but not removing cross-media limits. 2 A federal appeals court stayed the proposed rules in 2004, essentially leaving the existing rules in place. 3 The FCC is now reviewing the rules, taking into account changes since then in the media market and the way people are using media. 4 This article examines the background to cross-media ownership laws and compares the approaches to changing them in the two countries. It finds different outcomes generated by different media markets, political and institutional contexts, legislative histories and levels of policy analysis. The two countries are both moving away from blanket prohibition of cross-media holdings {{and trying to make}} any remaining restrictions more sensitive to the characteristics of individual markets...|$|R
50|$|Five of {{the pilot}} {{programs}} allowed individuals to participate in carbon trading while two only allowed enterprises to do so. Transaction formats varied slightly but were all in spot markets with no carbon futures. In all pilots, enterprises needed to pay the cost of trading, which was a two-way charging scheme. In order to ensure stability in the carbon market, each pilot set a price <b>limit</b> based <b>on</b> the closing price of carbon in the previous compliance period, as well as <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> maximum allowance <b>holdings</b> for enterprises. Each pilot implemented varying degrees of fines for faking carbon data or withholding data. Shenzhen was the only pilot to implement a variable fine, setting it as three times the market clearing price times the excess emissions. Other pilot programs charged a flat fee. All pilots deducted the excess emissions from the next period’s allowance for the enterprise in question.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the Vietnamese {{government}} has instigated land reforms that recognise the household as the basic unit of production and allocate land use rights to households. Under the 1993 Land Law these rights can be transferred, exchanged, leased, inherited, and mortgaged. This Land Law provided {{the foundation for the}} development of a market for land use rights. During 2001, 400 farm households were surveyed in four provinces in Vietnam. Along with production and consumption data, evidence was sought of land accumulation and consolidation, land use changes, and attitudes to land reform issues. Analysis of the data shows that there is an active market for land use rights, but the level of activity varies considerably between provinces. Some individual households have acquired a large percentage of their land through buying or renting activities, as distinct from land that has been allocated or inherited. A more active market appears to be associated with opportunities for land use changes which lead to more profitable production activities. Lack of available land and in some cases labour, inadequate credit access, and reluctance to sell land use rights are identified as constraints to the land use right market, rather than transaction costs and the <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> land <b>holdings.</b> agricultural policy, land reform, land market, Vietnam, Agricultural and Food Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} fit changes in {{financial}} markets, portfolio managers often need to revise an existing portfolio. This article analyzes the portfolio adjusting problem with new added assets. We propose a possibilistic portfolio adjusting model with transaction costs and bounded constraints <b>on</b> <b>holdings</b> of assets, {{which can be}} transformed into a linear programming problem. Both the lower bounds <b>on</b> <b>holdings</b> and the total investment constraints influence the optimal portfolio adjusting strategies. Furthermore, a numerical example of a portfolio adjusting problem is given to illustrate our proposed effective approaches. The numerical results show the case that investors do not need to invest total capital and to hold all assets in the portfolio for some required return levels.

40|$|I {{examine a}} series of surveys of (primarily) {{industrial}} workers taken {{in the late nineteenth}} century to support the proposition that life-cycle saving was common and as a consequence that saving rates of the working class were surprisingly high. The surveys have detailed information on income, wage rates, occupation, unemployment, self-reported “productivity, ” savings, and also some <b>limited</b> information <b>on</b> asset <b>holdings.</b> I supplement the worker surveys with evidence drawn from the public-use samples drawn from the U. S. censuses of the nineteenth century. Saving behavior in this era seems to have been motivated by the fact that industrial workers of the time faced declining incomes, more frequent and longer episodes of unemployment, and voluntary or unavoidable downward occupational mobility as they aged. While full retirement was also common for the very old, accumulated assets were primarily a protection against falling income and enforced idleness at a time when many elderly could not depend upon their grown children to support them. The conclusions challenge the findings of life-cycle skeptics such as Michael Darby, Laurence Kotlikoff, Lawrence Summers, and others. This paper returns to a research topic that has interested me for many years. I hope it can serve as background for a book I am contemplating on the subject. My early collaborators on the history of saving and retirement, Susan B. Carter, Roger L. Ransom, and Samuel H. Williamson, have been a constant source of inspiration and ideas, although none of them should be implicated in the conclusions of this paper.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{political}} participation <b>on</b> <b>holdings</b> of liquid assets in a transition economy. Previous research has shown that the risk of political extraction by politicians and bureaucrats in countries with weak institutions has an adverse effect <b>on</b> <b>holdings</b> of liquid assets. We propose that political participation by private entrepreneurs can function as a means to alleviate some of that risk. Our empirical results indicate that political participation is positively related to cash holdings in China, especially in regions with weak institutions proxied by lower GDP per capita, lower marketization levels, and weaker property protection. Cash holdings {{have a negative effect on}} firm value as measured by the market-to-book ratio. However, political participation, the combined effect of cash holdings and political participation, as well as the combined effect of cash holdings, political participation, and institutions are all positively associated with firm value. Political participation thus results in an improved ability for firms that function in an environment fraught with the risk of political extraction to increase their holdings of liquid assets as well as a related positive effect on firm value.
