5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, <b>logical,</b> <b>and</b> straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, who was known for a <b>logical</b> <b>and</b> somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt {{that he did not}} have the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, and that he was not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races, liking to be in control. He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to his vast experience.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} of the book for the journal International Criminal Justice Review, Robert M. Worley of Penn State Altoona {{comments}} favorably on the comprehensive nature of Melzer's research and his descriptions of the differences of the practice of targeted killing in varying countries. Worley comments on the relevance of the book to scholars in various fields, including history, law, law enforcement, and terrorism analysis. Worley concludes his review by recommending the book for those with a fascination in researching criminal justice or the law. William Abresch comments favorably on Targeted Killing in International Law, in a review for the European Journal of International Law. He writes that the book is an important addition to the field of scholarship regarding how international law governs the practice of targeted killing. Abresch calls the author's writing style <b>logical,</b> <b>and</b> praises the book's organizational structure including its separate sections on use of targeted in war contrasted with use by police.|$|E

5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is {{nothing at all to}} do with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly <b>logical...</b> <b>And</b> as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} and use of the term Wicca within contemporary Paganism has been a recurring topic of discussion in the field of Pagan studies. The majority of academics and independent scholars use the first, more inclusive definition. Given its historical status and prevalent usage within Paganism, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White thought it the <b>logical</b> <b>and</b> easier choice for academia, although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines Wicca. Among those who have used the former definition are American sociologist Margot Adler, literary scholar Chas S. Clifton, and religious studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly, while others such as the Britons Graham Harvey and Ronald Hutton failed to make their usage clear. To deal with this problem in future, Doyle White urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{use a variety of}} {{firearms}} to defeat enemies, ranging from pistols to a rocket launcher. Aside from enemies, parts of the environment, such as explosive barrels, can be targeted and shot at, causing them to explode and damage nearby enemies. The game also introduces the ability for players to dodge attacks or perform a quick 180 degree turn to evade enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Health is regained with first aid sprays, as well as herbs, which can be used separately or mixed together to increase their healing effect. The game also features an ammunition creation system that allows players to create new ammunition from different varieties of gunpowder. In addition to engaging in combat, the player must often solve puzzles that focus on <b>logical</b> <b>and</b> conceptual challenges.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 24, 1911. The film had mixed reviews from critics. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was thorough {{in the analysis of}} the film who did not like the production for its poor rehashed story and maudlin melodrama. The characters behavior was not <b>logical</b> <b>and</b> the series of events relied on deus ex machina elements, such as the Salvation Army suddenly decides to march down to the water's edge, then stop and remain in the background so that they can save his soul at the opportune moment. The reviewer did state that the acting was good. The Billboard review agreed that the story was implausible, but agreed that the skill of the actors made it more plausible than it otherwise would have been. The Morning Telegraph and Walton of The Moving Picture News would praise the film for its pathos and heart. The film is presumed lost because the film is not known to be held in any archive or by any collector.|$|E

25|$|Several {{registers}} {{could be}} read onto the read bus simultaneously. When this occurred, data from each register was inclusive-ORed onto the bus. This inclusive-OR feature was used to implement the Mask instruction, which was a <b>logical</b> <b>AND</b> operation. Because the AGC had no native ability to do a <b>logical</b> <b>AND,</b> but could do a logical OR through the bus and could complement (invert) data through the C register, De Morgan's theorem was used to implement {{the equivalent of a}} <b>logical</b> <b>AND.</b> This was accomplished by inverting both operands, performing a logical OR through the bus, and then inverting the result.|$|E
