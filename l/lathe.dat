5|$|In 1910, {{he moved}} to Springfield, Vermont {{to work as a}} {{mechanical}} engineer for the Fellows Gear Shaper Company. He was already friendly with James Hartness, the president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J), another company in town. In 1911, Flanders married Hartness' daughter, Helen. Shortly afterwards, Hartness hired Flanders as a manager of the department at J that built the Fay automatic <b>lathe.</b> Flanders redesigned that <b>lathe</b> to achieve higher productivity and accuracy. He became a director in 1912 and president of the company in 1933 after Hartness retired.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} of J, Flanders implemented a continuous production line to manufacture the Hartness Turret <b>Lathe</b> instead of building each machine individually, attempting {{to bring some}} of the efficiencies of mass production to machine tool building.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 the Applied Research and Development Division of {{the company}} based in Daventry, {{demonstrated}} the first use of control tapes prepared by computer to control a <b>lathe,</b> a significant milestone {{in the development of}} CNC. This project was developed in conjunction with IBM.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine shop}} has turret <b>lathes,</b> capstan <b>lathes,</b> CNC <b>lathes,</b> and other machine tools.|$|R
50|$|Turrets can {{be added}} to non-turret <b>lathes</b> (bench <b>lathes,</b> engine <b>lathes,</b> toolroom <b>lathes,</b> etc.) by {{mounting}} them on the toolpost, tailstock, or both. Often these turrets are not as large as a turret <b>lathe's,</b> and they usually do not offer the sliding and stopping that a turret <b>lathe's</b> turret does; but they do offer the ability to index through successive tool settings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lathes</b> {{that are}} {{controlled}} by a computer are CNC <b>lathes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an {{expensive}} and painstaking process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single <b>lathe</b> and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Pascu {{applied for}} Târgu Mureş' Szentgyörgyi István Drama School, but failed the entry exam. He {{worked in a}} {{state-owned}} factory as a <b>lathe</b> operator, and for several months in 1980, was conscripted into the Romanian Land Forces, where he met other amateur musicians who were undergoing military training. Together they founded the rock band Fundal, with Pascu as lead singer and drummer. They performed in the nationwide Cântarea României festival.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred {{on the second floor}} (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a <b>lathe</b> and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.|$|E
5000|$|Machine tools: Machining centers, turning centers (CNC <b>lathes),</b> {{automatic}} <b>lathes</b> (screw machines) ...|$|R
5000|$|Smaller {{metalworking}} <b>lathes</b> {{that are}} larger than jewelers' <b>lathes</b> and can sit on a bench or table, but offer such features as tool holders and a screw-cutting gear train are called hobby <b>lathes,</b> and larger versions, [...] "bench lathes". Even larger <b>lathes</b> offering similar features for producing or modifying individual parts are called [...] "engine lathes". <b>Lathes</b> of these types do not have additional integral features for repetitive production, but rather are used for individual part production or modification as the primary role.|$|R
50|$|Manually {{controlled}} metalworking <b>lathes</b> {{are commonly}} {{provided with a}} variable-ratio gear-train to drive the main lead-screw. This enables different thread pitches to be cut. On some older <b>lathes</b> or more affordable new <b>lathes,</b> the gear trains are changed by swapping gears with various numbers of teeth onto or off of the shafts, while more modern or expensive manually controlled <b>lathes</b> have a quick-change box to provide commonly used ratios by the operation of a lever. CNC <b>lathes</b> use computers and servomechanisms to regulate the rates of movement.|$|R
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a <b>lathe</b> or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|The barracks {{was less}} than 10yards wide and 33yards long (9mx30m) and was divided into eight houses, each with three floors, {{containing}} 56 rooms in all. Each floor had seven rooms facing the front and seven in the back. There were no internal hallways. The rooms were accessed directly from the outside via eight narrow wooden staircases, a fire hazard given that the stairs provided the sole exit and the houses were separated only by thin <b>lathe</b> and plaster partitions.|$|E
5|$|Francis Penny Burnage, {{son-in-law}} of Charles, became {{chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co, and Gabriel {{continued to work}} for that company. They moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what {{would otherwise have been}} just a sales organisation: in December 1934 the company took over Cornelius Redman & Sons, renaming it Churchill-Redman Ltd. The facility was used initially to manufacture American machine tools under licence, rather as the machine tool company had started out in the early 1900s. A particularly notable example of its output was the licence granted in 1937 by Jones & Lamson of Springfield, Vermont, for the Fay automatic <b>lathe.</b> It was to become a pattern for Gabriel to orchestrate take-overs of other companies but not subsume them: they would have their own management team and retain a separate corporate identity.|$|E
50|$|Die {{heads are}} {{commonly}} used on <b>lathes,</b> turret <b>lathes,</b> screw machines and CNC <b>lathes.</b> They {{may be used for}} either cutting a thread or rolling a thread. They may also be used for internal or external thread cutting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lathes</b> are {{machines}} that cut workpieces {{while they are}} rotated. CNC <b>lathes</b> {{are able to make}} fast, precision cuts, generally using indexable tools and drills. They are particularly effective for complicated programs designed to make parts that would be infeasible to make on manual <b>lathes.</b> CNC <b>lathes</b> have similar control specifications to CNC mills and can often read G-code as well as the manufacturer's proprietary programming language. CNC <b>lathes</b> generally have two axes (X and Z), but newer models have more axes, allowing for more advanced jobs to be machined.|$|R
50|$|Micro <b>lathes</b> {{are well}} suited for use in {{restricted}} spaces where heavy machining or high accuracy are not requirements. Micro <b>lathes</b> {{find a place in}} homes, basements, and garages. As they are a popular tool for hobbyists, they are commonly sold through hobby catalogs and hobby websites. Micro <b>lathes</b> are preferred over larger <b>lathes</b> by some professionals, commonly locksmiths, jewelers, designers, and engineers for prototyping or fabrication work.|$|R
5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a <b>lathe</b> to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Charles Churchill & Co, {{the parent}} company, moved its offices from London to Birmingham and in 1955 {{increased}} its share capital to £1.26M. By the financial year ending March 1962 it reported a group net profit of £575,352 and a dividend of 22.5%. Exports were up 26% {{and there were}} hopes of the sector eventually amounting to 40% of total output. Fixed assets had increased significantly: the business had taken over Newcast Foundries Ltd, Halifax-based heavy <b>lathe</b> manufacturer Denhams Engineering Co Ltd and Churchill-Milnes; it had spent £2M of its own resources building extensions and plant improvements to more than double its manufacturing capability compared to that in 1951. Information regarding Churchill-Milnes is lacking but a business called Henry Milnes manufactured lathes in the Bradford area {{for many years and}} it may be that this was the target of a take-over.|$|E
5|$|Now {{returning}} to its pre-Kensington route, NY33 follows a six-lane, divided Genesee Street past the airport {{on one side}} and numerous associated businesses such as hotels and fast food restaurants on the other. The large aerospace contractor Calspan has its headquarters here, and Westinghouse once operated a large industrial <b>lathe</b> plant on the airport side of the road (it was torn down when the airport was rebuilt in the late 1990s). Beyond the airport, the divider ends, the travel lanes are reduced to four and, after a short curve and minimal descent, NY33 intersects Transit Road (NY78) and enters the town of Lancaster. After this junction, the highway becomes a two-lane route once again through the small hamlet of Bowmansville, where it crosses Ellicott Creek near some rapids.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} mechanically automated <b>lathes</b> were geometric <b>lathes.</b> These included Rose engine <b>lathes</b> and others. In industrial contexts {{during the}} Machine Age, the term [...] "automatic lathe" [...] referred to mechanical screw machines and chuckers (discussed below), {{of which a}} large variety of types, brands, and models were built.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lathes</b> can be {{combined}} with other machine tools, such as a drill press or vertical milling machine. These are usually referred to as combination <b>lathes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Almost all <b>lathes</b> have a bed, {{which is}} (almost always) a {{horizontal}} beam (although CNC <b>lathes</b> commonly have an inclined or vertical beam for a bed {{to ensure that}} swarf, or chips, falls free of the bed). Woodturning <b>lathes</b> specialized for turning large bowls often have no bed or tail stock, merely a free-standing headstock and a cantilevered tool rest.|$|R
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a <b>lathe.</b> Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E
5|$|The major {{producers}} of calcium are China (about 10000 to 12000 tonnes per year), Russia (about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year), and the United States (about 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year). Canada and France are {{also among the}} minor producers. In 2005, about 24000 tonnes of calcium were produced; {{about half of the}} world's extracted calcium is used by the United States, with about 80% of the output used each year. In Russia and China, Davy's method of electrolysis is still used, but is instead applied to molten calcium chloride. Since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium, the oxide–nitride coating that results in air is stable and <b>lathe</b> machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium. In the United States and Canada, calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium metal at high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{witnesses who}} testified to bloodstains and {{strands of hair}} found on the <b>lathe,</b> to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested {{the place of the}} murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.|$|E
50|$|Cue <b>lathes</b> {{function}} {{similarly to}} turning and spinning <b>lathes,</b> allowing a perfectly radially-symmetrical cut for billiard cues. They {{can also be}} used to refinish cues that have been worn over the years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lathes</b> {{are very}} similar to {{surfaces}} of revolution. However, <b>lathes</b> are constructed by rotating a curve defined by a set of points instead of a function. Note that this means that <b>lathes</b> can be constructed by rotating closed curves or curves that double back on themselves (such as the aforementioned torus), whereas a surface of revolution could not because such curves cannot be described by functions.|$|R
50|$|During 1946, {{the company}} was located at 105 South Townsend Street and they were hiring machine workers to operate their Brown and Turret <b>Lathes,</b> Bar and Chuck, Engine <b>Lathes,</b> Sharpe millers and Cincinnati millers.|$|R
5|$|The vimana {{of their}} temples (tower over the shrine) is a {{compromise}} in detail between the plain stepped {{style of the}} early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas. To the credit of the Western Chalukya architects {{is the development of}} the <b>lathe</b> turned (tuned) pillars and use of Soapstone (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, a very popular idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use of decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was dravidian architecture. This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large <b>lathe</b> using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of {{the hair on the}} <b>lathe</b> shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that the}} various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the bar puller begins with the {{introduction}} of the NC/CNC <b>lathes</b> in around 1980. At this time <b>lathes</b> were changed to permit inexpensive and economical production of small or medium-sized batches.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "monitor lathe" [...] {{formerly}} (1860s-1940s) {{referred to}} the class of small- to medium-sized manual turret <b>lathes</b> used on relatively small work. The name {{was inspired by the}} monitor-class warships, which the monitor <b>lathe's</b> turret resembled. Today, <b>lathes</b> of such appearance, such as the Hardinge DSM-59 and its many clones, are still common, but the name [...] "monitor lathe" [...] is no longer current in the industry.|$|R
50|$|The term {{layshaft}} {{was also}} applied to back-geared <b>lathes.</b> These were <b>lathes</b> with a slow-speed mechanism {{in addition to}} their usual belt drive. This used two gears on a layshaft behind the headstock, giving a double reduction gear.|$|R
