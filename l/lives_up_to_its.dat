Stob Garbh <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> name by being rocky and needs care when being traversed. It can be by-passed {{on the west side}} but the path is steep and slippery and it is best to stick to the path over the crest. The original 1891 edition of Munro's Tables lists another Top at an intermediate point on the ridge, Stob Garbh South East Top at 925m. This Top was deleted in the 1921 edition. The north west ridge has two intermediate summits, Meall Dhamh (814 metres) and Grey Heights (686 metres), before dropping steeply to Glen Falloch through a conifer plantation.|$|E

[...] Criticizing Rebel Heart for being [...] "overworked", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that [...] "the duality of its title [...] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna'". John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song [...] "never quite <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> fantastic title, and just sounds a bit of a mess, trying to cram in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap".

500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Leahey of allmusic {{opined that}} some of the cast members are better actors than vocalists, but gave {{particular}} praise to Michele's songs, suggesting that the soundtrack is largely a showcase for her talent, and that she outperforms most of the original artists. IGN's Brian Linder described the album as having [...] "an appealing irreverent spirit that tamps down the earnestness just as it begins to overwhelm." [...] Linder agreed that Morrison does not excel as an emcee, but still found his attempts at rapping enjoyable. He generally approved of the track list, but found the older songs such as [...] "Sweet Caroline" [...] and [...] "Say a Little Prayer" [...] lacking in resonance, and named [...] "You Keep Me Hangin' On" [...] as the weakest performance. Linder commended Riley and Michele's vocals, and most enjoyed the covers of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] and [...] "Keep Holding On", suggesting that the latter surpasses the original version. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that the album requires a suspension of disbelief, attributing some negative reviews from US critics to their inability to accept the fantasy of the series. Petridis reviewed [...] "Dancing With Myself", [...] "Sweet Caroline", [...] "Gold Digger", [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] and [...] "Alone" [...] favorably, but as with Gill and Linder disliked [...] "You Keep Me Hangin' On", which she deemed bland and boring. Petridis wrote that the album does not entirely work in its own right, separate from the television series, but concluded that for listeners prepared to accept the conceit, [...] "Glee: the Soundtrack almost <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> title." ...|$|E

[...] Jason Thompson from PopMatters described Minogue's vocals as a [...] "sexual come on" [...] and called the song [...] "trim and funky, certainly something that couldn't miss anywhere." [...] Dominique Leone from Pitchfork Media praised the commercial prospect of the song, saying that it [...] "exudes a catchiness that belies its inherent simplicity, so reassuring during an era when chart acts sound increasingly baroque and producers race to see who can ape electronic music trends first." [...] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly said that the song [...] "fully <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> title" [...] with [...] "every sound a hook," [...] and compared it to the works of Andrea True. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH labelled the song [...] "one of 2001's best singles," [...] saying that it [...] "predictably beat off lesser 'competition.'" [...] In 2012, The Guardian critic Everett True defined [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] as [...] "one of those rare moments in pop: sleek and chic and stylish and damnably danceable, but with a darker element hidden in plain sight." [...] Billboards Jason Lipshutz felt that [...] "the metallic production wouldn't carry quite as much of its impact if Minogue had attempted to outshine it; wisely, her voice operates alongside it, finding renewed power in its drive", concluding that [...] "almost 15 years after its release, it still sounds fresh, forward-thinking and alive".|$|E
