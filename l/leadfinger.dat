Proton Energy Pills played a [...] "form of heavy retro-grunge that drew on US bands like Blue Oyster Cult, MC5 and Mudhoney for inspiration". They included the three Curley brothers: Dave on lead vocals, Jason on bass guitar, and Lenny on guitar; with Stewart Cunningham on lead guitar & Richard Lewis on drums. Other bands which included Tumbleweed members were Richie and the Creeps, The Pink Fits, Monstrous Blues, The Unheard, The Hot Rollers, Brother Brick, <b>Leadfinger.</b> Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described Tumbleweed as the [...] "ultimate stoner's band for the 1990s. From within a post-psychedelic underground haze that evoked {{the spirit of}} 1969, [...] came on with lashings of fuzz-drenched wah wah guitar riffs, hard-driving beats, languid vocal melodies and more hair than any band {{had a right to}} possess!" [...] Their initial line up only lasted a few months, they recorded a 7" [...] single, [...] "Captain's Log", which was produced by Mudhoney's Mark Arm, in December 1990 and released in August the next year on Waterfront Records. McFarlane noted that it was [...] "a distorted slice of voodoo acid-rock".|$|E

50|$|After Thumlock Lough, Iacurto, Stokes and Kane Goodwin formed another {{band called}} Remnants Of A Dead Star (R.O.A.D.S.) which {{released}} one ep Double White Lines. Stokes {{was a member}} of The Wardens and <b>Leadfinger.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Leadfinger</b> dabble in a {{wide variety}} of styles but are mostly known for a {{combination}} of guitar driven high energy rock, power pop and 70s punk rock, similar to The Replacements, Radio Birdman and The Saints. <b>Leadfinger</b> mine the deep seam of underground guitar music back through the 70s rock and punk era's to the classic Stones and Dylan records of the late 60s and beyond. Their tools are as broad as their musical palette; electric guitars, 12 and 6 string acoustic guitars, alternate tunings and slide, dynamic bass and drums and harmony vocals. Their music embodies a soulful and classic kind of rock and roll and is based around the songwriting of singer/guitarist Stewart Cunningham and the use of vintage gear and amplification.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leadfinger</b> (pron: Led-finger) is an Australian rock’n’roll band {{formed in}} the city of Wollongong, New South Wales in 2006 by Glasgow-born singer/guitarist Stewart 'leadfinger' Cunningham. The band has {{released}} 5 albums to date, with the most recent coming out in July 2016 through Conquest of Noise.|$|E
5000|$|Brother Brick were an Australian {{punk rock}} band {{formed in the}} city of Sydney, New South Wales in 1991. Led by Stewart (<b>Leadfinger)</b> Cunningham, the band {{released}} many 7" [...] vinyl singles and 1 album in its time and contained members of many other successful Australian bands.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} line-up of Brother Brick {{was formed}} following {{the demise of}} The Proton Energy Pills from Wollongong and The Horny Toads from Sydney and featured former Protons guitarist Stewart <b>Leadfinger</b> Cunningham and former Horny Toads Bassplayer Kurt Anderson and Drummer, Mikey J Stephenson. The Horny Toads were originally formed in Brisbane but moved to Sydney in 1988 {{and over the next}} 2 years they played many gigs with The Proton Energy Pills at venues such as The Lansdowne Hotel, The Journos Club and The Hopetoun Hotel. Both bands were 5 piece 'rock' bands and had much in common musically being inspired by many of the same seminal acts Radio Birdman, Blue Öyster Cult and The MC5. Other members of these two bands also went on to play in The Dubrovniks, Tumblweed and <b>Leadfinger.</b>|$|E
50|$|The band {{released}} their newest album Friday Night Heroes on 14 July. Recorded in mid-2015 when <b>Leadfinger</b> spent a {{few weeks}} in Linear Recording Studio (Leichardt, NSW), it was released on 14 July 2016 on the Conquest of Noise label. The band embarked on a tour {{in support of the}} album.|$|E
50|$|The {{current and}} most well known <b>Leadfinger</b> line up came {{together}} in late 2008 {{with the addition of}} second guitarist Michael Boyle (ex-Mudlungs) and a new rhythm section of Adam 'Reggie' Screen on electric bass guitar and Dillon Hicks (ex-Zambian Goat Herders). on Drums. Although they played their first official gig at The Annandale Hotel in Sydney in January 2009, Hicks had previously filled in on Drums for some <b>Leadfinger</b> gigs in Melbourne in 2008 whilst Boyle had been playing with Cunningham in a duet format at smaller intimate gigs in the previous two years. With the culmination of this line up the band became a genuine going concern. A newfound camaraderie and commitment that was missing from the previous line up enabled the band to play live more regularly and pursue a more definite musical direction.|$|E
5000|$|After a 4-year hiatus {{from playing}} and writing music {{following}} the death of his Yes-Men bandmate, Sean Greenway in 2001 and the abrupt end of that band, Cunningham began writing again in 2005 and a new batch of songs was recorded primarily as demos in his home studio. These songs would eventually be compiled for release as the first <b>Leadfinger</b> album, 'the floating life' which came out in mid 2007 through Spanish based record label Bang! Records. The connection with Bang! Records came through that label's prior release of recordings by Cunningham's earlier bands Brother Brick, The Yes-Men and Asteroid B-612. The first ever <b>Leadfinger</b> gig took place at Wollongong's long standing underground venue The Oxford Tavern in February 2006 and featured in Cunningham's own words [...] "…a musician used to playing with a band fumbling through a set of songs in a shocked and disjointed manner". By mid 2006 Cunningham was joined at a number of gigs by drummer Stephen O'Brien (ex- The Unheard). Finally at the Oxford Tavern on NYE 2006 the first full line-up of <b>Leadfinger</b> was completed with the addition of Wayne Stokes (ex-Thumlock) on electric bass guitar. This initial 3 piece line-up of <b>Leadfinger</b> would only play live sporadically in its time together, including the official launch gig for 'the floating life' album at the Hopetoun Hotel in Sydney on 29 July 2007. They managed to record a batch of new songs in two inspired sessions at an old farmhouse in the Tongarra dairy country below Macquarie Pass south of Wollongong. These recordings can be heard on the Through the Cracks CD EP (2008 - Musicfarmers Records) and the Rich Kids album (2009 - Bang! Records). Both these releases were produced and mixed by Cunningham at his home studio, dubbed 'Leadfinger's Rendezvous Studio'. This first line up played its last gig at The Tote Hotel in Melbourne as part of the two night Bang! Records Festival on 15 August 2008.|$|E
50|$|Songs {{originally}} {{written and}} recorded by The Yes-Men have been covered by Swedish band The Hellacopters who included {{a version of}} Acid Reign {{as part of the}} digital only version of their last album Head off in 2008. Australian band <b>Leadfinger</b> recorded Swept Back (By the Tide) in 2008 and Leaving was included on their 2011 album, We Make the Music.|$|E
5000|$|... 2009 {{finally saw}} a belated {{release of the}} Tongarra {{farmhouse}} recordings by the first <b>Leadfinger</b> line up. The album titled Rich Kids (after the album track Rich Kids Can't Play Rock'n’roll) was released on vinyl and cd again through Bang! Records. Critical reviews of the album were very positive. Of the album's title track Patrick Emery wrote via Australian Mess+Noise music website [...] "…Rich Kids Can't Play Rock'n’Roll but <b>Leadfinger</b> can!" [...] Rich Kids has a raw, distinctly Australian sound a la The Saints and Radio Birdman and contained two standout tracks that would become mainstays of the live set for years to come, namely Fade Your Brilliance and Rich Kids Can't Play Rock'n’Roll. Both formats of the album also include a cover of Bad Penny, a song written originally performed and written by Rory Gallagher whilst a version of I Think of Demons (originally by Roky Erickson) appears on the vinyl format. A version of The Saints song Ghost Ships appears on the CD release.|$|E
50|$|The Remaining tracks {{from the}} {{sessions}} were released {{on a limited}} edition CD EP called I Belong to the Band in November 2011. <b>Leadfinger</b> also made two video clips for songs from the We Make the Music album, for the title track We Make the Music and the song Fourteen from the CD version of the album. Both clips were produced by Rob Stephenson.|$|E
5000|$|Most great rock n’ roll is {{made out}} on the fringes but this latest album from Australian veteran Stewart <b>Leadfinger</b> Cunningham packs such a punch that it deserves to come out from the underground. Fans of bands from The Masters Apprentices to HITS will love its greasy swagger, sure-footed songwriting and a sound thats both rich and raw. This is a deep seam, back to the classic Stones records of the late 60s on songs like Youre So Strange, with its gospel-charged backing vocal from Chloe West. Gimme The Future sports searing guitar work that threatens to shred speakers, and Cruel City pumps {{with the kind of}} {{intensity}} once found on Radio Birdman records. But there is also room for banjo on the dusty roads of the title tune, and the intense The Lonely Road is dedicated to Rory Gallagher. Anyone who ever heard the sparks flying on a record by the late Irish bluesman will recognise a soul brother in <b>Leadfinger</b> and his passionate tunes."

50|$|<b>Leadfinger</b> founder Stewart Cunningham {{has been}} a fixture in the Australian {{underground}} music scene for over 20 years. After first plying his trade as guitarist with pre-grunge Wollongong band The Proton Energy Pills. in the late 1980s, he then headed to Sydney where he spent the 1990s playing in seminal underground guitar bands - Asteroid B-612, Brother Brick and Challenger-7. He also had a stint in Melbourne with The Yes-Men, a band formed by Sean Greenway (ex-God and The Freeloaders). All of these bands released critically appreciated albums in Australia, USA, Japan and Europe.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{returning}} {{to live near}} hometown Wollongong in 2005, Cunningham began performing live as 'Leadfinger', relying on open tuning and slide guitar driven songs. The first three <b>Leadfinger</b> albums were released through Bang! Records, a Spanish Basque independent label that specialises in underground Australian rock like The Beasts of Bourbon, The Scientists and The Drones. The band's most recent album No Room at the Inn, came out through iconic Australian Label Citadel Records whose legacy stretches back 30 years and roster includes many of Leadfinger's own musical influences including Deniz Tek, Died Pretty and the Lime Spiders.|$|E
5000|$|Australian Musicologist, Ian McFarlane {{writes that}} [...] "The Proton Energy Pills {{comprised}} Dave Curley (vocals), Lenny Curley (guitar), Jay Curley (bass), Stewy <b>Leadfinger</b> Cunningham (guitar) and Richie Lewis (drums). Proton Energy Pills derived their name from American cartoon series Roger Ramjet (the proton energy pills gave Ramjet his extraordinary strength). The band played {{a form of}} heavy retro-grunge that drew on US bands like Blue Oyster Cult, MC5 and Mudhoney for inspiration. Local bands that the Pills aspired to included Radio Birdman, The Celibate Rifles and The New Christs. Sydney independent label Waterfront issued two Proton Energy Pills singles, `Survival'/`Symmetry' (September 1989) and `(Less than I) Spend'/`Strawberry Patch' (March 1990), and the mini-album Proton Energy Pills(September 1990)." ...|$|E
50|$|Greenway wrote most of {{the first}} Yes-Men songs and began {{recording}} these songs prior to even having a band to perform them. He recruited Sydney based musician Stewart <b>Leadfinger</b> Cunningham as lead guitarist and began rehearsing and arranging the songs with him during visits to Sydney and when Cunningham was in Melbourne (Cunningham was then playing in Asteroid B-612 and Brother Brick and would visit Melbourne every 6 weeks to play gigs). The first recording sessions for The Yes-Men involved Greenway and long time friend Matthew Whittle(ex-God) laying down bass, guitar and drum tracks at Birdland Studios in Prahran whilst Cunningham would lay down his parts {{when he was in}} Melbourne. These earlier recordings would eventually surface on the 2005 posthumous self-titled album 'The Yes-Men' (aka El Peligro Ha Comenzado).|$|E
50|$|The name 'leadfinger' was {{originally}} a nom de plume for Stewart Cunningham and originates from when his brother shot {{him with an}} air rifle at age 14. The lead pellet from the air rifle became embedded in his left index finger and required surgery to remove. Future bandmates would take to calling Cunningham 'leadfinger' in jest that the bizarre air rifle injury had somehow come to influence his guitar style. Cunningham himself states that the name <b>Leadfinger</b> was also chosen for his new project as an homage to delta blues legend Lead Belly, his original intention being to perform solo under the name. Interestingly Cunningham continues a great tradition of Scottish Australian rock musicians and songwriters in Australia following in {{the steps of the}} Young family (members of AC/DC, The Easybeats), Jimmy Barnes, Bon Scott, Colin Hay, Karl Broadie, James McCann and others.|$|E
50|$|In late 2011 <b>Leadfinger</b> began {{arranging}} and rehearsing a new {{batch of}} songs {{that would become}} album No. 4. The songs were mostly pre-written by Cunningham with many being inspired by an Epiphone acoustic 12 string guitar that had he had acquired in early 2011. Songs like The Wandering Man, Gimme the Future, Pretty Thing and The Other Ones that became {{the backbone of the}} album were all based on simple 3 chord progressions that were given a distinct tone and twist by the involvement of the 12 string sound. Having a very small budget the band had no option but to record something quick and inexpensively so the bed tracks were done at Sydneys Defwolf studio in late April 2012 whilst the overdubs, vocals and mixing were completed by Cunningham himself at his home studio, Leadfingers Rendezvous Studio over the next few months. The resulting album No Room at the Inn was recorded and mastered for under $5,000. It is a true independent recording paid for and made by the band. The album was fortuitously picked up by iconic Australian record label Citadel Records and it received worthy critical acclaim upon release in February 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the split}} of the band, {{members of the}} Proton Energy Pills went on to play in many {{successful}} bands including Brother Brick, Zambian Goatherders, Tumbleweed, <b>Leadfinger,</b> Asteroid B-612 and Challenger-7, The Yes-Men, Richie & the Creeps, Brut 66 and The Pink Fits. Despite their limited output, {{the significance of the}} band would come to light in hindsight and they came to be considered a pre-grunge seminal act that paved the way for an 'unearthing' of underground rock in Australia in the 1990s. In their hometown of Wollongong, 'the Protons' (as they are known) played many all-ages gigs mostly due to the philosophy of frontman David Curley who in his role as youth social worker with Wollongong Council was very committed to engaging the region's youth in music and art. As a result, the band are revered for inspiring many young people to pick up instruments and form bands. In 2007, Spanish Label Bang! Records released a gatefold CD retrospective of the band's music including extensive liner notes on the band's history and impact. The band also featured on Tales From the Australian Underground retrospective which was released in 2006 on Feel Presents Record Label, the following quote on the significance of The Proton Energy Pills is taken from that release: ...|$|E
5000|$|Over winter 2010 <b>Leadfinger</b> {{recorded}} album number 3 at Sydney's Big Jesus Burger Studio in Surry Hills, Sydney. With {{the help}} of JP Fung and Brent Williams (The New Christs) the band {{found themselves in a}} professional recording studio {{for the first time and}} made the most of it. We Make the Music was recorded using vintage analogue technology and 2" [...] tape and then mixed on a vintage Neve desk. As a result, the sound of this album has great warmth and depth that harks back to great seventies era albums that are a strong influence on the band like Exile on Main Street by the Rolling Stones and Big Star's first two albums. We Make the Music was released in March 2011. The CD and digital version were released through Wollongong based record label Impedance Records whilst the vinyl version came out through Bang! Records. The album title and title track was inspired by a particular scene from the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (starring Gene Wilder) and is a statement on the originality and the value of artistic inspiration over corporate and media manipulation. [...] "We are the music makers and we are the dreamers of the dreams" [...] was originally from an 1873 poem, Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy.|$|E
