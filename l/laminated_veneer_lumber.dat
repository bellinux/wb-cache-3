40|$|Abstract [...] Chemically-modified <b>laminated</b> <b>veneer</b> <b>lumbers</b> (LVLs) were {{produced}} and their physical properties and biological resistance were evaluated. For the chemical modification, the vapor-phase formalization and the pad-dry-cure treatment ofveneers with some cross-linking agents were employed prior to lamination of the treated veneers. The vapor-phase formalization was conducted for 5, 10 and 24 hours using tetraoxane {{as a source}} offormaldehyde, and the pad-dry-cure treatments with glutaraldehyde and dimethylol dihydroxy ethylene urea (DMDHEU) were made after impregnation of their 2. 5, 5 and 10 % aqueous solutions. Sulfur dioxide {{was used as a}} catalyst in both treatments. Laboratory tests with a brown-rot and a white-rot fungus revealed that decay was almost completely suppressed at the high levels of treatment, and fairly eliminated at the low levels of treatment. The treatment could reduce the weight loss of specimens caused by termite attack, but the effectiveness in resisting it was not as sufficient as was decay resistance. All treated LVLs were very stable to water soaking even in the 2 -hour boiling on thickness swelling as well as linear expansion along tangential direction...|$|R

50|$|A leading {{manufacturer}} and marketer of building and lumber products, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LP) revolutionized the industry by inventing alternatives to plywood and solid wood building products. Instead {{of relying on}} larger, more expensive old-growth timber, LP found ways to make structural building products from small-diameter, fast-growing trees. LP pioneered the use of oriented strand board (OSB) — a reconstituted plywood substitute made by pressing wood wafers together. OSB {{is the basis for}} many of LP's structural building products. LP also manufacturers industrial wood products, such as hardboard and medium density fiberboard, which are used by furniture and cabinet makers. Furthermore, along with wood products such as LPI joists and <b>laminated</b> <b>veneer</b> <b>lumber,</b> the company also produces Cocoon cellulose insulation. Plywood and pulp manufacturing round out LP's operations. The company controls over 950,000 acres of timberland, and owns plants in 29 states, as well as in Canada and Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Suwyn also {{concentrated}} on developing LP's specialty products lines. As its past innovations had become industry standards (and were imitated by numerous competitors), {{it was essential}} for LP to launch new products {{that would give the}} company an edge over its rivals. To further this goal, LP engaged in a series of targeted acquisitions. In 1996, LP purchased Associated Chemists, a key supplier of specialty coatings to the wood products industry, as well as GreenStone Industries, a manufacturer of cellulose insulation, and Tecton Laminates Corp., a producer of <b>laminated</b> <b>veneer</b> <b>lumber</b> and wood I-joists used in the construction industry. Two years later, LP acquired ABT Building Products Corporation, a transaction it heralded as a way 'to expand its specialty products lines and complement its low-cost commodity building products,' according to the Wall Street Journal. In 1999, LP purchased Evans Forest Products Ltd., a Canadian manufacturer of engineered wood and lumber products.|$|E
50|$|LP's OSB {{products}} {{protected the}} company {{from some of the}} vicissitudes of the timber market. Buoyed by this success, the company soon expanded its line of products made from reconstituted wood to include I-beams for floor joists and rafters. These structural beams used half as much lumber as their solid wood counterparts, yet were stronger and lighter. LP also introduced a concrete form of Inner-Seal, and in 1985 began to market Inner-Seal siding for the exterior of homes. Driven by these breakthroughs, a housing boom, and a thriving remodeling and repair business that increased demand for its specialty building products, LP's sales grew 50 percent between 1980 and 1988, according to the Portland Oregonian. During the same period, its profits increased 400 percent. Moreover, OSB products accounted for an escalating portion of the company's total sales. Only six percent of sales in 1980, the Inner-Seal line by 1990 amounted to almost 30 percent of total sales volume. LP's sales of lumber—once the mainstay of the building industry—decreased from 53 to 30 percent over the same period. In 1986, the company purchased Kirby Forest Industries and the California properties of Timber Realization Company. From these transactions, LP gained almost 830,000 acres of timberland, which helped balance the land taken in 1978 for Redwood National Park. (LP received a final payment of $440 million from the government for this land in 1988.) In 1990, LP bought Weather Guard Inc., a manufacturer of housing insulation made from recycled newsprint, as well as MiTek Wood Products, a North Carolina-based producer of <b>laminated</b> <b>veneer</b> <b>lumber</b> and engineered wood I-beams.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{randomized}} controlled split-mouth clinical trial evaluated the short-term survival rate of indirect resin composite and ceramic <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers.</b> Materials and Methods: A total of 10 patients (mean age: 48. 6 years) received 46 indirect resin composite (Estenia; n = 23) and ceramic <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> (IPS Empress Esthetic; n = 23) on the maxillary anterior teeth. Veneer preparations with incisal overlap were performed and existing resin composite restorations of good quality were not removed but conditioned using silica coating (CoJet) and silanization (ESPE-Sil). Enamel and dentin were etched and rinsed; adhesive resin (ExciTE) was then applied. After cementation (Variolink Veneer), restorations were evaluated at baseline and thereafter every 6 months {{for up to}} 3 years using modified USPHS criteria. Results: Seventeen <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> were bonded onto intact teeth and 29 on teeth having existing resin composite restorations. In total, 3 failures were observed {{in the form of}} debonding (n = 1) and fracture (n = 2) in the group of resin composite <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers.</b> No significant difference was observed between the survival rates of composite and ceramic <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> (Estenia: 87 %, IPS Empress Esthetic: 100 %; p > 0. 05).
