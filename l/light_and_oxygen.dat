Steaks from these muscles were segmented into a low oxygen dark, low <b>oxygen</b> <b>light,</b> high <b>oxygen,</b> <b>and</b> PVC overwrap packaging environment for six days of retail display. There were no major differences in pH, oxygen consumption rate, or myoglobin reductase acitivity between shelf-life days and packaging environments for the muscles used in the study. The VL, TB, ST, SM, and the GM had higher levels of lipid oxidation in the later days of shelf-life storage and were higher (P < 0. 05) in high oxygen packaging compared to the other three treatments. Oxygen penetration depth was greater (P < 0. 05) over all storage days for the high oxygen treatment in the TB and LL as compared to the other treatments. Hunter CIE a* and b* values significantly decreased across all muscles for the high <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> PVC treatments. Discoloration increased significantly as storage days increased in the high <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> PVC treatments for the TB, SM, VL, BF, IF, GM, PM, and TM.
