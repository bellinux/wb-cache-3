5000|$|Market {{price support}} (MPS) is an indicator, {{developed}} by the OECD, used in the calculation of Producer and Consumer Subsidy Equivalents (PSE/CSE). MPS is the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers arising from policy measures creating a gap between domestic market prices and border prices of a specific agricultural commodity measured at the farm gate level. Conditional on {{the production of a}} specific commodity, MPS includes the transfer to producers associated with both production for domestic use and exports and is measured by the price gap applied to current production. The MPS is net of producer <b>levies</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> of the specific commodity or penalties for not respecting regulations such as production quotas (price levies). In the case of livestock production MPS is net of the market price support on domestically produced coarse grains and oilseeds used as animal feed (excess feed cost).|$|E

The French Government contributed 56 per cent of the programme's total development costs, which was intended to be repaid by Dassault via a <b>levy</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> of the airliner, the company also financed the initiative with $10 million of its own money, as well as being mainly responsible for costs related to manufacture.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the according demands of customers, BHC formed a partnership with operator Hovertravel {{in order to develop}} the envisioned hovercraft, which would be a cheaper and quieter successor to the SR.N6; £237,000 of funding was provided by the British Technology Group to support the initiative, which was to be repaid during via a <b>levy</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> <b>on</b> the new craft. The majority of that project's financing originated from BHC itself, which would ultimately spend around £1 million of its own funds on the new hovercraft by the end of development.

30|$|Another factor behind labor {{share is}} the {{development}} of the services sector. Because the labor income share in the services sector is higher than that in industry, its average value will rise if there is a structural transformation from industry to services. The recent government experiment of replacing the business tax which is <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> revenue with the value added tax in the services sector should be a significant boost to the services sector. Reducing the biases against the services sector in terms of land allocation and entry barriers should also have a positive effect.

50|$|The main {{taxes in}} Chile {{in terms of}} revenue {{collection}} are the value added tax (45.8% of total revenues in 2012) and the income tax (41.8% of total revenues in 2012). The value added tax is <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> {{of goods and services}} (including imports) at a rate of 19%, with a few exemptions. The income tax revenue comprises different taxes. While there is a corporate income tax of 20% over profits from companies (called First Category Tax), the system is ultimately designed to tax individuals. Therefore, corporate income taxes paid constitute a credit towards two personal income taxes: the Global Complementary Tax (in the case of residents) or the Additional Tax (in the case of non-residents). The Global Complementary Tax is payable by those that have different sources of income, while those receiving income solely from dependent work are subject to the Second Category Tax. Both taxes are equally progressive in statutory terms, with a top marginal rate of 40%. Income arising from corporate activity under the Global Complementary Tax only becomes payable when effectively distributed to the individual. There are also special <b>sales</b> taxes <b>on</b> alcohol and luxury goods, as well as specific taxes on tobacco and fuel. Other taxes include the inheritance tax and custom duties.|$|R
