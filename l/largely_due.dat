5|$|Sicilian Baroque {{is today}} {{recognised}} as an architectural style, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> {{to the work}} of Sacheverall Sitwell, whose Southern Baroque Art of 1924 was the first book to appreciate the style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt.|$|E
5|$|About 100 tonnes of {{dysprosium}} {{are produced}} worldwide each year, with 99% of that total produced in China. Dysprosium prices have climbed nearly twentyfold, from $7 per pound in 2003, to $130 a pound in late 2010. The price increased to $1,400/kg in 2011 but fell to $240 in 2015, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to illegal production in China which circumvented government restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Because Israel's {{victory was}} <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated {{by refusing to}} sell crude oil to the U.S., {{resulting}} in the 1973 oil crisis. The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the Sea was {{released}} in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office. Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee and former Darin manager Steve Blauner responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey's work on the film. Despite a number of negative reviews, some critics praised Spacey's performance, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to his decision to use his own singing voice. He received a Golden Globe nomination.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge is {{especially}} {{noted for its}} historical links with Ireland. This is <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to large scale immigration into the town from Ulster (especially from County Donegal) in the 19th century and {{throughout most of the}} 20th century. Indeed, the town has been called 'little Ireland'.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the defense}} buildup in Mobile shipyards {{resulted}} in a considerable increase in the city's white middle-class and working-class population, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to the massive influx of workers coming {{to work in the}} shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.|$|E

5|$|England {{dominated}} the second Test, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to the bowling of Briggs. Batting first, England scored 292 runs, of which Abel contributed 120. Fothergill claimed the first South African wicket, Albert Rose-Innes {{at the end}} of the first day, but only claimed two more in the match, as Briggs took fifteen wickets on the second day to help England to an innings and 202-run victory.|$|E
5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, {{and recent}} history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of}} law is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{much to the}} nation's surprise, the Hanshin Tigers {{faced the}} Seibu Lions and took their first and only victory in the Japan Series, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> {{to the efforts of}} star slugger Randy Bass (presently State Senator from Oklahoma), an American playing for the team.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, Morgan {{was ranked}} by Time as the top-paid American women's soccer player <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to her {{numerous}} endorsement deals. Morgan, along with Canada's Christine Sinclair and Australia's Steph Catley, {{became the first}} women's soccer players {{to appear on the}} cover of FIFA video games in 2015. She appeared alongside Lionel Messi on covers of FIFA 16 sold in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, Forbes named PewDiePie as the highest-earning YouTuber {{with his}} annual income {{reaching}} $15 million. This is up 20% from 2015, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to his YouTube Red series Scare PewDiePie and his book This Book Loves You, which sold over 112,000 copies according to Nielsen Bookscan.|$|E
5|$|International {{trade in}} the Caribbean queen conch is {{regulated}} under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) agreement, {{in which it is}} listed as Strombus gigas. This species is not endangered in the Caribbean as a whole, but is commercially threatened in numerous areas, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to extreme overfishing.|$|E

50|$|Transfusions of {{platelets}} are comparatively {{far less}} numerous, but they present unique storage/management issues. Platelets {{may only be}} stored for 7 days, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> to their greater potential for contamination, which is in turn <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> to a higher storage temperature.|$|R

5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the northeastern United States, the {{population}} of Massachusetts has continued to grow in the past few decades. Massachusetts is the fastest growing state in New England and the 25th fastest growing state in the United States. Population growth was <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to a relatively high quality of life and a large higher education system in the state.|$|E
5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} a reduced quality of life, and people with the condition incur increased healthcare costs, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to hospital admissions including observation and treatment on intensive care units. OHS often occurs together with several other disabling medical conditions, such as asthma (in 18–24%) and type 2 diabetes (in 30–32%). Its main complication of heart failure affects 21–32% of patients.|$|E
5|$|Pinon and Ron Perlman {{were cast}} by Alien: Resurrection {{director}} Jean-Pierre Jeunet <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to the director's practice of casting recurring collaborators in unconventional, marginal roles. In Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction, Teresa Rizzo explores Alien: Resurrection hybridization theme; the dynamic between Vriess and his wheelchair share a synergy {{of flesh and}} prosthetic with Number 8 and her Alien composition.|$|E
30|$|The {{increasing}} role {{of energy}} efficiency {{as a catalyst}} for sustainable development is realism in the industrialized countries of the world. In Nigeria, the story is different at the moment as the huge benefits derivable from adoption of energy efficiency and conservation measures by various economic sectors remain <b>largely</b> untapped <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> to lack of awareness of the economic and social benefits of energy efficiency measures [8].|$|R

5|$|Severely {{threatened}} by the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in England and Wales, the breed has survived due to the intent to preserve this unique animal as {{a crucial part of}} traditional Lakeland agriculture. Still far fewer in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to farming subsidies and the aid of the British National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s mobile devices {{have become more}} widely available, {{advancing}} beyond simple communication devices, and {{have been found to}} be rich forms of information, even for crime not traditionally associated with digital forensics. Despite this, digital analysis of phones has lagged behind traditional computer media, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to problems over the proprietary nature of devices.|$|E
5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, {{from green}} to brown, grey or red. This {{variation}} has a genetic component, but is <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> to local environmental factors. In particular, individuals which delay moulting become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are {{stronger and more}} aggressive, but are less tolerant of environmental stresses, such as low salinity or hypoxia. Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning than adults.|$|E
