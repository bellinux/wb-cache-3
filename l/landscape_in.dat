5|$|North of Alma, US127 turns due north {{again and}} crosses into Isabella County. It runs near {{the campus of}} Central Michigan University, {{crossing}} the Chippewa River in Mount Pleasant.

US127 in Mount Pleasant is marked by residential neighborhoods; the location of the M-20 interchange has some commercial properties, however. Otherwise, the <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> Isabella County is mostly farms adjacent to the freeway.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{may have}} been {{intended}} as a pendant to a sixteenth-century Venetian painting of a recumbent Venus (which seems to have begun life as a Danaë) in a <b>landscape,</b> <b>in</b> the same pose, but seen from the front. The two were certainly hung together {{for many years in}} Spain when in the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{country has}} two {{national}} parks. Cairngorms National Park includes the largest area of arctic mountain <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> the UK. Sites designated as {{of importance to}} natural heritage take up 39% of the land area, two thirds of which are of Europe-wide importance. Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park includes Britain's largest body of freshwater, the mountains of Breadalbane and the sea lochs of Argyll.|$|E

30|$|Thus, the {{prevailing}} views regarding the ‘typical’ natural <b>landscapes</b> <b>in</b> Russia and Japan, and the fundamental differences between them, do not adequately reflect the diverse natural features of both countries. Such views could {{be attributable to}} the fact that mass media and literature tend to pay special attention to the flat landscapes of the Central European part of Russia and the limited number of famous mountainous <b>landscapes</b> <b>in</b> central and southern Japan; meanwhile, other <b>landscapes</b> <b>in</b> both countries remain practically unknown to the larger population. We hope our study will help to remedy this gap.|$|R
5|$|The {{final section}} of the path was {{designated}} as a National Trail in 1978. Many of the landscapes which the South West Coast Path crosses have special status, either as a National Park {{or one of the}} Heritage Coasts. The path passes through two World Heritage Sites: the Dorset and East Devon Coast, known as the Jurassic Coast, was designated in 2001, and the Cornwall and West Devon Mining <b>Landscape</b> <b>in</b> 2007.|$|E
5|$|The red poppies that McCrae {{referred}} to had {{been associated with}} conflict since the Napoleonic Wars when a writer of that time first noted how the poppies grew over the graves of soldiers. The damage done to the <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> Flanders during the battle greatly increased the lime content in the surface soil, leaving the poppy {{as one of the}} few plants able to grow in the region.|$|E
5|$|The soils of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that {{is typical of the}} southwest of Scotland. There is a mixture of boulder clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a machair <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> places, inland from the sandy bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E

5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} northward, US31 intersects {{the western end}} of M-20 in New Era in Oceana County. The <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> this area is dominated by forest land as the trunkline crosses the Hart-Montague Trail State Park, a linear state park that follows a bike trail in the area. North of the trail crossing, US31 has a business spur for Hart that runs east into that town; north of this interchange, the freeway crosses the Pentwater River near the community of Pentwater which also has its own business loop.|$|E
5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E
5|$|Greek life at UVA began a {{few decades}} after the school's {{establishment}} in 1819. Before this time social life at the university was fixed around debating societies; the now-defunct Patrick Henry Society, for instance, initially had a membership nearly equal {{to the size of}} the student body. In the 1850s the first fraternities began to appear and assumed a significant role in the student body's social <b>landscape.</b> <b>In</b> the following decades, the university became the birthplace of two national fraternities and saw many more fraternity chapters chartered. The twentieth century saw the system expand even more to include professional fraternities, social sororities, local fraternities, and black fraternities and sororities. Moving into the 2000s, several new social Greek organizations were founded, and multicultural organizations began to rise to prominence.|$|E

5|$|M-83 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan primarily {{serving as a}} link between Interstate75/US Highway23 (I-75/US23) in Birch Run, including a short east–west section with M-54, and the Bavarian-themed town of Frankenmuth. M-83 is primarily a north–south trunkline that passes by such landmarks as Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, Zehnder's and the Bavarian Inn before leaving town. The <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> {{the remainder of the}} area is composed of farm fields between Frankenmuth and the northern terminus at M-15 near Richville.|$|E
5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in the canopy of trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E
5|$|The Beaver Mill Lumber Company {{became one}} of the largest single lumber {{operations}} in all of Pennsylvania, and four lumber boomtowns, Beaver Mills, Star Mill, Underwood Mills, and Antes, altered the <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> the Black Moshannon area. A dam was built at the site of an old beaver dam, and the mill ponds for the lumber mills flooded the old beaver ponds. The communities featured general stores, blacksmith shops, liveries, taverns, schools, and even a ten-pin bowling alley. The area helped to meet the nation's need for timber in mining operations, construction, and railroads.|$|E

5|$|The English {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Darby Creek watershed due to the proximity to trading routes and productive <b>landscape.</b> <b>In</b> 1777, British soldiers breached dikes and floodwalls that were constructed on the creek. The Pennsylvania legislature passed an act in 1788 that mandated a maintenance of the dikes and the mowing of plants such as elderberries and pokeweed three times a year. Early English colonists utilized Darby Creek {{as a source of}} water power. Lumber, grist, and textile mills were established {{along the banks of the}} creek. Most of these mills have been demolished, although some of the tenement structures are currently in use as housing. At the end of the 19th century, industrial advances such as engine-driven machinery had made these mills obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked very hard on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the <b>landscape</b> <b>in</b> lead pencil, then {{to put in the}} shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed at lower right) by a variety of engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortification}} of Castle Rising {{was constructed}} in a carefully designed <b>landscape.</b> <b>In</b> front of the castle was the town of Castle Rising, moved to its new site when the castle was built. The settlement {{appears to have been}} laid out to a grid-plan design, possibly bounded by ditches; with the castle positioned just behind it, in a similar fashion to that at New Buckenham and Malton Castle. A dovecot and a religious house were founded nearby; both of these were important symbols of lordship at the time, and were considered essential parts of a properly established castle.|$|E
