40|$|XX Central {{vestibular}} neurons process head movement-related signals. Characterization {{of these}} neurons {{and the knowledge}} about their connectivity is crucial to confer them a particular role in gaze and posture stabilization. Different aspects of the sensory-motor transformation were studied in vestibular neurons recorded from isolated brain preparations of adult frogs. The preparation includes the N. VIII with its individual <b>labyrinthine</b> <b>nerve</b> branches. XX Vestibular neurons subdivide into tonic and phasic neurons based on differential intrinsic membrane properties and might be suited to process different dynamic components of vestibular signals. Intracellular injections of oscillatory frequency-modulated currents showed that tonic neurons form neuronal elements with low-pass filter properties. In contrast, phasic neurons exhibited a pronounced subthreshold resonance at ∼ 40 Hz due to the activation of prominent potassium conductances, which conferred to these neurons band-pass filter-like properties. In addition, the different filter behaviors of the two neuronal subtypes correlate with a differential processing of synaptic sensory inputs that renders tonic neurons well-suited for synaptic integration and phasic neurons for signal detection. XX The different response dynamics of labyrinthine synaptic inputs in tonic and phasic vestibula...|$|E
40|$|Summary: In two {{patients}} with surgically proved CSF fis-tula through {{the facial nerve}} canal, MR and CT exami-nations showed smooth enlargement of the geniculate fossa with CSF signal. In the clinical setting of CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea, {{the presence of an}} enlarged <b>labyrinthine</b> facial <b>nerve</b> canal and enlarged geniculate fossa on CT scans and CSF intensity on MR images strongly suggests a CSF fistula through the facial nerve canal. Spontaneous CSF fistulas from the subarachnoid space into the middle ear cavity rarely occur via the proximal facial nerve canal (1, 2). Gacek and Leipzig detailed such a case in 1979, accompanied by sur-gical findings, illustrative drawings, and histopatho-logic sections (1). In 1983, Phelps briefly described a similar case in which he filled an arachnoid sac in the region of the geniculate fossa with intrathecal io-phendylate (2). However, this route of CSF fistula is not widely known, because few, if any, additional cases have been reported subsequently (3). We report two such recent cases, both diagnosed on high-reso-lution CT scans and confirmed at surgery...|$|R
40|$|Normal {{vestibular}} end organs {{generate an}} equal resting-firing {{frequency of the}} axons, {{which is the same}} on both sides under static conditions. An acute unilateral vestibulopathy leads to a vestibular tone imbalance. Acute unilateral vestibulopathy is defined by the patient history and the clinical examination and, in unclear cases, laboratory examinations. Key signs and symptoms are an acute onset of spinning vertigo, postural imbalance and nausea as well as a horizontal rotatory nystagmus beating towards the non-affected side, a pathological head-impulse test and no evidence for central vestibular or ocular motor dysfunction. The so-called big five allow a differentiation between a peripheral and central lesion by the bedside examination. The differential diagnosis of peripheral <b>labyrinthine</b> and vestibular <b>nerve</b> disorders mimicking acute unilateral vestibulopathy includes central vestibular disorders, in particular "vestibular pseudoneuritis" and other peripheral vestibular disorders, such as beginning Menière's disease. The management of acute unilateral vestibulopathy involves (1) symptomatic treatment with antivertiginous drugs, (2) causal treatment with corticosteroids, and (3) physical therapy...|$|R
