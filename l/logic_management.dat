40|$|Many {{scholars}} have described organization form as a management {{tool in the}} alignment of organization and environment. As the environment of many companies becomes more chaotic, the exploration of organization forms characterized by flexibility and adaptability has been intensifying. When reviewing existing literature on new organization forms, several gaps become apparent. These gaps {{can be traced back}} to the artificial separation between the macrolevel and the firm level of analysis and the prevalence of a static notion of form. To contribute to a more encompassing theory of new organization forms, a coevolutionary perspective is suggested. In this perspective, contextual variation of macrolevel <b>management</b> <b>logics</b> is proposed as a key mediator in the coevolution of organization and environment. At the firm level, the contextual variation of <b>management</b> <b>logics</b> is reflected in shared managerial schemas underlying strategic design actions. The resulting coevolutionary model shows how contextual applications of <b>management</b> <b>logics</b> may be a source of variation in new organization forms. On the basis of a literature review, three <b>management</b> <b>logics,</b> representing ideal types, are described: classical <b>management</b> <b>logic,</b> modern <b>management</b> <b>logic,</b> and postindustrial <b>management</b> <b>logic.</b> These logics are related to three levers of design actions which reflect fundamentally different interventions in form.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to point out a {{research}} agenda for Management Accounting under the emergent Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic. S-D Logic is widely discussed {{in the field of}} Marketing, the paper tries to extend S-D Logic in the Management Accounting context and develops some related considerations. Methodology/approach – Service related change in economy and firms raises new challenging issues in management accounting topics such as cost classification, cost structure, cost object, the role of “traditional” accounting tools and models, price-cost relations for pricing decisions. In this paper, we identify several critical research questions that address a tentative research agenda in the field of management accounting to better explore its role within service science. Throughout the paper many different examples are provided in order to support what is sustained. Findings – The conclusions of the paper trace some aspects addressed as core in the distinction between Goods-Dominant Accounting and Service-Dominant Accounting. Considering the new changing service environment, the role of management accounting in providing information to support managerial decision making and control can be widely renewed. Research implications – The paper opens many underexplored topics on Management accounting in the interface with service and traces a research agenda for further research. Originality/value – This is the first paper, after the brief overview on accounting and Service Science provided by Kerr (2008), aiming at understanding the role of Management accounting in the context of S-D Logic.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{services}} in every socio-economic context {{and on the}} global scene has led to increased interaction at all levels since services are based upon networks and systems that involve all interested actors; this indeed is applicable in business and social life, affecting every sector such as trade, finance, health, education, entertainment, transport, goods production and so on. Such scenario has challenged traditional production and managerial theories and models and consequently has stimulated service research to redesign the scientific approach to service management, and, to some extent, to business management and marketing. From the fordist approach to production design and management characterizing industrial and management research of the past, new theories are characterizing global research trying to address complexity, networks and service; these emerging theories, indeed, seem to be coherent with nowadays social and business interactions. These new scientific proposals have originated a new research movement, firstly stimulated by industry, then followed by academia, characterized by the study of service: this was the born and rise of Service Science, {{with the emergence of}} service systems (economic, managerial, organizational, technological) and the logic related to Service strongly linked to the concepts of co-creation, value networks, innovation and ICT applications. However, the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary character of the transition to service economy makes it inherently difficult to define a new kind of discipline, due to its cross-cutting and unifying traits; there are important debates worldwide on how to describe this transition and the consequent implications of the various characterizations both for basic research and for applied research. For this reason researchers are discussing worldwide and the main focus today is to diffuse the emerging concepts, trying to draw future research trends that may support a better understanding of service and today business interactions. In this contribution there is an attempt to introduce recent trends in service research, with particular focus to Service Science, in order to promote and diffuse worldwide its basilar scientific pillars and its scientific goals. With this aim the article starts with an introduction presenting the growing relevance of Service, continues on a deepening of the origins of Service Science in particular highlighting its numerous scientific domains and multidisciplinary perspective, suggesting its inferences upon theory and models of management and marketing disciplines.

H 577 P BSE 2014 MakSince {{the energy}} crisis {{occurred}} in 1973, the issue of energy use became the first priority for engineers and researchers to tackle this problem. In the recent two decades, ozone depletion and global warming have become two critical issues that affecting our global environment. Starting from 1990 s, the Hong Kong government has been concerning about the energy use in air-conditioning systems within buildings. The government launched code of practice and guidelines for energy efficiency of air conditioning installations as well as guidelines on energy audit. Nonetheless, they were voluntary base which did not incentive to the building owners to follow. Until 2012, the government turned the codes and guidelines with some modifications into Building Energy Efficiency Ordinance under Chapter 610 that all building services engineers and building owners shall follow the regulation. Nevertheless, some statements regarding the issue of assessing the energy performance of the centralized air-conditioning system within buildings and recommendations on optimizing the control for chiller plant are still vague. In addition, when assessing the energy performance of the chiller plant, inadequate and invalid building information and operating data were discovered in most of buildings in Hong Kong. Notwithstanding, building energy performance or chiller performances are traditionally investigated by engineering modeling especially in the striking of the optimum point, this approach may be very successful in research level, whether it is laboratory based or simulation based. All through the past decades, there exist no successful optimization protocols in real building. This thesis presents a protocol for assessing and optimizing individual chillers within building with supplementing the deficiency of the codes addressed by the Hong Kong government. This research starts {{with the concept of}} data mining with two approaches: (a) preliminary building energy performance assessment; and (b) detailed chiller performance assessment. For preliminary building energy performance assessment, the energy signature for building performance analysis based on statistical model is discussed. Using this technique, the applications of the energy signature for 20 surveyed buildings are studied. Through this analysis, the effects of the outdoor environment conditions on the building energy consumption especially the air-conditioning system for different types of functional use can be investigated. Furthermore, the survey on the availability of essential building information for establishing the building energy signature is also presented. Apart from using statistical modeling approach, a dissection of building energy consumption using engineering mode ling approach in order to simulate the building energy performance for a selected commercial building is also highlighted. The results are the annual building electricity consumption breakdown, the effects of the climatic variable (To 2 and ToWo) on the building electricity consumption together with the degradations of the equipment of the centralized chiller plant within building. For detailed chiller performance assessment, a modified refrigerant model for simulating the thermal-dynamic characteristic of R 134 a is firstly presented. The accuracy of this model is significantly high when comparing the laboratory data. Secondly, a data management protocol with 5 steps (including data acquisition, data synchronization, data conditioning, range validity conditioning and uncertainty analysis) {{in order to deal with}} the typical problems (i. e. due to data acquisition or sensor errors etc.) occurred in BMS is introduced. This protocol is a prior procedure that facilitates the next step for individual chiller performance assessment and optimization. Two chiller plants are selected for the study. Lastly, the Heuristic-Engineering-Statistical (HES) approach is developed in this study It innovates this practice in two ways. On one hand, this study tries to identify low optimization operation zones (operating conditions) of chillers instead of highly optimized operating point or zones where the operating conditions are usually cannot be matched in real life operation, and converts these low optimized conditions into more optimized operating conditions. On the other hand, this study takes every site collected performance conditions as the operating settings in an experiment. At the completion of one annual cycle, the chiller can be thought of going through all most likely operating conditions in the building. This approach is then more realistic and applicable in the building. The HES model is then self-validated by the true operation of the chiller. An integrated solution for individual chiller optimization involved the comprehensive working procedures. Therefore, a chiller server (electronic web-based integrated analysis scheme) for individual chiller performance optimization is established and demonstrated in this research project which is comprised of the data <b>logic</b> <b>management</b> protocol and the HES approach for individual chiller performance assessment and optimization. This chiller server is welcome by the industry and is expected to innovate the method for individual chiller performance analysis and optimization. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.

40|$|Summary An {{emerging}} marketing <b>management</b> <b>logic</b> {{proposes a}} new perspective on service activities, which previously have been subject to a biased goods-dominant logic. According to this new logic, customers always are co-producers of services and co-creators of value, not simple marketing targets, because they mobilize knowledge and other resources in the service process that affect the success of a value proposition. This article explores this key proposition, analyzing service co-production and value co-creation phenomena in the business-to-business segment and focusing on the case of service-oriented architecture (SOA) with an in-depth, qualitative analysis of two firms pioneering the implementation of SOA solutions.

40|$|The {{primary concern}} {{in this paper}} is to {{understand}} how reforms, characterized by New Public Management, NPM, affect management in hospitals. This would be considered in the light of theories of management where the term "hybrid" management is central. This term indicates a combination of management forms which "normally" do not belong together. I also apply neo-institutional theory where institutional logics are essential. The institutional logics are socially constructed patterns of cultural symbols and material practices which contribute towards meaning to daily activities for individuals and organizations. In light of profession theory professionalism is emphasized together with the professional relationship with management. I follow up how new guidelines affect management in hospitals. Research Question: How has hospital management changed after the meeting with NPM-reforms? How is management affecte whe institutional framewor condition fo organizin changes and new <b>logics</b> for <b>management</b> are introduced? Is management hybridized? How are the leading roles of doctors and nurses changed as a result of new institutional instructions? Are the leading role getting more characterized by hybrid management? The empirical material in the study is obtained from a qualitative study with interviews and observations of Norwegian and German hospital leaders. In addition, reviews of secondary and tertiary data are carried out. This has resulted in three separate articles that describe different aspects of the issue. The introductory part also sheds light on the main research question as a separate contribution. In the first approach, I examine how changes in the organization and the introduction of <b>management</b> <b>logic</b> affect an organization that previously has been dominated by professional <b>logics</b> in <b>management.</b> Through the comparison with Germany {{it turns out that the}} way management is organized and what management applications dominate has an impact on how management is practiced and understood. In Norway where there have been reforms that have introduced unitary management, as well as organizational changes with the introduction of divisional structure, management has changed. Doctors and nurses have acquired a more coherent focus on leadership. In Germany, there have not been direct management reforms, but reforms which indirectly affect management through greater emphasis on economy and increased competition. The organization of management, therefore, has not changed. When doctors lead their own profession, as seen in Germany, management is related to the organization of physician’s professional work. The equivalent is discovered amongst nurses. When doctors have unitary management positions, as can be seen in Norway, the focus of management is expanded. Corresponding findings are reported amongst Norwegian nurses. On the basis of this, I consider the German nurses and doctors in management positions as professional managers, while the Norwegians have taken a management role, but not in its pure form. I consider management in the Norwegian context as a hybrid of different types of logics. The introduction of NPM reforms have led to greater demands for planning and documenting, which have contributed to increased bureaucracy. The leaders are consequently, also characterized by a neo-bureaucratic logic. In the second approach I examine how new institutional framework conditions set out to change the management role for doctors and nurses in Norway. The introduction of unitary management has not displaced the professional <b>logic</b> of <b>management,</b> but the professional logic has changed and become something else. The professional focus extends from organizing, maintenance and development of their own profession, to include other groups they are responsible for. The focus of professional management is expanded and I have grouped this development in three; 1) the leaders’ focus on the professional development of both treatment and care, 2) maintenance and development of the competence of related staff in the unit and 3) concern of attention to quality at the system level (procedure development, discrepancy reports, complaints, etc.). The leaders have a unitary focus on management and the professional <b>logic</b> of <b>management</b> has been extended for both professional groups in the study. This can be attributed to competition for management positions amongst doctors and nurses. Both professional groups include management after the guidelines set out through the reforms to be able to participate in the contest. Due to the increasing level of academic knowledge in nursing, doctors and nurses can to a greater extent both cooperate and compete for management positions in Norwegian hospitals. The Norwegian managers are further concerned with the relational aspects of leadership. Leadership is acting as a catalyst that makes it possible to deal with the complexity of <b>logics</b> in <b>management.</b> On the background of the logics that distinguish the Norwegian and German managers, I conclude that German leaders have not changed focus after the reforms and are considered as professional managers. After the reforms with the introduction of management and structural changes with the introduction of divisional organization, management has changed in Norway. The leaders have taken on a hybrid management role. This is called a “multiprofessional management role” as an expression of multiple <b>logics.</b> The <b>management</b> <b>logic</b> is supplemented by professional logics and neo-bureaucratic logic. Leadership influences on the conduct and coordination of these logics. </p...|$|R
