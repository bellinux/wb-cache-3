6000|$|Lady Merrifield {{drew the}} little girl into her own room, stooped down, and kissed her, saying, 'My dear child, these things need {{a great deal of}} patience. You will have to be doubly kind and forbearing now, for she must be very unhappy, and perhaps not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it. <b>You</b> might say a little prayer for her, that God will help us to be kind to her, and soften her heart.' ...|$|R

"I am {{not sure}} that he has one; but I possess a very fine {{portrait}} of him, in oils, by a good artist, which, I hope, will belong to your brother some day, for I do not wish to live for ever, Miss Eden.

6000|$|This little {{innocent}} {{touch of}} natural taste did not please the elder sister at the moment, {{and she did}} not scruple to betray it.

[...] "Hurry is not the handsomest mortal in the world, by many; and there are officers in the garrisons--" [...] Judith stammered at the words--"there are officers in the garrisons, near us, far comelier than he. But why do you think me the equal of Deerslayer--speak of that, for I do not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear <b>you</b> <b>show</b> so much admiration of a man like Hurry Harry, who has neither feelings, manners, nor conscience. You are too good for him, and he ought to be told it, at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|As I grew up, and {{was allowed}} more liberty, I went {{every year to}} {{pay a visit to}} my uncle's court, and usually stayed there about two months. In this way my cousin and I became very intimate, and were much {{attached}} to each other. The very last time I saw him he seemed more delighted to see me than ever, and gave a great feast in my honour. When we had finished eating, he said to me, [...] "My cousin, you would never guess what I have been doing since your last visit to us! Directly after your departure I set a number of men to work on a building after my own design. It is now completed, and ready to be lived in. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but you must first swear two things: to be faithful to me, and to keep my secret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see, Lolly {{wants you}} for effect!' he said, sneeringly. 'But {{you are always}} welcome, Cilly; we are woefully slow when you ain't there to keep us going, and I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> a thing or two. I only did not ask you, because I thought you had not hit it off with Rashe, or have you made it up?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the meantime, Mr. Pratt," [...] the {{physician}} enquired, replacing his watch in his waistcoat pocket, [...] "can I {{be of any}} service to you? Your brother is a personal friend of mine {{as well as a}} patient, and I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> any attention agreeable to you. Would you care, for instance, to see over one of our big hospitals?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do just as {{you please}} about going away," [...] he said; [...] "but I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> the sights of my city and to {{entertain}} your party while you are here. We feel highly honored to have little Dorothy with us, I assure you, and we appreciate her kindness in making us a visit. For whatever country Dorothy visits is sure to become famous." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was just}} when this {{important}} question {{was decided that}} the Baron of Bradwardine, with a careful and yet important expression of countenance, joined the two young men. He descended from his reeking charger, the care of which he recommended {{to one of his}} grooms. 'I seldom ban, sir,' said he to the man; 'but if you play any of your hound's-foot tricks, and leave puir Berwick before he's sorted, to rin after spuilzie, deil be wi' me if I do not give your craig a thraw.' He then stroked with great complacency the animal which had borne him through the fatigues of the day, and having taken a tender leave of him--' Weel, my good young friends, a glorious and decisive victory,' said he; 'but these loons of troopers fled ower soon. I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> the true points of the pralium equestre, or equestrian combat, whilk their cowardice has postponed, and which I hold to be the pride and terror of warfare. Weel--I have fought once more in this old quarrel, though I admit I could not be so far BEN as you lads, being that it was my point of duty to keep together our handful of horse. And no cavalier ought in any wise to begrudge honour that befalls his companions, even though they are ordered upon thrice his danger, whilk, another time, by the blessing of God, may be his own case. But, Glennaquoich, and you, Mr. Waverley, I pray ye to give me your best advice on a matter of mickle weight, and which deeply affects the honour of the house of Bradwardine. I crave your pardon, Ensign Maccombich, and yours, Inveraughlin, and yours, Edderalshendrach, and yours, sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've said it, little sister.... Say, gee! {{you don't}} {{know what a}} luxury {{it is for me}} to talk about books and {{literature}} with an educated, cultured girl like you. Now take the rest of these people here at the farm--nice folks, you understand, mighty well-traveled, broad-gauged, intelligent folks, and all that. There's a Mr. and Mrs. Cannon; he's some kind of an executive in the Chicago stock-yards--nice, fat, responsible job. And he was saying to me, 'Mr. Schwirtz,' he says, 'Mrs. C. and I had never been to New England till this summer, but we'd toured every other part of the country, and we've done Europe thoroughly and put in a month doing Florida, and now,' he says, 'I think we can say we've seen every point of interest that's worth an American's time.' They're good American people like that, well-traveled and nice folks. But books--Lord! they can't talk about books no more than a Jersey City bartender. So you can imagine how pleased I was to find you here.... World's pretty small, all right. Say, I just got here yesterday, so I suppose we'll be here about the same length o' time. If you wouldn't think I was presumptuous, I'd <b>like</b> mighty well <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> some of the country around here. We could get up a picnic party, ten or a dozen of us, and go up on Bald Knob and see the scenery and have a real jolly time. And I'd be glad to take you down to Lesterhampton--there's a real old-fashioned inn down there, they say, where Paul Revere stayed one time; they say you can get the best kind of fried chicken and corn on cob and real old-fashioned New England blueberry pie. Would you like to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And you young people, {{who have}} no {{authority}} over anyone, but over your own bodies; to whom the Lord has given {{little or nothing to}} manage and take care of except your own health and strength--do not let the devil tempt you to believe that that health and strength is your own property, to do what you like with. It belongs to the Lord who died for you, and He will require an account from you how you have used it. Do not let the devil tempt you to believe that the Lord delays His coming to you--that you may do what you like now, in the prime of your years, and that it will be time enough to think about God and religion when God visits you with cares, and sickness, and old age. That is the fancy of too many; but it will surely {{turn out to be a}} mistake. Those who misuse their youth, and health, and strength, in tyrannising over those who are weaker than themselves, and laughing at those who are not as clever as themselves, and eating and drinking with the drunken--the Lord will come to them in an hour when they are not aware, and cut them asunder, in some way or other, by loss of work, or poverty, or sickness, or doubt and confusion, and bitter shame and perplexity of mind; till they find out, poor things, that they have been living like the unbelievers all their youth, without God in the world, while God's love and God's teaching, and God's happiness was ready for them; and have to go back again to their Father and their Lord, and cry: [...] "Father, we have sinned against heaven and before Thee, and are no more worthy to be called Thy children!" [...] Oh, you who have been fancying that the Lord was gone far away, and that you had a right to do what you liked with the powers which He has given you, go back to Him, now at once, and confess that you, and all belonging to you, belong to Him, and ask Him to teach you how to use it aright. Ask Him to teach you how to please Him with it, and not yourselves only. Ask Him to teach you how to do good to all around you, and not merely to do what <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> Ask Him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how <b>to</b> do your duty to Him, and to your neighbours, for whom He died on the cross, in that station of life to which He has called <b>you.</b> Ask Him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how <b>to</b> use your property, your knowledge, your business, your strength, your health, so that you may be a blessing and a help to those whom He blesses and helps, and who, He wishes, should bless and help each other. Go back to Him at once, my friends. You will not have far to go, seeing that He is now even among us here hearing my clumsy words; and I do hope, and trust, and pray, bringing them home to some of your hearts with that spirit and power of His, which is like a two-edged sword, piercing to the very depths of a man's heart, and showing him how ugly it is--and how noble the Lord will make it, if he will but repent and pray to Him who never cast out any that came to Him.|$|R
