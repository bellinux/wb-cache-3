50|$|Latch and Batchelor: Founded by Mr Arthur Latch, Mr Telford Clarence Batchelor and Mr Henry Herbert Horsfall {{to develop}} Mr Batchelor’s patent of <b>Locked</b> <b>Coil</b> Wire Rope and Flattened Strand, it {{was formed in}} 1884 on part of the Hay Mills site owned at that time by Webster and Horsfall Ltd. Due to its smooth outer layer <b>Locked</b> <b>Coil</b> became {{increasing}} popular with its use in aerial ropeways and its unexpected yet excellent non-spinning properties and high breaking-strength-to-weight ratio were recognized by the mining industry and adopted worldwide. <b>Locked</b> <b>Coil</b> development continued {{with the advent of}} the half-lock Colliery Guide ropes and more use being made of galvanized wires. The company was one of the first to come under direct Government control in both World Wars. In the 1914-18 war they were the sole manufacturer of shell fuse spring wire, for example, producing 80,260 miles, along with anti-submarine netting, mine, aircraft and balloon cables.|$|E

For the first time, the Discovery is based around Land Rover's aluminium architecture, first introduced on the Range Rover (L405). The use of aluminium chassis and body panels gives a weight loss {{of up to}} 480 kg over its predecessor. This weight loss combined with a new aerodynamic design, achieves a fuel efficiency improvement over previous Discovery generations. The new Discovery is offered {{with a combination of}} V6 petrol and diesel engines. All Discovery 5's are equipped with a standard 8 speed automatic transmission. An available option package adds a two speed transfer case (low range gearbox) and the option of an actively <b>locking</b> rear differential. <b>Coil</b> springs are now standard on base trim models, while air suspension is still offered as an option.|$|R

50|$|Spiral strand is {{slightly}} weaker than <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> strand. Steel spiral strand cables have a Young's modulus, E of 150±10 kN/mm² (or 150±10 GPa) {{and come in}} sizes from 3 to 90 mm diameter. Spiral strand suffers from construction stretch, where the strands compact when the cable is loaded. This is normally removed by pre-stretching the cable and cycling the load up and down to 45% of the ultimate tensile load.|$|E
40|$|Attaining {{the highest}} {{performance}} in poloidally diverted tokamaks requires resonant magnetic perturbation coils to avoid core instabilities (locked, resistive wall and neoclassical tearing modes). These coils also perturb the pedestal and edge region, causing varying degrees of stochasticity with remnant islands. The effects of the DIII-D <b>locked</b> mode control <b>coil</b> on the edge and core of Ohmic plasmas are modeled with the field line integration code TRIP 3 D and compared with experimental measurements. Without detailed profile analysis and field line integration, {{it is difficult to}} establish whether a given response is due to a ''core mode'' or an ''edge stochastic boundary. '' In diverted Ohmic plasmas, the boundary stochastic layer displays many characteristics associated with such layers in non-diverted tokamaks. Comparison with stochastic boundary results from non-diverted tokamaks indicates that a significant difference in diverted tokamaks is a ''focusing'' of the magnetic field line loss into the vicinity of the divertor...|$|R
5000|$|The omoplata (referred to in judo as ashi-sankaku-garami, 三角緘, [...] "triangular entanglement" [...] and in catch wrestling as <b>coil</b> <b>lock)</b> {{is also a}} {{commonly}} featured shoulder lock in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The locking mechanism {{is similar to the}} kimura lock, but instead of using a figure-four, it is applied using a leg. The omoplata can be applied from the guard, by placing one leg under the opponent's armpit and turning 180 degrees in the direction of that leg, so that the leg moves {{over the back of the}} opponent and entangles the opponent's arm. By controlling the opponent's body and pushing the arm perpendicularly away from the opponent's back, pressure can be put on the opponent's shoulder. It is also possible to put pressure on the elbow joint by bending the leg entangling the arm, and twisting it in a specific manner. In order to secure the opponent and prevent him from rolling out of the lock, the inner arm can be thrown over the opponent's waist as a [...] "seatbelt" [...] securing the opponent. Though an effective lock, it is more difficult than other armlocks to successfully apply. The technique called a monoplata is a similar armlock that resembles jūji-gatame or spiderweb position yet has a mechanism like an omoplata.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{a feeble}} light began to pierce the darkness, and I {{perceived}} that I {{stood on the}} lowest step of a staircase, vast as {{the foot of a}} mountain. Behind me were thousands of steps of lurid iron; before me, nothing but a void--an abyss, and ether; the blue gloom of midnight beneath my feet, as above my head. I became delirious, and quitting that staircase, which methought it was impossible for me to reascend, I sprung forth into the void with an execration. But, immediately, when I had uttered the curse, the void began to be filled with forms and colors, and I presently perceived that I was in a vast gallery, along which I advanced, trembling. There was still darkness round me; but the hollows of the vaults gleamed with a red light, and showed me the strange and hideous forms of their building..... I did not distinguish the nearest objects; but those towards which I advanced assumed an appearance more and more ominous, and my terror increased with every step I took. The enormous pillars which supported the vault, and the tracery thereof itself, were figures of men, of supernatural stature, delivered to tortures without a name. Some hung by their feet, and, <b>locked</b> in the <b>coils</b> of monstrous serpents, clenched their teeth in the marble of the pavement; others, fastened by their waists, were dragged upwards, these by their feet, those by their heads, towards capitals, where other figures stooped towards them, eager to torment them. Other pillars, again, represented a struggling mass of figures devouring one another; each of which only offered a trunk severed to the knees or to the shoulders, the fierce heads whereof retained life enough to seize and devour that which was near them. There were some who, half hanging down, agonized themselves by attempting, with their upper limbs, to flay the lower moiety of their bodies, which drooped from the columns, or were attached to the pedestals; and others, who, in their fight with each other, were dragged along by morsels of flesh,--grasping which, they clung to each other with a countenance of unspeakable hate and agony. Along, or rather in place of, the frieze, there were on either side a range of unclean beings, wearing the human form, but of a loathsome ugliness, busied in tearing human corpses to pieces--in feasting upon their limbs and entrails. From the vault, instead of bosses and pendants, hung the crushed and wounded forms of children; as if to escape these eaters of man's flesh, they would throw themselves downwards, and be dashed to pieces on the pavement..... The silence and motionlessness of the whole added to its awfulness. I became so faint with terror, that I stopped, and would fain have returned. But at that moment I heard, from the depths of the gloom through which I had passed, confused noises, like those of a multitude on its march. And the sounds soon became more distinct, and the clamor fiercer, and the steps came hurrying on tumultuously--at every new burst nearer, more violent, more threatening. I thought that I was pursued by this disorderly crowd; and I strove to advance, hurrying into the midst of those dismal sculptures. Then it seemed as if those figures began to heave,--and to sweat blood,--and their beady eyes to move in their sockets. At once I beheld that they were all looking upon me, that they were all leaning towards me,--some with frightful derision, others with furious aversion. Every arm was raised against me, and they made as though they would crush me with the quivering limbs they had torn one from the other."....|$|R

50|$|In principle, spiral ropes are round strands as {{they have}} an {{assembly}} of layers of wires laid helically over a centre {{with at least one}} layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer. Spiral ropes can be dimensioned {{in such a way that}} they are non-rotating which means that under tension the rope torque is nearly zero.The open spiral rope consists only of round wires. The half-locked coil rope and the full-locked coil rope always have a centre made of round wires. The <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> ropes have one or more outer layers of profile wires. They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The primary aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the bending behaviour of helically wound steel cables of various types (i. e. normal spiral strands, sheathed spiral strands and <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> cables) in the presence of friction and to propose more efficient computational models for their analysis under combined tension and bending. The proposed model fully takes into account interwire contact forces both in the radial direction (point contact between wires in different layers) and hoop direction (line contact within the wires in the same layer). Extensive theoretical parametric studies have been undertaken on a variety of cable constructions covering a wide range of geometrical and material parameters. Explicit formulations have been developed for the smooth transition of the bending stiffness from no-slip to full slip regimes, as a function of cable curvature. Based on these formulations, it is now possible to calculate the relative displacements of the wires, as well as the tensile, bending and hoop stresses in the individual wires of the cable. Furthermore, bending stiffness of the cable is shown to decrease by a factor of 2 to 16, depending upon the friction coefficient between wires and the type of cable construction. Wherever possible, the theoretical results have been compared with experimental results from the available literature and are found in very good agreement with them. A simple method for the determination of the bending stiffness of large diameter multi-layered cable has been developed. The simplified method is further shown to provide estimates of the bending stiffness which are very close to those calculated by the original theory, allowing hand calculations for an easier use in industry. The proposed formulations have been extended to cater for the effects of external hydrostatic pressure on sheathed spiral strands in deep water applications. These forces are shown to have a great influence on the pattern of interwire contact forces and hence the interlayer slippage between the wires in the strand. Numerical results have been obtained and analysed for three different 127 mm diameter strands with lay angles of 12 °, 18 ° and 24 ° respectively, experiencing a wide range of external hydrostatic pressures of 0 to 2, 000 metres. The significant increase in normal contact Page | iv force between wires is shown to suppress the slippage of wires in the cable. However, the no-slip and full slip values of the effective bending stiffness of the cable is shown to be independent of the level of hydrostatic pressure. A theoretical model is also proposed for estimating wire kinematics, pattern of interwire slippage, contact forces as well as the flexural rigidity of <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> cables with outer layers made of shaped wires. In order to validate this model, numerical results are reported for two different <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> cables.

40|$|Abstract. A {{combined}} approach to strength assessment of stay ropes in suspension bridges is considered. The rope working condition is analyzed by in-situ magnetic testing, computational assessment of ultimate breaking load {{and evaluation of}} residual margin of safety. The diagnostic parameters – distributed and/or local faults in wires – are used as input data for mechanical model of rope structure. The model allows calculating the stresses in each wire, simulating the degradation process and evaluating the rope breaking tensile load. The safety factor of deteriorated rope is considered as a generalized parameter that specifies the rope safe operation as an element of bridge stay arrangement. Examples of integrity analysis of stranded stay ropes and <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> stay ropes are presented...|$|E
