I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later <b>learned</b> <b>was</b> Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson <b>learned</b> <b>was</b> that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections {{are more likely}} to be based on allegations of mysticism, occultism, and even Satanism. Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although undoubtedly <b>learned,</b> <b>was</b> not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore an opinion grounded in the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.|$|E

The principles discussed in this chapter included: learning occuring within a community of practice; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> learner-centred; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> flexible and based on individual needs; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> resource-based, and technology-mediated; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> both individual, and networked; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated when new, and valued knowledge <b>is</b> created; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> cognitive, affective, social and sensory-motor; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> best supported through constructive alignment of assessment, curriculum and pedagogy; and <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> best when activities are purposeful and aligned with assessment...|$|R

He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E

Samuel Hand was a distant, intimidating figure to his son; Learned Hand later described his relations with his father as [...] "not really intimate".

The sixth of eight {{children}} in a poor family, she began playing piano {{at the age of}} three; the first song she <b>learned</b> <b>was</b> [...] "God Be With You, Till We Meet Again". Demonstrating a talent with the instrument, she performed at her local church. But her concert debut, a classical recital, was given when she was 12. Simone later said that during this performance, her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move {{to the back of the}} hall to make way for white people. She said that she refused to play until her parents were moved back to the front, and that the incident contributed to her later involvement in the civil rights movement.|$|E

[...] On August 25, 2004, {{it was announced that}} Hilary Duff, Jessica Simpson, and Ashanti had auditioned for the role of Dorothy Gale, but Ashanti had won the part. When asked about how she felt about working with the Muppets, Ashanti replied, [...] "I love children, and to me, the Muppets are just like little kids."

500|$|The Portuguese {{colony of}} Macau was also struck. While Portugal was neutral, the colony's {{government}} {{had been forced}} to accept the presence of Japanese [...] "advisers" [...] since 1943 and had traded weapons for food supplies. The main target of the raid was a stockpile of aviation fuel at the Macau Naval Aviation Center which the Allies had <b>learned</b> <b>was</b> to be sold to the Japanese. The fort of Dona Maria II was also attacked, possibly to destroy a radio station located within or near it, and some damage was inflicted on civilian areas and the city's harbor. An official court of inquiry was subsequently conducted to investigate this violation of Portugal's neutrality, and the US Government apologized for the incident. In 1950 the United States provided Portugal with a $US 20.3 million compensation payment for the damage caused to Macau's harbor on 16 January and other accidental raids on 11 and 25 June 1945.|$|E

500|$|Arnold led the American chase, {{and then}} led Poor's men {{in an attack}} on the Balcarres redoubt. [...] Balcarres had set up his {{defenses}} well, and the redoubt was held, in action so fierce that Burgoyne afterwards wrote, [...] "A more determined perseverance than they showed … is not in any officer's experience". [...] Seeing that the advance was checked, and that <b>Learned</b> <b>was</b> preparing to attack the Breymann redoubt, Arnold moved toward that action, recklessly riding between the lines and remarkably emerging unhurt. [...] He led the charge of Learned's men through the gap between the redoubts, which exposed the rear of Breymann's position, where Morgan's men had circled around from the far side. [...] In furious battle, the redoubt was taken and Breymann was killed. [...] Arnold's horse was hit in one of the final volleys, and Arnold's leg was broken by both shot and the falling horse. [...] Major Armstrong finally caught up with Arnold to officially order him back to headquarters; he was carried back in a litter.|$|E

Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were [...] "both military men – Air Force, Marines". Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War. Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would [...] "come in each week and just nail his stuff" [...] regardless of what else was going on. Similarly, Frank Spotnitz thought that [...] "Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry, loved playing scenes together.

500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had <b>learned</b> <b>was</b> that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E
