5|$|The 1991 {{release of}} Forest of Equilibrium, the debut album by UK band Cathedral, helped spark {{a new wave}} of doom metal. During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise <b>Lost,</b> <b>My</b> Dying Bride, and Anathema gave rise to European gothic metal, with its {{signature}} dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania. New York's Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style.|$|E
5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

25|$|You may be {{too young}} to remember, but in 1971, during a Test match, I {{collided}} with England fast bowler John Snow and <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> bat.

25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle.

Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{allegations}} and court cases of police brutality, custodial death, human rights violations, fake encounter killing, extortion, filing fake cases to harass the general public, corruption {{filed against the}} Assam Police.Because of the corrupt politicians the police have always complained {{not being able to}} function properly.Different organizations and their open extortion are known to the public and the police also have been alleged to have a fair share on those.Another main acquisition of Assam police in the present is that they are the friends of thieves, kidnappers and murderers rather than the public and it is said that the police has a better share in those crime money.Corruption of the organization is at peak with people fearing to go to the police against a crime as they need to pay money to file an FIR or take actions.As a victim says,"I <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> bicycle as few days back and had reported the case in the station.They called me that they had found it and asked 1000 rupees for the release.I took a new one in 1600". In fact it is said that the police waits for the crime to happen so that they can make a profit out of it.Therefore, citizens there take the law in their own hands.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, McGovern {{decided to}} run for the U.S.Senate and {{challenge}} the Republican incumbent Karl Mundt, a formidable figure in South Dakota politics whom McGovern loathed as an old-style McCarthyite.

McGovern made careless charges during the campaign, and the press turned against him; he would say eleven years later, [...] "It was my worst campaign. I hated [...] so much I <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> sense of balance." [...] McGovern was defeated in the November 1960 election, gaining 145,217 votes to Mundt's 160,579, but the margin was one-third of Kennedy's loss to Vice President Richard M. Nixon in the state's presidential contest.|$|E
