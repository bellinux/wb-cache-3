50|$|<b>Levobetaxolol</b> {{is a drug}} used {{to lower}} the {{pressure}} in the eye in treating conditions such as glaucoma. It is typically marketed as a 0.5% ophthalmic solution of <b>levobetaxolol</b> hydrochloride under the trade name Betaxon. <b>Levobetaxolol</b> is a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor (beta blocker).|$|E
50|$|<b>Levobetaxolol</b> {{inhibits}} the beta-1-adrenergic receptor. When applied topically, {{it reduces}} intra-ocular pressure (IOP) by 16-23% depending on {{time of day}} and the individual. It is indicated for IOP reduction in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. <b>Levobetaxolol</b> has fewer cardiovascular side effects than other beta blockers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levobetaxolol</b> {{should not}} be used by people who have sinus bradycardia, {{atrioventricular}} block, cardiogenic shock, or overt cardiac failure.|$|E
40|$|<b>Levobetaxolol</b> is a {{cardioselective}} β-blocker {{that has}} been demonstrated to reduce intraocular pressure in patients affected with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. <b>Levobetaxolol</b> may be an effective neuroprotectant because of its great capacity to block sodium and calcium influx, which might confer a neuroprotective activity. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the effects of <b>levobetaxolol</b> on ocular hemodynamics and visual field, and the pharmacologic differences between β-blockers currently used {{for the treatment of}} elevated IOP have become of more than academic interest since {{a number of studies have}} shown improvements to various extents. Unlike the initially manufactured 0. 5 % ophthalmic solution, <b>levobetaxolol</b> is suspended in a different delivery vehicle in <b>levobetaxolol</b> ophthalmic suspension, to increase the ocular tolerance and allow a similarity of effect with a 2 -fold reduced concentration (0. 25 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Welcome to {{the second}} edition of Clinical Ophthalmology. Once again, this edition {{reflects}} the diversity of ophthalmology from basic science to {{state of the art}} clinical care. Colleagues in other specialties often ask me how I can maintain my interest in such a ‘small ’ speciality but those of us who deal with the eye and its diseases, rather than knowing everything, are eternally humbled by how much we do not know. Just looking at the broad range of areas represented in this journal should convince anyone that ophthalmology is anything but a narrow speciality. Articles in this current edition range from ‘Severe visual loss associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in pregnancy ’ (Zamecki et al 2007) to in-depth reviews of important areas such as the pharmacology and use of <b>levobetaxolol</b> hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension (Quaranta et al 2007) and the clinical efficacy and microbial eradication of 1 % azithromycin ophthalmic solution versus tobramycin in adult and pediatric subjects with bacterial conjunctivitis (Abelson et al 2007). We publish the results of original clinical research studies such as the ‘Influence of uncorrected ametropia on computerbase...|$|E
