5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. He {{appeared to have been}} near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses. His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite <b>legible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since its creation, Bembo {{has enjoyed}} {{continuing}} popularity as an attractive, <b>legible</b> book typeface. Prominent users of Bembo have included Penguin Books, the Everyman's Library series, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, the National Gallery, Yale University Press and Edward Tufte. Bembo {{has been released}} in versions for phototypesetting and in several revivals as digital fonts by Monotype and other companies.|$|E
5|$|Director David Silverman had {{difficulty}} devising a <b>legible</b> Scrabble {{board for the}} opening scene that would convey {{the idea that the}} Simpsons were only able to devise very simple words. The design of Bart's visualization of the math problem was partially inspired by the art of Saul Steinberg. The increasing appearance of numbers in that sequence derived from Silverman's use of a similar tactic when he had to develop a set design for the play The Adding Machine.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} by Col. Parsons in 1861, the ballroom {{in the upper}} story of Wappocomo's stone addition served as the scene of many events and parties. According to tradition, as many as 100 couples have danced on the ballroom's wooden floor since {{its construction}} in 1861. It was the custom of the Parsons family to allow guests who were visiting the mansion {{for the first time}} to write their names and the date of their visit on the mortar between the addition's stone blocks; many of these signatures are still <b>legible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{typewriter}} received an unenthusiastic reception from the public. Lack of an established market, high cost, {{and the need}} for trained operators slowed its adoption. Additionally, recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical, all upper-case writing to be impersonal and even insulting. The new communication technologies and expanding businesses of the late 19th century, however, had created a need for expedient, <b>legible</b> correspondence, and so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures. The typewriter is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace, as many were hired to operate the new devices.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in <b>legible</b> condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more <b>legible</b> appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his career}} was over, Rotheram {{continued}} to request sea service and honours from the Admiralty, becoming increasingly irate and intemperate in his demands. At the reorganising of the knightly orders in 1815, a number of senior naval officers were given knighthoods, but Rotheram was only made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, a step below knighthood. He retired to Bildeston in Suffolk and from there continued to request appointments, finally being made one of the captains of the Greenwich Naval Hospital in 1828. Rotheram died at Bildeston in 1830 and {{was buried in the}} churchyard of St Mary Magdelene just outside the village, where his grave and a memorial plaque are still <b>legible</b> today. Rotheram was never awarded any further honours or promoted to admiral, having lost his seniority in the court martial of 1808.|$|E
5|$|Shepseskare is {{completely}} absent from another king list {{dating to the}} same period: the Abydos king list, written {{during the reign of}} Seti I (1294–1279 BC). He is also absent from the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a lacuna affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still <b>legible</b> and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>legible</b> texts {{referring to}} the kings of the Kaan dynasty come from excavations of the large city of Dzibanche in Quintana Roo, far north of Calakmul. A hieroglyphic stairway depicts bound captives, their names and the dates they were captured together {{with the name of}} king Yuknoom Che'en I, although the exact context of the king's name is unclear - the captives may have been his vassals captured by an enemy or they may have been rulers captured by the king of Calakmul. The dates are uncertain but two of them may fall within the 5th century AD. The nearby Quintana Roo site of El Resbalón has a jumbled hieroglyphic text, including a date in 529, that indicates that the city was within the control of the Kaan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|U 956 {{was first}} {{documented}} by Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), {{and later by}} Johan Peringskiöld (1710), who commented that the inscription was <b>legible</b> {{in spite of the}} stone having been split in two parts. Unlike modern scholars, Peringskiöld connected this stone, like the other Greece runestones, to the Gothic wars in south-eastern Europe from the 3rd century and onwards. Olof Celsius visited the stone three times, and the last time was in 1726 together with his nephew Anders Celsius. Olof Celsius noted that Peringskiöld had been wrong and that the stone was intact, although it gives an impression of being split in two, and the same observation was made by Richard Dybeck in 1866.|$|E
5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most <b>legible</b> parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts to decipher the rongorongo script of Easter Island since its discovery {{in the late nineteenth}} century. As with most undeciphered scripts, many of the proposals have been fanciful. Apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to deal with a lunar calendar, none of the texts are understood, and even the calendar cannot actually be read. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment: the small number of remaining texts, comprising only 15,000 <b>legible</b> glyphs; the lack of context in which to interpret the texts, such as illustrations or parallels to texts which can be read; {{and the fact that the}} modern Rapanui language is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets—especially if they record a specialized register such as incantations—while the few remaining examples of the old language are heavily restricted in genre and may not correspond well to the tablets either.|$|E
5|$|As usual, {{the tone}} of the epigram is {{somewhat}} fawning toward his patron, Titus, but it gives more detail than any other account of the games. It seems to imply that a draw was uncommon in gladiatorial combat at this level, but that Titus eventually yielded to the wishes of the crowd, declared the match equal, and granted both men their freedom (with the traditional presentation of the wooden sword). The traditional way of acknowledging defeat was for the yielding gladiator to raise a finger (ad digitum), and it is possible that in this case both men raised their fingers, but Martial's emphasis here is on Titus' even-handedness and generosity in granting a reprieve (missio) to the crowd's two favourites. His reference to this only happening under Titus probably alludes to the declaration of both as victors, as there is evidence that neither ties nor the survival of both gladiators in a contest were uncommon: it was expensive to train and keep a gladiator and they were not despatched lightly. There is some evidence for the existence of both Priscus and Verus, at least as names of gladiators, outside of Martial's account. A first-century graveyard in Smyrna contains the grave of a gladiator named Priscus, and Verus' name is etched on a marble slab from Ferentinum, recording a gladiatorial contest. The details of Verus' fights are unfortunately not <b>legible.</b> While neither of these may be the Priscus and Verus mentioned by Martial they do attest to the use of these names by gladiators.|$|E
25|$|There are {{thirteen}} {{full and}} one partial line, containing ~ 2,320 glyphs per Fischer. As of April 2008, the CEIPP counted 2208 <b>legible</b> glyphs, 261 indistinct or partially <b>legible</b> glyphs, and estimated that 35 glyphs had been effaced.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} must be <b>legible.</b> As calligraphy is {{the method}} of writing well, a calligraphic work must be recognizable as script, and furthermore be easily <b>legible</b> to those familiar with the script style, {{although it may be}} illegible to those unfamiliar with the script style. For example, many people cannot read cursive, but a calligraphic work in cursive can still be considered good if those familiar with cursive can read it.|$|E
25|$|The lead foils of Punta della Vipera {{have about}} 40 <b>legible</b> words {{having to do}} with ritual formulae. It is dated to about 500 BC.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{lines of}} glyphs on side a, with traces of an eighth on its beveled edge; six lines on side b, for ~ 270 glyphs in all, both <b>legible</b> and damaged.|$|E
25|$|There are 310 {{separate}} gravesites. 280 {{of these}} the headstones have <b>legible</b> carvings; another 199 also have footstones. They {{are made of}} materials from sandstone to white marble and granite, depending on the era. The earliest graves are dated 1766; the latest is from 1959.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, over 150 Romano-Germanic votive {{inscriptions}} to the matronae Austriahenae {{were discovered}} near Morken-Harff, Germany. Most of these inscriptions {{are in an}} incomplete state, yet many are at least reasonably <b>legible.</b> Some of these inscriptions refer to the Austriates, evidently {{the name of a}} social group.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, written records must {{be marked}} with the date and time and scribed with {{indelible}} pens without use of corrective paper. Errors in the record should be struck out with a single line (so that the initial entry remains <b>legible)</b> and initialed by the author.|$|E
25|$|Around 2012, Apple {{started using}} Helvetica in macOS (then named OS X) {{application}} software. iTunes, iMovie, iPhoto, GarageBand, and Apple's professional applications started to feature heavy use of Helvetica, {{while the majority}} of the OS X (now named macOS) environment retained the comparatively more <b>legible</b> Lucida Grande typeface, which was designed specifically for on-screen use.|$|E
25|$|When Isildur {{took the}} Ring from Sauron's hand, it was burning hot, so {{the letters were}} <b>legible.</b> Isildur was able to {{transcribe}} the inscription before it faded as the Ring cooled. This transcription survived in a document Isildur left in Gondor before marching north to the Gladden Fields, where he was killed and the Ring lost.|$|E
25|$|The Tiwanaku {{created a}} {{powerful}} ideology, using previous Andean icons that were widespread throughout their sphere of influence. They used extensive trade routes and shamanistic art. Tiwanaku art consisted of <b>legible,</b> outlined figures depicted in curvilinear style with a naturalistic manner, while Wari art {{used the same}} symbols in a more abstract, rectilinear style with a militaristic style.|$|E
25|$|I {{have thought}} it {{expedient}} to instruct your Prudence to order fifty copies of the sacred Scriptures, the provision and use of which you know to be most needful for the instruction of the Church, to be written on prepared parchment in a <b>legible</b> manner, and in a convenient, portable form, by professional transcribers thoroughly practised in their art.|$|E
25|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight. Especially {{his left eye}} was weak. This interfered with his education, yet his handwriting was quite <b>legible</b> {{until the end of}} his life. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries; he appeared to have been near-sighted. Yet he did not use eyeglasses, which were available at that time.|$|E
25|$|Both Lipchitz and Henri Laurens—late adherents to Cubist sculpture, {{following}} Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky, Umberto Boccioni, Otto Gutfreund and Picasso—began {{production in}} late 1914, and 1915 (respectively), taking Cubist paintings of 1913-14 {{as a starting}} point. Both Lipchitz and Laurens retained highly figurative and <b>legible</b> components in their works leading up to 1915-16, after which naturalist and descriptive elements were muted, dominated by a synthetic style of Cubism {{under the influence of}} Picasso and Gris.|$|E
25|$|The {{main source}} of {{information}} about Kharavela is his rock-cut Hathigumpha inscription. The inscription is undated, and only 4 of its 17 lines are completely <b>legible.</b> Different scholars have interpreted it differently, leading to a number of speculations about Kharavela's reign. The inscription credits the king with several welfare activities, patronage of arts, repair works and military victories. Although it exaggerates his achievements, historians agree that Kharavela was one of the strongest rulers of Kalinga.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of the church lot is given over to its cemetery. It contains around 300 headstones, many of which predate the current church. The stonework on many is detailed and high in quality. 1710 is the earliest date for which one is <b>legible,</b> but church records show burials as early as 1679, and some {{that have not yet}} been translated may have taken place earlier. Not all graves were marked. The most recent stone dates to 1832.|$|E
25|$|Julius Caesar {{was born}} in Godalming, Surrey, to Benjamin Caesar, an English {{professional}} cricketer, and his wife Anne (née Bowler). Benjamin and Anne had seven children. George, Richard, Lawrence William, Ann, Benjamin, Frederick Bowler and finally Julius. He {{was brought up in}} Godalming, a town with approximately 4,000 inhabitants, in Surrey, England. He was almost certainly educated in one of the two schools in Godalming at the time, and could read and write with a <b>legible</b> hand.|$|E
25|$|When {{an outline}} font is used, a {{rasterizing}} routine (in the application software, operating system or printer) renders the character outlines, interpreting the vector instructions {{to decide which}} pixels should be black and which ones white. Rasterization is straightforward at high resolutions such as those used by laser printers and in high-end publishing systems. For computer screens, where each individual pixel {{can mean the difference}} between <b>legible</b> and illegible characters, some digital fonts use hinting algorithms to make readable bitmaps at small sizes.|$|E
25|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was probably}} copied in western France, perhaps at Fleury Abbey. The riddle was added {{after the completion}} of the main contents, fairly certainly at Fleury Abbey, in the tenth century, but the language of the text is older, of the eighth century. It was already hard to read by the earlier nineteenth century, and was further damaged by the librarian, Willem George Pluygers, who in 1864 applied reagents to the text in an attempt to make it more <b>legible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{available}} information about Kharavela comes from the undated and partially damaged Hathigumpha inscription, plus a few other minor Inscriptions found in Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, in present-day Odisha. The Hathigumpha inscription records Kharavela's life up to his 38th year, including 13 years of his reign. The inscription is badly mutilated: out of its 17 lines, only four are completely <b>legible.</b> Therefore, it is open to multiple interpretations, and {{has given rise to}} different speculations by different scholars.|$|E
25|$|Neferefre's prenomen {{was most}} likely also given on the Turin canon (third column, 21st row), which dates to the same period as the Saqqara tablet, but it has since been lost in a large lacuna {{affecting}} the document. Nonetheless, {{the part of the}} reign length attributed to Neferefre by the canon is still <b>legible,</b> with a single stroke sign indicating one year of reign to which a decade could in principle be added, as the corresponding sign would be effectively lost in the lacuna of the document.|$|E
25|$|Although the German {{inscription}} is {{no longer}} <b>legible,</b> the National Cemetery records inscription, transcribed into English, reads as follows:HERE REST THE FIRST HEROES OF THE 32ND INDIANA GERMAN REGIMENT WHO LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR PRESERVATION OF THE FREE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA. THEY WERE KILLED DECEMBER 17, 1861. IN A FIGHT WITH THE REBELS AT ROWLETT'S STATION, KENTUCKY, IN WHICH ONE REGIMENT TEXAS RANGERS, TWO REGIMENTS OF INFANTRY, AND A BATTERY OF SIX CANNON, OVER 3,000 STRONG, WERE DEFEATED BY 500 GERMAN SOLDIERS.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} of iOS 7 in June 2013, Apple began using an extra-thin weight of Helvetica Neue for the user interface of iOS 7, arousing numerous complaints about the less <b>legible</b> typography. For the final release of the operating system, Apple changed the system's font to a slightly thicker weight of Helvetica Neue, although some have complained that readability is still compromised compared to the font weight used in former versions of iOS. Older iOS devices continue to use Helvetica or Helvetica Neue in regular font weights that display with higher contrast on low-resolution displays.|$|E
