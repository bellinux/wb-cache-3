40|$|The {{juvenile}} wood presents great {{difference in}} its anatomical and physical properties {{in relation to}} the mature wood. That heterogeneity of the wood causes a series of upset for the processing industry. The present research had as objective the study of the physical properties of the juvenile and mature wood of Pinus elliottii Engelm var. elliottii, with 25 years of age and of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden, with 30 years of age, coming from the Experimental Station of Itapetininga and State Forest of Santa Barbara, belonging to the Forest Institute of the state of São Paulo. From both species there were taken from radial boards, specimens with dimensions of 20 x 30 x 50 mm, for the determination of density, swelling and swelling coefficient of the juvenile and mature wood. The results of the species showed that the mature compared with the juvenile wood presented: (1) an increase in the values of the basic density, at 0 % and at 12 % of moisture content and of the volumetric, radial and tangential swelling at 12 % moisture content and maximum coefficient of radial and tangential swelling; (2) a reduction in the values of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> at 12 % and maximum and of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to compare {{swelling}} and collapsing of structural massive and laminated wood of beech. Prisms of size 10 x 10 x 1000 mm are for 30 days submerged in water. Thereafter the experimental values of swelling are settled and also are settled the coefficients of swelling and transverse and longitudinal collapsing. The repercussions of beech wood by solid prisms and effect of glue and individual plates with glued blocks are analysed. In our experiment, the values are larger volumetric swelling in solid wood and in tangential, radial and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> the opposite is true. Cross warping achieves higher values for laminated prisms and longitudinal collapsing has been measured only in solid samples...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} the heat treatment on physical properties (density, equilibrium moisture content, mass loss, volumetric and linear swelling and shrinkage) and chemical composition of normal (opposite side) and compression wood of Pinus caribaea Morelet. Samples of 25 x 25 x 50 mm were heat-treated under two different temperatures: 200 and 220 ºC. The results indicated a reduction in equilibrium moisture content and swelling and shrinkage following heat treatment, independent of wood type. The compression wood showed higher <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> than normal one, however, after heat treatment, the improvements were similar between both wood types. Samples heat-treated at 200 and 220 ºC had mass losses of 9. 94 and 21. 03 %, respectively. The heat treatment promoted a relative increase in lignin content and a decrease in holocellulose and α-cellulose contents, indicating the occurrence of thermal degradation of these components...|$|E
40|$|Single-layer {{oriented}} strand panels were fabricated under {{a combination}} of three alignment levels, four densities, and two resin contents. Flake orientation, density gradient across panel thickness, linear expansion (LE), and bending properties were measured. Flake orientation was characterized with the von Mises distribution using mean flake angle and concentration parameter. It was shown that {{the shape of the}} LE-moisture content change curve varied with alignment level and test direction. The variation was attributed to whether the LE of a panel was controlled by transverse or <b>longitudinal</b> wood <b>swelling</b> along a particular test direction. Total LE from oven-dry to water-soak condition, modulus of elasticity (MOE), and modulus of rupture (MOR) varied significantly with flake orientation distribution and density. Effects of resin content at the levels used on LE, MOE, and MOR was relatively small and was niore diversified. The LE, MOE, and MOR were correlated with the concentration parameter, density. resin content, and moisture content using a power form equation. The experimental data form a database of layer properties for modeling three-layer, cross-laminated oriented strandboards (OSBs) manufactured under hot pressing.

40|$|Strain {{caused by}} the {{adsorption}} of gases was measured in samples of subbituminous coal from the Powder River basin of Wyoming, U. S. A., and high-volatile bituminous coal from the Uinta-Piceance basin of Utah, U. S. A. using a newly developed strain measurement apparatus. The apparatus {{can be used to}} measure strain on multiple small coal samples based on the optical detection of the <b>longitudinal</b> strain. The <b>swelling</b> and shrinkage (strain) in the coal samples resulting from the adsorption of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, helium, and a mixture of gases was measured. Sorption-induced strain processes were shown to be reversible and easily modeled with a Langmuir-type equation. Extended Langmuir theory was applied to satisfactorily model strain {{caused by the}} adsorption of gas mixtures using the pure gas Langmuir strain constants. The amount of time required to obtain accurate strain data was greatly reduced compared to other strain measurement methods. Sorption-induced changes in permeability were also measured as a function of pres-sure. Cleat compressibility was found to be variable, not constant. Calculated variable cleat-compressibility constants were found to correlate well with previously published data for other coals. During permeability tests, sorption-induced matrix shrinkage was clearly demonstrated by higher permeability values at lower pore pressures while holding overburden pressure constant. Measured permeability data were modeled using three dif-ferent permeability models from the open literature that take into account sorption-induced matrix strain. All three models poorly matched the measured permeability data because they overestimated the impact of measured sorption-induced strain on permeabil-ity. However, by applying an experimentally derived expression to the measured strain data that accounts for the confining overburden pressure, pore pressure, coal type, and gas type, the permeability models were significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{altitude}} and aspect on wood-water relations in Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky.) were studied. Study area divided into five altitude steps and two aspect groups, total of 20 trees were cut off. In {{order to determine}} the wood-water relations; volume density value, fiber saturation point, maximum moisture content, and shrinkage and swelling percentages were determined. According to results, with 95 % significance level (p< 0, 05), altitude affects volume density value, shrinkage and swelling percentages, fiber saturation point and maximum moisture content; aspect affects volume density value, tangential and radial shrinkage percentages, volumetric shrinkage percentage, tangential and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> percentages, fiber saturation point and maximum moisture content while it has no effect on longitudinal shrinkage percentage, radial and volumetric swelling percentages. Results demonstrated that northern aspect and first altitude step has the lowest values, thus, this aspect and altitude step making a suitable place for this tree species to be used as solid wood...|$|E
30|$|Load and {{moisture}} content (MC) changes are the essential {{conditions for the}} mechano-sorptive (MS) creep of wood. An experiment was carried out on poplar to comprehend the mechano-sorptive creep from our point view. To restore the truth of MS creep behavior especially in the first humidifying stage, three well-matched sets of specimens were loaded in third-point bending under different humidity cycles. For each set, the applied load varied from 15 to 35  % of the short-term breaking load. It {{was found that the}} wood specimens exhibited a partial recovery during all the adsorption phase and deflection increase during all the desorption phase when low load level was applied. This phenomenon was very different from that a considerable creep at first adsorption observed by large amounts of researchers, which can be ascribed to the pseudo-creep due to the difference in the normal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> and shrinkage of wood. The results also indicated that an amplified load effect existed within the creep under cyclic moisture changes, which usually resulted in a fast increasing rate of viscoelastic creep to veil pseudo-recovery in the first humidifying stage.|$|E
40|$|Samples of {{pinewood}} (Pinus Sylvestris) were swelled in ternary {{mixtures of}} ethanol – acetone – water. The tangential, radial and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> was measured and volumetric swelling of oven-dried samples was determined. Anomalous properties of binary and ternary liquid systems have cardinal influence on swelling of wood. Swelling in solutions was multiplied applying the same samples {{and a new}} solution with the same concentrations. Selected specimens were swelled in the same solution repeatedly to perform comparative tests. The values for re-swelling in new solutions were up to two times higher when the same solutions were used. Re-swelling resulted in gradual damping in swelling values. The SEM analysis showed that multiple swelling of wood in water causes decrease in the elasticity of the wood matter. The view of the latewood cells swelled in ethanol and acetone showed the disruption of compound middle lamella (CML). The enlargement of the cell apexes showed deeper impact {{of the water in}} ethanol-water mixture. When single swelling of wood in acetone – water mixtures did not reveal any substantial change in the wood structure, multiple swelling caused noticeable swelling of the S 3 layer of the cell wall...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{commercial}} heat treatment on physical and mechanical properties of compression wood (CW) and opposite wood (OW) of black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) was investigated. Black pine logs containing CW were cut {{parallel to the}} pith and separated into CW and OW sections. A commercial heat treatment process was applied to pine lumber at 180 and 210 ºC for 3 hours. Water absorption (WA), contact angle (CA), swelling, modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and impact bending strength (IBS) were measured. The results showed that heat treatment decreased water absorption and swelling of the CW and OW of black pine. Heat treatment at 210 °C temperature decreased the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> of CW by 51. 4 %. Higher immersion time lowered the effect of heat treatment on the WA values. The CA values of the CW and OW increased due to heat treatment. Heat treatment reduced the MOR, MOE, and IBS values. The results indicated that MOR, MOE, and CA values were highly affected in the CW; on the other hand, the IBS value was highly affected in the OW by heat treatment compared to control groups. The results indicate that heat-stabilized CW can be used more widely and effectively in the forest products industry...|$|E
40|$|Samples of pine (Pinus Sylvestris) sapwood were swelled in binary {{mixtures}}. Binary mixtures used in {{this study}} were aqueous solutions of ethanol, isopropanol, acetone and dimethylformamide. The tangential, radial and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> was measured and volumetric swelling of oven-dried samples was determined. The synergic effects of swelling in aqueous solutions were observed. The properties of binary liquid systems have a major influence on the swelling of wood. Microscopy studies of wood samples show that after swelling in water the cells are densely packed and the compound middle lamellae (CML) has arranged in a form of continuous ribbon around the cells. The swelling of wood in ethanol-water mixtures has a dramatic effect on the wood structure through dissolving a main part of lignin from CML and released individual cells at sectioning. Acetone and acetone-water mixtures have an insignificant effect on the cell wall structure and its bonding to the CML. The swelling in DMF opened up the location of the primary wall layer and S 3 layer. There is no substantial difference in the influence on the cell structure between pure DMF and its mixture with water. INTRODUCTION∗ The swelling of wood in liquids is of fundamental importance both from a scientific standpoint and in the context of commercial processes, which involve dimen...|$|E
40|$|For {{production}} of compression moulded boards from whole coconut husk the auto-adhesive properties {{are derived from}} the intrinsic high lignin content. Since the properties of manufactured boards for a large part {{will depend on the}} input husk material these properties are studied here. Husks of different varieties and maturity have been investigated for their contents of fibre and pith. Relevant physical properties and chemical composition were determined. For accurate determination of tensile strength and stiffness of coir fibre, its density (¿coir = 1. 2 ¿ 1. 3 g/cm 3) and cross-sectional area were determined. Both thickness and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> of the fibre were measured to assess the effects of water absorption. The constituent fibre and pith fractions of coconut husk have been chemically analysed for polysaccharide (cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose) and lignin contents. Detailed carbohydrate analysis of the fibre indicated a glucose (cellulose) content of approximately 33 % in the cell wall, together with 12 % xylose as the major component of the hemicellulose fraction. Coir pith only contains 16 % glucose. The effects of maturing on the chemical composition of the husk is analysed and a significant increase in glucose (cellulose) is observed, while for other sugars no dramatic change in relative amounts can be measured. It was concluded that only slight differences can be observed between mature coconut husks of different origin, and all are suitable as input feedstock for boards production. More effects can be expected from the age of the nuts...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} wood {{instability}} have identified some wood basic properties which influence the timber distortion and shape changes while the wood is losing or gaining moisture. These properties include wood anisotropic shrinkage, {{equilibrium moisture content}} (EMC) in both desorption and adsorption, fibre saturation point (FSP) and water diffusion coefficient. This study investigated the stability related wood properties and their variations within the stems of the New Zealand grown radiata pine trees. The basic density, EMC and shrinkage for the earlywood and the latewood were also experimentally determined. In taking into account these properties and their variations, an analytical model was developed to simulate the wood distortion. The equilibrium moisture content was determined at 30 Â°C and humidity range from 27 % to 90 %. It {{was found that the}} EMC difference between the earlywood and the latewood was negligible. The experimental results also show that the EMC decreases from pith towards the bark over the disc cross section and the trend is most obvious at high humidities (70 - 90 %). Along the tree height, the EMC decreases from ground towards the top of the stem. The tangential shrinkage results were highly variable but, in general, the latewood has higher values than the earlywood. The opposite trend was found for the longitudinal shrinkage, higher values for the earlywood than the latewood. In the tree height direction, the tangential shrinkage was found to decrease with the tree height. This follows the same trend as the microfibril angle which in general also decreases with the tree height. The fibre saturation point (FSP) was determined from the tangential shrinkage values at different equilibrium moisture contents. These were taken as the intersection point of the tangential shrinkage line with the moisture content axis. The experimental results have revealed a trend that the FSP decreases from the pith towards the bark and also decreases with the tree height. Similar behaviour was found for the tangential and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>swelling</b> during the adsorption. The moisture transport within radiata pine was investigated based on the diffusion theory under transient and isothermal condition of 30 Â°C. The moisture dependant diffusion coefficient was derived from the experimental data using the inverse analysis method. The surface emission coefficient was determined by taking into account the variable surface moisture content, wood density and the ambient conditions. In the experiments, 138 samples in total (46 samples for each XIV of the longitudinal, tangential and radial directions) were used and their diffusion coefficients were determined for both the adsorption and the desorption with moisture content ranging from 6 % to 22 %. The derived diffusion coefficients are comparable with the reported data in the literature. Further investigation of the wood type influence on the diffusion coefficient revealed that compression wood has the lowest diffusion coefficients in the three directions (longitudinal, tangential and radial) both in the desorption and in the adsorption. In addition, the moisture content has the least influence on the diffusion coefficient in the compression wood. Investigation on the effects of the wood density has shown that in general, the diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing wood density although the correlations are only significant for the longitudinal direction in desorption. An analytical model for the simulation of the wood twist was developed which is based on the geometry and geometrical changes of the grains aligning non parallel to the pith. A board consists of numerous such grains which change the length and shape with moisture content change. The model predictions confirm that the grain angle, the tangential and longitudinal shrinkage and the conical angle all affect the development of the board twist. However, the discrepancies between the model prediction and the experimental data are significant, partly due to the experimental uncertainties and partly due to the model errors. In this study, sound velocity in the longitudinal direction was measured for the test samples used in the shrinkage experiments. The results revealed that the correlations between the sound velocity and the volumetric shrinkage at oven dry are significant. Based on this finding, the relationship between the tangential shrinkage and the radial shrinkage, the tangential shrinkage can be predicted from the sound velocity measurements. As the tangential shrinkage has significant influence on the wood distortion, this method can be used to segregate logs which may be prone to wood distortion...|$|E
