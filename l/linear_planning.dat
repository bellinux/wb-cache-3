40|$|AbstractConformant {{planning}} {{is used to}} refer to planning for unobservable problems whose solutions, like classical <b>planning,</b> are <b>linear</b> sequences of operators called <b>linear</b> <b>plans.</b> The term ‘conformant’ is automatically associated with both the unobservable planning model and with <b>linear</b> <b>plans,</b> mainly because the only possible solutions for unobservable problems are <b>linear</b> <b>plans.</b> In this paper we show that <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> are not only meaningful for unobservable problems but also for partially-observable problems. In such case, the execution of a <b>linear</b> <b>plan</b> generates observations from the environment which must be collected by the agent during the execution of the plan and used at the end in order to determine whether the goal had been achieved or not; this is the typical case in problems of diagnosis in which all the actions are knowledge-gathering actions. Thus, there are substantial differences about <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> for the case of unobservable or fully-observable problems, and for the case of partially-observable problems: while <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> for the former model must conform with properties in state space, <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> for partially-observable problems must conform with properties in belief space. This differences surface when the problems are allowed to express epistemic goals and conditions using modal logic, and place the plan-existence decision problem in different complexity classes. <b>Linear</b> <b>plans</b> is one extreme point in a discrete spectrum of solution forms for planning problems. The other extreme point is contingent plans {{in which there is a}} branch point for every possible observation at each time step, and thus the number of branch points is not bounded a priori. In the middle of the spectrum, there are plans with a bounded number of branch points. Thus, <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> are plans with zero branch points and contingent plans are plans with unbounded number of branch points. In this work, we lay down foundations and principles for the general treatment of <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> and plans of bounded branching, and provide exact complexity results for novel decision problems. We also show that <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> for partially-observable problems are not only of theoretical interest since some challenging real-life problems can be dealt with them...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{times have}} seen the {{development}} of a number of planners that exploit advances in SAT(is?ability) solving technology to achieve good performance. In that spirit we develop the approximate contingent planner PSLSPLAN. Our approach is based on a stochastic local search procedure for solving stochastic SAT (SSAT) representations of probabilistic planning problems. PSLSPLAN ?rst constructs an SSAT representation of the n-time step probabilistic plangraph for the problem at hand. It then iteratively calls a stochastic local search procedure to ?nd a <b>linear</b> <b>plan</b> (sequence of actions) which achieves the goal (i. e. satisfies the SSAT formula) with non-zero probability. <b>Linear</b> <b>plans</b> thus generated are merged to create a single contingent plan. Successive iterations progress from deciding the outcomes of stochastic actions in order to ?nd a <b>linear</b> <b>plan</b> quickly, to sampling the outcomes of actions. Consequently, PSLSPLAN efficiently ?nds a <b>linear</b> <b>plan</b> which logically achieves the goal. Over time it re?nes its contingent plan for likely scenarios. We empirically evaluate PSLSPLAN on benchmarks from the probabilistic track of the 5 th International Planning Competition.

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{focuses on}} the <b>linear</b> <b>planning</b> method. The method is particularly useful when planning linear objects, such as roads, pipelines, tunnels, railways, sewerage {{and in some instances}} multi-storied buildings. The advantage of <b>linear</b> <b>planning</b> is primarily its two-dimensionality. One axis shows time and the other location, which enables a clear comparison between the planned and {{the current state of the}} plan. When using the network planning method, the linear object must be divided into sections, and each section must have a network structure of activities applied. The more sections, the more precise and complex the plan, which can lead to difficulties monitoring the project. Computer support has an important role in schedule-planning. It enables fast updating or correcting the plan, the use of an existing similar plan and working with a distant-access simultaneously. In the program Tilos, which supports <b>linear</b> <b>planning,</b> I analyzed the existing schedule-plan for the Kidričevo- Rogatec pipeline that was made in MS Project. My focus was primarily on the possible mistakes in the existing plan due to the use of the network planning method for planning linear objects, such as collisions and incorrect sequence of activities. Implementing the critical path test and using various sources I attempted to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the Tilos program, compared to the MS Project...|$|E

The generated repairs serve two purposes: as they describe possible worlds in which the goal holds, they can be used to reason about these worlds and eliminate those, which have undesired properties. Moreover, the repairs can be used for driving the actual planning procedure such that the generated plans lead to the selected possible world.

40|$|The role of {{planning}} and reactive control in an architecture for autonomous agents is discussed. The postulated architecture seperates the general robot intelligence problem into three interacting pieces: (1) robot reactive skills, i. e., grasping, object tracking, etc.; (2) a sequencing capability to differentially ativate the reactive skills; and (3) a delibrative planning capability to reason in depth about goals, preconditions, resources, and timing constraints. Within the sequencing module, caching techniques are used for handling routine activities. The planning system then builds on these cached solutions to routine tasks to build larger grain sized primitives. This eliminates large numbers of essentially <b>linear</b> <b>planning</b> problems.

40|$|We present twelve propositions constituting a {{contribution}} to a contingency view of time in organizations and synthesize apparently opposite perspectives of time. To articulate them, we relate the planning, action and improvisation strategic orientations to the dependent, independent and interdependent perspectives of the environment. Then, we relate these strategic orientations related to approaches {{to the problems of}} scheduling, synchronization and time allocation. Action strategies rely on event time to handle scheduling, use entrainment to synchronize with their environment and view time as <b>linear.</b> <b>Planning</b> strategies use even time to handle scheduling, impose their internal pacing upon the environment and view time as cyclic. Improvisation strategies use even-event time to handle scheduling, synchronize via internal-external pacing and hold a spiral view of time.
