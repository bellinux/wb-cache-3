40|$|International audienceStudies on the {{dynamical}} behaviour {{of rolling}} element bearings {{show that the}} position {{as well as the}} loading of the flange roller-end contact depends on the momentum created on the roller track cause by local friction variability. This situation is characterized by a skew angle. The investigations described in this paper intend to propose {{a better understanding of the}} physical phenomena occurring in spinning contacts under skewing. Experimental investigation is done in a unique test rig called TRIBOGYR, dedicated to large size-contacts with spinning kinematics, which allows both film thickness and friction measurement. In the meantime, a numerical analysis is lead, based on a Finite Element software, aiming to take into account the multiphysics aspect of this thermoelastohydrodynamic contact. Longitudinal and transverse friction as well as power losses are both measured and computed as a function of the kinematics conditions imposed to the contact. When the skew increases, the transverse power losses increases due to the new orientation of the velocity field over the contact surfaces. The overall magnitude of the velocity field increases to match the kinematics imposed by the skew and as a consequence temperature elevation occurs. The shearing induced by the transverse component of the velocity impacts the viscosity and thus the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slide</b> power losses as well as the spin power losses. Variations of viscosity are explained by both shear and thermal thinning. When the skew angle is large enough, both experimental and numerical analysis show the formation of a dimple (local increase of film thickness inside the contact area) caused by a viscosity gradient due to high shear in the transverse direction...|$|E
40|$|The {{compound}} Rp-d[Gp(S) CpGp(S) CpGp(S) C], an analogue of the deoxyoligomer d(G-C) 3, crystallizes {{in space}} group P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1) with a = 34. 90 A, b = 39. 15 A and c = 20. 64 A. The structure, {{which is not}} isomorphous with any previously determined deoxyoligonucleotide, was refined to an R factor of 14. 5 % at a resolution of 2. 17 A, with 72 solvent molecules located. The two strands of the asymmetric unit form a right-handed double helix, which is a new example of a B-DNA conformation and brings to light an important and overlooked component of flexibility of the double helix. This flexibility is manifest in the alternation of the backbone conformation between two states, defined by the adjacent torsion angles epsilon and zeta, trans. gauche-(BI) and gauche-. trans (BII). BI is characteristic of classical of B-DNA and has an average C(1 ') to C(1 ') separation of 4. 5 A. The corresponding separation for BII is 5. 3 A. Each state {{is associated with a}} distinct phosphate orientation where the plane of the PO 2 (or POS) group is alternately near horizontal or vertical with respect to the helix axis. The BI and BII conformations are out of phase on the two strands. As a consequence, on one strand purine-pyrimidine stacking is better than pyrimidine-purine, while the converse holds for the other strand. At each base-pair step, good and bad stacking alternate across the helix axis. The pattern of alternation is regular {{in the context of a}} fundamental dinucleotide repeat. Re-examination of the B-DNA dodecamer d(C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G) shows that the C-G-C-G regions contain the BI and BII conformations, and the associated dual phosphate orientation and asymmetric base stacking. Different mechanisms are used in the two structures to avoid clashes between guanine residues on opposite strands, a combination of lateral slide, tilt and helical twist in the present structure, and base roll, tilt and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slide</b> (Calladine rules) in the dodecamer. The flexibility of the phosphate orientations demonstrated in this structure is important, since it offers a structural basis for protein-nucleic acid recognition...|$|E

40|$|The {{frictional}} {{properties of}} individual multiwalled boron nitride nanotubes (BN-NTs) synthesized by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) and deposited on a silicon substrate are investigated using an atomic force microscope tip <b>sliding</b> along (<b>longitudinal</b> <b>sliding)</b> and across (transverse sliding) the tube's principal axis. Because of the tube transverse deformations during the tip sliding, a larger friction coefficient is found for the transverse sliding {{as compared to the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sliding.</b> Here, we show that the friction anisotropy in BN-NTs, defined as the ratio between transverse and longitudinal friction forces per unit area, increases with the nanotube-substrate contact area. Larger contact area denotes stronger surface adhesion, resulting in a longitudinal friction coefficient closer to the value expected in absence of transverse deformations. Compared to carbon nanotubes (C-NT), BN-NTs display a friction coefficient in each sliding direction with intermediate values between CVD and arc discharge C-NTs. CVD BN-NTs with improved tribological properties and higher oxidation temperature might be a better candidate than CVD C-NTs for applications in extreme environments.

40|$|Eukaryotic flagella contain tens of {{thousands}} of dynein motor enzymes, arranged in regular arrays along the outer doublet microtubules of the axoneme [...] the internal cytoskeleton of a flagellum or cilium. These dyneins produce <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sliding</b> between the doublet microtubules. They must interact cooperatively to generate the bending waves that are required for efficient propulsion of spermatozoa, or other situations. Sperm flagella can generate a variety of bending patterns, including nearly two dimensional patterns that can be approximated as planar bending waves and three-dimensional bending patterns that are approximately helical waves. In some situation, they can switch between these two types of bending [1, 2].

40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a semi-automatic image tracking system to analyze the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sliding</b> and transformation of a string-like object. By using this system, we made a moving image analysis on actin filament (F-actin) in an in vitro motility assay. In this assay, F-actin was sliding on the surface under a fluorescent microscope. The tracking system pursues the fluorescent image of F-actin by matching a polygon line model with the video images. In this study, the directional change and the curvatures of the sliding F-actin were statistically analyzed using {{the data obtained by}} the tracking system. The simplified sliding motion of the polygon line model was simulated on a computer. By comparing the result of the analysis with that of the simulation, we found that the sliding F-actin has a flexible and compliant nature. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe report here {{a simple}} yet robust {{transient}} compartmentalization system for microfluidic platforms. Cylindrical microfilaments made of commercially available fishing lines {{are embedded in}} a microfluidic chamber and employed as removable walls, dividing the chamber into several compartments.

This allows the easy implementation of various functions, previously impossible or requiring more complex instrumentation. In this study, we demonstrate the applications of our strategy, firstly to trigger chemical diffusion, then to make surface co-coating or cell co-culture on a two-dimensional substrate, and finally to form multiple cell-laden hydrogel compartments for three-dimensional cell co-culture in a microfluidic device.

40|$|We study {{experimentally}} {{and discuss}} quantitatively {{the contact angle}} hysteresis on striped superhydrophobic surfaces {{as a function of}} a solid fraction, ϕ_S. It is shown that the receding regime is determined by a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sliding</b> motion the deformed contact line. Despite an anisotropy of the texture the receding contact angle remains isotropic, i. e. is practically the same in the longitudinal and transverse directions. The cosine of the receding angle grows nonlinearly with ϕ_S, in contrast to predictions of the Cassie equation. To interpret this we develop a simple theoretical model, which shows that the value of the receding angle depends both on weak defects at smooth solid areas and on the elastic energy of strong defects at the borders of stripes, which scales as ϕ_S^ 2 ϕ_S. The advancing contact angle was found to be anisotropic, except as in a dilute regime, and its value is determined by the rolling motion of the drop. The cosine of the longitudinal advancing angle depends linearly on ϕ_S, but a satisfactory fit to the data can only be provided if we generalize the Cassie equation to account for weak defects. The cosine of the transverse advancing angle is much smaller and is maximized at ϕ_S≃ 0. 5. An explanation of its value can be obtained if we invoke an additional energy due to strong defects in this direction, which is shown to be proportional to ϕ_S^ 2. Finally, the contact angle hysteresis is found to be quite large and generally anisotropic, but it becomes isotropic when ϕ_S≤ 0. 2. Comment: 17 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|In Part I of the thesis, {{a general}} {{physical}} framework describing the kinetics of protein- DNA interaction is developed. Recognition and binding of specific sites on DNA by proteins is central for many cellular {{functions such as}} transcription, replication, and recombination. In the process of recognition, a protein rapidly searches for its specific site on a long DNA molecule and then strongly binds this site. Earlier {{studies have suggested that}} rapid search involves sliding of the protein along the DNA. I treat sliding as a one-dimensional diffusion in a sequence-dependent rough energy landscape. I demonstrate that, despite the landscape's roughness, rapid search can. be achieved if one-dimensional sliding is accompanied by three-dimensional diffusion. I estimate the range of the specific and nonspecific DNA-binding energy required for rapid search and suggest experiments that can test the proposed mechanism. It appears that realistic energy functions cannot provide both rapid search and strong binding of a rigid protein. To reconcile these two fundamental requirements, a search-and-fold mechanism is proposed that involves the coupling of protein binding and partial protein folding. In this regard, I propose an effective energy landscape that incorporates <b>longitudinal</b> (<b>sliding)</b> and transversal (folding) dynamics. I also study the influence of finite correlation length in the binding potential profile on the one-dimensional diffusion. The proposed mechanism has several important biological implications for search in the presence of other proteins and nucleosomes, simultaneous search by several proteins, etc. (cont.) In Part II, I analyze the behavior of random walks in presence of smooth manifolds. First, I treat a random walk (or gaussian polymer) confined to a half-space using a field-theoretic approach. Using path integrals, I derive basic scaling relations and the probability distribution function for arbitrary coupling strength between the polymer and the manifold. Next, I consider self-avoiding polymers attached to the tip of an impenetrable probe. The scaling exponents [gamma] ₁ and [gamma]₂, characterizing the number of configurations for the attachment of the polymer by one end, or at its midpoint, are shown to vary continuously with the tip's angle. These apex exponents are calculated analytically by [epsilon]-expansion and compared to numerical simulations in three dimensions. I find that when the polymer can move through the attachment point, it typically slides to one end; the apex exponents quantify the entropic barrier to threading the eye of the probe. by Michael Slutsky.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} control approach is proposed {{for trajectory tracking}} and obstacle avoidance for mobile robots with consideration given to unknown sliding. A kinematic model of mobile robots is established in this paper, in which both <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>sliding</b> are considered and processed as three time-varying parameters. A sliding model observer is introduced to estimate the sliding parameters online. A stable tracking control law for this nonholonomic system is proposed to compensate the unknown sliding effect. From Lyapunov-stability analysis, it is proved, regardless of unknown sliding, that tracking errors of the controlled closed-loop system are asymptotically stable, the tracking errors converge to zero outside the obstacle detection region and obstacle avoidance is guaranteed inside the obstacle detection region. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed control system are verified by simulation results...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with non-specific arm pain (NSAP; {{also known as}} repetitive strain injury), there are clinical signs of altered median nerve sliding. It is possible that a restriction along the nerve course will lead to abnormal increases in local strain during limb movements, possibly contributing to symptoms. The present study uses ultrasound imaging to examine median nerve sliding through the proximal and distal nerve segments in 18 NSAP patients. <b>Longitudinal</b> nerve <b>sliding</b> was measured during metacarpophalangeal, wrist and elbow movements. During elbow movements, the angle of elbow extension at which the nerve begins to move was determined, since this was expected to decrease with a restriction through the shoulder. The {{results from this study}} were compared with previously reported data. Nerve movements ranged from 1. 26 to 4. 73 mm in patients compared with 1. 43 – 5. 57 mm in controls. There {{was no significant difference in}} nerve sliding (p> 0. 05) or in the angle of elbow extension at which the nerve began to move (mean= 53. 4 ° in patients, 52. 0 ° in controls; p> 0. 05). In summary, restriction of median nerve sliding is unlikely to play a major role in NSAP. Therefore, painful responses during limb movements which tension the nerve are unlikely to result from abnormal increases in nerve strain...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Peripheral nerves {{straighten}} {{and stretch}} {{in order to}} accommodate increases in bed length during joint movements. The ulnar nerve is predicted to show large bed length changes, particularly on elbow flexion. The present study examines sliding of the ulnar nerve during limb movements, to determine how far these changes are accommodated by straightening and stretch. METHODS Ultrasound imaging was used to measure <b>longitudinal</b> nerve <b>sliding</b> in the forearm and upper arm during 40 degrees wrist extension, 90 degrees elbow flexion and 50 degrees shoulder abduction. Nerve trunk folding in the upper arm was measured from still ultrasound images taken in a series of limb positions from 40 degrees shoulder abduction, elbow extended and wrist neutral to full elbow flexion, 90 degrees shoulder abduction and wrist extension, a position designed to stretch the ulnar nerve. FINDINGS Wrist extension led to clear nerve sliding in the forearm with movements of up to 4 mm. However, shoulder abduction and elbow flexion caused remarkably little nerve movement. Images of the ulnar nerve showed considerable curvature with 40 degrees shoulder abduction and elbow extension but a much straighter path with the elbow flexed. INTERPRETATION The ulnar nerve appears unloaded and follows a wavy path in most functional upper limb positions. During elbow and shoulder movements, changes in bed length appear to be accommodated largely by straightening of the nerve path, with only modest stretch of the nerve itself when the elbow flexes. The ulnar nerve is thus well adapted for the large changes in bed length that occur during limb movements...|$|R
40|$|A major {{landslide}} event {{occurred at}} Pollatomish, County Mayo, Ireland in September 2003, {{during a period}} of intense rainfall.

Relatively simple limit state stability analyses, using the method of slices and an infinite slope analysis, were used to model the slide and {{it was found that the}} features observed on site could easily be reproduced. These included confirmation that thin layers of peat could be stable on steep slopes but the margin of safety reduces rapidly under elevated pore pressure conditions. As was observed in the field, the analyses suggested the most vulnerable zone was the upper layer of weathered rock but that slides could occur in the peat if its thickness was appreciable. Careful site characterization is vital in such studies. Here efforts have been made to understand the effect of fibres on the peat strength and some sensitivity analyes have been performed to assess the critical engineering parameters of the peat...|$|R
40|$|Nerve sliding may be {{restricted}} following nerve repair. This {{could result in}} increased tension across the repair site and lead to poor functional recovery of the nerve. Ultrasound {{was used to examine}} <b>longitudinal</b> median nerve <b>sliding</b> in 10 patients who had previously undergone nerve repair surgery following complete division of the median nerve. The median longitudinal movement in the forearm in response to metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint movements was 2. 15 mm on the injured side, compared with 2. 54 mm on the uninjured side, a difference that was significant. There was a significant reduction in nerve sliding following repair (median = 8 %, range − 8 % to 54 %; P = 0. 02), which correlated with time from injury to surgery (rho = 0. 87; P = 0. 001). These results indicate that ultrasound can be used as an adjunct assessment tool to monitor both morphology and sliding of the nerve through the repair site. It may have future application in the investigation of patients with persisting functional impairment following primary nerve repair...|$|R

The axes of inquiry are twofold: 1 st) crosssectional approach to family bias expressed in the job profiles of cycle life, occupational segregation, concentration of employment in occupational groups and allocation of family responsibilities between spouses; and 2 nd) <b>longitudinal</b> treatment with <b>sliding</b> panel of family interference in the market status of married women by age and educational level. Cross-sectional analysis shows negative associations between marriage-education in both sexes and between education and participation in women by comparison with men, jointly with large gender segregation in married women suggests that they support a family specific bias which hinders its market presence. The individual perception of family interference confirms this fact as they are married women who suffer mainly from the problems of work-family conciliation, even younger than 44 years where they are more educated than their husbands and gender equality is a social value settled. The longitudinal analysis quantifies, with multinomial Logit estimates, the disadvantage of married women to participate into the market in terms of the entry barrier for inactive wives and the premature withdrawal for occupied ones due to problems of work-family reconciliation. In short, family responsibilities leave off the market to married women, regardless of age and education...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2010 - 2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence (CES), the location of Christchurch-City on the coast of the Canterbury Region (New Zealand) has proven crucial in determining the types of- and chains of hazards that impact the city. Very rapidly, the land subsidence of up to 1 m (vertical), and the modifications of city’s waterways – bank <b>sliding,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> profile change, sedimentation and erosion, engineered stop-banks… - turned rainfall and high-tides into unprecedented floods, which spread across {{the eastern side of the}} city. Within this context, this contribution presents two modeling results of potential floods: (1) results of flood models and (2) the effects of further subsidence-linked flooding – indeed if another similar earthquake was to strike the city, what could be the scenarios of further subsidence and then flooding. The present research uses the pre- and post-CES LiDAR datasets, which have been used as the boundary layer for the modeling. On top of simple bathtub model of inundation, the river flood model was conducted using the 2 -D hydrodynamic code NAYS- 2 D developed at the University of Hokkaido (Japan), using a depth-averaged resolution of the hydrodynamic equations. The results have shown that the area the most at risk of flooding are the recent Holocene sedimentary deposits, and especially the swamplands near the sea and in the proximity of waterways. As the CES drove horizontal and vertical displacement of the land-surface, the surface hydrology of the city has been deeply modified, increasing flood risks. However, it seems that scientists and managers haven’t fully learned from the CES, and no research has been looking at the potential future subsidence in further worsening subsidence-related floods. Consequently, the term “coastal quake”, coined by D. Hart is highly topical, and most especially because most of our modern cities and mega-cities are built on estuarine Holocene sediments...|$|R
40|$|Immersed tunnels are {{particularly}} sensitive to tensile and compressive deformations {{such as those}} imposed by a normal seismogenic fault rupturing underneath, and those generated by the dynamic response due to seismic waves. The paper investigates the response of a future 70 m deep immersed tunnel to the consecutive action of a major normal fault rupturing in an earthquake occurring in the basement rock underneath the tunnel, and a subsequent strong excitation from a different large-magnitude seismic event that may occur years later. Non-linear finite elements model the quasi-static fault rupture propagation through the thick soil deposit overlying the bedrock and the ensuing interaction of the rupture with the immersed tunnel. It is shown that despite imposed bedrock offset of 2 m, net tension or excessive compression between tunnel segments could be avoided with a suitable design of the joint gaskets. Then, the already deformed (""injured"") structure is subjected to strong asynchronous seismic shaking. The thick-walled tunnel is modelled as a 3 -D massive flexural beam connected to the soil through properly-calibrated nonlinear interaction springs and dashpots, the supports of which are subjected to the free-field acceleration time histories. The latter, obtained with 1 -D wave propagation analysis, are then modified to account for wave passage effects. The joints between tunnel segments are modeled with special non-linear hyper-elastic elements, properly accounting for their 7 -bar <b>longitudinal</b> hydrostatic pre-stressing. <b>Sliding</b> is captured with special gap elements. The effect of segment length and joint properties is explored parametrically. A fascinating conclusion emerges in all analysed cases for the joints between segments that were differentially deformed after the quasi-static fault rupture: upon subsequent very strong seismic shaking, overstressed joints de-compress and understressed joints re-compress-a ""healing"" process {{that leads to a}} more uniform deformation profile along the tunnel. This is particularly beneficial for the precariously de-compressed joint gaskets. Hence, the safety of the immersed tunnel improves with ""subsequent"" strong seismic shaking! © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|R
