5000|$|Stimulus-onset {{asynchrony}} (SOA) is {{a measure}} used in experimental psychology. SOA denotes {{the amount of time}} between the start of one stimulus, S1, and the start of another stimulus, S2 (Figure 1). In this respect, a stimulus may consist of, e.g., a presented image, sound or printed word. A short time interval between S1 and S2 may lead to interference in the neural processing of these two patterns. Conversely, a very long SOA may lead to a situation where the brain activity caused by S1 may have faded, such that S2 has become an isolated event. Typical research questions concern the facilitation, deterioration, or biasing effects of the sequential stimulus presentation on a required <b>later</b> <b>response.</b> In a certain kind of studies on subliminal stimulation, called [...] "pattern masking", subliminality is achieved by masking the subliminal stimulus with a second stimulus composed of either random parts of letters or numbers, or containing different kinds of figural properties. Here, the critical parameter is the time interval (the SOA) between the onset of the subliminal stimulus and the onset of the masking stimulus. In psycholinguistics the stimuli are typically a prime and a target, in which case the stimulus-onset asynchrony is measured {{from the beginning of the}} prime (S1) until the beginning of the target (S2). This time can be manipulated experimentally to determine its effects on other dependent measures such as reaction time or brain activity.|$|E

40|$|Inhibitory {{mechanisms}} {{contribute to}} directional tuning in primary visual cortex, {{and it has}} been suggested that, in the primate brain, the middle temporal area (MT) inherits most of its directional information from primary visual cortex (V 1). To test the validity of this hierarchical scheme, we investigated whether directional tuning in MT was present upon blockade of local γ-aminobutyratergic (GABAergic) inhibitory mechanisms. Direction selectivity during the initial 50 ms after response onset was abolished in many MT cells when the local inhibitory network was inactivated whereas direction selectivity in <b>later</b> <b>response</b> periods was largely unaffected. Thus, direction selectivity during early response periods is often generated autonomously within MT whereas direction selectivity during <b>later</b> <b>response</b> periods is either inherited from other visual areas or locally mediated by mechanisms other than γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA) inhibition. GABAergic inhibition may also mediate contrast normalization. Our data suggest that GABAA inhibition implements a local direction-selective static nonlinearity, rather than a full normalization in MT. These findings put constraints on strict hierarchical models according to which MT performs more complex computations based on local motion measurements provided by earlier areas, arguing for more distributed and independent information processing...|$|E

Methods: We examined determinants of early versus <b>later</b> <b>response</b> to the baseline questionnaire using logistic regression with response wave regressed on measures of demographics, history of illness, health behaviors, medication, and supplement use. Results: Participants who were more health conscious tended to respond earlier. Female sex, more education, personal experience with cancer, more physical activity, and regular use of aspirin were associated with early response. Race other than white and current smoking were associated with <b>later</b> <b>response.</b> Of note, African-Americans and Latinos, with lower response rates, and Japanese, with the highest response rate overall, {{were more likely to}} respond to a later mailing.

40|$|Although lithium {{has been}} the first line agent in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder (BD), few studies have evaluated lithium's efficacy in mania with psychosis and its association with <b>later</b> <b>response.</b> Furthermore, given the widespread concern about antipsychotic side effects, answering a question about whether lithium alone can manage to treat both psychotic and non-psychotic mania seems a very relevant one. The present study addresses the antipsychotic efficacy of lithium monotherapy in acute mania and early improvement of psychotic symptoms as a predictor of <b>later</b> <b>response</b> of manic symptoms. Forty-six patients presenting a manic episode (32 with psychotic features and 14 subjects without psychotic features) were treated for 4 weeks with lithium monotherapy and evaluated weekly using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Subjects with rapid cycling, substance abuse/dependence, or mixed episodes were excluded. The overall antimanic efficacy of lithium in psychosis vs. non-psychosis groups was evaluated. In addition, early improvement of psychotic symptoms and its prediction of subsequent response (> 50 % decrease in total YMRS scores) or remission were evaluated. Lithium showed a similar efficacy in both psychosis and non-psychosis mania. Early improvement of psychotic symptoms was associated with clinical response and remission at endpoint.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{research}} has shown that exposure to testicular hormones during the peri-pubertal period of life has long-term, organizational effects on adult sexual behaviour and underlying neural mechanisms in laboratory rodents. However, the organizational effects of peri-pubertal testicular hormones on other aspects of behaviour and brain function are less well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of manipulating peri-pubertal testicular hormone exposure on later behavioural responses to novel environments and on hormone receptors in various brain regions that are involved in response to novelty. Male rodents generally spend less time in the exposed areas of novel environments than females, and this sex difference emerges during the peri-pubertal period. Male Lister-hooded rats (Rattus norvegicus) were castrated either before puberty or after puberty, then tested in three novel environments (elevated plus-maze, light–dark box, open field) and in an object/social novelty task in adulthood. Androgen receptor (AR), oestrogen receptor (ER 1) and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRF-R 2) mRNA expression were quantified in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and medial amygdala. The results showed that pre-pubertally castrated males spent more time in the exposed areas of the elevated-plus maze and light–dark box than post-pubertally castrated males, and also confirmed that peri-pubertal hormone exposure influences <b>later</b> <b>response</b> to an opposite-sex conspecific. Hormone receptor gene expression levels did not differ between pre-pubertally and post-pubertally castrated males in any of the brain regions examined.
