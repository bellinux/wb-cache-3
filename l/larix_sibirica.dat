25|$|The Central Siberian Plateau is {{an ancient}} craton (sometimes named Angaraland) that formed an {{independent}} continent before the Permian (see the Siberian continent). It is exceptionally rich in minerals, containing large deposits of gold, diamonds, and ores of manganese, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt and molybdenum. Much of the area includes the Siberian Traps—a large igneous province. This massive eruptive period was approximately coincident with the Permian–Triassic extinction event. The volcanic event {{is said to be}} the largest known volcanic eruption in Earth's history. Only the extreme northwest was glaciated during the Quaternary, but almost all is under exceptionally deep permafrost, and the only tree that can thrive, despite the warm summers, is the deciduous Siberian Larch (<b>Larix</b> <b>sibirica)</b> with its very shallow roots. Outside the extreme northwest, the taiga is dominant, covering a significant fraction of the entirety of Siberia. Soils here are mainly turbels, giving way to spodosols where the active layer becomes thicker and the ice content lower.|$|E

Surprisingly, no reports had been made {{at the time of}} Alston's review in 1968, although many species had been investigated for flavonoids. Apart from the Larix compounds, C-glycosides had been reported in only two other species; a vitexin-like compound from Ephedra americana and vitexin and orientin as minor constituents in Dioon spinu/osum leaves. The question, therefore, arose whether the larch may be exceptional in this respect within the Pinaceae, or even among the Gymnospermae. Therefore, leaves of a 46 species of gymnosperms were subjected to a screening for C-glycoflavonoids occurring as major constituents...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} a part of the ForestSpecs FP 7 EU project. The aim of this project was to utilize the readily available, large volume and low price wood {{residues}} from the wood processing industry. The first part of this work involved a comparative study of three extraction techniques, shaking, soxhlet and microwave assisted extraction. The microwave extraction was found to be the most suitable method, as it allowed the results to be achieved with reduced level of solvents, lower energy consumption and faster processing time. The phytochemical investigation of six forestry species: Pinus sylvestris, <b>Larix</b> gmelinii, L. <b>sibirica,</b> L. sukaczewii, L. decidua, and Populus tremula was performed. This included many steps such as grinding, extraction of plant materials and separation, isolation and purification of a variety of compounds with potential use in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and also pest management applications. A total of ninety-three compounds were identified, with thirty-two being isolated from more than one source. Of these, four have not been described previously and are shown below. Compound 13 was isolated from L. gmelinii and compounds 32, 33 and 37 were isolated from L. sukaczewii. Components from the species investigated have been identified using ID, 2 D NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and optical rotation measurements. The extracts and purified compounds were submitted to the consortium screening programme. The thirteen bark extracts Of the species investigated were tested for cytotoxic and apoptotic activity using the LDH and MTT assays, as well as Western blot analysis of protein p 53. In both, A- 375 human melanoma cells and CVI-P fibroblast cells, the following bark extracts showed selective cytotoxic effects against A- 375 cancerous cells: L. gmelinii DCM (LGD) and P. sylvestris DCM (PSD), EtOAc (PSE) and MeOH (PSM) extracts. Further investigation demonstrated that L. gmelinii DCM and EtOAc and P. sylvestris DCM extracts induced the translocation of the p 53 protein into the nucleus. This approach proved the significance of the use of natural products as chemopreventive agents and cancer therapeutics. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Larch (Larix sp Mill.) is an {{important}} component in boreal montane and subalpine forests in the northern hemisphere. Macrofossils of larch in the Scandinavian mountains prove the existence of larch in Scandinavia after the last ice age, Siberian or Russian larch is now considered as an indigenous tree species of Sweden. The larches of Russia are of interest for their production potential and wood quality. The aim of this thesis was to determine frost resistance, juvenile growth, stem straightness and branch traits in a 5 -year-old combined provenance/progeny test with <b>Larix</b> sukaczewii, L. <b>sibirica,</b> L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi originating from Russia and tested on three sites in Sweden. An evaluation of genetic parameters in this half-sib family material was also made. The yield in 37 - 86 year old field tests of L. sukaczewii and Russian larch hybrids was also evaluated. The results indicate that larches from western Russia, L. sukaczewii were least damaged in the artificial freezing test, had highest survival in the field trials and had the best stem quality. The most northern provenances of this species had, however, poorer growth and lower survival, especially on the southern test site. L. sibirica from central Siberia and continental provenances of L. cajanderi and L. gmelinii were not adapted to any of the sites. Among provenances of L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi those with more maritime origin showed generally better adaptation than those from more continental areas. Geographic and climatic variables of provenance origin were important for the performance of the provenances. At the southern test site, provenances from northern latitudes and strongly continental areas in Russia showed poor growth and survival. On the two test sites located in harsh climates, provenances originating in climates similar to the test sites showed best survival. This means a northern transfer of 2 - 3 latitudes for the most northern site. The yield in 37 - 40 year-old L. sukaczewii was higher than Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Betula pendula on two test sites in central Sweden. In northern Sweden one provenance from Arkhangelsk showed higher yield after 50 years compared to one provenance from the central Ural Mountains. L. sukaczewii of Raivola origin demonstrated a wide ecological range with a yield of about 7 m 3 /ha/year for 76 years, in a local continental climate in central Sweden and a maritime site in northern Norway. Small test plots with the hybrid L. decidua x L. sukaczewii had substantially higher production than L. sukaczewii...|$|R

40|$|Lymantria dispar L. {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious forest pests {{worldwide}} by infesting large forest areas involving massive tree dieback. Unlike outbreaks of Lymantria dispar L. in Germany that cause massive defoliation, observations of outbreaks of Lymantria dispar asiatica made in the research area Khonin Nuga, West Khentii, Mongolia during the past six years showed only punctual defoliation, and dieback was extremely scarce. However, information on the performance of Lymantria dispar asiatica and the corresponding reaction of host tree species in Khonin Nuga is rare. Therefore, this study concentrates on the examination of primarily affected tree species and the magnitude and spatial structure of Lymantria dispar asiatica infestations. The determination of Lymantria dispar asiatica pupal development was carried out on Betula fusca, <b>Larix</b> <b>sibirica</b> and Prunus padus asiatica. The magnitude and spatial structure of Lymantria dispar asiatica infestations was surveyed at two <b>Larix</b> <b>sibirica</b> island stands in the forest steppe. A forest inventory of the stands was conducted and the degree of foliation and the infestation with pupae was investigated. It was found that Lymantria dispar asiatica developed best on <b>Larix</b> <b>sibirica</b> as the pupae mortality was lowest here. In both <b>Larix</b> <b>sibirica</b> stands, trees of high vitality showed the highest number of pupae, whereas trees of low vitality had fewer pupae, suggesting a movement of larvae from defoliated trees to vital trees for pupation.
