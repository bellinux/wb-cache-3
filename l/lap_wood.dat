50|$|The Berry House was {{constructed}} in 1908. It is significant both because of its association with James E. Berry, Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma from 1935 to 1955, {{but also because of}} its unique architectural style, described as “vaguely Italianate with a Midwestern feeling.” It is a two-story rectangular <b>wood</b> frame with <b>lapped</b> <b>wood</b> siding. The front door is flanked by glass sidelights; three Tuscan columns on the front support the upper story. A bay window occurs {{on each side of the}} structure. The roof, which is double-hipped, is set off by three low dormers, one on the front and one on each side. The interior has been remodeled only slightly, and includes egg and dart molding, in-laid oak doors, stained glass, and wooden wall paneling.|$|R
50|$|The church {{building}} is a one-story 29 x 45 ft wood-frame building with <b>wood</b> <b>lap</b> siding on a continuous brickfoundation over older piers.|$|R
5000|$|One {{of the few}} Delta Blues {{players to}} play lap style in the 1930s was Black Ace, also known as B.K. Turner. He toured and {{recorded}} with his mentor Oscar [...] "Buddy" [...] Woods, who also played lap style Resonator guitar and <b>Lap</b> Steel. <b>Woods,</b> who was fifteen years older than Ace, taught him his guitar playing techniques.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Mountain International Highway was {{completed}} in 1936. The customs station was built in 1939, designed by A. Paul Brown of the National Park Service. The 1-1/2 story structure is built of wood frame on a rubble stone foundation. The lower level is framed with posts and beams, while the upper portion is of light frame construction. The station is now sheathed in aluminum siding that mimics <b>wood</b> <b>lap</b> siding. The <b>wood</b> shingle roof was stained green, but has weathered to a natural gray. There are four stone chimneys. The interior retains much of its historic fabric, although almost all light fixtures have been replaced.|$|R
50|$|Purolator 500 Controversy marred the finish. The lead changed 43 times {{despite a}} ninety-minute delay for rain near halfway. Pearson {{took the lead}} with 14 to go, but in the final seven <b>laps</b> the <b>Wood</b> Brothers Mercury smoked heavily, to where by Lap 198 it was lapping its own smoke. At that point NASCAR black-flagged Pearson, but the rules allowed a three lap period to obey the flag and {{there were only two}} laps to go. It was the third win of the season for Pearson. Under current NASCAR rules with {{electronic}} scoring, a time or lap penalty would be added for late-race black flag penalties.|$|R
50|$|As the Moto Guzzi pit-attendants made {{preparations}} for Stanley Woods to refuel {{on the last}}-lap, the Norton pit-crew signalled to Guthrie to easy the pace on the last <b>lap.</b> Stanley <b>Woods</b> riding for Moto Guzzi went straight through the TT Grandstand area without stopping on the last lap and set a new overall lap record of 26 minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 86.53 mi/h km/h. Despite the Norton team telephoning the signal-station at Ramsey on the last lap to indicate to Jimmie Guthrie to speed-up the pace, Stanley Woods won the 1935 Senior TT Race by 4 seconds from Jimmie Guthrie in 3 hours, 7 minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 84.68 mi/h km/h.|$|R
40|$|Economic pressures, {{particularly}} {{related to}} the quality of manufactured goods and `time-to-market` are forcing designers to think {{not only in terms of}} product design but also in terms of integrated product and process design, and finally in terms of deterministic manufacturing planning and control. As a result of these three high level needs, there is now an even greater need for comprehensive simulations that predict material behavior during a manufacturing process, the stresses and/or temperatures on associated tooling, and the final-product integrity. The phrase `manufacturing processes` of course covers a broad scope; it includes semiconductor manufacturing, injection molding of polymers, metal machining and precision <b>lapping,</b> <b>wood</b> and textile production, and the final assembly of piece-parts into a consumer product. It can be seen from this partial listing that the fields of fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, dynamics and tribology can all play a role. The introduction to the paper will contain a review of manufacturing processes and describe where simulations have been successfully applied, and where simulations are still lacking. The best of the simulations are those where the models accurately fit the physical phenomena, where accurate constitutive equations are available, and where boundary conditions are realistic. Thus, the body of the paper will focus on the results from one of these more successful simulations. It has been used to predict the deflections of tooling and the most appropriate operating conditions for the manufacturing process under study. A new method for manufacturing planning is described. In this method, closed form, somewhat simplified, analytical models are used to determine manufacturing planning parameters and then the results from these simpler models are refined by the fuller simulations. A case study in machining parameter selection for peripheral finish milling operations is developed...|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} is {{set back from}} the road on a 3.85 acre grassy lot with mature trees. It is a three-bay, two-story gable front frame lodge building with a brick foundation, <b>wood</b> <b>lap</b> siding with cornerboards, and a shake roof with a boxed cornice. A brick chimney rises from the northwest slope of the roof. Both the interior and exterior of the building were carefully restored between 1986 and 1991 using original materials or in-kind replacements.|$|R
50|$|The City of Stockton and the County of San Joaquin resumed {{operating}} the former Stockton Municipal Airport on December 16, 1946 under a joint (interim) license. On the 1,044.18 acres of leased land (950 acres of which comprise the airport now under license) there were approximately 175 buildings, including 50 airport-related structures which {{were included in}} the above described license. The buildings were primarily the Quartermaster 700-series and 800-series type construction with concrete foundations, wood floor, composition roof, and <b>wood</b> <b>lap</b> siding.|$|R

The roof's gabled front dormer is finished in <b>wood</b> <b>lap</b> siding, although the actual gable in covered with wood shingles. A pair of double-hung windows are centered {{in the front of}} the dormer, flanked by single double-hung windows. The rear dormer, added after the original construction, sports triple-ganged double-hung windows and wood shingles. The home's roof is covered in asphalt shingles, and features the exposed rafter tails and knee braces.|$|R
5000|$|Barn - A family story {{tells of}} Pete, {{bringing}} home an Italian work crew one weekend. By Sunday, the barn was completed. The barn is a small, two-story building of frame construction. It has a hay loft under a gambrel roof. It was built ca 1920, replacing an earlier structure. It has a concrete foundation with a <b>wood</b> <b>lap</b> exterior. The Dutch door on {{east and west}} sides are original with the hay loft doors on both {{the north and south}} walls. A large vehicle door on north was added at a later time.|$|R
50|$|The NASCAR Convertible Series ran {{two races}} at North Wilkesboro. In 1957, Ken Rush won the pole {{and led the}} first 21 <b>laps</b> before Glen <b>Wood</b> took the lead for the next 42 laps. Paul Goldsmith took the lead on Lap 64 and led {{the rest of the}} 160-lap race. In 1958, Roz Howard won the pole but never led a lap. Billy Myers took the lead on Lap One and {{continued}} until Lap 82 when he was passed by Gwyn Staley. Billy Myers retook the lead on Lap 119 and lead the rest of the race.|$|R
50|$|The current {{house was}} built in 1930 on the {{location}} of the original house. It is a basic American Four-Square structure with Craftsman influences on the front porch. It is capped with a Prairie-style low pitch roof with low profile dormers on the south and west sides, and wide eaves. The two-story square structure is clad in <b>wood</b> <b>lap</b> siding. The house is built on a limestone foundation that is faced with brick on the exterior. In addition to the front porch there is also a side porch, a rear service entrance, and a small projecting window bay off the dining room. The {{house was built}} by Will Ehlers, who was also responsible for similar houses in the area.|$|R

40|$|Lignin is {{a natural}} {{biopolymer}} with a complex three-dimensional network. It {{is the second most}} abundant natural polymer on earth. Commercially, lignin is largely obtained from the waste liquors of pulping and bioethanol productions. In this study, wheat straw alkali lignin (WSAL) was demethylated by using an in-situ generated Lewis acid under an optimized demethylation process. The demethylation process was monitored by a semi-quantitative Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method. The demethylated wheat straw alkali lignin (D-WSAL) was further characterized by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H NMR), Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), and titration methods. After the demethylation process, {{it was found that the}} relative value of the methoxy group decreased significantly from 0. 82 to 0. 17 and the phenolic hydroxyl group increased from 5. 2 % to 16. 0 %. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl content increased from 6. 6 % to 10. 3 %. GPC results suggested that the weighted averaged molecular weight of D-WSAL was lower than that of WSAL with a smaller polydispersity index. The D-WSAL was then used to replace 60 wt % of phenol to prepare lignin-based phenol formaldehyde adhesives (D-LPF). It was found that both the free formaldehyde content and the free phenol content in D-LPF were less than those of the lignin-based phenol formaldehyde adhesives without lignin demethylation (LPF). Gel time of D-LPF was shortened. Furthermore, the wet and dry bonding strengths of <b>lap</b> shear <b>wood</b> samples bonded using D-LPF were higher than those of the samples bonded using LPF. Therefore, D-WSAL has shown good potential for application in phenol formaldehyde adhesives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Strength {{of double}} <b>lap</b> joints of <b>wood</b> (Lawson cypress) {{including}} a glued end butt joint at center was analyzed by applying Fracture Mechanics. Approximate stress {{analysis was conducted}} in accordance with Volkersen type theory. Apparent strain energy release rate G * of the joints was derived from applying the J-integral to the stress components. I t was assumed that the apparent strain energy release rate G * of the joints was propotional to the strain energy release rate G of cracked adhesive joint specimen subjecting to shear force and expressed as G*=NG. Fracture criterion was assumed that when G * reached its critical value G*c (=NGc), fracture occured at the right-angled corner of the joints. Experimental results showed good applicability of derived equation on predicting strength of the joints when N was 0. 5 and Gc was 0. 25 kg. cm/cm 2 • A simple but conservative design equation between strength and the half lap length of the joints based on the experimental results and derived equation was proposed...|$|R
5000|$|G.A.R. Memorial Hall, {{also known}} as the Algona Schoolhouse, is a {{historic}} building located in Algona, Iowa, United States. It was built as the city's first schoolhouse in 1867, and moved to this location in 1887. [...] The two-story frame Italianate structure features a gable roof, bracketed eaves, and <b>wood</b> <b>lap</b> siding. It originally had a belfry {{in the center of the}} roof, but it was removed at some point. [...] After the building was moved it was used by the James C. Taylor Post No. 165 of the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.), which had been organized in 1883. During the G.A.R.'s ownership the first floor was used as a library from 1899-1904. Because of declining numbers, the local G.A.R. Post gave the building to Hagg Post No. 90 of the American Legion Post in 1919 who used it for their clubhouse until 1967. At that time the Kossuth County Historical Society acquired the building, and they use it for a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.|$|R

40|$|The DVD 'Snow White and George' is edited from {{extensive}} {{footage of}} Wood's two year old son watching his favourite Disney film. The camera had been {{attached to the}} top of the television several days before filming, making him unaware (perhaps) that his portrait was being taken. Throughout the filming he was sitting on <b>Wood's</b> <b>lap</b> and despite having watched the film dozens of times he seldom lost his concentration. The work is informed by diverse genres, such as documentary film-making, Andy Warhol’s Screen tests and the Family Photograph. It is part of a series of works in which technological icons are major characters; in this case the television/ video is virtually a third parent. This particular edit focuses upon sections of Snow White depicting various female stereotypes such as ‘beautiful young girl’, ‘ugly old hag’ and the ‘murderously jealous queen’ with the corresponding responses of the extremely permeable young male. Part of the development of this work is to interrogate notions of gender – Wood as a father, and carer, the influence of feminism upon Wood as a male artist. Other edits have examined domesticity, cleanliness and hierarchy. The idea that an image (which in this case we never see) is neutral is of course the real fairy tale...|$|R

5000|$|During the Middle Ages {{files were}} already quite advanced, {{thanks to the}} {{extensive}} talents of blacksmiths. By the 11th century, there already existed hardened files that would seem quite modern even to today's eyes. But although they existed, and could even have spread widely, in a geographical sense, via trade, they were not widespread in the cultural sense of the word—that is, most people, and even many smiths, did not have them. For example, in the 13th century, ornamental iron work at Paris was done skillfully {{with the aid of}} files, but the process was a secret known only to a master craftsman. The Disston authors state, [...] "It was not until the fourteenth century, however, that those who practiced art in ironwork began to use other tools, besides heat and the hammer, regularly." [...] This statement could mislead in the sense that stoning (with sandstone) and <b>lapping</b> (with <b>wood,</b> sand, and water) have never been rare activities among humans, or especially smiths. But the point is that modern iron or steel files, with teeth and hardening, and the material culture of intricate filing that would lead to locksmithing and gunsmithing, for example, are what took time to become common. But by the late Middle Ages, however, the transition was extensive. The Disston authors mention Nuremberg, Sheffield, and Remscheid (they use the Reimscheid spelling) as leading centers of production for files as well as tools in general. The activity in Remscheid reflects the metalworking spirit of the Rhine-Ruhr region in general (including Essen, Düsseldorf, and Cologne) rather than representing a single village of geniuses in isolation. (In fact, given the Disston authors' mention of the blacksmith guilds of 13th-century Florence and 15th-century England, coupled with their mention of Nuremberg, Sheffield, and Remscheid, it is interesting to trace a region that sweeps from Florence through Nuremberg, the Rhine-Ruhr, the Netherlands, and up to Sheffield, and to compare it with the modern economics notation of the Blue Banana.) Most files of the period were smithed by hand in a sequence in which the iron was forged (heated and hammered), then the teeth were cut with a chisel (some of this action was just as much upsetting/swaging as it was cutting), and then the piece was hardened (by heating and then quenching), followed sometimes by tempering. Among the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci is a sketch of a machine tool for the cutting of files (the chisel would make one strike, swaging a tooth, then automatically advance into position for the next tooth, and strike again).|$|R
