5|$|In 1851 the Supreme Court was reorganized {{under the}} new state constitution. The {{position}} of justice was changed from an appointed position to an elected one. Judicial terms were changed to six years and the Court's size was set to {{a minimum of three}} members and not more than five. The Court's judges quickly became overwhelmed by an ever-increasing caseload. In 1853 the minimum was increased to four members and in 1872 it was increased to five. The Court has remained at a minimum of five justices since that time. In 1867 the general assembly transferred all the law books in the Indiana State Library to the Court to create a Supreme Court Law Library. The library grew to become the primary <b>legal</b> <b>library</b> for the state and includes more than seventy-thousand volumes.|$|E

40|$|Legal deposit is an {{obligation}} to deposit publications with specified depositories. The purpose of legal deposit is to preserve and provide long-term access to the national intellectual heritage. Extending legal deposit to digital publications presents many challenges for the framing of legislation, selection and acquisition of material, preservation and provision of access. The aim {{of this research was}} to: explore the potential issues related to the extension of UK legal deposit to digital publications and identify the implications for existing legal deposit arrangements. The research was based on Soft Systems Methodology. Data was gathered through two rounds of interviews with stakeholder groups, including <b>legal</b> deposit <b>libraries,</b> publishers, government and technical experts. Preservation is accepted as the main purpose of legal deposit, but there is some tension and lack of trust between publishers and <b>legal</b> deposit <b>libraries</b> on access to legal deposit collections. The new UK legal deposit law is enabling only; implementation will require further regulations that will be subject to detailed consultation and negotiation. While there has been a voluntary scheme in place for some time in the UK, the research found a lack of readiness amongst the UK <b>legal</b> deposit <b>libraries.</b> They still had to develop cooperative arrangements between themselves and publishers; policies, procedures, especially for online publications; and did not have all the necessary technical infrastructure in place. The deposit of digital publications is an extra role for <b>legal</b> deposit <b>libraries</b> and {{it is not clear that}} they will receive extra funding, as is the case in some other countries. There is currently no full-scale fully functional digital legal deposit system in the world. However, there are lessons to be learned from other <b>legal</b> deposit <b>libraries</b> and research and development work is providing partial solutions. The key issues are the need for communication and collaboration between UK <b>legal</b> deposit <b>libraries</b> and cooperation and trust between <b>legal</b> deposit <b>libraries</b> and publishers.
