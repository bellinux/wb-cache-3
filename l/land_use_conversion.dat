5000|$|The major {{category}} {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions resulting from human activities is carbon dioxide. Several other primary gases also include methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons.

Stationary sources emit greenhouse gases from a single point source such as a smoke stack. Stationary source examples include coal- or gas-fired power plants, incinerators, refineries, bakeries, or chemical plants.

Furthermore, fertilization significantly decreased the CH 4 fluxes from paddy soils in the second stage after conversion, but it failed to affect the CH 4 fluxes from orchard soils, whereas fertilizer applied to orchard and paddy increased soil N 2 O emissions by 68 and 113. 9 %, respectively. Thus, cumulative CH 4 emissions from the OF were 100 % lower, and N 2 O emissions were 421 % higher than those from the PF. Although cumulative N 2 O emissions were stimulated in the newly converted orchard, the strong reduction of CH 4 led to lower global warming potentials (GWPs) as compared to the paddy. Besides, fertilization in orchard increased GWPs but decreased GWPs of paddy soils. In addition, measurement of soil moisture, temperature, dissolved carbon contents (DOCs), and ammonia (NH 4 (+) -N) and nitrate (NO 3 (-) -N) contents indicated a significant variation in soil properties and contributed to variations in soil CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes. Results {{of this study suggest that}} <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>conversion</b> from paddy to orchard would benefit for reconciling greenhouse gas mitigation and citrus orchard cultivation would be a better agricultural system in the hilly red soils in terms of greenhouse gas emission.

Nevertheless, more field measurements from newly converted orchard are highly needed to gain an insight into national and global accounting of CH 4 and N 2 O emissions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} and {{predicts the}} {{effects of climate change}} and climate extremes on China’s <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>conversion</b> and soil carbon sequestration under two alternative climate change scenarios. It intends to investigate the following three questions. 1) How did climate factors affect land-use conversion in China from 1988 to 2000 and what was the relative importance of these factors? 2) How would the predicted future climate change pattern affect land-use choice under alternative climate change scenarios? 3) How would the predicted future climate pattern change the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon in China? The study makes two contributions to the literature. First, it integrates climate change, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>conversion,</b> and soil carbon sequestration into a whole model, which facilitates a comprehensive, systematic analysis. Second, it employs a unique dataset, consisting of high-quality Geographic Information System (GIS) data on climate, land use, and soil properties. To the best of our knowledge, no one has used such detailed Chinese data for economic research. Land-use change, soil carbon sequestration, climate change, Environmental Economics and Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|E
40|$|Europe's {{agricultural}} land (including Ukraine) comprise of 164 million hectares of cultivated land and 76 million hectares of permanent pasture. A "food first" paradigm was {{applied in the}} estimations of land potentially available {{for the production of}} biofuel feedstocks, without putting at risk food supply or nature conservation. Three land conversion scenarios were formulated: (i) A base scenario, that reflects developments under current policy settings and respects current trends in nature conservation and organic farming practices, by assuming moderate overall yield increases; (ii) an environment oriented scenario with higher emphasis on sustainable farming practices and maintenance of biodiversity; and (iii) an energy oriented scenario considering more substantial <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>conversions</b> including the <b>use</b> of pasture <b>land.</b> By 2030 some 44 - 53 million hectares of cultivated <b>land</b> could be <b>used</b> for bioenergy feed-stock production. The energy oriented scenario includes an extra 19 million hectares pasture land for feedstocks for second-generation biofuel production chains. Available land is foremost to be found in Eastern Europe, where substantial cultivated areas can be freed up through sustainable gains in yield in the food and feed sector. Agricultural residues of food and feed crops may provide an additional source for biofuel production. When assuming that up to 50 % of crop residues can be used without risks for agricultural sustainability, we estimate that up to 246 Mt agricultural residues could be available for biofuel production, comparable to feedstock plantations of some 15 - 20 million hectares...|$|R
40|$|The Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) is {{developing}} a model to examine <b>land</b> <b>use</b> changes and their associated environmental and economic implications for the Southeast region of the United States. The model will be built {{as if there were}} two regions in the U. S. One region is the Southeast with the other region containing the remainder of the 48 contiguous states. The driving force within the model will be assumed levels of demand for, or prices of, various agricultural and silvicultural products on a market region and national level. The CARD southeast model will be a cost minimization linear program. It will allocate the land resources of the nation to alternative uses to produce the specified levels of crop, forest, and pasture/range products. The model will also incorporate constraints such as allowable erosion levels, regional shifts in production, and levels of government policy variables. The basic hypothesis of this research is that future change sin national, including exports, and regional demand levels will cause substantial acreages of land in the Southeast to be converted to an alternative <b>use.</b> Such <b>conversions</b> could also occur as a result of government policy decisions. The <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>conversions</b> {{to be included in the}} Southeast are all directions between forest, crop, orchard, idle and pasture or range, and dryland to irrigated. In the remainder of the nation allowable conversions will be forest and pasture to crop and dryland to irrigated. The model will be an extension of current CARD national models by including for the Southeast the land conversions noted above. Also the crops of apples, citrus, peaches, pecans, sweet-corn, tomatoes, tobacco, sugarcane, rye, rice, and sweet and Irish potatoes will be included in the endogenous rather than exogenous crop sector for selected states as shown in Appendix 1. An overview of the model process is given in Figure 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Jatropha {{has often}} been {{proposed}} as a miracle crop {{for the production of}} oil, because of the high yields and low requirements in terms of land quality, climate and crop management. A large number of companies have started with jatropha production in Africa which is projected to increase rapidly. Yet, the sector is not fully developed and therefore the economic viability is unclear. Crucial issues for the economic performance are the crop management system, level of inputs and thereby yield and labour requirements, the price of jatropha seeds, and the business model used (e. g. farmer-centred, plantation model). Other factors infl uencing the sustainability of jatropha production and <b>use</b> are <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>conversions</b> and their resulting impacts on GHG emissions, as well as socio-economic impacts which depend largely on the combination of local socio-economic circumstances and on the business model. Plantations have generally larger negative effects on biodiversity and land issues than farmer-centred models, but larger positive effects on employment levels. Farmer-centred models are generally more pro-poor due to technological spillovers and the larger number of farmers involved. Especially when jatropha products are used to increase energy access, local communities can benefi t. More research is required to determine optimised agricultural practices, long-term effects on food security, local prosperity and gender issues and technological development of equipment that can use jatropha products. It should be avoided to replace food crops with jatropha to avoid negative impacts on food security...|$|R
