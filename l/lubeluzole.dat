50|$|<b>Lubeluzole</b> (Prosynap) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as an {{indirect}} NMDA antagonist. It inhibits the release of glutamate, inhibits nitric oxide synthesis, and blocks calcium and sodium gated ion channels. It has neuroprotective effects particularly in hypoxic conditions, and was developed {{for the treatment of}} stroke. Trials showed it to be safe, effective and well tolerated at low doses, but unfortunately higher doses produced the dangerous cardiac side effect of lengthening the QTc interval, which could potentially lead to heart failure, and so this meant that subsequent trials were limited to using only the low dose range. Animal studies had shown <b>lubeluzole</b> to produce neuroprotective effects when administered for prolonged periods, but the aim of its developers was to produce a drug that would be effective for preventing damage from acute stroke, and so ultimately it failed to show sufficient efficacy in trials and development for medical use was halted.|$|E
40|$|Besides other {{pharmacological}} effects, the neuroprotective compound <b>lubeluzole</b> blocks low-voltage-activated (iLVA) and high-voltage-activated (iHVA) {{calcium channel}} currents. We in-vestigated {{the site of}} action of <b>lubeluzole</b> on Ca 21 channels in isolated dorsal root ganglion cells of the rat, using whole-cell voltage clamp. Experiments with extracellular application of 3 mM <b>lubeluzole</b> (pKa 5 7. 6) at different values of extracellular pH suggest that the protonated form of <b>lubeluzole</b> contributes to the block of iLVA and iHVA from the extracellular side. The partial block of iLVA and iHVA by 3 mM <b>lubeluzole</b> at extracel-lular pH 9 and intracellular pH (pHi) 9 indicates that the un-charged form of <b>lubeluzole</b> (L) {{may contribute to the}} block as well.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>lubeluzole</b> (a neuroprotective {{benzothiazole}} derivative) and its (−) enantiomer R 91154 on whole-cell currents through Ca 2 + channels, with 10 [*]mM Ba 2 + as charge carrier (IBa), {{have been studied}} in bovine and mouse voltage-clamped adrenal chromaffin cells. Currents generated by applying 50 [*]ms depolarizing test pulses to 0 [*]mV, from a holding potential of − 80 [*]mV, at 10 [*]s intervals had an average magnitude of 1 [*]nA. <b>Lubeluzole</b> and R 91154 blocked the peak IBa of bovine chromaffin cells in a time and concentration-dependent manner; their IC 50 s were 1. 94 [*]μM for <b>lubeluzole</b> and 2. 54 [*]μM for R 91154. In a current-voltage protocol, <b>lubeluzole</b> (3 [*]μM) inhibited peak IBa at all test potentials. However, no obvious shifts of the I-V curve were detected. After 10 [*]min exposure to 3 [*]μM <b>lubeluzole,</b> the late current (measured {{at the end of}} the pulse) was inhibited more than the peak current. Upon wash out of the drug, the inactivation reversed first and then the peak current recovered. Blockade of peak current was greater at more depolarizing holding potentials (i. e. 35 % at − 110 [*]mV and 87 % at − 50 [*]mV, after 10 [*]min superfusion with <b>lubeluzole).</b> Inactivation of the current was pronounced at − 110 [*]mV, decreased at − 80 [*]mV and did not occur at − 50 [*]mV. Intracellular dialysis of bovine voltage-clamped chromaffin cells with 3 [*]μM <b>lubeluzole</b> caused neither blockade nor inactivation of IBa. The external application of 3 [*]μM <b>lubeluzole</b> to those dialysed cells produced inhibition as well as inactivation of IBa. The effects of <b>lubeluzole</b> (3 [*]μM) on IBa in mouse chromaffin cells were similar to those in bovine chromaffin cells. At − 80 [*]mV holding potential, a pronounced inactivation of the current led to greater blockade of the late IBa (66 %) as compared with peak IBa (46 % after 10 [*]min superfusion with <b>lubeluzole).</b> In mouse chromaffin cells approximately half of the whole-cell IBa was sensitive to 3 [*]μM nifedipine (L-type Ca 2 + channels) and the other half to 3 [*]μM ω-conotoxin MVIIC (non-L-type Ca 2 + channels). In ω-conotoxin MVIIC-treated cells, 3 [*]μM <b>lubeluzole</b> caused little blockade and inactivation of IBa. However in nifedipine-treated cells, <b>lubeluzole</b> caused a pronounced blockade and inactivation of IBa that reversed upon wash out of the compound. The results are compatible with the idea that <b>lubeluzole</b> preferentially blocks non-L-types of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels expressed by bovine and mouse chromaffin cells. The higher concentrations of the compound also block L-type Ca 2 + channels. The mechanism of inhibition involves the access of <b>lubeluzole</b> to the open channel from the outside of the cell and promotion of its inactivation. The differential blockade of Ca 2 + channel subtypes might contribute to the neuroprotective actions of <b>lubeluzole</b> (which exhibit stereoselectivity). However, in view of the lack of stereoselectivity in blocking Ca 2 + channels, this effect cannot be the only explanation for the protective activity of <b>lubeluzole</b> in stroke...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lubeluzole,</b> {{which acts}} on various targets in vitro, {{including}} voltage-gated sodium channels, was initially proposed as a neuroprotectant. The <b>lubeluzole</b> structure contains a benzothiazole moiety [N-methyl- 1, 3 -benzothiazole- 2 -amine (R-like) ] related to riluzole and a phenoxy-propranol-amine moiety [(RS) - 1 -(3, 4 -difluorophenoxy) - 3 -(piperidin- 1 -yl) propan- 2 -ol (A-core) ] recalling propranolol. Both riluzole and propranolol are efficient sodium channel blockers. We studied {{in detail the}} effects of <b>lubeluzole</b> (racemic mixture and single isomers), the aforementioned <b>lubeluzole</b> moieties, and riluzole on sodium channels to increase our knowledge of drug-channel molecular interactions. Compounds were tested on hNav 1. 4 sodium channels, and on F 1586 C or Y 1593 C mutants functionally expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, using the patch-clamp technique. <b>Lubeluzole</b> blocked sodium channels with a remarkable effectiveness. No stereoselectivity was found. Compared with mexiletine, the dissociation constant for inactivated channels was ∼ 600 times lower (∼ 11 nM), conferring to <b>lubeluzole</b> a huge use-dependence of great therapeutic value. The F 1586 C mutation only partially impaired the use-dependent block, suggesting that additional amino acids are critically involved in high-affinity binding. <b>Lubeluzole</b> moieties were modest sodium channel blockers. Riluzole blocked sodium channels efficiently but lacked use dependence, similar to R-like. F 1586 C fully abolished A-core use dependence, suggesting that A-core binds to the local anesthetic receptor. Thus, <b>lubeluzole</b> likely binds to the local anesthetic receptor through its phenoxy-propranol-amine moiety, with consequent use-dependent behavior. Nevertheless, compared with other known sodium channel blockers, <b>lubeluzole</b> adds a third pharmacophoric point through its benzothiazole moiety, which greatly enhances high-affinity binding and use-dependent block. If sufficient isoform specificity can be attained, the huge use-dependent block may help {{in the development of}} new sodium channel inhibitors to provide pharmacotherapy for membrane excitability disorders, such as myotonia, epilepsy, or chronic pain...|$|E
40|$|Incubation of bovine adrenal chromaffin {{cells with}} veratridine (10 – 100 [*]μM) during 24 [*]h, caused a concentration-dependent {{release of the}} cytosolic lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) into the bathing medium, an indicator of cell death. <b>Lubeluzole</b> or its R(−) enantiomer, R 91154, did not enhance LDH release. Both <b>lubeluzole</b> and R 91154 (0. 3 – 10 [*]μM) decreased the veratridine-induced LDH release. Penfluridol did not increase LDH release at concentrations 0. 003 – 1 [*]μM; 3 – 10 [*]μM increased LDH release to 50 – 60 %, after 24 [*]h exposure. Penfluridol (0. 03 – 0. 3 [*]μM) did not protect against the cytotoxic effects of veratridine; at 1 [*]μM, 15 % protection was produced. Higher concentrations (3 – 10 [*]μM) enhanced the cytotoxic effects of veratridine. Ba 2 + ions caused a concentration-dependent increase of LDH release. This cytotoxic effect was partially prevented by 3 [*]μM <b>lubeluzole</b> and fully counteracted by 1 [*]μM penfluridol. R 91154 was less potent than <b>lubeluzole</b> and only protected against the lesion induced by 0. 5 [*]mM Ba 2 +. Ouabain (10 [*]μM during 24 [*]h) increased LDH release to about 30 %. Both <b>lubeluzole</b> (0. 3 – 10 [*]μM) and the lower concentrations of penfluridol (0. 003 – 0. 3 [*]μM) prevented the ouabain cytotoxic effects. At higher concentrations (3 [*]μM), penfluridol increased drastically the ouabain cytotoxic effects. 6 -Hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) caused significant cytotoxic effects at 30 and 100 [*]μM. <b>Lubeluzole</b> (3 – 10 [*]μM) or penfluridol (0. 03 – 0. 3 [*]μM) had no cytoprotective effects against 6 -OHDA. <b>Lubeluzole</b> (3 [*]μM), R 91154 (3 [*]μM) and penfluridol (1 [*]μM) blocked the current through Na+ channels in voltage-clamped chromaffin cells (INa) by around 20 – 30 %. Ca 2 + current through Ca 2 + channels (ICa) was inhibited 57 % by <b>lubeluzole</b> and R 91154 and 50 % by penfluridol. The effects of penfluridol were not washed out, but those of <b>lubeluzole</b> and R 91154 were readily reversible. <b>Lubeluzole</b> (3 [*]μM) induced reversible blockade of the oscillations of the cytosolic Ca 2 +, [Ca 2 +]i, in fura- 2 -loaded cells exposed to 30 or 100 [*]μM veratridine. Penfluridol (1 [*]μM) inhibited those oscillations in an irreversible manner. The results suggest that <b>lubeluzole</b> and its R-isomer caused cytoprotection against veratridine cell damage, by blocking the veratridine stimulated Na+ and Ca 2 + entry, {{as well as the}} [Ca 2 +]i oscillations. The Ba 2 + and ouabain cytotoxic effects were prevented more efficiently by penfluridol, likely by blocking the plasmalemmal Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger. It remains dubious whether these findings are relevant to the reported neuroprotective action of <b>lubeluzole</b> in stroke; the doubt rests in the stereoselective protecting effects of <b>lubeluzole</b> in in vivo stroke models, as opposed to its lack of stereoselectivity in the in vitro model reported here...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 22 {{patients}} with acute ischemic stroke participated in two randomized, single-masked, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated {{the safety and}} pharmacokinetics of single escalating intravenous doses of <b>lubeluzole.</b> The first dose of study medication in all patients was given within 6 hours of {{the first sign of}} stroke onset. In the first study, 6 patients received a single 1 -hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg of lubeluzole; 4 of these patients received an additional 10 -mg dose 3 to 4 days later. Two additional patients received placebo. In the secund study, 4 patients received a single 1 -hour infusion of 10 mg of <b>lubeluzole,</b> and 2 patients received placebo. After a safety evaluation of the second study, 6 additional patients received 15 mg of <b>lubeluzole,</b> and 2 other patients received placebo. <b>Lubeluzole</b> had no clinically relevant effects on any cardiovascular variable compared with placebo. The majority of adverse experiences were mild to moderate and resolved during treatment. No unexpected electroencephalogram abnormalities were observed, and no evidence of epileptiform discharges was found in any of the patients. At the end of the infusion, plasma <b>lubeluzole</b> concentrations decayed biphasically, with mean distribution half-lives of 46. 3 to 101. 0 minutes and mean terminal half-lives of 20. 8 to 27. 7 hours. Comparisons of the dose-normalized values of the individual plasma concentrations {{at the end of the}} infusion and the total area under the curve from time 0 to infinity suggested that <b>lubeluzole</b> exhibited linear kinetics over the dose range evaluated in patients with ischemic stroke.

40|$|An {{affinity}} {{capillary electrophoresis}} (ACE) method to estimate apparent dissociation constants between bovine brain calmodulin (CaM) and non-peptidic ligands was developed. The method was validated reproducing the dissociation constants {{of a number}} of well-known CaM ligands. In particular, the potent antagonist 125 -C 9 was ad hoc synthesized through an improved synthetic procedure. The ACE method was successfully applied to verify CaM affinity for <b>lubeluzole,</b> a well-known neuroprotective agent recently proved useful to potentiate the activity of anti-cancer drugs. <b>Lubeluzole</b> was slightly less potent than 125 -C 9 (Kd =  2. 9  ±  0. 7 and 0. 47  ±  0. 06  μM, respectively) and displayed Ca(2 +) /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibition (IC 50  =  40  ±  1  μM). Possible binding modes of <b>lubeluzole</b> to CaM were explored by docking studies based on the X-ray crystal structures of several trifluoperazine-CaM complexes. An estimated dissociation constant in good agreement with the experimental one was found and the main aminoacidic residues and interactions contributing to complex formation were highlighted.

This study evaluates the independent effect of pre-stroke use of beta-blockers on ischaemic stroke severity and 3 months functional outcome. Methods: Pre-stroke use of beta-blockers was investigated in 1375 ischaemic stroke patients who had been included in two placebo-controlled trials with <b>lubeluzole.</b> Stroke severity was assessed by either the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or the European Stroke Scale (ESS).

40|$|Lot of {{advancement}} {{has taken}} place, {{not only in}} the management but also in the pathophysiology and imaging modalities in patients of stroke. Indolent chronic infections, particularly those due to H. pylori, have been identified as one of the risk factors.

CT angiography identifies abnormalities in the &#x 2032;circle of willis&#x 2032; in posterior circulation strokes much better, and helps weigh the risk versus benefit of thrombolysis. With experiance in use of r-TPA, the list of contra indications and precautions has become longer than its indications. Newer drugs like <b>lubeluzole</b> and edselen have also been recommended.

The {{aim of this}} study is to further analyse the relation between UA and outcome after acute ischemic stroke. Methods: We analysed UA levels in blood samples collected within 6 h of stroke onset from patients included in the placebo arm of the US and Canadian <b>Lubeluzole</b> Ischemic Stroke Study (LUB-INT- 9). We compared mean serum UA levels in patients with and without early neurological improvement (>= 4 versus Results: UA levels of 226 patients were available for analysis. Mean serum UA levels were not significantly higher in patients with than without early neurological improvement (0. 33 mmol/L versus 0. 30 mmol/L, p = 0. 070). The difference between patients with good and patients with poor functional outcome was borderline statistically significant (0. 34 mmol/L versus 0. 31 mmol/L, p = 0. 050). After adjustment for confounders, higher serum UA levels were neither associated with early neurological improvement OR (1. 30, 95 % CI 0. 98 - 1. 73, p = 0. 069), nor with a good functional outcome (OR 1. 09, 95 % CI 0. 72 - 1. 65, p = 0. 690).

40|$|Background and Purpose-Insulin-like {{growth factor}} I (IGF-I) is neuroprotective in animal models of stroke. We {{investigated}} whether serum IGF-I levels {{in patients with}} acute ischemic stroke influence stroke severity and outcome. Methods-Concentrations of IGF-I and IGF binding protein 3 were measured in serum samples obtained within 6 hours after stroke onset from 255 patients {{who took part in}} the placebo arm of the United States and Canadian <b>Lubeluzole</b> in Acute Ischemic Stroke Study. Stroke severity was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the overall shift in modified Rankin Scale score and changes in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at 3 months. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis to investigate factors influencing survival. Results-After controlling for statistically relevant risk factors, subjects with high IGF-I levels or IGF-I/IGF binding protein 3 ratios had a better neurological and functional outcome at 3 months. Baseline stroke severity was not different between high and low IGF-I groups. In contrast to the low IGF-I group, neurological symptoms gradually improved from Day 3 in the high IGF-I group.

The relation between serum glucose measured within 6 h after stroke onset and functional outcome was investigated in 1375 ischaemic stroke patients who had been included in two placebo-controlled trials with <b>lubeluzole.</b> The endpoint was a favourable outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score 8 mmol/l. A possible concentration-dependent effect of glucose on outcome was investigated in both lacunar and non-lacunar stroke. Multivariate analysis showed that hyperglycaernia was associated with decreased odds of a favourable outcome in non-lacunar stroke (OR 0. 60; 95 % CI 0. 41 - 0. 88, P = 0. 009), but with increased odds of a favourable outcome in lacunar stroke (multivariate OR for glucose > 8 mmol/l: 2. 70; 95 % CI 1. 01 - 713, P = 0. 048). In non-lacunar stroke, there appeared to be a concentration-effect relation, as the odds of favourable outcome gradually decreased with increasing glucose levels. In lacunar stroke, an association with favourable outcome was observed with glucose levels > 8 mmol/l, but this beneficial effect diminished with more severe hyperglycaernia > 12 mmol/l. In conclusion, hyperglycaernia has a detrimental effect in non-lacunar stroke, but moderate hyperglycaernia may be beneficial in lacunar stroke...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the sodium}} channel blocker {{mexiletine}} {{is considered the}} first-line drug in myotonia, some patients experiment adverse effects, while others do not gain any benefit. Other antimyotonic drugs are thus needed to offer mexiletine alternatives. In the present study, we used a previously-validated rat model of myotonia congenita to compare six marketed sodium channel blockers to mexiletine. Myotonia was induced in the rat by injection of anthracen- 9 -carboxylic acid, a muscle chloride channel blocker. The drugs were given orally and myotonia was evaluated by measuring the time of righting reflex. The drugs were also tested on sodium currents recorded in a cell line transfected with the human skeletal muscle sodium channel hNav 1. 4 using patch-clamp technique. In vivo, carbamazepine and propafenone showed antimyotonic activity at doses similar to mexiletine (ED 50 close to 5 mg/kg); flecainide and orphenadrine showed greater potency (ED 50 near 1 mg/kg); <b>lubeluzole</b> and riluzole were the more potent (ED 50 near 0. 1 mg/kg). The antimyotonic activity of drugs in vivo was linearly correlated with their potency in blocking hNav 1. 4 channels in vitro. Deviation was observed for propafenone and carbamazepine, likely due to pharmacokinetics and multiple targets. The comparison of the antimyotonic dose calculated in rats with the current clinical dose in humans strongly suggests that all the tested drugs may be used safely {{for the treatment of}} human myotonia.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of therapeutic interventions in acute stroke trials is traditionally measured with the modified Rankin scale (mRs) and the Barthel index (BI). The mRs {{is a global}} disability scale divided into six steps from total independence to total dependence. The BI assesses ten basal activities of daily living, of which eight assess level of dependence (bathing, grooming, using stairs, dressing, feeding, toilet use, transfers and walking). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between the mRs and the total scores and item-scores of the BI. During a period of 3 months mRs and BI scores were collected from two multicentre randomised, placebo-controlled trials with <b>lubeluzole</b> (515 and 519 patients). In each patient we compared the mRs grades with the total BI score and the scores on the ten subitems. For both trials there was extensive overlap of BI scores between mRs grades and a wide range in BI scores among patients with mRs grades 3 and 4. We also found discrepancies between the BI item-scores and mRs grades. About 40 % of patients with mRs grades 1 (able to carry out all usual activities) and 2 (able to look after own affairs without assistance) were not independent on at least one activity of the BI. In both studies, about 30 % of the patients needed help or supervision for walking, although they were classified as mRs 3 (requiring some help but able to walk without assistance). Investigators in stroke trials use the mRs as a subjective global disability scale, and they do not strictly take into account limitations in performing specific basal activities of daily living, as assessed by the BI, to assign mRs grades...|$|E
40|$|Background Ischaemic stroke affects {{more women}} than men. Gender {{influence}} on several aspects of ischaemic stroke has been revealed through the years. Stroke aetiology shows several gender differences, among others due to hormones. Women are significantly older, tend to have less traditional stroke symptoms, possibly have more severe strokes and have more co-morbidity and handicap pre-stroke. Partly {{as a consequence of}} this, they experience significant longer pre- and in-hospital delays, receive less diagnostic tests and are less intensively treated. Ultimately this results in worse functional outcomes and more post-stroke handicap. The golden standard of treatment in acute ischaemic stroke is intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Evidence of the gender specific efficacy of this treatment is not unequivocal. This study aimed to study the gender specific efficacy and safety of thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in ischaemic stroke. The hypothesis of a better efficacy of treatment in women was tested. Methods Data were obtained from two separate databases; rtPA-treated patients from the University Medical Center Groningen registry and placebo-treated patients from the United States and Canadian <b>Lubeluzole</b> Ischaemic Stroke Study (LUB-INT- 9). We examined gender specific favourable outcome; defined as a modified Rankin Scale 0 - 2 in both groups. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results Among 909 patients (63 %) were treated with rtPA and the remaining had received placebo-treatment. Men treated with rtPA had significant more favourable outcome compared to rtPA-treated women (52 % vs 43 %), no gender differences were found in placebo-treated patients. In a multivariable analysis no significant independent association between gender and functional outcome was found in either of the cohorts. The interaction between gender and rtPA treatment was not significant. Safety of treatment was similar in men and women. Conclusion The hypothesis of a better efficacy of rtPA treatment in women could not be confirmed in this study. The result of our rtPA-treated cohort suggests that treatment nullifies the worse functional outcome in untreated women. ...|$|E
