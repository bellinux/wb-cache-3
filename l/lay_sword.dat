For it does not need either the accolade or the bath to cause {{a man to be}} a true knight of God's making; nor does it need that a mortal King should <b>lay</b> <b>sword</b> upon shoulder to constitute a man the fellow of such knightly company as that whose history I am herewith writing; it needs only that he should prove himself at all times worthy in the performance of his duty, and that he shall not consider the hope of reward, or of praise of others in the performance of that duty.|$|E

60|$|And when {{he looked}} beneath it, on the ground <b>lay</b> a <b>sword</b> of bronze, with a hilt of {{glittering}} gold, and by it a pair of golden sandals; and he caught them up, and burst through the bushes like a wild boar, and leapt to his mother, holding them high above his head.|$|R

60|$|The {{manner of}} his watch was this. At dusk, {{he entered the}} house {{in the same way as}} when the {{locksmith}} bore him company, kindled a light, went through the rooms, and narrowly examined them. That done, he returned to the chamber on the ground-floor, and <b>laying</b> his <b>sword</b> and pistols on the table, sat by it until morning.|$|R

"Don't apologise {{for your}} quarters, Jeff," [...] {{returned}} my friend, <b>laying</b> his <b>sword</b> and revolver on the table; [...] "the {{house is a}} palace compared with some places I've inhabited of late. The last, for instance, was so filthy that I believe, on my conscience, an irish pig, with an average allowance of self-respect, would have declined to occupy it.--Here it is, you'll find it somewhere near the middle." ...|$|R

50|$|The Kalevide is so grief-stricken he abdicates {{and places}} his kingdom {{in the hands}} of Olev. The Kalevide leaves for a {{peaceful}} life {{on the banks of the}} river Koiva. He does not get the peace he desires and is annoyed by many visitors, some aggressive. He wanders around the country annoyed by these intrusions and makes his way to Lake Peipus. He wades into Kääpa, the brook where his old <b>sword</b> <b>lay,</b> and the <b>sword</b> keeps its promise to cut off the feet of anyone who dares wade in the brook. Unfortunately the Kalevide had forgotten this promise and his feet are cut off.|$|R

50|$|The Master Sword was {{inspired}} by the Arthurian legend, first mentioned in Welsh mythology; Mabinogion as; 'Caledfwlch' Excalibur. The similarities <b>lay</b> with the <b>swords</b> being kept in stone until the chosen one 'hero' takes it out to save the land.|$|R

Reports from the Sudan, where it was used in close-quarters fighting during the reconquest of the Sudan (1896-'99) were positive. Until 2004, they would be used in courts-martial by escorts of the accused and if the accused was an officer, he'd <b>lay</b> his <b>sword</b> on the table for judgement.|$|R

60|$|Duke Richard of Normandy {{slept in}} the room which had been his father's; Alberic de Montemar, as his page, slept at his feet, and Osmond de Centeville had a bed on the floor, across the door, where he <b>lay</b> with his <b>sword</b> close at hand, as his young Lord's guard and protector.|$|R
