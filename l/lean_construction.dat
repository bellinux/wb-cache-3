40|$|Construction {{productivity}} {{lags behind}} most industries. In general, {{the process of}} construction is carried out in several smaller processes. For the overall construction process to be successful, continuity between these smaller processes must be achieved. This has been the persistent goal of construction productivity improvement for decades now. Waste is generated between the continuing activities by the unpredicted release of work {{and the arrival of}} resources. However, in recent decades the construction industry has a great need to improve its productivity, quality and incorporate new technologies to the industry due to increased foreign competition. In the late 1980 s, researchers started looking at solving this problem in a more general and structured way based on the philosophy and ideology of lean production. In lean, adopting waste identification/reduction, or meeting the client's needs with minimal resources addresses the performance improvement. With recent developments in the construction industry, introduction of building information modeling (BIM) has had a significant influence on <b>leaner</b> <b>construction.</b> They are both complementary in several important ways. Various studies conducted exhibit that BIM is very crucial in reducing the project cost, site conflicts, project duration, error reduction, better and faster design development, and so on. This brings the question; can BIM be used as a tool for <b>leaner</b> <b>construction?</b> The objective of this thesis is to determine how BIM is helping achieve a <b>leaner</b> <b>construction.</b> More and more companies are adopting BIM as an acceptable waste reduction tool. A comprehensive study of lean theory and BIM was conducted, underscoring ways for BIM to help achieve <b>leaner</b> <b>construction.</b> The research was broadly conducted in three different parts. In the first part, a synthesis is drawn from a literature study to show that BIM helps reduce waste, helps in implementing lean techniques, and achieves lean principles. The second part focuses on the data acquired from a construction company to show that BIM helps reduce project cost, duration and conflicts. The third and the last part focused on getting the perspective view of different professionals in the construction industry on BIM by conducting focus interviews. A comprehensive conclusion was derived based on the findings from the three methods adopted. M. S.

40|$|Due {{to the low}} {{productivity}} growth in the construction industry, there are discussions about theories and tools that could support an increased productivity in construction projects. One such ‘theory’ or package of tools is lean. Lean has been used successfully for decades in the car manufacturing industry, Toyota for example, and in other industries as the shipbuilding industry. In the construction industry, {{the use of the}} word lean is not frequently used and construction projects could might implement lean concepts and tools in a greater extent than today. The purpose of this thesis is to increase the productivity in construction projects by evaluating if and in which types of <b>construction</b> projects different <b>lean</b> concepts and tools could be used and when it is worth to implement different lean concepts and tools. The research questions are about if there are any obstacles to implement lean and which lean concepts and tools that are most suitable for different types of construction projects. The findings, that will answer the research questions, are based on a theoretical view from an extensive literature review including prior case studies about lean in general as well as about <b>lean</b> in <b>construction</b> projects. The findings are also based on interviews, about the <b>construction</b> process and <b>lean</b> in <b>construction</b> projects, with managers at different types of projects, constructed by Skanska. Even though lean is already used in some extent in construction projects, the finding is that lean concepts and tools could be used in a greater extent in construction projects without obstacles. In addition to concepts and tools used in the car manufacturing industry, e. g. just-in-time, other concepts and tools have to be added. For example production control and planning are important to support <b>lean</b> in <b>construction</b> projects. In general, lean concepts and tools could be used in all types of construction projects. Some concepts or tools are more preferable in certain types of projects. Lean could be used only by the main contractor, however, to optimize the process by lean concepts and tool, it is preferable if the whole chain is adopting lean thinking. As a final comment, construction projects are not like car manufacturing facilities with repetitive work and products. But the construction industry has to take impact from it and the future will be more like the car industry, if the quality and the architectural creativity could retained in the projects...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis of 2007 shocked and affected {{the entire world}} economy and caused a global recession. The profitability of companies in all business sectors dropped and a myriad of bankruptcies were filed (CBS, 2010 a). At the start of 2010, economies worldwide recovered, as did the Dutch economy. However, even today, one sector is still in contraction: construction (Van de Wal et al., 2011). The current managerial principles prove to be insufficient and {{a need for a}} structural change is apparent. The lean management philosophy is seen as an effective way to achieve better results in construction (Koskela, 1992). This study sets out to obtain empirical evidence for the effectiveness of <b>lean</b> management in <b>construction</b> by comparing housing projects following the lean principles with traditionally conducted housing projects. Within the lean projects we distinguish the use of two main elements of the lean philosophy – the use of lean tools to change the organizational structure and the use of lean teams to change the organizational culture (Garvin, 1998). This way we can discern the most influential factors for success. Administrative data of 33 projects, all produced in the last one and a half years by construction company ‘BAM Woningbouw’, are linked to aggregated project member data, derived from a survey that was conducted for this inquiry. We used a multiple linear regression analysis with several interactions to empirically test our hypotheses. We find that the use of <b>lean</b> management in <b>construction</b> leads to an increased profitability. Both the use of lean tools and the use of lean teams are important for obtaining the best results. As the use of lean tools is obvious when implementing <b>lean</b> management in <b>construction,</b> particularly the added value of using lean teams to realize a change in the organizational culture is an important issue in the process of recovery from the {{economic crisis}}...|$|R

40|$|Hazard means ‘what can go wrong’ {{and risk}} is the {{combination}} of ‘how often’ and ‘how bad it will be’. Risk Assessment {{is the process of}} evaluating risks, arising from hazards, taking into account the adequacy of any existing controls, and deciding whether or not risks are acceptable, where as whole process is the risk management. Risk Management is paramount in running a business or a project. Although Structural Engineer or Construction Manager of a project is aware of hazards and related risks, unless they are assessed, identified, analysed, evaluated, treated, communicated, monitored and reviewed, there might be consequences, including leading to business risks with financial implications. Business risks could emanate at Design, Construction and Management Processes. See Figure 1 Risk Management starts at the conceptual design stage to final design, and then through to Construction and Management Processes. Structural Engineers’ main responsibility is to ensure that the structure he designs is ‘Fit for Use’. At the outset of a project, Structural Engineer should plan to determine hazards and related risks that could arise at Construction, Maintenance and demolition stages and needs to take actions for eliminating and or designing out risks. Information, regarding residual risks- cannot be eliminated by design actions must be informed to all parties concerned in a project. In oil and gas industry, design integrity checks and HAZOPS are carried out to eliminate risks. There should be an effective risk management process to determine and manage risks arising from Health and Safety, environment aspects, quality, waste, wastage and most importantly in 2 maintaining the Technical Integrity- ensure that construction is performed in accordance with design specification and drawings. Waste Plan and <b>Lean</b> <b>Constructions</b> could be useful tools for managing risks during the construction phase. Lack of a system for controlling management of change would bring disastrous results.

40|$|Applicability of <b>lean</b> {{principles}} to <b>construction</b> {{might seem to}} require that construction’s differentiating characteristics be softened or explained away. This is the strategy employed by those who advocate making construction more like the manufacturing from which lean thinking originated. Following that line of thought, successive waves of implementation would leave ever smaller remainders that are not yet reduced to manufacturing, and consequently not yet capable of being made lean. This approach offers tremendous opportunity for reducing the time and cost of constructed facilities. However, for our part, {{we are interested in}} that remainder, in understanding its peculiar characteristics, and in learning how to make it lean. Our interest is founded on the belief that construction is a fundamentally different kind of production; i. e., that there is an irreducible remainder. We also suspect that learning how to make <b>construction</b> <b>lean</b> will help show the way to the manufacturing of the future. Manufacturing is becoming more like construction. Far from being the most backward, in our view, construction can be among the leading edge industries in lean thinking. Adopting a single-minded strategy of transforming construction into manufacturing would be precisely the wrong thing to do. This paper explains the need to develop lean thinking for dynamic construction and lays the groundwork for a subsequent paper “Implementing Lean Construction”, in which these strategies are further developed...|$|R
