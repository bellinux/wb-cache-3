50|$|The {{most common}} phosphenes are {{pressure}} phosphenes, caused by rubbing or applying pressure {{on or near}} the closed eyes. They have been known since antiquity, and described by the Greeks. The pressure mechanically stimulates the cells of the retina. Experiences include a darkening of the visual field that moves against the rubbing, a diffuse colored patch that also moves against the rubbing, a scintillating and ever-changing and deforming <b>light</b> <b>grid</b> with occasional dark spots (like a crumpling fly-spotted flyscreen), and a sparse field of intense blue points of light. Pressure phosphenes can persist briefly after the rubbing stops and the eyes are opened, allowing the phosphenes to be seen on the visual scene. Hermann von Helmholtz and others have published drawings of their pressure phosphenes. One example of a pressure phosphene is demonstrated by gently pressing the side of one's eye and observing a colored ring of light on the opposite side, as detailed by Isaac Newton.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Structured light vision {{systems have}} been {{successfully}} used for accurate measurement of 3 -D surfaces in computer vision. However, their applications are mainly limited to scanning stationary objects so far since tens of images have to be captured for recovering one 3 -D scene. This paper presents an idea for real-time acquisition of 3 -D surface data by a specially coded vision system. To achieve 3 -D measurement for a dynamic scene, the data acquisition must be performed with only a single image. A principle of uniquely color-encoded pattern projection is proposed to design a color matrix for improving the reconstruction efficiency. The matrix is produced by a special code sequence {{and a number of}} state transitions. A color projector is controlled by a computer to generate the desired color patterns in the scene. The unique indexing of the light codes is crucial here for color projection since it is essential that each <b>light</b> <b>grid</b> be uniquely identified by incorporating local neighborhoods so that 3 -D reconstruction can be performed with only local analysis of a single image. A scheme is presented to describe such a vision processing method for fast 3 -D data acquisition. Practical experimental performance is provided to analyze the efficiency of the proposed methods.

40|$|Cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) {{has been widely}} adopted in clinical practice for image-guided radiotherapy. Soft tissue contrast and Hounsfield units are impaired {{to the presence of}} scattered radiation. In our previous work, we proposed a high selectivity anti-scatter grid (ASG) as a possible solution to the problem. An alternative approach is the application of iterative scatter correction using deconvolution with scatter point spread function (PSF). The purpose of this work was to compare the performance of ASGs with different selectivity with and without the iterative and uniform scatter corrections in terms of CBCT image quality. A secondary objective {{of this study was to}} develop a novel measurement approach to measure the scatter point spread functions. The scatter PSF was modeled as a sum of two bivariate Gaussian functions. The PSF parameters were estimated from a series of transmission measurements through polystyrene slabs of varying thickness with lead partial beam-blocker for three different ASG designs ranging from low (5. 6), medium (9), and high (11) selectivity. The scatter correction scheme is based on iterative convolution of the current estimate of the primary with the scatter PSF until the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the measured projection and the sum of the estimate of primary and scatter falls below a predefined threshold. The image quality was evaluated with the CIRS CBCT Image Quality and Electron Density phantom in a head and neck and pelvis configuration and the CIRS Virtual Male Human Patient. The image quality was quantified by the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) relative to the uncorrected scans and the root mean square deviation of the average gray values for different regions with respect to the nominal Hounsfield units and the mean difference of the reconstructed HU between the planning CT and CBCTs of the virtual human phantom. For the head and neck phantom, the CNR increased with more advanced scatter correction algorithm and the ASG selectivity, reaching 3. 9, 3. 7, 3. 5, and 3. 1 for the high, medium, light, and with no grid configuration, respectively, combined with the iterative software correction. The same is true for the pelvis phantom with CNR improvement reaching 1. 5 for the heavy and medium grid, 1. 3 for the <b>light</b> <b>grid,</b> and 1. 1 on its own. The HU RMSD for the head and neck phantom was 22 HU, 13 HU, 12 HU, and 6 HU for iterative correction without the grid, with the <b>light</b> <b>grid,</b> medium grid and the heavy grid, respectively. For same correction strategies, the values for the pelvis phantom where 170, 120, 34, and 27 HU. The average difference with the PCT of the virtual human phantom was 59 ± 48 HU and 63 ± 59 HU with scans reconstructed with the iterative correction and two higher selectivity grids. Visual inspection revealed similar trends for a head-and-neck and prostate cancer patient. The best scatter mitigation strategy was found to be a combination of a grid with selectivity larger than 9, combined with iterative scatter estimation. None of the investigated grids required increasing the imaging dose. The PSF determined using proposed method leads to image quality improvements results for all but one of the investigated scenario...|$|E
40|$|We present {{details of}} Tiled and Clustered Forward Shading in its {{application}} to rendering transparent geometry and using Multi Sampling Anti Aliasing (MSAA). We detail how transparency and MSAA is supported, and present performance results measured on modern GPUs. Previous techniques for handling large numbers of lights are usually based on deferred shading [Andersson 2009; Lauritzen 2010]. However, deferred shading techniques struggle with impractically large frame buffers when MSAA is used, and make supporting transparency difficult. In addition, deferred shading {{makes it more difficult}} to support custom shaders on geometry. Tiled Forward Shading is a new and highly practical approach to real-time shading scenes with thousands of light sources, introduced by Olsson and Assarsson in 2011 [2011]. Their results, measured on an GTX 280 GPU, indicated that tiled forward shading was impractically slow. Performance on more recent GPUs has improved considerably (approaching that of tiled deferred), which opens up the possibility of using the technique to support transparency and MSAA. Clustered Shading further extends tiled shading by adding depth partitioning [Olsson et al. 2012]. We show how Clustered Forward Shading can be extended to support transparency efficiently. Forward shading naturally supports both transparency and MSAA, which has been shown in previous work. However, the performance and implementation details have not previously been investigated. We provide details on how to construct the <b>light</b> <b>grid</b> for use with transparency. When the transparent geometry is considered, the depth range optimization cannot be fully used. Instead, only a more conventional hierarchical depth test can be used. The grid structure can be built once, and quickly pruned to prepare a more efficient instance for opaque geometry. However, as each transparent layer must consider all the lights in the tile, performance does not scale linearly with the depth complexity, but far worse (Figure 1, right). To improve on this we extend clustered forward shading by constructing the grid using a pre-pass over all geometry (not just opaque), and flagging clusters as a side effect. This allows us to quickly find the unique clusters used. As clusters contain only space around actual samples that need shading, efficiency is much better (Figure 1, left). For deferred shading a single 1080 p, 16 x MSAA, 16 -bit float RGBA buffer requires over 250 Mb of memory. In addition, each sample may need to be shaded individually, effectively running shading at a per-sample frequency. For forward shading, no G-Buffers are required and MSAA is trivially enabled. A brief performance and memory comparison is shown in Figure 2, showing that clustered forward outperforms tiled forward by more than 2 times, and also outperforms tiled deferred, if MSAA is used...|$|E
