40|$|We {{study the}} vortex {{state in a}} {{magnetic}} field parallel to the c axis {{in the framework of}} the extended Ginzburg Landau equation. We find the vortex acquires a fourfold modulation proportional to cos(4 ϕ) where ϕ is the angle r makes with the a-axis. This term gives rise to an attractive interaction between two vortices when they are aligned parallel to (1, 1, 0) or (1,- 1, 0).

After irradiation at 10 K, the TSL glow curve shows the presence of a strong peak at 50 K, together with additional structures at approximately 20 and 170 K. The TSL spectrum is dominated by the characteristic doublet emission due to transitions from the lowest energy level of the 5 d configuration to the spin-orbit split F- 2 ground state of Ce 3 +. Above RT, the glow curve exhibits a peak at 60 degreesC, whose spectrum is again dominated by Ce 3 + emission. The TSL emission is in accordance with radio-luminescence (RL) spectra performed in the 10 - 300 K region.

40|$|A general {{feature of}} the {{pathways}} for the assembly of double-stranded DNA phages and viruses is the assembly of coat and scaffolding subunits into a precursor shell or procapsid, followed by packaging of the genomic DNA into the shell.

Such lattice transitions have also been observed with adenoviruses and herpesviruses. In re-organizing into the mature capsid lattice, each subunit of the precursor lattice must change its conformation, or its relationship with its neighbours, or both.

Furthermore, we show how to compute bisimilarity symbolically via BDDs by defining an operation on BDDs that approximates an element of a Boolean algebra into a lattice.
