5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank.

In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to put the revolt down. To her frustration, he made <b>little</b> <b>progress</b> and returned to England in defiance of her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered in 1603, a few days after Elizabeth's death.

The South Koreans soon {{found themselves in a}} seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of 25 October. The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong, completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Aided by airdrops, the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group, the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on 27 October. Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made <b>little</b> <b>progress,</b> and the fighting stopped by 28 October.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of the shutdown, there was <b>little</b> <b>progress</b> and neither the {{governor}} nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making <b>little</b> <b>progress</b> on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E
30|$|The binding {{sites for}} the imaging tracers {{described}} above are all located on the extracellular domain of the c-MET receptor; however, the initial molecular event that leads to malignant development is the abnormal activation of the receptor’s tyrosine kinases, which {{are located in the}} intracellular domain of c-MET, and which will ultimately trigger downstream signaling pathways. Thus, molecular imaging based on small molecule probes with intracellular binding site can provide more roundly information about the c-MET activation status. Small molecule imaging probes, with their low molecular weight and size, are rapidly cleared and have higher permeability, and in particular, those based on c-MET-TKI have attractive properties, such as being non-toxic and easily accessible for clinical translation. However, to date, <b>little</b> <b>progresses</b> {{have been made in the}} development of small molecule imaging agents.|$|R

5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>progress</b> {{was made}} {{the next day}} as Byng {{directed}} that the focus for the day was to simply consolidate the gains made and prepare for a further movement forward on 23 August. The relative inactivity of 22 August encouraged von Below in {{a belief that the}} attacks of the previous day were a failure. Seeking to take advantage, he arranged for counterattacks to be mounted by the 17th Army, and these resulted in the loss of Dovecot, which overlooked the New Zealand positions. The machine gun battalion of 42nd Division provided key support in driving off the counterattacks which, according to prisoners of war captured during the action, was launched by 52nd Infantry Division, largely made up of men from the Grand Duchy of Baden, which had newly arrived in the sector from Flanders.|$|E

Should the two brigades successfully link up {{to the east of}} Bapaume, they would attack into the town from there. However, <b>little</b> <b>progress</b> was made in the south. The 63rd Division was still struggling to capture Thilloy while the advance of the 2nd Wellington Battalion, the leading unit of the 1st Infantry Brigade, was checked by gunfire from Bapaume on its right and from its left. The Wellington men had to eventually withdraw to their starting positions.|$|E

Eddie Thompson purchased the club from McLean in 2002 and invested heavily in the team, but with <b>little</b> <b>progress</b> made until Craig Levein became manager in 2006 and successfully restructured the youth system. Shortly after Levein's departure, the club won the Scottish Cup for a second time in 2010 under the management of Peter Houston. After several relatively successful seasons, a slump in form led to United being relegated in 2016. The first attempt to return ended in defeat to Hamilton in the final round of promotion playoffs.|$|E
