40|$|Companies {{successfully}} applying {{product line}} approaches often follow a long-term strategy {{and need to}} plan product portfolios years ahead. For instance in the automotive industry, managers constantly make decisions about future product evolution, like the LED tail lights will be introduced with the next facelift and the <b>LED</b> <b>front</b> <b>lights</b> two years later". With a raising number of features, feature changes, and evolution steps, a systematic approach for evolution planning becomes essential. However, there is only very little support for such evolution in model-based product line engineering so far. This paper presents an approach for extending modeldriven product line engineering towards automated and toolsupported techniques for product line evolution. We provide a feature-based approach to model the variability over time and a catalogue of change operators for feature models...|$|R

40|$|A {{machine vision}} system to {{evaluate}} harvested paddy grain quality during harvesting using double lighting was developed. The prototype {{consisted of a}} low-cost web camera and two lighting systems: a ring white <b>LED</b> for <b>front</b> <b>lighting,</b> and a flat dome white LED light for backlighting. Both lighting systems were arranged in a coaxial axis, making the system simple, compact and easy to handle. The aim {{of the system is}} to analyse the captured images and determine the amount of unwanted materials (rachis branch, grass and leaves, and stems) and damaged grain (brown and crack rice) present in the paddy as it is being harvested. In this paper, we introduce {{the first step in the}} development of the system: the design and selection of components to optimize the performance of the system to monitor harvested paddy grain quality. The idea would be to mount the system on top of the inlet channel of the grain tank of a combine harvester to provide real-time assessment of harvesting operational parameters...|$|R
5000|$|All 24 trams were {{refurbished}} between 2008 and 2009, {{which involved}} a deep clean, installation of new seats {{and a new}} lime green, blue and white external livery. The fleet is also progressively being fitted with new <b>front</b> <b>LED</b> <b>lights.</b> 2534 {{was the first to}} receive them following a collision with a Warburtons Lorry. Since then, cars 2531-2536, 2536-2544, 2546 and 2548-2553 have been fitted with the new <b>front</b> <b>lights.</b> 2553 was involved in a serious road traffic accident and was taken out of service for a number of months. It has recently returned to service after being repaired at the Therapia Lane depot, and during the repair a [...] "refresh" [...] was also carried out. The [...] "refresh" [...] involved a deep clean of all floorings, as well as a full interior repaint and repaint of all handrails and overhead handles.|$|R
2500|$|Work {{on a new}} Esprit {{had started}} as early as 2006 under Carr. The car was {{unveiled}} during Donato Coco's tenure as design chief and was to have featured a futuristic front-end with <b>LED</b> <b>front</b> daytime running <b>lights</b> and a centre-mounted dual exhaust system in the rear. Power was {{to come from a}} 5.0litre V8 engine delivering up to [...] through a 7 speed dual-clutch transaxle. A KERS system was to be optional. The interior was to have a futuristic but minimal design which included a digital instrument cluster, a sport steering wheel and carbon fibre trim scattered throughout the cabin.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of adaptive <b>front</b> <b>lighting</b> systems for vehicles has increased road safety and drivers' comfort significantly {{within the last}} years. A next step in this development is the realization of higher resolution systems to further increase the functionality of vehicle headlamps toward fully adaptive <b>front</b> <b>lighting</b> systems. In this paper, we present a short overview on highly dynamic <b>front</b> <b>lighting</b> systems and the essential technologies for their realization. Different approaches are compared and evaluated regarding their applications for headlamp systems.
