This Final Project Assignment is about making MTM-UAS analysis in the assembly process in Switch assembly line which is consist of 5 <b>work</b> <b>stations.</b> The MTM-UAS analysis is made for each <b>work</b> <b>station,</b> and made based on Work Instruction and a video recording. It is useful to know the Useful Time (UT) and also determine the Design Coefficient (KD) in Switch assembly line. The MTM-UAS flowchart is made using the MTM 2003 software. Improvements to its <b>work</b> <b>station</b> are made from the result of its KD. The improvements are made to <b>work</b> <b>station</b> that have KD below 0. 7 - 0. 8.

Also to re-design the <b>work</b> <b>station,</b> if necessary, in order to improve productivity, health safety and comfort of the operators in the <b>work</b> <b>station.</b> Design/Methodology/Approach: Optimising the acoustic design of the <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> can be a complex task {{because of the number of}} design parameters that must be considered. This problem has been made much easier by designing for the permissible acoustic limit. Because of the nature of the selected <b>work</b> <b>station,</b> Nomograph estimation method was used. Finally Doppler Effect was used to calculate the permissible acoustic distances between the sources of noise and operators in the <b>work</b> <b>station.</b> Finding: The <b>work</b> <b>station</b> have been examined under the combination of different acoustic parameters. The analysis of the results indicates some deficiencies in the design of the workstation based on the design parameters and standard values from the literatures. Based on the analysis of these results the operators and their clients may likely be exposed to fatigue, work stress and other related diseases. Research Limitation/Implication: For demonstration of the application of the permissible acoustic design approach, a computer operator <b>work</b> <b>station</b> (Open Plan Cyber café) has been re-designed as a real case. The new design it is hoped will contribute to improvement in productivity, health safety and comfort of the operators in the workstation Practical Implication: The proposed permissible acoustic design approach encourages Industrial/Design Engineers that standard permissible acoustic limit must be strictly followed, for the safety of the workers and site of computer operator <b>work</b> <b>station</b> should be in a place of reasonable serenity for maximum concentration. Originality/Value: Reports reveal that acoustic design of an open plan computer operator <b>work</b> <b>station</b> has never been done using multiple acoustic design parameters.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} an integer programming algorithm for assigning tasks on {{an assembly line}} to <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> {{in such a way}} that the number of <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> is minimal for the rate of production desired. The procedure insures that no task is assigned to a <b>work</b> <b>station</b> before all tasks which technologically must be performed before it have been assigned (precedence restrictions are not violated), and that the total time required at each <b>work</b> <b>station</b> performing the tasks assigned to it does not exceed the time available (cycle time restrictions are not violated). The procedure is based on a systematic evaluation (enumeration) of all possible task assignments to <b>work</b> <b>stations.</b> Significant portions of the enumeration process are performed implicitly, however, by utilizing tests described in the paper which are based on the specific structure of the line balancing problem. An artifice termed a network cut is also developed which eliminates from explicit consideration the assignment of tasks to <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> where such assignments would not lead to improved line balances. Results reported demonstrate that the procedure can obtain optimal balances for assembly lines with between 50 and 100 tasks in a reasonable amount of computation time and with modest computer storage requirements. production/scheduling: line balancing, programming: integer algorithms, enumerative, networks/graphs...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on a {{computational}} experiment designed to assess the efficacy of 26 heuristic decision rules which group work tasks into <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> along an assembly line such {{that the number of}} <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> required is minimized. The heuristic decision rules investigated vary from simple list processing procedures that consider a single attribute of each work task for assignment, to procedures which are optimal seeking, but which have had their search terminated through the imposition of a limit on the amount of computation time that can be devoted to each search. Also included are heuristic decision rules which backtrack in an attempt to locate an improved solution, and decision rules which probabilistically search for improved solutions. Our investigation differs from those reported previously, in that the objective in balancing each line is to determine the minimum number of <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> for a given limit on the time available for assembly at each <b>work</b> <b>station</b> (the cycle time). Previous approaches have investigated the problem of determining the minimum cycle time for a given line length. We also compare the results obtained with the optimal solution for a subset of the problems investigated. Both problems which have appeared in the open literature and problems which have been solved for the first time are included. Because a portion of our results differ from those reported previously, we suggest why these differences have occurred. Guidelines are also given to those balancing industrial assembly lines on the choice of the heuristic decision rule to use whether one is attempting to obtain a minimum station balance given a limit on the time available for assembly at each <b>work</b> <b>station,</b> or whether one is attempting to minimize the time devoted to assembly at a <b>work</b> <b>station</b> given a limit on the number of <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> available. production/scheduling: line balancing, networks/graphs: applications, facilities/equipment planning: design...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we will {{consider}} production lines, which consist of several <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> in series, possibly with buffers in between. A <b>work</b> <b>station</b> {{is a group of}} (parallel) machines or operators performing one or more operations on the jobs. One of the issues in the design of production lines is the (minimal) capacity (i. e., number of machines or operators) that is required to achieve a certain target throughput level T H. Denote the number of machines by m, and let W be the total work content of a job. Then, the maximum number of units work that can be processed per time unit is equal to m, and the amount of work that should be done per time unit is T H · W. Hence, to realize a target throughput T H, we need m ≥ T H · W. (1) Usually m should be greater than this minimum, due to line unbalance, variability in processing times, failures, etc. Other issues in the design and operation of production lines are, e. g., the degree of paralleling of <b>work</b> <b>stations,</b> location and size of buffers in between workstations, choice of the material handling system, allocation of tasks to <b>work</b> <b>stations,</b> and the assignment of operators to <b>work</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
