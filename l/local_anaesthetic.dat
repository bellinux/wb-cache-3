5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis.

An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic.</b>|$|E
30|$|Intraperitoneal {{administration}} of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> has been evaluated for several different laparoscopic procedures [25 – 29]. It {{is based on}} the theory that the instillation of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> in the peritoneal cavity blocks the visceral afferent signalling, thereby resulting in reduced nociception [30]. The literature presented in this review does not support the use of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> for SP reduction in benign gynaecological laparoscopy. None of the studies could demonstrate a reduction in incidence, and only two out of six studies reported a significant reduction in the severity of SP [10, 14]. Despite this, three out of six studies found a significant reduction of post-operative analgesic consumption [10, 11, 14]. The present evidence does not support a widespread use of intraperitoneal <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> in benign gynaecological laparoscopy for reduction of SP. Besides a local effect in the peritoneal cavity, the analgesic effect of intraperitoneal <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> could also be mediated through systemic absorption. There are measurable plasma levels of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> shortly after intraperitoneal administration due to absorption over the peritoneal surface. A potential risk with {{administration of}} intraperitoneal <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> is that the dosage is difficult to control. Although plasma levels of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> have been reported to be close to and above safe threshold, no clinical toxicity or adverse effects have thus far been reported [31]. It cannot be ruled out that <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> can be used to reduce SP after laparoscopic surgery for benign gynaecological disease, but further studies are warranted before a general recommendation can be made.|$|R

40|$|The present {{randomised}} controlled study {{compared the}} 3 -year outcome of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> with anaesthetics and lavage in patients suffering from painful temporomandibular joint (TMJ) locking. The study included 45 patients referred {{for treatment of}} temporomandibular disorders (TMD) to the Department of Orofacial Pain and Jaw Function, Faculty of Odontology, Malmo University, Malmo, Sweden. All patients received a history questionnaire and clinical examination according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD, panoramic radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging at baseline. Twenty-five patients were randomised to anaesthetics alone and 20 patients to anaesthetics and lavage. Three years after treatment, we sent the 37 patients who were available for follow-up a questionnaire that evaluated pain intensity, physical and emotional functioning, and global improvement. Thirty-four patients responded. The primary outcome was defined as >= 30 % pain relief. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 28 of 45 patients (62 %) reported >= 30 % pain relief at the follow-up. At 3 years, improvement in pain relief, physical functioning, emotional functioning and global improvement differed non-significantly between <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> and anaesthetics and lavage. Compared with baseline, significant improvements (P < 0. 05) in pain intensity, physical functioning, emotional functioning and global changes had occurred in both groups after 3 years. Because outcome measurements in the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> and lavage and the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> groups differed non-significantly 3 years after treatment of painful TMJ disc displacement without reduction, use of lavage (50 mL saline) has an equivalent effect as <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Contact allergy to <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> is {{relatively}} common. Patch testing with benzocaine in the European baseline series {{is recommended for}} diagnosis, even though a caine mix has been previously suggested to be superior. OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency and patterns of contact allergy to <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> by using a caine mix (benzocaine, tetracaine, and cinchocaine) in the baseline series, and evaluate its efficiency as compared with benzocaine alone. METHODS: We reviewed the results of 2736 patch tests performed between 2000 and 2010, identifying patients with positive reactions to caine mix or to one of seven <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics.</b> RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients (4. 1 %) {{had at least one}} allergic reaction to local anaesthetics; 86 were tested with all seven <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics,</b> resulting in 71 reactions in 53 patients. Cinchocaine gave the most reactions (50. 7 %); these occurred as a single reaction in 83. 3 % of patients, mostly with current or past relevance (97 %). Benzocaine represented 22. 5 % of reactions, many of which were non-relevant (44 %) or resulting from cross-reactions with para-compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 70 % of allergic reactions to <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> would have been missed if benzocaine had been used as a screening allergen. This study supports a recommendation to replace benzocaine with a caine mix containing cinchocaine in the baseline patch test series...|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{and basic}} science studies have {{demonstrated}} the anti-inflammatory properties of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics.</b> Recent studies have begun to unravel molecular pathways linking inflammation and cancer.

Because cancer is linked to inflammation and <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> have anti-inflammatory effects, these agents may participate in reducing the risk of metastasis, but their mechanism of action is unknown.

In a previous paper we discussed the endocrine effects of extradural <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> and extradural morphine after upper abdominal surgery (Rutberg et al., 1984 a). The main finding was that extradural <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> almost completely abolished the catecholamine response, whereas extradural morphine did not suppress the increase in plasma adrenaline concentration and suppressed only partly the increase in plasma noradrenaline concentrations. Although the extradural administ-ration of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> or morphine did not sup-press the cortisol release immediately after surgery, subsequent postoperative values were lower in both of these groups when compared with a control group.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous studies {{regarding}} {{the effects of}} some <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> have suggested that these agents can cause genetic damage. However, {{they have not been}} tested for genotoxicity related to repetitive administration. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the genotoxic potential of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> upon repetitive administration. METHODS: 80 male Wistar rats were divided into: group A - 16 rats intraperitoneally injected with lidocaine hydrochloride 2 %; group B - 16 rats IP injected with mepivacaine 2 %; group C - 16 rats intraperitoneally injected with articaine 4 %; group D - 16 rats IP injected with prilocaine 3 % (6. 0 mg/kg); group E - 8 rats subcutaneously injected with a single dose of cyclophosphamide; and group F - 8 rats intraperitoneally injected with saline. Eight rats from groups A to D received a single dose of anaesthetic on Day 1 of the experiment; the remaining rats were dosed once a day for 5 days. RESULTS: The median number of micronuclei in the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> groups exposed for 1 or 5 days ranged from 0. 00 to 1. 00, in the cyclophosphamide-exposed group was 10. 00, and the negative control group for 1 and 5 days was 1. 00 and 0. 00, respectively (p 0. 05).

25|$|Chemical eye {{injury is}} due to either an acidic or alkali {{substance}} getting in the eye. Alkalis are typically worse than acidic burns. Mild burns will produce conjunctivitis, while more severe burns may cause the cornea to turn white. Litmus paper is {{an easy way to}} rule out the diagnosis by verifying that the pH is within the normal range of 7.0—7.2.

25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} lidocaine as a <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> {{is characterized by}} a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
