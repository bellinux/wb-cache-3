5|$|After the floods, {{helicopters}} airlifted {{relief supplies}} <b>like</b> <b>food</b> {{and water to}} isolated villages, and to residents riding out the floods on their roofs. However, relief coordination was disrupted by damaged communication lines and ongoing rainfall. Rescue boats were used to rescue stranded residents. India's Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda provided 500million rupees (US$15million) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery. Conditions returned to normal within 12days of the onslaught of the rains, {{with the exception of}} minor delays to trains. However, another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh about three weeks after the flood event, killing over 1,000people.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have used}} height to measure living {{standards}} {{during this time}} as average adult heights can point to a population's net nutrition - the amount of nutrition people grew up with as compared to biological stress which can cause lower heights in adulthood, stemming from things <b>like</b> <b>food</b> deprivation, hard work, and disease. According to military records of American and European men, Americans were on average two to three inches taller than Europeans.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August, the United States, France, United Kingdom and Australia began {{humanitarian}} aid drops, <b>like</b> <b>food,</b> water and medical supplies, {{to help prevent}} a potential massacre against the Shi'a Turkmen minority in Amirli.

25|$|Currency and {{exchange}} were {{important elements of}} trade in the ancient world, enabling people {{to buy and sell}} items <b>like</b> <b>food,</b> pottery and raw materials. If a Greek coin held more gold than an Egyptian coin due to its size or content, then a merchant could barter fewer Greek gold coins for more Egyptian ones, or for more material goods. This is why, {{at some point in their}} history, most world currencies in circulation today had a value fixed to a specific quantity of a recognized standard like silver and gold.|$|E

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} active when a {{familiar}} sound triggers {{a feeling of}} pain from a past event, {{but most of the}} recall is shut out from traumatic event. It is similar to classical conditioning, when a dog hears a bell it begins to react to the noise rather than an exterior variable <b>like</b> <b>food</b> or an electric shock. The use of therapy is constructed for a person with this problem to help avoid the fear associated with sounds or objects, and be able to then recall other pieces of information that happened during the event.|$|E
25|$|Another basic {{drive is}} the sexual drive which <b>like</b> <b>food</b> motivates us {{because it is}} {{essential}} to our survival. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone. Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than woman to think about sex.|$|E

Dietary supplements are eaten or taken by mouth, and are regulated in United States law {{as a type of}} food rather than a type of drug. <b>Like</b> <b>food</b> and unlike drugs, no government approval is required to make or sell dietary supplements; the manufacturer checks the safety of dietary supplements but the government does not; and rather than requiring risk–benefit analysis to prove that the product can be sold like a drug, risk–benefit analysis is only used to petition that food or a dietary supplement is unsafe and should be removed from market.|$|E

25|$|In many jurisdictions (including many American states), {{there is}} a general tax levied {{periodically}} on residents who own personal property (personalty) within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things <b>like</b> <b>food</b> and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household. Any otherwise non-exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household. Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax. If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to personal property tax in that state as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{legality}} of freegan practices of reclaiming wasted food, space, or buildings {{varies depending on}} local laws around property, trespassing, and waste removal. In some places, like New York City, freegans dumpster dive publicly; in other locations, urban foraging is a secretive activity. In recent years, there have been arrests of people dumpster diving for political reasons in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France, although in most locations charges have eventually been dropped. These actions {{could be seen as}} part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival—like sleeping in public places, sharing food without a permit, or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell—that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups <b>like</b> <b>Food</b> Not Bombs and the homeless. Freegans report that stores have responded to waste recovery as well, including deliberately destroying products prior to disposing of them, locking dumpsters, or pouring bleach on food to make it inedible. In France, a new national law bans the practice of destroying food in this way.|$|E
25|$|Government {{safety net}} {{programs}} {{put in place}} since the War on Poverty have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself {{has done little to}} reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today. An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor. A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs <b>like</b> <b>food</b> stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher. Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed nations. Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than lack of it, which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.|$|E

40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study investigated how parents and friends influence adolescents’ <b>food</b> <b>likes</b> and consumption. 709 adolescent-parent and 638 adolescent-friend dyads completed a questionnaire, {{allowing us to}} compare target-parent and target-friend resemblances both on <b>food</b> <b>likes</b> and consumption, while distinguishing between cultural influence and dyadic unique influence. In addition, we identified two psychosocial predictors of resemblance, namely parenting style and adolescents' self-monitoring. As expected, results indicated that authoritative parenting style increased target-parent resemblance in <b>food</b> <b>likes</b> (directly) and consumption (indirectly), and self-monitoring orientation increased target-friend resemblance in <b>food</b> <b>likes</b> (directly) and consumption (indirectly). We also showed that target-friend resemblance was more culture-based than target-parent resemblance, suggesting that parental influence is more specific to the dyadic relation than is peer influence...|$|R
50|$|Spain {{has had an}} {{influence}} in Ulithi since the early 1500s. They left behind things <b>like</b> <b>foods,</b> religious terms, and animals. Some examples of words from Spain are ‘’gato’’ which Ulithian changed to ‘’hatu’’which means cat and ‘’flores’’ which was changed to ‘’floras’’ which means flowers. For example, Spain introduced ‘’cajon’’, which was turned into ‘’kahol’’ which is a crate or box.Since Spain passed through Ulithi {{for such a long}} period of time, the words they left were used because they actually left behind those things. <b>Foods</b> <b>like</b> the potato and squash were brought by the Spanish, so Ulithian uses words based on the Spanish word for them. Spain was also Catholic, so Catholic terms were left behind.|$|R
40|$|The elderly {{population}} is rapidly growing worldwide. In sensory and nutrition research, age-associated losses in sensory function {{are believed to}} change the perception of food, to decrease <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> and consequently to decrease food intake of the elderly, although data {{in support of this}} line of assumptions are currently scarce. Consequently, there is a growing need to understand more about age related changes both in food perception and <b>food</b> <b>liking.</b> Therefore, the present thesis describes research on <b>food</b> perception, <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> and sensory acuity with increasing age. The results demonstrate that the elderly indeed perceive foods differently compared to the young, mainly as less intense in flavour and in creaminess/fattiness. However, their <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> is not reduced, despite these age-related changes in perception. It is concluded that decreased sensory acuity, although causing losses in perception of the elderly, is obviously not causing a reduced <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> and thus may not be the predominant reason for a diminished food intake...|$|R
