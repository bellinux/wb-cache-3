The present {{study was designed to}} examine whether the voltage-dependent K+ channels encoded by the KCNQ gene family (Kv 7 channels) mediate vasodilator effects of kynurenine and whether modulation of these channels ameliorates hypotension caused by this compound. Rat aortas and mesenteric arteries or human omental arteries without endothelium were used. Some rings were incubated with the selective Kv 7 channel inhibitor <b>linopirdine</b> (10  μM). l-Kynurenine (10  μM– 1  mM) induced concentration-dependent relaxation in rat aortas and mesenteric arteries as well as human omental arteries, whereas <b>linopirdine</b> abolished the relaxation. l-Kynurenine (1  mM) produced hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle, which was reversed by <b>linopirdine</b> (10  μM).

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) and voltage-dependent K(+) (KV) channels {{play key}} roles in regulating coronary blood flow {{in response to}} metabolic, ischemic, and paracrine stimuli. The KV channels responsible have not been identified, but KV 7 channels are possible candidates. Existing data regarding KV 7 channel function in the coronary circulation (limited to ex vivo assessments) are mixed. Thus we examined the hypothesis that KV 7 channels are present in cells of the coronary vascular wall and regulate vasodilation in swine. We performed a variety of molecular, biochemical, and functional (in vivo and ex vivo) studies. Coronary arteries expressed KCNQ genes (quantitative PCR) and KV 7. 4 protein (Western blot). Immunostaining demonstrated KV 7. 4 expression in conduit and resistance vessels, perhaps most prominently in the endothelial and adventitial layers. Flupirtine, a KV 7 opener, relaxed coronary artery rings, and this was attenuated by <b>linopirdine,</b> a KV 7 blocker. Endothelial denudation inhibited the flupirtine-induced and linopirdine-sensitive relaxation of coronary artery rings. Moreover, <b>linopirdine</b> diminished bradykinin-induced endothelial-dependent relaxation of coronary artery rings. There was no effect of intracoronary flupirtine or <b>linopirdine</b> on coronary blood flow at the resting heart rate in vivo. <b>Linopirdine</b> {{had no effect on}} coronary vasodilation in vivo elicited by ischemia, H 2 O 2, or tachycardia.

40|$|Exposure to {{cholinergic}} agonists is {{a widely}} used paradigm to induce epileptogenesis in vivo and synchronous activity in brain slices maintained in vitro. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.

To establish whether K(IR) or K(M) blockade could replicate CCh effects, we exposed slices to blockers of these currents in the absence of CCh. K(IR) channel blockade with micromolar Ba(2 +) concentrations induced interictal-like events with duration and frequency that were lower than those observed with CCh; by contrast, the K(M) blocker <b>linopirdine</b> was ineffective. Pre-treatment with Ba(2 +) or <b>linopirdine</b> increased the duration of epileptiform discharges induced by subsequent application of CCh.

Contractile responses to <b>linopirdine</b> and XE 991 were measured in intact and endothelium denuded vessels. Experiments were also carried out under conditions that prevent the contractile effects of nerve released noradrenaline or ATP, or block various Ca 2 + influx pathways, in order to investigate the mechanisms underlying contraction. Results <b>Linopirdine</b> and XE 991 both contracted rat and mouse pulmonary arteries but had little effect on mesenteric arteries.

Conclusion The KCNQ channel blockers are potent and powerful constrictors of pulmonary arteries. This action may be selective for the pulmonary circulation as mesenteric arteries showed little response. The results imply that the drugs act directly on smooth muscle cells and contraction requires voltage-dependent Ca 2 + influx.

Relaxations to acute administration of flupirtine and contractions to K v channel blocking drugs, including the K v 7 channel blocker <b>linopirdine,</b> were measured.

Conclusions and implications : Flupirtine significantly attenuated development of chronic hypoxia-induced PAH in mice and reversed established PAH in SERTSERT &# 43; mice, apparently via K v 7 channel activation. These results provide the first direct evidence that drugs activating K v 7 channels may be of benefit in the treatment of PAH with different aetiologie...|$|E
40|$|Pressor {{effects of}} the {{vasoconstrictor}} hormone arginine vasopres-sin (AVP), observed when systemic AVP concentrations are less than 100 pM, are important for the physiological maintenance of blood pressure, and {{they are also the}} basis for therapeutic use of vasopressin to restore blood pressure in hypotensive patients. However, the mechanisms by which circulating AVP induces ar-terial constriction are unclear. We examined the novel hypothesis that KCNQ potassium channels mediate the physiological vaso-constrictor actions of AVP. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed expression of KCNQ 1, KCNQ 4, and KCNQ 5 in rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells (MASMCs).

40|$|KCNQ 2 (Kv 7. 2) and KCNQ 3 (Kv 7. 3) are {{voltage-gated}} K chan-nel subunits {{that underlie}} the neuronal M current. In humans, mutations in these genes lead to a rare form of neonatal epi-lepsy (Biervert et al., 1998; Singh et al., 1998), suggesting that KCNQ 2 /Q 3 channels may be attractive targets for novel anti-epileptic drugs. In the present study, we have identified the compound N-(6 -chloro-pyridin- 3 -yl) - 3, 4 -difluoro-benzamide (ICA- 27243) as a selective activator of the neuronal M current and KCNQ 2 /Q 3 channels. In SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells, ICA- 27243 produced membrane potential hyperpolar-ization that could be prevented by coadministration with the M-current inhibitors 10, 10 -bis(4 -pyridinylmethyl) - 9 (10 H) -an-thracenone dihydrochloride (XE- 991) and <b>linopirdine.</b> ICA- 27243 enhanced both 86 Rb efflux (EC 50 0. 2 M) an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cholinergic {{transmission}} {{has been}} implicated in learning, memory and cognition. However, the cellular effects induced by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) activation are poorly understood in the neocortex. We investigated {{the effects of the}} cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) and various agonists and antagonists on neuronal activity in rat neocortical slices using intracellular (sharp microelectrode) and field potential recordings. Results CCh increased neuronal firing but reduced synaptic transmission. The increase of neuronal firing was antagonized by pirenzepine (M 1 /M 4 mAChRs antagonist) but not by AF-DX 116 (M 2 /M 4 mAChRs antagonist). Pirenzepine reversed the depressant effect of CCh on excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) but had marginal effects when applied before CCh. AF-DX 116 antagonized the depression of EPSP when applied before or during CCh. CCh also decreased the paired-pulse inhibition of field potentials and the inhibitory conductances mediated by GABA A and GABA B receptors. The depression of paired-pulse inhibition was antagonized or prevented by AF-DX 116 or atropine but only marginally by pirenzepine. The inhibitory conductances were unaltered by xanomeline (M 1 /M 4 mAChRs agonist), yet the CCh-induced depression was antagonized by AF-DX 116. <b>Linopirdine,</b> a selective M-current blocker, mimicked the effect of CCh on neuronal firing. However, <b>linopirdine</b> had no effect on the amplitude of EPSP or on the paired-pulse inhibition, indicating that M-current is involved in the increase of neuronal excitability but neither in the depression of EPSP nor paired-pulse inhibition. Conclusions These data indicate that the three effects are mediated by different mAChRs, the increase in firing being mediated by M 1 mAChR, decrease of inhibition by M 2 mAChR and depression of excitatory transmission by M 4 mAChR. The depression of EPSP and increase of neuronal firing might enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, whereas the concomitant depression of inhibition would facilitate long-term potentiation. Thus, this triade of effects may represent a “neuronal correlate” of attention and learning. </p...|$|E

The present study identified a novel, swelling-activated K+ current in freshly dissociated porcine pigmented ciliary epithelial cells.

40|$|Ischemic stroke {{can cause}} striatal {{dopamine}} efflux {{that contributes to}} cell death. Since Kv 7 potassium channels regulate dopamine release, we investigated the effects of their pharmacological modulation on dopamine efflux, measured by fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), and neurotoxicity, in Wistar rat caudate brain slices undergoing oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The Kv 7 activators retigabine and ICA 27243 delayed the onset, and decreased the peak level of dopamine efflux induced by OGD; and also decreased OGD-induced damage measured by 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Retigabine also reduced OGD-induced necrotic cell death evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase activity assay. The Kv 7 blocker <b>linopirdine</b> increased OGD-evoked dopamine efflux and OGD-induced damage, and attenuated the effects of retigabine. Quantitative-PCR experiments showed that OGD caused an ~ 6 -fold decrease in Kv 7. 2 transcript, while levels of mRNAs encoding for other Kv 7 subunits were unaffected; western blot experiments showed a parallel reduction in Kv 7. 2 protein levels. Retigabine also decreased the peak level of dopamine efflux induced by L-glutamate, and attenuated the loss of TTC staining induced by the excitotoxin. These results suggest a role for Kv 7. 2 in modulating ischemia-evoked caudate damage...|$|E
40|$|Potassium {{channels}} are substantial to regulate electrical signaling andthe ionic composition of biological fluids. It {{has also been}} suggested that mutations inthe KCNQ 4 K+ channel gene are responsible for autosomal dominant nonsyndromichearing impairment (DFNA 2). Negatively activating potassium (K+) conductance inrodent cochlear hair cells called gK,n, comprises KCNQ 4 subunit, member of the KCNQfamily of K+ channels. This conductance is important in setting the hair cells 2 ̆ 7 restingpotentials and input conductances.

40|$|Reaction of {{pulmonary}} {{vascular bed}} to hypoxia {{is different than}} in systemic vasculature. Acute ventilatory hypoxia constricts pulmonary arteries (HPV), diverts blood to better oxygenated alveoli and optimises arterial pO 2. Chronic hypoxia causes pulmonary hypertension (HPH) and exposure to hypoxia at birth (perinatal hypoxia) results in longterm changes of pulmonary vasculature, which makes it more susceptible to develop pulmonary hypertension in adulthood. Reaction of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) to hypoxia involves membrane depolarization by inhibition of voltage gated potassium channels (Kv). Among them KCNQ (Kv 7) channels have biophysical properties (low voltage threshold for activation and lack of inactivation during sustained depolarization) which suggest them to {{play a key role}} in hypoxic response. Specific KCNQ channel inhibitor <b>linopirdine</b> primes HPV in saline perfused lungs, but in not primed lungs does not cause vasoconstriction, it behaves in the same way as acute ventilatory hypoxia. Moreover, in primed lungs linopirdin potentiates HPV and prevents non- specific Kv inhibitor 4 -aminopyridine to potentiate HPV. It seems, that KCNQ channel inhibition has a key role in HPV. In rats exposed to hypoxia for 3 - 5 days (normobaric chamber, FiO 2 0, 1) we examined relationship of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the role of Kv 7 potassium channels in the morphine-induced antinociception in both acute and neuropathic pain models. Methods: Neuropathic pain was induced by partial ligation of the right sciatic nerve. For intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injections, each rat was equipped with a permanent cannula. The response to painful thermal stimuli was assessed by the tail-flick test. In sciatic nerve-ligated rats, thermal hyperalgesia was assessed by paw withdrawal latencies in the plantar test and the mechanical hyperalgesia was determined by rigid von Frey filaments. Results: Rats received morphine (2, 5, 20 µg/ 10 µl; i. c. v.) or saline (10 µl; i. c. v.) 15 min before the tests. In all tests, morphine produced significant antinociceptive effect. When a Kv 7 potassium channel blocker, <b>linopirdine</b> (0. 1, 1, 10 µg/ 10 µl; i. c. v.) was administered 15 min before morphine, the effect of i. c. v. morphine in the tail-flick test and plantar test {{but not in the}} test with von Frey filaments were prevented. Conclusions: Kv 7 potassium channels contribute to the effect of i. c. v. morphine on acute pain induced by thermal stimulation.

Whole-cell currents were recorded by the patch-clamp technique in pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cell (PCE-NPCE) pairs or single PCE cells. The 0 -current potential was - 49 ± 13 mV in PCE-NPCE cell pairs (n = 97) and - 52 ± 12 mV in single PCE cells (n = 30).

40|$|KCNQ (KV 7) {{channels}} are voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels, and {{the function of}} KV 7 channels in muscles, neurons, and sensory cells is well established. We confirmed that overall blockade of KV channels with tetraethylammonium augmented the mineralization of bone-marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells during osteogenic differentiation, and we determined that KV 7. 3 was expressed in MG- 63 and Saos- 2 cells at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, functional KV 7 currents were detected in MG- 63 cells. Inhibition of KV 7. 3 by <b>linopirdine</b> or XE 991 increased the matrix mineralization during osteoblast differentiation. This was confirmed by alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and osterix in MG- 63 cells, whereas the expression of Runx 2 showed no significant change. The extracellular glutamate secreted by osteoblasts was also measured to investigate its effect on MG- 63 osteoblast differentiation. Blockade of KV 7. 3 promoted the release of glutamate via the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 -mediated upregulation of synapsin, and induced the deposition of type 1 collagen. However, activation of KV 7. 3 by flupirtine did not produce notable changes in matrix mineralization during osteoblast differentiation.

40|$|Flupirtine (Flu), a triaminopyridine derivative, is a {{centrally}} acting, non-opiate analgesic agent. In this study, {{effects of}} Flu on K+ currents were explored in {{two types of}} motor neuron-like cells. Cell exposure to Flu decreased the amplitude of delayed rectifier K+ current (IK(DR)) with a concomitant raise in current inactivation in NSC- 34 neuronal cells. The dissociation constant for Flu-mediated increase of IK(DR) inactivation rate was about 9. 8 [*]μM. Neither <b>linopirdine</b> (10 [*]μM), NMDA (30 [*]μM), nor gabazine (10 [*]μM) reversed Flu-induced changes in IK(DR) inactivation. Addition of Flu shifted the inactivation curve of IK(DR) to a hyperpolarized potential. Cumulative inactivation for IK(DR) was elevated {{in the presence of}} this compound. Flu increased the amplitude of M-type K+ current (IK(M)) and produced a leftward shift in the activation curve of IK(M). In another neuronal cells (NG 108 - 15), Flu reduced IK(DR) amplitude and enhanced the inactivation rate of IK(DR). The results suggest that Flu acts as an open-channel blocker of delayed-rectifier K+ channels in motor neurons. Flu-induced block of IK(DR) is unlinked to binding to NMDA or GABA receptors and the effects of this agent on K+ channels are not limited to its action on M-type K+ channels...|$|E
40|$|Early in development, network {{activity}} in the hippocampus is characterized by recurrent synchronous bursts, whose cellular correlates are giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs). The propensity for generating GDPs is attributed to GABAergic synaptic transmission being depolarizing and excitatory in neonatal neurons. However, developmental regulation of intrinsic conductances may also influence GDPs generation. A likely candidate is the non-inactivating, low-threshold, muscarinic-sensitive K+ current (M current; Im), which down-regulates intrinsic bursting {{activity in}} adult hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Western blot analysis of homogenates of the CA 3 hippocampal region showed that expression of the Kv 7. 2 subunit, one of the constituents of neuronal M channels, is weak in neonatal neurons, and markedly increases after the first postnatal week. Likewise, the density of Im was very low in neonatal CA 3 pyramidal cells and increased later on. Spontaneously occurring intrinsic bursts in neonatal neurons were longer and more robust, and recurred more regularly, than in juvenile neurons. The Im blocker <b>linopirdine</b> only mildly affected intrinsic bursting in neonatal neurons, but strongly facilitated and regularized it in juvenile neurons. We conclude that the low expression of Kv 7 /M channels and the depolarizing action of GABA early after birth enhance intrinsic bursting and neuronal synchronization leading to generation of GDPs within the hippocampal network...|$|E
40|$|Potassium {{channels}} {{are central to}} the regulation of pulmonary vascular tone. The smooth muscle cells of pulmonary artery display a background K+ conductance with biophysical properties resembling those of KCNQ (KV 7) potassium channels. Therefore, we investigated the expression and functional role of KCNQ channels in pulmonary artery. The effects of selective KCNQ channel modulators were investigated on K+ current and membrane potential in isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), on the tension developed by intact pulmonary arteries, and on pulmonary arterial pressure in isolated perfused lungs and in vivo. The KCNQ channel blockers, <b>linopirdine</b> and XE 991 [10, 10 -bis(4 -pyridinylmethyl) - 9 (10 H) -anthracenone], inhibited the noninactivating background K+ conductance in PASMCs and caused depolarization, vasoconstriction, and raised pulmonary arterial pressure without constricting several systemic arteries or raising systemic pressure. The KCNQ channel openers, retigabine and flupirtine, had the opposite effects. PASMCs were found to express KCNQ 4 mRNA, at higher levels than mesenteric artery, along with smaller amounts of KCNQ 1 and 5. It is concluded that KCNQ channels, most probably KCNQ 4, make an important contribution to the regulation of pulmonary vascular tone, with a greater contribution in pulmonary compared with systemic vessels. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor effect of KCNQ blockers is a potentially serious side effect, but the pulmonary vasodilator effect of the openers may be useful in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStimulation of {{vascular}} calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) {{is reported}} to induce both constrictions and relaxations. However, cellular mechanisms involved in these responses remain unclear. The present study investigates the effect of stimulating CaSRs on vascular contractility and focuses {{on the role of}} the endothelium, nitric oxide (NO) and K+ channels in these responses. In wire myography studies, increasing [Ca 2 +]o from 1 mM to 6 mM induced concentration-dependent relaxations of methoxamine pre-contracted rabbit mesenteric arteries. [Ca 2 +]o-induced relaxations were dependent on a functional endothelium, and were inhibited by the negative allosteric CaSR modulator Calhex- 231. [Ca 2 +]o-induced relaxations were reduced by inhibitors of endothelial NO synthase, guanylate cyclase, and protein kinase G. CaSR activation also induced NO production in freshly isolated endothelial cells (ECs) in experiments using the fluorescent NO indicator DAF-FM. Pre-treatment with inhibitors of large (BKCa) and intermediate (IKCa) Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels (iberiotoxin and charybdotoxin), and Kv 7 channels (<b>linopirdine)</b> also reduced [Ca 2 +]o-induced vasorelaxations. Increasing [Ca 2 +]o also activated IKCa currents in perforated-patch recordings of isolated mesenteric artery ECs. These findings indicate that stimulation of CaSRs induces endothelium-dependent vasorelaxations which are mediated by two separate pathways involving production of NO and activation of IKCa channels. NO stimulates PKG leading to BKCa activation in vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas IKCa activity contributes to endothelium-derived hyperpolarisations...|$|E
