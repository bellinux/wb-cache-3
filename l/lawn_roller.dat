25|$|Lawn rollers are {{designed}} to even out or firm up the lawn surface, especially in climates where heaving causes the lawn to be lumpy. Heaving may result when the ground freezes and thaws many times over winter. Where this occurs, gardeners are advised to give the lawn a light rolling with a <b>lawn</b> <b>roller</b> in the spring. Clay or wet soils should not be rolled as they become compacted.|$|E
50|$|On April 21, 1967, {{a tornado}} touched down at 105th and Kean Avenue in Palos Hills, 5 mi west of Oak Lawn. There were no deaths in Palos Hills, {{although}} {{a number of}} homes were destroyed and two transmission towers collapsed.

40|$|Collective Pressure: Mobility as Maker (Event) and Collective Pressure: Makers as Mobilizers (Presentation during panel discussion) KCAD Printmaking students, staff, alumni, {{and faculty}} offered a printmaking {{experience}} for conference attendees that involved collective, large-scale printing using objects or tools related {{to either the}} auto industry directly or transportation in general. Objects and tools included tires from cars, bikes, skateboards as well as gears, timing belts, <b>lawn</b> <b>rollers,</b> and a 2 ̆ 2 conveyor belt 2 ̆ 2 substrate powered by a dismantled bike. Through inking and using the aforementioned tools/objects, conference attendees helped create large-scale works on tyvek through either printing or making rubbings. The three-hour outdoor event focused on process, participation and collaboration, and the performative capacity of using mobility as a maker. The presentation in the panel discussion focused {{on the power of}} art to mobilize communities, and we looked specifically at Grand Rapids and how blighted areas are bring revitalized with art, while being conscious of the disenfranchised who live in the area. Specific examples included the Heartside area of Grand Rapids, Division Avenue, and Avenue for the Arts. The presentation focused on how as educators and community members, we as teachers can empower students to make positive change with an artistic and social focus...|$|R

40|$|Progress is {{constantly}} being made and new applications are constantly {{coming out in}} the area of field robotics. In this paper, a promising application of field robotics in football playing fields is introduced. An algorithmic approach for generating the way points required for the guidance of a GPS-based field robotic through a football playing field to automatically carry out periodical tasks such as cutting the grass field, pitch and line marking illustrations and lawn striping is represented. The manual operation of these tasks requires very skilful personnel able to work for long hours with very high concentration for the football yard to be compatible with standards of Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). In the other side, a GPS-based guided vehicle or robot with three implements; grass mower, <b>lawn</b> stripping <b>roller</b> and track marking illustrator is capable of working 24 h a day, in most weather and in harsh soil conditions without loss of quality. The proposed approach for the automatic operation of football playing fields requires no or very limited human intervention and therefore it saves numerous working hours and free a worker to focus on other tasks. An economic feasibility study showed that the proposed method is economically superimposing the current manual practices...|$|R
