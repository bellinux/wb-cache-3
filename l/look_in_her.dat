25|$|Of Queen Isabella’s five {{children}} to survive infancy, Paz {{was the one}} who resembled their mother most closely. Paz was short and plain with a small upward nose and a mischievous <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> small eyes. Unlike her sisters Isabel and Eulalia, Paz did not have a strong personality. She was uncomplicated, friendly and accommodating. Romantic and artistic, she was very fond of writing poems and was also a skillful painter. As a child, she studied the history of Spain, remaining interested in this subject. In later years she wrote articles published in the newspaper ABC. She was also musical; she played the harp, and enjoyed songs by Tosti as well as the operas of Verdi and Charles Gounod. She was also a devoted Catholic.|$|E
500|$|Bachchan {{said that}} Sam was his most {{difficult}} character to play, {{and he worked}} hard on his gestures and mannerisms: [...] "I had {{to work very hard}} to portray a straight man acting gay. It could easily have gone over-board. I wanted to avoid making the character caricatural [...] Barring one portion ... we kept it controlled." [...] Bachchan and Abraham, who had gained weight for their earlier films, had to lose the weight and become more muscular. Although Chopra agreed to wear a swimsuit, she refused to wear a bikini. The actress said that that she did not lose any weight (as the media speculated), but worked out for a toned <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> films; she was also filming Fashion (2008) at the time. According to Chopra, [...] "For Fashion, I had to put on six kilos and later had to shed chip by chip as the character progressed in the film. My body structure in Dostana is more toned than in Fashion as it is a completely beach film. I've worked very hard on my body." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly before {{graduating from}} Juilliard, Chastain {{attended}} an event for final-year students in Los Angeles, {{where she was}} signed to a talent holding deal by the television producer John Wells. She relocated to Los Angeles, and started auditioning for jobs. She initially found the process difficult, which she blamed on other people finding her difficult to categorize as a redhead with an unconventional <b>look.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> television debut, The WB network's 2004 pilot remake of the 1960s gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, she was cast as Carolyn Stoddard. The pilot was directed by P. J. Hogan, but the series was never picked up for broadcast. [...] Later that year, she appeared as a guest performer on the medical drama series ER [...] playing a woman she described as [...] "psychotic", which led to her getting more unusual parts such as accident victims or the mentally ill. She went on to appear in such roles in a few other television series from 2004 to 2007, including Veronica Mars (2004), Close to Home (2006) and [...] (2005–2006).|$|E

500|$|Retouching {{was applied}} during {{post-production}} where Minaj wanted {{her body to}} look like a plastic doll. Production for the music video was handled by US based company Bureau and UK based Riff Raff Films. Paris based visual effects, animation and motion design studio Mathematic was given the task of adding the graphics on the video. A team of 14 artists worked for two weeks in Paris to finish the task, accompanied by Megaforce. Different methods used included rotoscoping and keying for creating artificial fireworks and sparkling rain, 3D and 2D backgrounds, set-extensions, buildings, as well as the sky which they created using Autodesk Maya. Costumes worn in the video included Adidas uniforms for Minaj and M.I.A. and a retro inspired look for a sequence, wearing white lace dresses reminiscent of Madonna's <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> music video for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] (1984), as well as Marilyn Monroe. Another ensemble for Madonna included a crop top, leopard printed bra and a huge cross across her neck.

The music video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment of jazz hands, was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the [...] "first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet", triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography and a legion of amateur imitators on YouTube.

In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen. In July 2014, a Beyoncé exhibit was introduced into the [...] "Legends of Rock" [...] section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
