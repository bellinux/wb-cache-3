40|$|We {{should be}} taking {{advantage}} of recent gains in our nonperturbative understanding of supersymmetric gauge theories to find the "standard" model of of dynamical supersymmetry breaking, and possibly of flavor as well. As an illustration of the possibilities for understanding the flavor hierarchy, I describe a realistic, renormalizable, supersymmetric model with a compositeness scale of ∼ 1 - 3 TeV for the top quark, the <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> <b>bottom</b> quark, and the up-type Higgs. The top-Higgs Yukawa coupling is a dynamically generated strong interaction effect, and is naturally large, while the other Yukawa couplings are suppressed.

40|$|The baker’s map, {{invented by}} Eberhard Hopf in 1937, is an {{intuitively}} accesible, two-dimensional chaos-generating discrete dynamical system. This map, which describes {{the transformation of}} an idealized two-dimensional dough by stretching, cutting and piling, is non-dissipative. Nevertheless the “x” variable is identical with the dissipative, one-dimensional Bernoulli-shift-generating map. The generalization proposed here takes up ideas of Yaacov Sinai in a modified form. It has a staircase-like shape, with every next step half {{as high as the}} preceding one. Each pair of neighboring elements exchanges an equal volume (area) during every iteration step in a scaled manner. Since the density of iterated points is constant, the thin tail (to the right, say) is visited only exponentially rarely. This observation already explains the map's main qualitative behavior: The “x” variable shows “flares”. The time series of this variable is closely analogous to that of a flaring-type dissipative dynamical system – like those recently described in an abstract economic model. An initial point starting its journey in the tale (or “antenna”, if we tilt the map upwards by 90 degrees) is predictably attracted by the broad <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> (<b>bottom)</b> part, in order to only very rarely venture out again to the tip. Yet whenever it does so, it thereby creates, with the top of a flare, a new “far-from-equilibrium” initial condition, in this reversible system. The system therefore qualifies as a discrete analogue to a far-from-equilibrium multiparticle Hamiltonian system. The height of the flare hereby corresponds to the momentary height of the H function of a gas. An observable which is even more closely related to the momentary negative entropy was recently described. Dependent on the numerical accuracy chosen, “Poincaré cycles” of two different types (periodic and nonperiodic) can be observed for the first time...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a realistic, renormalizable, supersymmetric "quindecuplet" {{model in which}} the top quark, <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> <b>bottom</b> quark, and up-type Higgs boson are composite, with a compositeness scale ∼ 1 - 3 TeV. The top-Higgs Yukawa coupling is a dynamically generated strong interaction effect, and is naturally much larger than any other Yukawa coupling. The light quark doublets and right-handed up-type quarks are also composite but at higher energies; the hierarchy of quark masses and mixings {{is due to a}} hierarchy in the compositeness scales. Flavor changing neutral currents are naturally suppressed, as is baryon number violation by Planck-scale dimension five operators. The model predicts that the most easily observable effects would be on b-quark physics and on the ρ parameter. In particular a small negative Δρ=-ϵ leads to Δ R_b> + 2 ϵ. There are effects on B meson mixing and on flavor-changing neutral-current b-quark decays to leptons which might be detectable, but not on b→ sγ. The model also suggests the supersymmetry-breaking mass for the right handed top squark might be considerably larger than that of the <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> top squark.

5000|$|A player's {{handedness}} {{is determined}} by which side of their body they hold their stick. A player who shoots left (alternatively called a left-handed shot) holds the stick such that the blade is (normally) {{to the left of}} their body, with the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> on the <b>bottom</b> and the right hand on top; a player who shoots right (a right-handed shot) holds the stick such that the blade is to their right, with the right <b>hand</b> at the <b>bottom</b> and <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> on top. The <b>bottom</b> <b>hand</b> delivers most of the power while the top hand is responsible for control and stickhandling, as well as the [...] "whip" [...] of your shots.

The graduates then sing their graduation song and the awards for outstanding graduates are then given out.|$|R

5000|$|This {{temple was}} built in honour of Varahi {{in the first quarter}} of 10th century A.D. during Somavamsi rule. The temple is east facing and built with Sand stone. The area {{dimension}} (L x B x H) of the temple is 15.84 m x 8.23 m x 8.40 m. Varahi is believed to be the Sakti of Varaha. In the Tantric text 'Varahi Tantra' mention has been made of five forms of Varahi i.e., Svapna Varahi, canda Varahi, Mahi Varahi (Bhairavi), Krcca Varahi and Matsya Varahi. The description of Matsya Varahi closely corresponds to the image enshrined in the temple. She has two arms and she is shown seated in Lalitasana on a pedestal. Following the iconographic canons, the image bears the face of a boar and body of a divine woman. Her right hand holds a fish while the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> holds a Kapala. She has kept her right foot on her Vahana (vehicle) buffalo which is seated on the pedestal at the bottom. Varahi is represented with a third eye on her forehead which is not clearly visible at present. Her hair is decorated in the form of spiral coils." [...] The beauty of this image lies in her big belly to indicate her as holding the universe in her womb. On the back slab two Vidyadharas are represented each on either side. In addition to the main deity in the sanctum two more images of Varahi which are smaller than the main image are placed in the Jagamohana. Both of them are seated in ardhaparyankasana. Among them the image in the right niche is shown with a fish in her right hand and a kapala in her <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> At the <b>bottom</b> a figure of naravahana is placed on the pedestal. The four-armed Varahi in the left niche holds a kapala in the lower <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and is shown with Varada mudra in the corresponding right hand. The upper right hand holds a fish and <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> holds a rosary.|$|R
