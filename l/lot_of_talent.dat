In mid-1968, at age fifteen, Reeve was accepted as an apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

In a workshop, he played a scene from A View from the Bridge that was chosen to be presented in front of an audience. After the performance, actress Olympia Dukakis said to him, [...] "I'm surprised. You've got a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talent.</b> Don't mess it up." [...] The next summer, Reeve was hired at the Harvard Summer Repertory Theater Company in Cambridge for $44 per week.

Reeve's romance with the actress fizzled a few months later when the age difference became an issue. Reeve was briefly involved with Scientology but opted out of becoming a member. He subsequently voiced criticism of the organization.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the evenings}} our camps were invaded by whole populations. Every company had its campfire, and around each fire {{something}} was doing.
