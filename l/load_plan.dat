Determining {{the design of the}} <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> is critical to effective operations of such carriers. This dissertation makes contributions in modeling and algorithm design for three problems in LTL <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design: (1) Refined execution cost estimation. Existing <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design models use approximations that ignore important facts such as the nonlinearity of transportation costs with respect to the number of trailers, and empty travel beyond what is required for trailer balance that results from driver rules. We develop models that more accurately capture key operations of LTL carriers and produce accurate operational execution costs estimates; (2) Dynamic load planning. Load plans are traditionally revised infrequently by LTL carriers due to the difficulty of solving the associated optimization problem. Technological advances have now enabled carriers to consider daily <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> updates. We develop technologies that efficiently and effectively adjust a nominal <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> for a given day based on the actual freight to be served by the carrier. We present an integer programming based local search procedure, and a greedy randomized adaptive search heuristic; and (3) Stochastic <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design. <b>Load</b> <b>plan</b> design models commonly represent origin-destination freight volumes using average demands, which do not describe freight volume fluctuations. We investigate <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design models that explicitly utilize information on freight volume uncertainty and design load plans that most cost-effectively deal with varying freight volumes and lead to the lowest expected cost. We present a Sample Average Approximation approach and a variant of the method for solving the stochastic integer programming formulations. Ph. D.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops {{contributions in}} the area of supply chain risk assessment and mitigation. In each of the three main chapters, we present and analyze a risk assessment or mitigation problem for supply chains. The first problem is {{to assess the impact of}} infrastructure disruptions on supply chain performance; the second problem is to develop an operational control approach to mitigate risks posed by uncertain events that disrupt network synchronization; and the third problem is to analyze the risk posed by an adversary seeking to use a supply chain as a weapon. Chapter II presents a methodology for assessing the excess supply chain costs that arise from a failure of or an attack on a critical supply chain infrastructure component. Different from many subjective risk assessment practices, our methodology provides a systematic approach to search for the most vulnerable supply chain components and measure the economic consequences of disruption. Modeling a supply chain using network flow models, we analyze the impact of disruption by linear programming theory, and propose an efficient assessment algorithm based on the dual network simplex method. Finally, a case study on the U. S. corn export supply chain is presented. Chapter III discusses the mitigation of risks created by transit time uncertainties in less-than-truckload (LTL) line-haul operations. Transit time uncertainty may undermine the performance of the <b>load</b> <b>plan,</b> which specifies the route for each shipment and is synchronized to reduce line-haul costs. In our study, risk assessment of a <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> is performed via a dispatch simulation under randomly generated travel time scenarios. The risk consequence is measured by the average excess operational cost, including transportation cost and handling cost. Compared to existing line-haul network models embedded within integer programming approaches for <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> optimization, the dispatch simulation can evaluate the performance of a <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> more realistically. In addition, a heuristic search algorithm based on "multi-tree pivots" is provided to obtain a cost-efficient <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> that is robust to transit time uncertainties. Chapter IV presents methodology to assess the consequence of risks which arise from the intentional contamination of a food supply chain. Different from many risk management practices, the source of risk in this problem is an intelligent adversary, e. g., a terrorist group, who intends to deliver chemical or biological toxins to consumers using the supply chain. First, a general modeling scheme based on state-space models is provided to describe the dissemination of toxin across consumed products in a food supply chain. Then, a case study based on a representative liquid egg supply chain is presented. Based on the system model, a risk assessment for different supply chain designs is performed by simulation. Moreover, an in-depth analysis is conducted to determine the worst-case consequence given an intelligent attack considering the operational characteristics of the system. The worst-case consequence tool developed is designed to be embedded within any risk assessment approach.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses problems arising in freight routing {{and scheduling}} where full truckload (FTL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers {{are used to}} serve transportation needs. Each of the problems investigated in this dissertation tries to optimize/maximize consolidation to decrease system transportation costs by (1) carefully choosing the timing and path of freight and/or (2) introducing consolidation points. Approaches are proposed that enable effective planning and operation of freight routing and scheduling for large-scale transportation networks. Chapter 2 presents solution approaches for a shipper pickup and delivery planning problem faced by many large retailers to move freight from suppliers to distribution centers. Each shipment is moved either direct via a LTL carrier or possibly consolidated with other shipments and moved by one or two FTL routes. When using a FTL carrier, the shipper takes advantage of contracted lane rates that establish prices per mile for a truck operated between two locations that are significantly less than the comparable LTL price for shipping a full truckload. Consolidated FTL routes may each visit multiple shipment origins (supplier locations) and/or destinations (distribution center locations). Additionally, FTL routes may move shipments through a single crossdock facility en route. The challenge in this planning problem is to exploit {{as much as possible}} negotiated truckload lane rates and to judiciously make use of routes through crossdock facilities to consolidate shipments. The primary contributions of this section are that (1) an interesting new problem variant is introduced to the field of transportation and logistics that is important in practice and (2) the solution approach demonstrates that exploiting knowledge of the problem and solution structure to cleverly select subsets of path variables for evaluation during each iteration of an integer programming based local search heuristic is effective on path-based routing models. Chapter 3 evaluates how to route each customer shipment through a sequence of transfer terminals in a LTL carrier network. At each terminal stop, a shipment is unloaded from an inbound trailer and reloaded onto an outbound trailer. A <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> determines the specific sequence of terminal transfers to be used for freight moving between each origin and destination. The design of the <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> determines the linehaul transportation and handling costs required to serve customers. We develop an improved very large-scale neighborhood search heuristic for solving an integer programming model for <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design. The main contributions of this section include (1) the investigation of {{the pros and cons of}} optimizing system-wide into a single destination versus optimizing freight for all destinations in a small region, and (2) a solution approach that can find load plans with costs 6 to 7 % lower than those used in practice, and can find 2. 5 to 5 % additional cost savings using the same time budget when compared to an approach optimizing system-wide into a single destination. Chapter 4 addresses a strategic planning problem that extends the <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design problem to consider terminal roles. We investigate two-stage approaches that first identify the set of transfer terminals and then develop the corresponding <b>load</b> <b>plan.</b> Computational results compare the terminals chosen as transfer facilities from the proposed integer programming based local search method with a traditional hub location formulation and a simple facility location formulation to depict the benefits gained from modeling additional information. The key contributions of this section are (1) the introduction of a new hub location problem variant incorporating freight dispatch timing and trailer transportation cost characteristics found in the LTL trucking industry and (2) a solution approach utilizing IP-based local search that demonstrates the importance of incorporating freight dispatch timing. Finally, Chapter 5 summarizes the main conclusions from this dissertation and discusses directions for further research.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of robust <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> for trains in {{intermodal}} container terminals is studied. The goal of <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> is to choose wagon settings and assign load units to wagons of a train such that the utilization of the train is maximized, and setup and transportation costs in the terminal are minimized. However, in real-world applications, many of the parameters needed for the model are not known exactly. Since feasibility of the resulting load distribution has always to be guaranteed, we decided to use a robust approach. In particular, we apply the concepts of strict and adjustable robustness to enhance the <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> problem.

40|$|Recent {{research}} related to the aircraft container loading and scheduling problem for airfreight forwarding business has seen significant advances in terms of <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> optimization, {{taking into account the}} cost and volume of packed boxes. In today's competitive industrial environment, it is essential that freight forwarders are able to collaborate with carriers (airline companies) to achieve the best possible selection of logistics workflow. However, study of contemporary research publications indicates that there is a dearth of articles related to the design and implementation of an intelligent logistics system to support decision-making on carrier selection, aircraft container loading plans as well as carrier benchmarking. This paper presents an intelligent logistics support system (ILSS) which is able to provide expert advice related to the airfreight forwarding business, enhancing the logistics operations in relevant activities within the value chain of tasks. ILSS comprises a heuristics-based intelligent expert system which supports carrier searching and cargo trading planning as well as <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> generation. The proposed approach is meant to enhance various operations in the airfreight forwarding business, adopting computational intelligence technologies such as rule-based reasoning to provide domain advice and heuristics to support the generation of load plans. After potential outcomes are generated by the heuristics-based intelligent expert system, a neural network engine is applied to support prediction of unexpected events. To validate the viability of this approach, a production system using the ILSS has been developed and subsequently applied in an emulated airfreight forwarding environment. The application results indicate that the operation time from searching for potential carriers to the execution of the order is greatly reduced. In this paper, details related to the structure, design and implementation of the ILSS are also covered with the inclusion of the actual program codes for building the prototype.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Ship {{turnaround}} {{time at a}} marine containerport is an important measure of the port's efficiency and attractiveness. Both the speed and quality of <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> affect the length of {{turnaround time}} considerably. Past attempts at computerizing the <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> function have been unsatisfactory and have not reflected the port's objective of optimally utilizing its facilities and equipment. The computerized model developed through this study generates optimum feasible <b>load</b> <b>plans</b> that minimize yard material handling of containers while meeting all ship stability and loading restrictions. The model is particularly addressed to containerports with transtainers as prime yard movers. Minimization of yard handling is accomplished through formulation of the transtainer routing problem as a dynamic programming problem. The set of shipboard container-cell assignments is then checked against the constraints. Pairwise exchanges of assignments are made to meet any violated constraint so that the yard handling increase is minimized. The model has been tested using data for five actual ship loadings at Port of Portland. It yielded feasible <b>load</b> <b>plans</b> that were better than those manually generated showing an average 3. 2 percent less material handling requirements. The model can be easily implemented at containerports with medium-to-large computers with some adjustments.

40|$|The {{container}} loading problem {{considered in}} this thesis is to determine placements {{of a set of}} packages within one or multiple shipping containers. Smaller packages are consolidated on pallets prior to being loaded in the shipping containers together with larger packages. There are multiple objectives which may be summarized as fitting all the packages while achieving good stability of the cargo as well as the shipping containers themselves. According to recent literature reviews, previous research in the field have to large extent been neglecting issues relevant in practice. Our real-world application was developed for the industrial company Atlas Copco to be used for sea container shipments at their Distribution Center (DC) in Texas, USA. Hence all applicable practical constraints faced by the DC operators had to be treated properly. A high variety in sizes, weights and other attributes such as stackability among packages added complexity to an already challenging combinatorial problem. Inspired by how the DC operators plan and perform loading manually, the batch concept was developed, which refers to grouping of boxes based on their characteristics and solving subproblems in terms of partial load plans. In each batch, an extensive placement heuristic and a <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> evaluation run iteratively, guided by a Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the placement heuristic, potential placements are evaluated using a scoring function considering aspects of the current situation, such as space utilization, horizontal support and heavier boxes closer to the floor. The scoring function is weighted by coefficients corresponding to the chromosomes of an individual in the GA population. Consequently, the fitness value of an individual in the GA population is the rating of a <b>load</b> <b>plan.</b> The loading optimization software has been tested and successfully implemented at the DC in Texas. The software has been proven capable of generating satisfactory load plans within acceptable computation times, which has resulted in reduced uncertainty and labor usage in the loading process.

In this paper, a multi-objective model is developed to solve the production planning problems, in which the profit is maximized but production penalties resulting from going over/under quotas and the change in workforce level are minimized. To enhance the practical implications of the proposed model, different managerial production <b>loading</b> <b>plans</b> are evaluated according to changes in future policy and situation. Numerical results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the developed model...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregate}} production planning (APP) problem considers the medium-term production <b>loading</b> <b>plans</b> subject to certain restrictions such as production capacity and workforce level. It {{is not uncommon}} for management to often encounter uncertainty and noisy data, in which the variables or parameters are stochastic. In this paper, a robust optimization model is developed to solve the {{aggregate production}} planning problems in an environment of uncertainty in which the production cost, labour cost, inventory cost, and hiring and layoff cost are minimized. By adjusting penalty parameters, decision-makers can determine an optimal medium-term production strategy including production <b>loading</b> <b>plan</b> and workforce level while considering different economic growth scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed model is realistic for dealing with uncertain economic conditions. The analysis of the tradeoff between solution robustness and model robustness is also presented...|$|R
