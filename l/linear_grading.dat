This advanced technology has contributed {{to the success of the}} Clavinova as a more affordable substitute for an acoustic piano. The Graded action is intended to reproduce more accurately the varying weights of the hammers of an acoustic piano where the hammers vary in weight from the bass section to the treble. Higher-end models, such as the CVP-600 Series from 2012, incorporate real wood keys and <b>linear</b> <b>grading</b> for added realism. The built-in synthesizer produces the sound. Early Clavinova models used FM synthesis. Later models use sample-based synthesis to produce the sound. Information comes in a MIDI or similar format either directly from the piano keyboard or from a stored source (from within the piano or via a computer or external sequencer). The synthesizer can imitate a large array of acoustic instruments, electronic instruments and other sound effects. Recent models of CVP Clavinova have hundreds of such voices. These usually include many types of pianos and organs, string, percussion, brass and woodwind instruments, as well as modern and vintage synthesizer sounds, sampled effects etc. The more recent CVP models also feature many accompaniment styles, ranging from traditional dance and classical orchestration, through to more modern club, pop, rock, big band and jazz styles.|$|E

They serve as moderate resolution spectral discriminators in astronomical instruments and in reconnaissance equipment. They perform extremely well as "sliding out-of-band blocking filters " {{when used in}} conjunction with grating spectrometers. Visible band LVFs fabricated using traditional interference filter technology have become available and form the basis of a number of spectral imager and imaging spectrometer designs. The desire to extend the instrumentation into the infrared region has been often stated. Additionally, commercial providers of devices using LVFs desire readily available parts and consistent specification. We have manufactured wedge filters covering the 2. 5 - 5 pm spectral range by patterning thin metal films using the electron beam lithography technique. Arrays of apertures with varying size and pitch were manufactured in a gold layer deposited on a calcium fluoride substrate.

40|$|Silicon {{germanium}} alloy layers can {{be grown}} epitaxially on a silicon substrate to provide a means of adjusting the lattice parameter of the crystal. Such a platform, known as a virtual substrate, {{has a number of}} potential applications. For instance, it allows for subsequent overgrowth of highly strained layers of silicon, or germanium, that could enable very high speed transistors, similarly it could be used as the starting point of a range a silicon-based optoelectronic devices. In this work, a novel adaptation has been made to a recently proposed reverse grading technique to create high Ge composition SiGe virtual substrates. The proposed structures consist of a relaxed, highly defected, pure Ge underlayer on a Si (001) substrate prior to reverse grading where structures have final compositions of Si 0. 2 Ge 0. 8. Additionally, two grading schemes are studied, reverse <b>linear</b> <b>grading</b> and reverse terrace grading. All buffers are grown by reduced pressure chemical vapour deposition. The relaxation, defect levels and surface roughness of the fabricated buffers have been quantified whilst varying the grading rate. An ideal grading rate has been found where the quality of the buffer is very high, due to the highly defected Ge underlayer and that the buffer relaxes under tensile strain. Outside of this ideal grading rate three dimensional growth, stacking fault formation and crack generation can occur. Cracking of the buffer has been modelled and some conditions where the buffer is stable have been found. This study experimentally investigates this proposed solution and a crack-stable high quality buffer is fabricated. Comparisons have been drawn with other more popular buffer fabrication techniques and it is found that this technique has very competitive qualities.

At 154 to 156 d of age, 267 pigs were subjectively scored on 9 conformation and 2 locomotive characteristics. Scoring was performed on a 9 -point <b>linear</b> <b>grading</b> scale. For conformation characteristics, score 5 indicated normal conformation and scores 1 and 9 indicated severe deviations from normal. For the locomotive characteristics, score 1 indicated normal locomotion and score 9 indicated severe deviation from normal.

Results showed that swaying hindquarters and a stiffer gait were associated with higher scores for OC in, respectively, the femoropatellar (P = 0. 018) and tarsocrural joint (P = 0. 005); smaller inner claws as compared to the outer claws of the front legs was associated with lower scores for OC than equally sized claws in the femoropatellar joint (P = 0. 021) and on animal level (P = 0. 010); steep and weak pasterns of the front legs were associated with higher scores for OC in the elbow joint (P = 0. 004) and on animal level (P = 0. 018); X-shaped hind legs was associated with higher scores for OC on animal level (P = 0. 037); and steep and weak pasterns of the hind legs were associated with lower scores for OC than normal conformation in the tarsocrural joint (P = 0. 05).

Such virtual substrates will allow access to new materials {{that can be used for}} designing optical and electronic devices with superior characteristics and performances compared with conventional devices that are grown lattice-matched on standard substrates such as GaAs and InP. In addition, the principles behind such graded buffers can be used to bridge different lattice-constants, which can be a pathway to future integration of previously distinct classes of devices that have been defined by the lattice-constant on which they were built (e. g. Si-based, GaAs-based, InP-based etc.). Graded buffers with threading dislocation densities (TDD) < 9. 5 x 104 cm- 2, at a final composition of x = 0. 346 were obtained, representing the lowest value ever achieved at or around this composition. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out on InGaAs quantum wells (QWs) that were re-grown on these buffers, and high luminescence efficiency was observed in the 1. 2 - 1. 5 tm wavelength range. Ridge waveguide QW-separate confinement heterostructure lasers and heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) were also grown on the graded buffers to demonstrate their applicability for device applications. Pulsed threshold current densities of 262 Ac 2 at room temperature were obtained for 2 mm long strained-InGaAs QW emitting at 1320 nm, with peak output powers up to 40 mW. Preliminary tests on the unoptimized HBTs revealed that they operate with dc current gains of up to 13. A new class of graded buffers using all-binary III-V semiconductors has also been demonstrated. Thin constituent layers of GaAs and InP are combined such that they act in a mechanically-similar fashion as a random alloy. (cont.) We term this combination of many thin layers of constituent materials a Digital Metamorphic Alloy (DMA). The DMAs are used to replace conventional random-alloys in a metamorphic buffer layer. Such a DMA buffer has superior thermal conductivities to, and avoids materials growth-related problems associated with, conventional compositionally-graded random-alloy metamorphic buffers. The method of fabricating DMAs is described. Lattice-constant grading from GaAs to InP has been carried out using both the DMA concept, and a hybrid random-alloy-buffer/DMA approach. by Kenneth Eng Kian Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|High quality {{strained}} Ge (s-Ge) epitaxial layers are {{a promising}} candidate to achieve high mobility channel MOSFETs {{suitable for the}} 22 nm technology node and beyond, due to the intrinsically higher mobility of Ge compared to Si, and the additional performance enhancements from strain [1]. In order to achieve an s-Ge channel {{more than a few}} monolayers thick it is necessary to engineer a relaxed Si 1 -xGex buffer with a high Ge content (x > 0. 5). We have recently reported high quality s-Ge layers grown by RP-CVD at low temperature (T ≤ 450 °C), on a fully relaxed Si 0. 2 Ge 0. 8 buffer [2]. By using a reverse-grading approach, we achieved a high Ge composition in the buffer, with a smooth surface (rms surface roughness of 2 nm), low threading dislocations density (4 x 106 cm- 2) and much thinner (2. 1 μm) than can be achieved with conventional <b>linear</b> <b>grading</b> [3]. In this work, the thermal stability of s-Ge epilayers (up to 80 nm thick) grown on relaxed Si 0. 2 Ge 0. 8 buffers has been investigated by in-situ annealing in H 2 ambient at temperatures up to 650 °C. These temperatures are similar to those currently used during fabrication of advanced CMOS devices. All s-Ge layers were grown at 400 °C using GeH 4 gaseous precursor. The relaxation of the annealed layers has been studied using high-resolution XRD reciprocal space maps (RSMs), and was found to depend strongly on both annealing temperature and thickness of the Ge epilayer. Strained Ge layers up to 50 nm thick remained fully strained after annealing at 450 °C, whereas after annealing at 550 °C s-Ge layers thicker than 20 nm were on the onset of relaxation; after annealing at 650 °C all s-Ge layers showed significant relaxation with defects clearly visible at the Si 0. 2 Ge 0. 8 /Ge interface. All annealed s-Ge layers exhibited higher surface roughness than s-Ge control samples without annealing (rms 2 nm). Annealing at 450 °C resulted in only a slight increase in surface roughness (rms 3 nm), almost independent of s-Ge thickness. However, annealing at 550 °C and 650 °C resulted in significant surface roughening (with maximum rms values of 5 nm and 35 nm, respectively) due to the formation of Ge islands, which were observed by AFM. At these higher temperatures, the surface roughness of the s-Ge layers was found to be thickness dependent, with a Ge smoothing effect observed for layers greater than 50 nm. These results are particularly important for the fabrication of s-Ge MOSFETs, for which the surface passivation prior to gate stack formation is critical to the performance of the device. Based on the results presented here, the thermal budget should be kept below 550 °C to avoid relaxation and roughening of the s-Ge epilayer, which could degrade the device performance...|$|E

Using a numerical analysis based on experimentally determined parameters, we predicted in silico and validated in vivo that ERK is processively phosphorylated in HeLa cells. Finally, we identified molecular crowding as a critical factor that converts distributive phosphorylation into processive phosphorylation. We proposed the term quasi-processive phosphorylation to describe this mode of ERK phosphorylation that is operated under the physiological condition of molecular crowding. The generality of this phenomenon may provide a new paradigm for a diverse set of biochemical reactions including multiple posttranslational modifications...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} new rank tests for testing independence. The new testing procedures are sensitive {{not only for}} <b>grade</b> <b>linear</b> correlation, but also for grade correlations of higher-order polynomials. The number of polynomials involved {{is determined by the}} data. Model selection is combined with application of the score test in the selected model. Whereas well-known tests as Spearman's test or Hoeffding's test may completely break down for alternatives that are dependent but have low <b>grade</b> <b>linear</b> correlation, the new tests have greater power stability. Monte Carlo results clearly show this behavior. Theoretical support is obtained by proving consistency of the new tests...|$|R
