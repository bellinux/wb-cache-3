5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated {{increases}} over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching {{both men and}} machinery within.|$|E

She became the {{flagship}} of the Commander-in-Chief Scottish Coast on 22February 1922, but was sold for scrap in December 1922. Both ships were scrapped to meet the tonnage <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E

During the meeting he presented the proposals for British reconnaissance flights and for the transport collaboration. The Swedish government rejected the former but accepted the latter. However, privately Boheman indicated that Sweden's air force would not pursue Allied planes in their airspace, and also that <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transport collaboration meant it would have little benefit for the British.|$|E

5|$|Much {{like its}} predecessor, the game {{received}} generally positive reviews for its gameplay, sprite animations, and character roster. The Sega Saturn version, utilizing the 4MB RAM expansion cartridge, was praised {{for being an}} arcade-perfect conversion. Due to the memory <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation, tag team battles were, once again, removed from its port, resulting in more mixed critical reception.

5|$|A PlayStation 2 port of the game, retitled Deus Ex: The Conspiracy {{outside of}} Europe, was {{released}} on March 26, 2002. Along with pre-rendered introductory and ending cinematics that replaced the original versions, it features a simplified interface with optional auto-aim and motion captured character models. There are many minor changes in level design, some {{for the purpose of}} balancing gameplay, but most to accommodate loading transition areas, due to the memory <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 2 version was rereleased in Europe on the PlayStation 3 as a PlayStation 2 Classic on May 16, 2012.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current stage of thinking {{is the driving force}} behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

5|$|Agincourt {{was later}} {{transferred}} to the 2nd Battle Squadron and {{was present at the}} surrender of the High Seas Fleet on 21November 1918. She was placed in reserve at Rosyth in March 1919. After unsuccessful attempts to sell her to the Brazilian Government, she was listed for disposal in April 1921, but was used for experimental purposes later that year. She was sold for scrap on 19December 1922 to comply with the tonnage <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington Naval Treaty, although she was not actually broken up until the end of 1924.|$|E
5|$|At {{the early}} stages of development, Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships {{more powerful than the}} French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} started in June 1998, {{directly}} {{after the release of}} its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nintendo 64 hardware. Banjo-Tooie features levels that are significantly larger than those of its predecessor and requires the player to complete various challenges such as solving puzzles, collecting items, and defeating bosses. It also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames. Upon release, the game sold more than three million copies and received critical acclaim from video game critics. The game is also included in the Rare Replay video game compilation, released for the Xbox One in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic content, {{there are}} several {{different}} versions of Cannibal Holocaust in circulation which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{technological}} <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was {{kept to a}} minimum. Though many characters from Kingdom Hearts were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: Keiji Fujiwara as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A limited amount of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain of Memories. The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, laughter, and other battle cries.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which could fill the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to a}} re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent.

Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E
