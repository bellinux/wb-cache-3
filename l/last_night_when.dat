Club, {{television}} reviewer Hayden Childs {{commented that}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] was [...] "somewhat amusing {{and far more}} coherent than many recent episodes, but the satire is relatively mild.

Tim Surette of TV.com called it [...] "one minute of genius", and MTV's Brandon Freeberg wrote: [...] "Congratulations are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking this {{one out of the}} park." [...] Jenna Busch of Zap2it and Kelly West of Cinema Blend, both fans of Game of Thrones, named the opening the best {{in the history of the}} show. IGN's Eric Goldman commented: [...] "Ah, The Simpsons. Always there for us with clever/loving parody of something we all love. Such was the case <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield-inspired version of the terrific Game of Thrones credits." ...|$|E
