5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the <b>Liszt</b> <b>circle.</b> The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} June, Liszt left Paris {{without warning}} {{with his new}} lover, the Countess Marie d'Agoult, and moved to Geneva, where he began to teach at the recently founded Geneva Conservatory of Music. Devastated by the sudden loss of his mentor, Cohen persisted in begging Liszt {{to allow him to}} join him there, to which Liszt eventually relented. Cohen's arrival in the <b>Liszt</b> <b>circle</b> in Geneva soon earned him the long-held enmity of the countess. His abilities continued to grow under Liszt’s watchful eye. On 1 October 1835 Cohen played in a concert sponsored by the Princess Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso. Together with Liszt and two other pianists, he played in a four-piano Brilliant Potpourri on folk airs by Czerny. That same month Liszt entrusted the boy with 10 students of his own. At age 13, Cohen’s career appeared headed for greatness.|$|E
50|$|From 1835 to 1839, {{she lived}} with virtuoso pianist and {{composer}} Franz Liszt, who was six years younger, and was then a rising concert star. She became close to <b>Liszt's</b> <b>circle</b> of friends, including Frédéric Chopin, who dedicated his 12 Études, Op. 25 to her (his earlier set of 12 Études, Op. 10 had been dedicated to Liszt). D'Agoult had three children with Liszt; however, she and Liszt did not marry, maintaining their independent views and other differences while Liszt was busy composing and touring throughout Europe.|$|R
50|$|Pohl was {{a member}} of <b>Liszts</b> {{intimate}} <b>circle</b> at Weimar. <b>Liszt</b> therefore might have heard of Schumanns opinion, but despite this he shortly afterwards published his Piano Sonata in B Minor with a dedication to Schumann.|$|R
50|$|Ingeborg Starck was the {{daughter}} of Swedish parents Margareta Åkerman and Otto Starck who were living in Saint Petersburg, Russia, where her father was involved in commerce. Having shown musical gifts from a young age, studied piano with Nicolas von Martinoff and Adolf Henselt, as well as composition with Constantin Decker. She completed her studies in Weimar with Franz Liszt. During a stay in Paris in 1861 her friends included composers such as Auber, Berlioz, Rossini and Wagner (who commented in his autobiography on her good looks). In September of the same year, she married fellow pianist-composer Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff, a member of <b>Liszt's</b> <b>circle</b> whom she had met in Weimar.|$|R
50|$|While Liszt {{had been}} {{inspired}} {{to some extent}} by the ideas of Richard Wagner in unifying ideas of drama and music via the symphonic poem, Wagner gave Liszt's concept only lukewarm support in his 1857 essay On the Symphonic Poems of Franz Liszt, and was later to break entirely with <b>Liszt's</b> Weimar <b>circle</b> over their aesthetic ideals.|$|R
50|$|Hans Bronsart von Schellendorf (also called Hans von Bronsart) {{was born}} into a Prussian {{military}} family, and educated at Berlin University. He studied piano with Adolph Jullack. He went to Weimar in 1853 where he met Franz Liszt and became familiar with all the musicians in <b>Liszt's</b> <b>circle</b> at the time, including Hector Berlioz and Johannes Brahms. It is a measure of his close relationship with Liszt that it was he who played the solo part in the first Weimar performance of Liszt's 2nd Piano Concerto, with the composer conducting. When the concerto was published, Liszt dedicated it to Bronsart. After having trained for several years with Liszt, he worked as a conductor in Leipzig and Berlin, and then took the post of general manager of the Royal Theatre in Hanover from 1867 to 1887. He held a similar post in Weimar from 1887 until his retirement in 1895.|$|R
50|$|However Liszt {{had also}} himself {{to blame for}} such opposition. Throughout the 1850s, in a manner until then unparalleled in music history, Liszt himself and his friends had, {{in more than half}} a dozen journals, bombarded the {{contemporary}} public with huge quantities of articles, many of them in aggressive polemical style, in favour of their intended transformation of art. In addition there were books, such as Hans von Bronsart's Musikalische Pflichten ("Musical Duties"), (Leipzig 1858, where adversaries of <b>Liszt</b> and his <b>circle</b> were accused of ill-will, unfairness and slander. After this it should not have been surprising that similar reactions were evoked from the opposite side.|$|R
5000|$|A {{central point}} of {{disagreement}} {{between these two}} groups of musicians was between traditional and new musical forms. This was {{an outgrowth of the}} debate on the viability of the symphony genre, which had grown in the hands of Ludwig van Beethoven from one intended for entertainment to a form that included social, moral and cultural ideals. <b>Liszt</b> and his <b>circle</b> favored new styles in writing and forms that would blend music with narrative and pictorial ideas. Toward this end, and with the motto [...] "New wine required new bottles" [...] in mind, Liszt developed the symphonic poem. The Leipzig/Berlin school championed the forms used by the classic masters, forms codified by musicologists such as Adolf Bernhard Marx of the early 19th century.|$|R
50|$|In 1837 <b>Liszt</b> and his <b>circle</b> {{returned}} to Paris, where the princess {{had arranged for}} a famed competition {{between him and his}} greatest rival of the period, Sigismond Thalberg. She came to know Cohen at that time and became a friend and patron. When his increasing debts threatened to drown him, she arranged for a concert, which was to prove unsuccessful, apparently due to his lack of training from the idle lifestyle of gambling and dissolution he had adopted. The shock of this failure led Cohen to return to Hamburg, where he sought help from his father. Alone and in financial straits himself, the elder Cohen had no interest in helping his son. Cohen then turned to a former patron, Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who sponsored several concerts for him to raise funds. They were successful enough to allow him to return to Paris. There he met a popular Italian singer named Mario, which whom he formed a partnership. The duo traveled to London, where Cohen improved his skills and experienced a number of successes with their concerts.|$|R
500|$|For these concerts, Bache {{programmed}} five of Liszt's symphonic poems, the Faust and Dante symphonies, the Thirteenth Psalm and the Legend of St. Elisabeth. Works of Berlioz, Schumann and Wagner {{were also}} featured, but Liszt's compositions predominated. While {{the performances of}} the Faust and Dante symphonies were British premieres, the symphonic poems had previously been introduced at the Crystal Palace; nevertheless, Bache felt that offering repeat performances of the symphonic poems was important in making them familiar to audiences. Les préludes was performed three times at the Bache concerts, Mazeppa, [...] Festklänge and Orpheus each twice and Tasso once. Part of this strategy of familiarity was {{the inclusion of the}} two-piano arrangements of the symphonic poems as a way to prepare audiences for the orchestral versions. Bache had begun this practice with his first concert in 1865, when he and Dannreuther presented the two-piano arrangement of Les préludes. Another part of this strategy was supplying learned, well-considered and thoroughly detailed essays for program notes. Sometimes Bache wrote them himself; at other times, he relied on prominent theorists such as Carl Weitman and Frederick Niecks. According to musicologist Alan Walker, they [...] "are filled with insights that were both new and original for their time, and they are lavishly illustrated with music examples—a sure sign that they were aimed at a sophisticated public and were intended to have a potential life after the concert was over." [...] According to Walker, they still are worth study for Liszt scholars as many of the ideas, while transmitted through members of <b>Liszt's</b> inner <b>circle,</b> probably originated with the composer himself. These notes, along with the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements and what musicologist Michael Allis calls [...] "a thoughtful approach to programming ... all contributed to an aggressive marketing of Liszt's new status as a composer".|$|R
5000|$|While Robert Schumann {{had been}} a {{progressive}} critic {{and editor of the}} influential music periodical Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, which he had founded in 1834, he was never a true admirer of Liszt. However, as Schumann maintained exceptionally enthusiastic and artistically fruitful friendships with the emerging vanguard of radical romantics [...] - [...] Liszt in particular [...] - [...] as well as with musical conservatives such as Mendelssohn and Gade, he remained cordial with Liszt at first. He praised Liszt's piano playing in Neue Zeitschrift and reviewed his Leipzig concerts in 1840 favorably. However, as Lisztomania swept through Europe after 1842, both he and Clara believed that Liszt had become self-deluded. After Schumann sold the Neue Zeitschrift to Franz Brendel in 1845, it became an enthusiastic supporter of <b>Liszt</b> and his <b>circle.</b> It also openly played down Mendelssohn and other conservative composers. Though the final break between Liszt and Schumanns would not come until 1848, the editorial turn that Neue Zeitschrift had taken would color their relations {{for the rest of their}} lives. While Liszt remained cordial and at times generous on a professional level toward the Schumanns, they became openly hostile to him.|$|R
