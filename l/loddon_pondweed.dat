The Loddon {{has been part of}} the SSSI since 1986. The meadows are cut for hay in July each year, and then grazed by cattle until the end of the year. This cycle has resulted in a large population of fritillaries (Fritillaria meleagris), a bulb which thrives in damp meadows when its life cycle is not cut short by more modern management regimes. The river is included for its population of <b>Loddon</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton nodosus), as this is the principal location in the country where it can be found.|$|E

5000|$|Potamogeton nodosus is {{a species}} of aquatic plant known by the common names {{longleaf}} pondweed [...] and <b>Loddon</b> <b>pondweed.</b> It is native to Eurasia and the Americas, where it is widespread {{and can be found}} in water bodies such as ponds, lakes, ditches, and streams. This is a perennial herb producing a thin, branching stem easily exceeding a meter in maximum length. The leaves are linear to widely lance-shaped and up to 15 centimeters long by 4 wide. Both floating leaves and submerged leaves are borne on long petioles, a distinguishing characteristic. The inflorescence is a spike of many small flowers arising from the water on a peduncle.|$|E
