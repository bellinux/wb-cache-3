40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} whether performance-based tests have additional prognostic value over self-reported work ability for sustainable return to work (RTW) in physically demanding work. A one-year prospective cohort study was performed among 72 construction workers on sick leave for six weeks due to musculoskeletal disorders. The Work Ability Index (WAI) question regarding "current work ability" was used. Three dynamic lifting tests were used from a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE). Sustainable RTW {{was the number of}} days on sick leave until the first day of returning fully to work for a period of ≥ 4 weeks. Regression models were built to calculate the prognostic values. Self-reported work ability alone predicted sustainable RTW (R= 0. 31, R (2) = 0. 09, P= 0. 009). In combination with one <b>lifting</b> <b>test,</b> the explained variance (R (2)) increased to 0. 16 (P= 0. 001).

To {{establish the}} validity of determining effort level by visual observation of a <b>lifting</b> <b>test.</b> Summary of Background Data. Determining effort level during a <b>lifting</b> <b>test</b> is critical for interpretation of test performance, yet {{the validity of}} these determinations has not been established in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain. Methods. Fifteen healthy subjects and 16 patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain performed a standardized <b>lifting</b> <b>test</b> as outlined in the Isernhagen Work System Functional Capacity Evaluation. The lifts were videotaped and independently observed by 9 trained observers, who rated effort levels using an Isernhagen Work System categorical scale (Appendix 1) and a Borg Category Ratio scale (Appendix 2). External effort indexes were established to control for effort at group level. Validity of the observer ratings was analyzed {{by means of a}} sensitivity and specificity analysis and correlations between performances and observer ratings. Interrater reliability was analyzed by means of intraclass correlation coefficients and Cohen kappa. Results. External indexes differ significantly between patients with chronic low back pain and healthy subjects, indicating that at group level, patients did not perform maximally. Submaximal performances were correctly rated in 85 % to 90 % (healthy subjects) and in 100 % (patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain) of the cases. "Maximal" performances were correctly rated in 46 % to 53 % (healthy subjects) and in 5 % to 7 % (patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain) of the cases. Correlations between performances and observer ratings were r= 0. 90 to r= 0. 92 (healthy subjects) and r= 0. 82 (patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain). Reliability: intraclass correlation coefficient, r= 0. 76 (patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain) to r= 0. 87 (healthy), Kappa K= 0. 50 (patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain) to r= 0. 58 (healthy subjects).

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} criterion-related {{validity}} of the five Ergo-Kit (EK) functional capacity evaluation (FCE) <b>lifting</b> <b>tests</b> in construction workers on sick leave due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Methods: Six weeks, 6 months and 1 year after the first sick leave day due to MSDs, construction workers underwent two isometric and three dynamic EK FCE <b>lifting</b> <b>tests,</b> and completed the Instrument for Disability Risk (IDR) for future work disability risk. Concurrent and predictive validity were assessed by the associations between the scores of the EK FCE <b>lifting</b> <b>tests</b> and the IDR outcomes (Pearson Correlation coefficients (r) and associated proportions of variance (PV) and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)). Predictive {{validity of the}} EK FCE <b>lifting</b> <b>tests</b> on {{the total number of}} days on sick leave until full durable return to work (RTW) was also evaluated (Cox regression analysis). Results: Concurrent validity with future work disability risk was poor for the two isometric EK FCE <b>lifting</b> <b>tests</b> (- 0. 15 <= r <= 0. 04) and moderate for the three dynamic EK FCE <b>lifting</b> <b>tests</b> (- 0. 47 <= r <= - 0. 31).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the intra- and interrater reliability of tests from the Ergo-Kit (EK) functional capacity evaluation method in adults without musculoskeletal complaints. DESIGN: Within-subjects design. SETTING: Academic {{medical center in}} The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven subjects without musculoskeletal complaints (15 men, 12 women). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seven EK tests (2 isometric, 3 dynamic <b>lifting,</b> 2 manipulation <b>tests)</b> were each assessed 3 times (over 4 days), twice by 1 rater (R 1) and once by another rater (R 2). Intrarater reliability was calculated using the EK test scores assessed by R 1. Interrater reliability was calculated using the EK test scores assessed by both raters. Counterbalancing the rater order made possible the calculation of 2 interrater reliability levels (at time intervals of 4 and 8 d). All reliability levels were expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Intrarater and interrater reliability (8 -d time interval) was high (ICC, >. 80) for the isometric <b>lifting</b> <b>tests,</b> moderate (ICC range,. 50 -. 80) for the dynamic <b>lifting</b> <b>tests,</b> and low (ICC,. 80), and it was moderate (ICC range,. 50 -. 80) for both manipulation tests.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to study the functional outcome after non-operative treatment of type A thoracolumbar spinal fractures without neurological deficit. Functional outcome was determined following the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, measuring restrictions in body function and structure, restrictions in activities, and restrictions in participation/quality of life. All patients were treated non-operatively for a type A thoracolumbar (Th 11 -L 4) spinal fracture at the University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands. Thirty-three of the eighty-one selected patients {{agreed to participate in the}} study (response-rate 41 %). Respondents were older than non-respondents (mean 50. 5 years vs. 39. 2 years), but did not differ from each other concerning injury-related variables. Patients with a neurological deficit were excluded. Treatment consisted either of mobilisation without brace, or of bedrest followed by wearing a brace. Restrictions in body function and structure were measured by physical tests (dynamic <b>lifting</b> <b>test</b> and bicycle ergometry test); restrictions in activities were measured by means of questionnaires, the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and Visual Analogue Scale Spine Score (VAS). Restrictions in participation/quality of life were assessed with the Short Form 36 (SF- 36) and by means of return to work status. Thirty-seven per cent of the patients were not able to perform the dynamic <b>lifting</b> <b>test</b> within normal range. In the ergometry test, 40. 9 % of the patients performed below the lowest normal value, 36. 4 % of the patients achieved a high VO 2 -max. Mean RMDQ-score was 5. 2, the mean VAS-score was 79. No significant differences between patients and healthy subjects were found in SF- 36 scores, neither were differences found between braced and unbraced patients in any of the outcome measures. Concerning the return to work status, 10 % of the subjects had stopped working and received social security benefits, 24 % had arranged changes in their work and 14 % had changed their job. We conclude that patients do reasonably well 5 years after non-operative treatment of a thoracolumbar fracture, although outcome is diverse in the different categories and physical functioning seems restricted in a considerable number of patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Long-term spinal pain is {{a common}} health problem, often leading to disabilities. There is still no general {{agreement}} on what measures to use for evaluating disability in people with spinal pain. Performance-based tests are often used by physiotherapists for assessing impairments and activity limitations, but {{our knowledge of the}} clinimetric properties of such tests has been limited. Aims: The overall aim of this thesis was to identify among eleven tests assembled in a test package, one or more that, based on clinimetric properties, could be used in clinical practice for a) assessing impairments and activity limitations in persons with long-term spinal pain, and b) contributing to a common basis for evaluation and treatment of persons with long-term spinal pain. The objective of Study I was to explore the underlying foundations for ratings made by physicians, physiotherapists and insurance officers involved in an individual's rehabilitation concerning rated need of rehabilitation and rated potential to benefit from rehabilitation, for persons with long-term spinal pain. The objectives of Studies II-V were to examine the reliability, validity and sensitivity to change of the physical performance tests, and to identify their clinical usefulness. Methods: The basis for treatment recommendations was examined with a questionnaire distributed to professionals involved in 214 persons' rehabilitation process. The physical performance tests examined were the Åstrand ergometry test; isometric endurance tests for neck and trunk flexion and extension; a dynamic endurance test for the lower extremity; two lifting tests (PILE tests) and three gait tests. Discriminative ability of the tests was examined by comparing test performance for persons with long-term spinal pain and that of back-healthy persons. Inter-rater agreement was examined for persons with long-term spinal pain; intra-rater repeatability and inter-rater repeatability were examined for persons with long-term spinal pain as well as back-healthy persons. For construct validity we examined the possible effects of different related factors and background factors on test performance. Sensitivity to change was examined by relating the changes in performance to self-rated changes. Results: The ratings of need for rehabilitation were based on duration of sick leave (physician) and on self-rated physical function (insurance officer). The judgements about benefiting from rehabilitation were in most cases based on age. Most tests discriminated between persons with long-term spinal pain and back-healthy persons. Six of the tests were considered to have acceptable reliability when repeated over time and between raters. Persons with neck pain had generally better performance than those with low back pain, except in the cervical <b>lifting</b> <b>test.</b> When pain behaviour was high, the test performance went down. Rated pain and exertion levels during the tests also were related to test performance. Background factors examined explained only at most 27 percent of the variation in performance scores. The sensitivity to change was moderate in most tests, but was greater for subjects with low performance at inclusion in the study. Conclusions: There is an obvious need for a common basis and commonly accepted measures for evaluation and treatment in persons with long-term spinal pain. The cervical <b>lifting</b> <b>test</b> and the gait tests can without reservations be recommended for evaluating impairments and activity limitations in people with spinal pain. For use as outcome measures, the cervical <b>lifting</b> <b>test,</b> the gait test with burden and the stair-climbing test can be of interest. Physical performance tests and self-rated measures of disability complement each other, and might both be used as tools for describing disability and as outcome measures for persons with long-term spinal pain...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to explore the concurrent validity of test results of upper lifting tasks of the Ergo-Kit FCE and the Isernhagen Work Systems (IWS) FCE. Seventy-one healthy young adults performed 5 upper <b>lifting</b> <b>tests</b> with at least 5 min of rest in between. The <b>lifting</b> <b>tests</b> included 3 standard protocols and 2 modified protocols. Three criteria for concurrent validity were established: 1) Pearson correlation higher than. 75, 2) nonsignificant two-tailed t test, and 3) mean difference smaller than 5 kg.

Objectives To explore for {{associations}} between demographic, patient history, and physical examination variables and short-term improvement in self-reported disability following dry needling therapy performed on individuals with {{low back pain}} (LBP). Background Dry needling is an intervention used with increasing frequency in patients with LBP; however, the characteristics of patients {{who are most likely}} to respond are not known. Methods Seventy-two volunteers with mechanical LBP participated in the study. Potential prognostic factors were collected from baseline questionnaires, patient history, and physical examination tests. Treatment consisted of dry needling to the lumbar multifidus muscles bilaterally, administered during a single treatment session. Improvement was based on percent change on the Oswestry Disability Index at 1 week. The univariate and multivariate {{associations between}} 33 potential prognostic factors and improved disability were assessed with correlation coefficients and multivariate linear regression. Results Increased LBP with the multifidus <b>lift</b> <b>test</b> (rpb = 0. 31, P =. 01) or during passive hip flexion performed with the patient supine (rpb = 0. 23, P =. 06), as well as positive beliefs about acupuncture/dry needling (rho = 0. 22, P =. 07), demonstrated univariate associations with Oswestry Disability Index improvement. Aggravation of LBP with standing (rpb = − 0. 27, P =. 03), presence of leg pain (rpb = − 0. 29, P =. 02), and any perception of hypermobility in the lumbar spine (rpb = − 0. 21, P =. 09) were associated with less improvement. The multivariate model identified 2 predictors of improved disability with dry needling: pain with the multifidus <b>lift</b> <b>test</b> and no aggravation with standing (R 2 = 0. 16, P =. 01). Conclusion Increased LBP with the multifidus <b>lift</b> <b>test</b> was the strongest predictor of improved disability after dry needling, suggesting that the finding of pain during muscle contraction should be studied in future dry needling studies...|$|R

The detection of submaximal capacity can have major implications for patients. The validity of these instruments has never been systematically reviewed. Methods. A systematic literature search was performed including the following databases: Web of Knowledge (including PubMed and Cinahl), Scopus, and Cochrane. Two reviewers independently selected the articles based on the title and abstract according to the study selection criteria. Studies were included when they contained original data and when they objectified submaximal physical or functional capacity when maximal physical or functional capacity was requested.

Dynamic stability was assessed with the Star Excursion Balance Test, side hop test, and figure-of-eight hop test. Significant receiver operating characteristic curves and therefore cutoff scores were found for the foot <b>lift</b> <b>test</b> (P= 0. 011; cutoff= 4. 84 foot <b>lifts),</b> time-in-balance <b>test</b> (P= 0. 020; cutoff= 41. 23 s), center-of-pressure velocity (P= 0. 026; cutoff= 1. 56 cm/s), anterior-posterior time-to-boundary standard deviation of the minima (P= 0. 054; cutoff= 3. 72 s), posteromedial reach direction of the Star Excursion Balance Test (P= 0. 039; cutoff= 0. 91 normalized to leg length) and side hop test (P= 0. 044; cutoff= 12. 88 s). The associated positive (≥ 2) and negative (≤ 0. 05) likelihood ratios with each cutoff score indicated that changes in positive and negative posttest probabilities from the pretest probability of 50 % were small, yet significant. Essentially, the significant change between pretest and posttest probabilities indicates that clinically relevant information was gained by conducting these balance measure because they quantified a high proportion of individuals with a positive test who have FAI and a low proportion of individuals with a negative test who have FAI. No significance was found for the Balance Error Scoring System (P= 0. 249), center-of-pressure area (P= 0. 547), anteromedial (P= 0. 134) and medial (P= 0. 125) reach directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test, and the figure-of-eight hop test (P= 0. 117). In conclusion, we found the foot <b>lift</b> <b>test,</b> time-in-balance test, center-of-pressure velocity, anterior-posterior time-to-boundary standard deviation of the minima, posteromedial reach direction of the Star Excursion Balance Test, and the side hop test to be sensitive and accurate balance measures for detecting balance deficits associated with FAI. We suggest utilizing these measures and their cutoff scores to evaluate balance deficits associated with FAI...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To reach {{consensus}} {{on the most important}} biopsychosocial factors that influence functional capacity results in patients with chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, arranged in the framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. DESIGN: Three-round, internet-based Delphi survey. SETTING: Not applicable. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were scientists, clinicians, and patients familiar with functional capacity testing. Scientists were invited through purposive sampling {{based on the number of}} relevant publications in peer-reviewed journals. The scientists recruited clinicians and patients through snowball sampling. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consensus was reached if at least moderate influence (25 %) was achieved and an interquartile range of no more than 1 point was reached. RESULTS: Thirty-three scientists, 21 clinicians, and 21 patients from 9 countries participated. Participants reached {{consensus on}} 6 factors that can influence the outcome of the <b>lifting</b> <b>test,</b> having a median of severe influence (50 %- 95 %) : catastrophic thoughts and fear, patient adherence to "doctor's orders," internal and external motivation, muscle power, chronic pain behavior, and avoidance behavior. Motivation, chronic pain behavior, and sensation of pain were the top 3 factors affecting postural tolerance and repetitive movement functional capacity tests. Furthermore, participants reported 28 factors having a median of moderate influence (25 %- 49 %) that could influence the outcome of lifting, postural tolerance, and repetitive movement tests. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, chronic pain behavior, motivation, and sensation of pain are the main factors that can influence functional capacity results. We recommend that scientists and clinicians, respectively, consider the most important factors when planning future studies and when interpreting functional capacity test results...|$|E
40|$|Assessments {{of whether}} {{patients}} with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) {{can participate in}} work mainly consist of case history, physical examinations, and self-reports. Performance-based measures might add value in these assessments. This study answers the question: how well do performance-based measures predict work participation in patients with MSDs? A systematic literature search was performed to obtain longitudinal studies that used reliable performance-based measures to predict work participation in patients with MSDs. The following five sources of information were used to retrieve relevant studies: PubMed, Embase, AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Functional Ability, references of the included papers, and the expertise and personal file of the authors. A quality assessment specific for prognostic studies and an evidence synthesis were performed. Of the 1, 230 retrieved studies, eighteen fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The studies included 4, 113 patients, and the median follow-up period was 12 months. Twelve studies took possible confounders into account. Five studies were of good quality and thirteen of moderate quality. Two good-quality and all thirteen moderate-quality studies (83 %) reported that performance-based measures were predictive of work participation. Two good-quality studies (11 %) reported both an association and no association between performance-based measures and work participation. One good-quality study (6 %) found no effect. A performance-based <b>lifting</b> <b>test</b> was used in fourteen studies {{and appeared to be}} predictive of work participation in thirteen studies. Strong evidence exists that a number of performance-based measures are predictive of work participation in patients with MSDs, especially lifting tests. Overall, the explained variance was modes...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Repetitive manual {{handling}} tasks {{account for a}} substantial portion of work-related injuries. However, few studies report endurance time in repetitive {{manual handling}} tasks. Consequently, there is little guidance to inform expected work time for repetitive manual handling tasks. We aimed to investigate endurance time and oxygen consumption of a repetitive lift and carry task using linear mixed models. Methods Fourteen male soldiers (age 22. 4 ± 4. 5 yrs, height 1. 78 ± 0. 04 m, body mass 76. 3 ± 10. 1 kg) conducted four assessment sessions that consisted of one maximal box lifting session and three lift and carry sessions. The relationships between carry mass (range 17. 5 - 37. 5 kg) and the duration of carry, and carry mass and oxygen consumption, were assessed using linear mixed models with random effects to account for between-subject variation. Results Results demonstrated that endurance time was inversely associated with carry mass (R 2 = 0. 24), with significant individual-level variation (R 2 = 0. 85). Normalising carry mass to performance in a maximal box <b>lifting</b> <b>test</b> improved the prediction of endurance time (R 2 = 0. 40). Oxygen consumption presented relative to total mass (body mass, external load and carried mass) was not significantly related to lift and carry mass (β 1 = 0. 16, SE = 0. 10, 95 %CI: - 0. 04, 0. 36, p = 0. 12), indicating that there was no change in oxygen consumption relative to total mass with increasing lift and carry mass. Conclusion Practically, these data can be used to guide work-rest schedules and provide insight into methods assessing the physical capacity of workers conducting repetitive manual handling tasks...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: With {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in life expectancy, systematic physical exercise programs can have a good influence on the functional capacity of the elderly, especially in relation to institutionalization. Objective: To analyze the association between a systematic physical exercise program and functional capacity in institu-tionalized elderly. Methods: The sample included 30 elderly subjects (16 women and 14 men) aged 60 years or older (mean age = 74. 43), divided into a control group (n= 16) and a training group (n= 14), residents in a long-stay institution. A training protocol of 12 weeks, two weekly sessions, was applied, and functional capa-city was assessed {{before and after the}} intervention, through chair <b>lift</b> <b>tests</b> (lower limb strength), upper limb strength, timed up and go and handgrip dynamometry. The analysis pre and post-training of intervention and control groups was performed using paired Student t test and the ANOVA test for repeated measures. The level of significance was set at 5 %. Results: The main statistical significance were found for the following functional tests: upper limb strength (training 15. 6 ± 4. 1 x control 10. 7 ± 6. 6 rep, p< 0. 05) and chair <b>lift</b> <b>test</b> (training 11. 0 ± 4. 0 x control 8. 0 ± 3. 1 rep, p< 0. 05).
