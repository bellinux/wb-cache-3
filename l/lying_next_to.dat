The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|McCudden set {{out across}} the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance he checked the {{airfield}} he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map and McCudden returned to his machine. Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a plunged into the ground. 8 Squadron's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> one of the wings—he had not worn his safety belt. Burdett followed and recognised the pilot {{as soon as his}} headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness and died at 20:00.|$|E

5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E

25|$|Nine bomb explosions {{eventually}} {{occurred on}} the flight deck, eight caused by the AN-M65 Composition B bombs cooking off under {{the heat of the}} fuel fires, and the ninth occurring as a sympathetic detonation between an AN-M65 and a newer 500lb M117 H6 bomb that it was <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> on the deck. The other Composition H6-based bombs performed as designed and either burned on the deck or were jettisoned, but did not detonate under the heat of the fires.|$|E
25|$|The hold has {{not been}} {{excavated}} and thoroughly examined, but in it are coal and a large quantity of stoneware Bartmann jugs, probably containing wine destined for the Swedish market. The divers who first located the wreck brought up the glass bottle that bore {{the crest of the}} English Boynton or Ogle families, a bowl, a drinking cup and one of the Bartmann jugs. Since the official announcement of the find in 2007, only two further objects have been brought up for analysis. One, the wooden butt of a flintlock pistol, helps date the find. The 1.9 meter-long lion figurehead <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the ship was also brought up and recorded in a 3D scanner. Both objects were then returned to their original positions on or near the wreck.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between harvestmen and spiders {{is that in}} harvestmen the two main body sections (the abdomen or opisthosoma with ten segments and the cephalothorax or prosoma) are nearly joined, so that {{they appear to be}} one oval structure. In more advanced species, the first five abdominal segments are often fused into a dorsal shield called the scutum, which is normally fused with the carapace. Sometimes this shield is only present in males. The two hindmost abdominal segments may be reduced or separated in the middle on the surface to form two plates <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> each other. The second pair of legs is longer than the others and works as antennae. They have a single pair of eyes {{in the middle of their}} heads, oriented sideways. They have a pair of prosomatic scent glands that secrete a peculiar smelling fluid when disturbed. Harvestmen do not have spinnerets and do not possess poison glands, posing absolutely no danger to humans. They breathe through tracheae. Between the base of the fourth pair of legs and the abdomen is a pair of spiracles, one opening on each side. In more active species, spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs. They have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax, and copulation is direct, as the male has a penis (while the female has an ovipositor).|$|E
500|$|The oil {{and paint}} {{stored in the}} shop caused the fire to burn out of control, and when the fire {{services}} were eventually able to enter the premises {{the rest of the}} family were found dead. The body of Henry Chandler was found on the staircase, still clutching a locked strongbox filled with the shop's takings, while the badly burnt remains of Mary Ann Chandler were found <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a first floor window, the body of six-year-old Henry by her side. Ayres's condition deteriorated and she died in Guy's Hospital on [...] 1885. Her last words were reported as [...] "I tried my best and could try no more". Elizabeth, the last of the children to be rescued, had suffered severe burns to her legs and died shortly after Ayres.|$|E
500|$|The {{new name}} of Osijek first {{appeared}} in 1196. The center of medieval Osijek was {{on the banks of}} the River Drava where Tvrđa now stands. The town was a trade and port settlement from the early 12th century due to its position on the way from Pécs and Buda southwards. The site was home to the Romanesque church of the Holy Trinity. Between 1526 and 1687 Osijek was ruled by the Ottomans, who did not change the layout of the settlement in any substantial way but introduced Islamic places of worship, giving the area an Oriental appearance. Traces of medieval and Ottoman towns remain to this day, including a remnant of the old Ottoman fortress wall, known today as the [...] "Turkish Wall" [...] (...) or [...] "Filibey's Fort" [...] (...) , <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the Tvrđa access road.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, Noreen was {{harvesting}} falsa berries with a {{group of}} other farmhands in a field in Sheikhupura. She was asked at one point to fetch water from a nearby well; she complied but stopped to take a drink with an old metal cup she had found <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the well.

500|$|The {{beginning}} of the episode, in which Homer has a dream of himself as an ape, is {{a reference to the}} [...] sequence from the 1968 science-fiction film [...] The Simpsons director David Silverman had difficulties with making the ape resemble Homer and struggled with the design for several hours. After hurting Lisa's feelings at talent show, Homer watches old home movies of him and Lisa, including one in which a young Homer is seen watching Fantasy Island on television instead of paying attention to Lisa's taking her first steps. The scene in which Lisa wakes up in her bed and discovers the pony <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film The Godfather, in which Jack Woltz awakens to discover the severed head of his favorite horse placed in his bed. The musical chords used in the episode are the same as in the film but shortened. While driving home from the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer falls asleep behind the wheel and dreams that he is in Slumberland, drawn in the style of Winsor McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland. The song [...] "Golden Slumbers" [...] by The Beatles plays during the sequence.|$|E
500|$|Studies on freely moving {{rats and}} mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields, and these fire bursts of action {{potentials}} when the animal passes through a particular location. This place-related neural activity in the hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a restraint chair. [...] However, the place cells may have fired in relation to where the monkey was looking rather that to its actual location in the room. Over many years, many studies {{have been carried out}} on place-responses in rodents, that have given a large amount of information. Place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and by granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons and these often show place-related variations in their firing rate which are much weaker. [...] There is little if any spatial topography in the representation; in general, cells <b>lying</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> each other in the hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns. Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hz, when the rat is near the center. Neural activity sampled from 30 to 40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat's location to be reconstructed with high confidence. The size of place fields varies in a gradient {{along the length of the}} hippocampus, with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields, cells near the center showing larger fields, and cells at the ventral tip showing fields that cover the entire environment. In some cases, the firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also on the direction a rat is moving, the destination toward which it is traveling, or other task-related variables.|$|E
