We emulate the IEEE 802. 11 MAC/PHY using the EMANE software emulator, on a cluster of machines, for different multi-hop wireless scenarios. As an instance of real-world usage scenario, we study the performance of real-time streaming media over a mesh network supported by OLSR.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{interest}} in daylight imaging, a baffle {{was needed to}} reduce background light during the day but not impact wind <b>loading</b> induced <b>jitter</b> on the 3. 6 m telescope. Analysis was performed to design a compliant baffle out of a synthetic fabric that satisfied these requirements. Initial testing showed that static loading increased as predicted by classical wind drag analysis techniques, and wind induced jitter remained the same or decreased slightly. This paper will present further testing to quantify this effect and offer a physical explanation based on the design analysis models and wind pressure data collected with and without the baffle installed. The metric used to quantify jitter will be a comparison of angular rate sensors and accelerometers mounted on the telescope. Unsteady wind loading is the largest dynamic loading on most large ground telescopes. The maximum operational wind speed not only sets requirements on the wind load rejection performance of the mount control system but also is a significant driver for tracker error rejection. In addition, turbulence due to the wind contributes to wavefron...|$|R
40|$|Support for QoS enabled {{multimedia}} transmission over multicast ad hoc {{network is}} necessary these days. Researchers have developed various encoding/decoding schemes which can efficiently deliver the multimedia contents over wireless networks. In case of ad hoc networks, performance of routing protocol depends upon different factors i. e. traffic type {{being used for}} wireless transmission, dynamic network behavior, bandwidth and computational power of nodes etc. It is essential to investigate the performance of multicast routing protocol using various data types because they may consume huge network resources thus results in degradation of transmission quality. In case of multicast group communication, Audio/Video data stream can cause extra overhead on network performance and it is quite difficult to maintain Quality of Services for such type of data. H. 264 offers a rich codec library for Scalable Video Coding, to transfer SVC video traffic efficiently over wireless networks.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{fundamental}} problems {{in the domain of}} distributed multimedia application is the synchronization of the communication elements. Multimedia data is defined as bundles composed of several streams (video, audio or text streams). A stream can be defined as a sequence of information units (IU). Intra-synchronization binds IUs of the same stream with ordered or temporal constraints (e. g. one image each 1 / 25 th second), whereas inter-synchronization binds streams of the same bundle (e. g. lip synchronization). In the network environment, three specific phenomena may produce synchronization loss : <b>load</b> variation, <b>jitter,</b> or packet loss. Based on single data stream, usual mechanisms used to preserve synchronization do not work well with multimedia streams. In this paper, we present the synchronization services required by distributed multimedia applications. We propose a formal definition of inter-stream and intra-stream synchronization. We present the impact of intra or inter-stream synchronization loss. We show how to use the specification of synchronization constraints to propose a concealment mechanism. After a synchronization loss, {{depending on the type of}} the constraints of the multimedia bundle and streams, appropriated actions are proposed to achieve synchronization recovery...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly complex requirements, {{coupled with}} with tighter {{economic}} and organizational constraints, {{are making it}} hard to build complex distributed real-time embedded (DRE) systems entirely from scratch. The proportion of DRE systems made up of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software is therefore increasing significantly. There are relatively few systematic empirical studies, however, that illustrate how suitable COTS-based hardware and software have become for mission-critical DRE systems. This paper provides the following contributions to the study of real-time quality of service (QoS) assurance and performance in COTS-based DRE systems: (1) it presents evidence that flexible configuration of COTS middleware mechanisms, and the operating system settings they use, allows DRE systems to meet critical QoS requirements over a wider range of <b>load</b> and <b>jitter</b> conditions than statically configured systems, (2) it shows that in addition to making critical QoS assurances, non-critical QoS performance can be improved through flexible support for alternative scheduling strategies, and (3) it presents an empirical study of three canonical scheduling strategies [...] -specifically the conditions that predict success of a strategy for a production-quality DRE avionics mission computing system. Our results show that applying a flexible scheduling framework to COTS hardware, operating systems, and middleware improves real-time QoS assurance and performance for mission-critical DRE systems...|$|R

40|$|Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) are {{autonomous}} and decentralized wireless systems. Mobile Ad hoc Network is {{a collection}} of mobile nodes in which the wireless links are frequently broken down due to mobility and dynamic infrastructure. Routing is a significant issue and challenge in ad hoc networks. Many Routing protocols have been proposed so far to improve the routing performance and reliability. This research paper describes the characteristics of ad hoc routing protocols Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), Optimized link State Routing (OLSR), Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) based on the performance metrics like packet delivery fraction, Average delay, Normalized Routing <b>load,</b> Throughput and <b>Jitter</b> under low mobility and low traffic network as well as under high mobility and high traffic network. Results show that AODV has maximum throughput under low traffic and DSDV has maximum throughput under high traffic. As network becomes dense OLSR, DSR and DSDV perform well in terms of Throughput than AODV and TORA. TORA performs well in dense networks in terms of packet delivery fraction {{but at the same time}} Normalized Routing load of TORA is maximum among all the protocols in both the networks. DSDV has least Normalized Routing load in both low and high traffic. OLSR and DSDV give the least Jitter and Average Delay in both networks...|$|R
