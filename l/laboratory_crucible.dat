5000|$|The {{device was}} {{originally}} a standard platinum <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucible</b> with a perforated base into which asbestos pulp was placed {{to form the}} filter mat. [...] The crucible was then heated in an oven to dry out until it attained constant weight. The use of these materials meant that after filtration, the crucible and its contents could be subjected to high temperature to dry the filtrate and possibly oxidize or ash it to minimum weight. However, {{because of the high}} cost of platinum, versions made of porcelain were introduced in 1882. Some Gooch crucibles, such as the one in the drawing, permit two layers of asbestos to be used, separated by a perforated porcelain plate. Other inorganic fibers, notably glass, have been used in place of asbestos. Gooch crucibles made of borosilicate glass with fritted glass bases are more common today. [...] Platinum may still be required for the most corrosive materials, and porcelain ones are used where ashing at high temperature is required, but the borosilicate glass ones are adequate for drying.|$|E
40|$|A {{design for}} an {{air-cooled}} test tube, {{with a series}} of modular and movable rings (cylindrical “crystallization comb”), installed in a <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucible</b> furnace is presented. The setup allows easy regulation simultaneous crystallization tests of a series of different crystallization rates in several columns (matrix) of test tubes, enabling fast studies of obtaining crystals. This low-budget, portable device (i. e. adjustable airstream with more simple control options), can also be applied in tube and chamber furnaces. The relations between the crystallization rate and parameters of air-cooled test tube are given and numerically analyzed...|$|E
40|$|A <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucible</b> {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop waste forms to treat nonradioactive simulated {sup 238 }Pu heterogeneous debris waste from Savannah River, metal waste from the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), and nominal waste also from INEL using DC arc melting. The preliminary results showed that the different waste form compositions had vastly different responses for each processing effect. The reducing condition of DC arc melting had no significant effects on the durability of some waste forms while it decreased the waste form durability from 300 to 700 % for other waste forms, which resulted in the failure of some TCLP tests. The right formulations of waste can benefit from devitrification and showed an increase in durability by 40 %. Some formulations showed no devitrification effects while others decreased durability by 200 %. Increased waste loading also affected waste form behavior, decreasing durability for one waste, increasing durability by 240 % for another, and showing no effect for the third waste. All of these responses to the processing and composition variations were dictated by the fundamental glass chemistry and can be adjusted to achieve maximal waste loading, acceptable durability, and desired processing characteristics if each waste formulation is designed for the result according to the glass chemistry...|$|E

These alloys are used in furnace windings, bushings for glass fiber production, thermocouple elements, electrodes for aircraft spark plugs, and <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucibles.</b> Other uses include: ...|$|R
500|$|Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) {{is used in}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucibles,</b> in {{metallurgical}} furnaces, and as a refractory material. Because it is mechanically {{strong and}} flexible, it can be sintered into ceramic knives and other blades. [...] Zircon (ZrSiO4) and the cubic zirconia (ZrO2) are cut into gemstones for use in jewelry.|$|R
50|$|Zirconium nitride {{is a hard}} ceramic {{material}} similar to titanium nitride and is a cement-like refractory material. Thus it is used in refractories, cermets and <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucibles.</b> When applied using the physical vapor deposition coating process {{it is commonly used}} for coating medical devices, industrial parts (notably drill bits), automotive and aerospace components and other parts subject to high wear and corrosive environments.|$|R
40|$|The Transportable Vitrification System (TVS) {{is a large}} scale, fully integrated, {{vitrification}} {{system for}} the treatment of low-level and mixed wastes in the form of sludges, soils, incinerator ash, and many other waste streams. It was demonstrated on surrogate waste at Clemson University and at the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) prior to treating actual mixed waste. Treatment of a combination of dried B and C Pond sludge and CNF sludge was successfully demonstrated at ORR in 1997. The demonstration produced 7, 616 kg of glass from 7, 328 kg of mixed wastes with a 60 % reduction in volume. Glass formulations for the wastes treated were developed using a combination of <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucible</b> studies with the actual wastes and small melter studies at Clemson with both surrogate and actual wastes. Initial characterization of the B and C Pond sludge had not shown the presence of carbon or fluoride, which required a modified glass formulation be developed to maintain proper glass redox and viscosity. The CNF sludge challenges the glass formulations due to high levels of phosphate and iron. The demonstration was delayed several times by permitting problems, a glass leak, and electrical problems. The demonstration showed that the two wastes could be successfully vitrified, although the design glass production rate was not achieved. The glass produced met the Universal Treatment Standards and the emissions from the TVS were well within the allowable permit limits...|$|E
40|$|A {{workshop}} {{was organized}} and conducted in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on March 29 and 30, 1994, {{to evaluate the}} use of in situ vitrification (ISV) technology to produce large silicate melts that would serve as analogs for natural magmas for the study of magmatic properties and processes. ISV technology would permit experiments to test hypotheses or provide new data that cannot be tested or obtained through bench-top experimentation or the study of natural systems. The scale of ISV melts is intermediate between that of natural lava lakes and <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucible</b> experiments, with melt volumes from 15 to 300 m{sup 3 } easily obtained. This approach permits investigation of dynamic processes which operate on scales difficult to simulate through bench-top experimentation and that are not amenable to direct observation or control in natural systems (e. g., degassing, convection, and crystal settling). Several aspects of the ISV process make it uniquely applicable for the study of magma systems. The process produces {open_quotes}containerless{close_quotes} silicate melts, which permits development of important analog components of natural magma systems including: partial melt zones, stopping, contact metamorphic haloes, and {open_quotes}hydrothermal{close_quotes} fluids. The lack of a melt {open_quotes}container{close_quotes} also enables use of standard field-scale geophysical instrumentation for studying the seismic and electrical properties of the melt and host materials. In addition, volatile and particulate emissions from the melt can be sampled using methods that avoid reaction with, and contamination by, host rocks. The consensus of the group was that the use of melts generated by ISV technology provided unique opportunities to advance the understanding of magmas and magmatic processes and warranted development of a proposal...|$|E

An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this {{has been replaced by}} an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the first {{quarterly}} report under Contract AT(30 - 1) - 2528 for the decontamination and recovery of precious metals from contaminated scrap. This program encompasses the recovery of gold, platinum, iridium, rhodium and palladium from scrap and contaminated laboratory ware, equipment, etc. which may be contaminated by alpha emitters (i. e., uranium, plutonium and possibly polonium or combinations of these), beta-gamma emitters such as fission products or all three sources of radiation. In addition the scrap can be chemically contaminated by base metals, graphite or other contaminants. Osmium, ruthenium or silver {{are not to be}} recovered. Since the scrap can exist in such a great variety of forms such as platinum-rhodium <b>laboratory</b> <b>crucibles,</b> graphite crucibles containing platinum-base metal alloys derived from vacuum fusion baths, insulated thermocouple wires, reactor liners, porous platinum filters, alloys such as Baker alloy 413 (60 Au, 25 Pd, 15 Pt) {{it may be necessary to}} devise specific methods for a given type of scrap. Nevertheless the basic chemistry is the same and information and methods applicable to single systems will apply directly to the more complicated ones. Accordingly the relatively simple systems would be investigated first and the more complicated ones later in the program. An essential and major contribution to the success of the program is to devise or adapt accurate and precise analytical chemical techniques for scrap identification, process control, purity of the final products and accountability control. Accordingly, the emphasis on chemical analysis will be proportionally greater during the early stages of the program. The residual activity level to be attained is presently stated at twice the standard deviation obtained in low background counters (alpha {approx} 0. 1 c/m, beta {approx} 5 c/m) of virgin platinum...|$|R

50|$|Crucibles {{and their}} covers {{are made of}} high temperature-resistant materials, usually porcelain, alumina or an inert metal. One of the {{earliest}} uses of platinum was to make crucibles. Ceramics such as alumina, zirconia, and especially magnesia will tolerate the highest temperatures. More recently, metals such as nickel and zirconium have been used. The lids are typically loose-fitting to allow gases to escape during heating of a sample inside. Crucibles and their lids can come in high form and low form shapes and in various sizes, but rather small 10-15 ml size porcelain crucibles are commonly used for gravimetric chemical analysis. These small size crucibles and their covers made of porcelain are quite cheap when sold in quantity to <b>laboratories,</b> and the <b>crucibles</b> are sometimes disposed of after use in precise quantitative chemical analysis. There is usually a large mark-up when they are sold individually in hobby shops.|$|R
40|$|The {{suspension}} of copper droplets in the slag is considered. The copper/slug suspension is delivered {{as the product}} from the direct-to-blister process which is applied in the KGHM – Polska Miedź (Polish Copper) S. A. factory. The droplets / slag suspension was treated by a special set of reagents (patented by the authors) to improve the coagulation process. On the other hand, the observations are made to estimate if the melting / reduction process in the furnace is sufficiently effective to avoid a remaining of carbon in the copper droplets. The coagulation process {{was carried out in}} the <b>crucible</b> (<b>laboratory</b> scale). However, conditions imposed to the coagulation / solidification process in the laboratory scale were to some extent similar to those applied usually in the industry when the suspension is subjected to the analogous treatment in the electric arc-furnace. Some suggestions are formulated how to improve the industrial direct-to-blister process...|$|R
