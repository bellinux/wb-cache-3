40|$|The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America {{reports that}} an {{underground}} mine {{is the most}} difficult environment to illuminate (Rea, 2000). Researchers at the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) are conducting ongoing studies designed to explore different lighting technologies for improving mine safety. Underground miners use different visual cues to escape from a smoke-filled environment. Primary and secondary escapeways are marked with reflective ceiling tags of various colors. Miners also look for mine rail tracks. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} compare different lighting types and ceiling tag colors to differentiate what works best in a smoke-filled environment. Various <b>cap</b> <b>lamps</b> (LED and incandescent) and lasers (red, blue, green) were compared to see which options resulted in the longest detection distances for red, green and blue reflective markers and a section of mine rail track. All targets advanced toward the human subject inside of a smoke-filled room to simulate the subject walking in a mine environment. Detection distances were recorded and analyzed to find the best <b>cap</b> <b>lamp,</b> laser color and target color in a smoke environment. Results show that <b>cap</b> <b>lamp,</b> laser color and target color do make a difference in detection distances and are perceived differently based on subject age. <b>Cap</b> <b>lamps</b> were superior to lasers in all circumstances of ceiling tag detection, with the exception of the green laser.
