5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and <b>leafscale</b> <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|R
40|$|Portuguese {{commercial}} Elasmobranch landings were {{analysed for}} the period 1986 – 2009 and revealed that some species may be in danger of overfishing. Landings totalled 122, 515 mt, {{with an average of}} 5, 105 mt landed yearly, with captured sharks, skates and rays representing 8 orders, 14 families and 44 species. Annual landings for the fishery generally decreased over time, with a corresponding increase in price per kilogram. The most landed group, skates (Raja sp.), accounted for 33 % of the landings, or 40, 344 mt. They were followed by lesser spotted catsharks (Scyliorhinus sp.), Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), <b>leafscale</b> <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Centrophorus squamosus), blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Centrophorus granulosus) (accounting for 12 %, 11 %, 10 %, 9 % and 8 % of the landings, respectively). In the absence of CPUE data, comparative trends of landings and price over time were used as an indicator of the status of specific Elasmobranch species. Centrophorus granulosus, smoothounds (Mustelus sp.), torpedo rays (Torpedo sp.), requiem sharks (Carcharhinus sp.) and angel sharks (Squatina sp.) displayed indications of possible over-exploitation, with significantly decreasing landings and increasing prices over time, and merit the focus of future research. The pattern shown by fishing effort over time (i. e. number of fishing vessels over time) displayed a marked decrease, although this was substantially less than the decrease shown by landings of the species mentioned earlier. It is therefore unlikely that such a decrease in landings is justified solely by a decrease in number of fishing vessels. Similarly, the increase in price shown for all species was largely superior to the increase in inflation, which would suggest that the increase in inflation alone would not account for the increase in price. All results and data corroborate the notion that some species are, in fact, over-exploited and in need of immediate management and conservation measurements. These findings were substantiated by min/max auto-correlation factor analysis (MAFA), which shows that the most important trend is that of a decrease in landings of those species where overfishing in indicated.

50|$|Due to the {{frequency}} and patterns of migration the <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> population estimates may be inaccurate with some sharks being counted twice, which are exacerbated by inappropriate tagging techniques. There are multiple species of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> which has contributed to misidentification in the past.

50|$|Human {{interaction}} with the <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> exists mainly {{in the form of}} fishing. Longline fishing is a typical method for fishing at the depth required to catch <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> and the broad distribution of gulper habitat leads to this method being used to catch gulpers around the world. However, <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> are not always caught intentionally. The deep waters in which the <b>gulper</b> and similar <b>shark</b> species live is difficult to harvest, and longlines are an unspecific form of fishing.

50|$|While {{information}} concerning <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> exists, {{there is no}} place to centrally compile the information so that other researchers may easily obtain it.

40|$|Deep-water sharks exhibit species-specific {{reproductive}} strategies, {{which include}} segregation by sex, size and reproductive stage. However, {{due to the}} wide spatial distribution of most species, available information, usually collected at a regional scale, is usually not adequate to infer species reproductive spatial dynamics. This study draws together information {{on the distribution of}} reproductive stages of three species of squaliform sharks: Portuguese dogfish Centroscymnus coelolepis (Somniosidae), <b>leafscale</b> <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> Centrophorus squamosus (Centrophoridae) and birdbeak dogfish Deania calcea (Centrophoridae), gathering data from several geographical areas from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. For each species we analysed the sex ratio and the spatial patterns of reproductive stages within regions, considering the influence of geographical area, depth, season, temperature and salinity. The combination of statistical methods used in this study successfully identified a number of life history patterns which reflect different use of habitats by sex and life cycle stage. Pregnant females of the three species are spatially segregated, inhabiting shallower and/or warmer waters. In the case of the <b>leafscale</b> <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> this segregation might be associated with large scale migrations. In contrast, in Portuguese dogfish all adult maturity stages occur in the same geographical area. Pregnant female birdbeak dogfish were rare in all samples. Larger immature specimens of all the three species distribute deeper than the remaining maturity stages in most of the regions analysed. Mature males of <b>leafscale</b> <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> and birdbeak dogfish were more broadly distributed than mature females, supporting the possibility of sex-biased dispersal. Neonates and small sized specimens were scarce in the Northeast Atlantic potentially explained by their concentration in nurseries, and/or by gear selectivity. Management measures will benefit from considering the geographic scale of demographic variation between species. However, standardized collaborative approaches will be needed for comprehensive assessment. Publicado...|$|E

40|$|The Fisheries Research Centre has {{conducted}} a deep-water survey programme since 1993 {{and as part}} of this programme a deep-water trawl survey was carried out in September 1996. The survey fished areas along the continental slope west of Ireland from 52 ° N to 58 ° N at depths of 500 - 1, 200 m The primary objective was to secure samples of potentially commercial deep-water shark and teleost species in order to examine aspects of their age, growth, reproduction and diet. The survey was conducted on a chartered commercial fishing vessel using a deep-water otter trawl fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. A total of 26 hauls were made during 87 hours of fishing and yielded a total catch of 29, 345 kg. The ground covered ranged from mud to gravel and bare rock and there was no significant gear damage during the survey. Thirteen species of chondrichtian and 33 species of teleost fish were recorded. Length, weight sex and maturity data were taken from some of these species. The most abundant species in the catch were Baird's smoothhead, roundnose grenadier, <b>leafscale</b> <b>gulper</b> <b>shark,</b> black scabbard and orange roughy. Trawl discards expressed as kg discarded per tonne of roundnose grenadier landed were calculated for a broad range of the most abundant species in the catch. During the survey in the Rockall Trough an estimated 16 t of deep-water species were discarded and results are compared to estimates for 1995. The main species discarded were smoothhead, squaliform sharks and Lepidion eques. Results indicate up to 16, 783 t of deep-water species may have been discarded from the deep-water fishery in this area in 1996.

40|$|A {{deepwater}} trawl survey programme {{has been}} operated since 1993 by the Fisheries Research Centre (FRC) {{in the deep}} waters of the Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank. The present survey took place {{over a period of}} 10 days in October and November 1997 on the eastern and southern slopes of the Rockall Trough from 54 °N to 59 °N. Fishing was carried out in five separate areas, in four depth strata: 500 - 700 m, 700 - 900 m, 900 - 1100 m and 1100 - 1300 m. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondrichthyan and teleost fish for the FRC deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis offish by the FRC chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on a commercial trawler using commercial deepwater demersal otter trawl gear. In total 15 species of chondrichthyan, 41 species of teleost fish and 5 species of cephalopods were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were roundnose grenadier, Portuguese dogfish, <b>leafscale</b> <b>gulper</b> <b>shark,</b> and Baird's smoothhead. Over the entire survey discarding was estimated as 50. 5 % of the total catch. Discard rates expressed as kg discarded per tonne roundnose grenadier landed and {{as a percentage of the}} total catch when compared with those of previous years showed no appreciable change. The main species discarded were rabbitfish, birdbeak dogfish, Baird's smoothhead, roundnose grenadier and Lepidion eques. Catch per unit effort rates expressed as kg caught per hour fished compared with rates for previous trawl surveys showed marked declines. Length frequency distributions for the main chondrichthyan species showed absence of smaller individuals from the samples and sexual dimorphism with respect to length. Attachment of fine-mesh cod-end liner suggested that the commercial gear selects all length frequencies present and that mesh size may not be an effective management measure in this fishery.
