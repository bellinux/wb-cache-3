25|$|Across the world, it {{is common}} for people to sleep in the same bed as one another after copulation. Humans are {{more likely to engage in}} sexual {{activity}} at night, so therefore night-time brings the highest danger of infidelity. Due to females investing more in the relationship (Parental investment), women therefore receive more benefits from sleeping with their mate during the night. Keeping close proximity with a partner acts as a mate guarding technique as it minimises the likelihood of unfaithfulness by the male, and also assures their partner of her fidelity. As a result of the paternal confidence, the male is also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and provide resources. In one study it was found that 73.7% of participants said that females are more likely to want to sleep together after sexual intercourse. Mate guarding is a very likely explanation to this, but it may also have the benefits of increasing the female's protection, potentially from male poachers.|$|E

Typically, a 10 % increase in the unemployment rate leads to a 5 % increase in out-migration.

However, older people in low income community are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be admitted in nursing home. The goals {{of this study is}} (1) to understand the service needs of older people living in low income rental estates; and (2) to understand factors associated with the aging-in-place preference of older people in low income naturally occurring retirement communities. METHOD: Respondents of this study came from four low income public rental estates. We conducted 9 focus group interviews with residents, their services providers, and property management staff of these states. We also conducted face-to-face interview with 400 older residents in these estates. RESULTS: Older people who reported a neighbour support network were 6. 26 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> prefer <b>staying</b> in the community and those who had received support from family member living together were 3. 1 times more like <b>to</b> prefer <b>staying</b> in the community. Respondents who lived in an estate that had an elderly center were 2. 75 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> prefer <b>staying</b> in the community than those who lived in an estate that did not have an elderly centre.

500|$|Parenting {{is a large}} task within itself, {{and when}} a parent has a career as well, it can cause a double burden, or work–family conflict. Strain begins to develop when women and men find that the demands of their family are {{conflicting}} with the demands from their job. When one is faced with a double burden like this, it affects how decisions are made within a career and in a family; this burden could potentially effect when a couple decides to have children. 75% of all women who have jobs are in their childbearing prime. When the conflict between one's family and work presents itself, the unpaid work that is being done in the home may be cut down, because of the certain health effects, or {{as a solution to}} deal with the greater demands from the workplace. Social outings and visits, and family dinners are two of the first things that get cut back on due to the work/family conflict. In a study by Ari Väänänen, May V. Kevin, et al. found that if a man put a higher importance on their family, were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> home from work {{in order to deal with}} extreme family demands. Ways that the double burden can be lessened for is with hired help in the house, day-care facilities, and longer maternity leaves for women. For instance, in Norway women are allowed the options of 10months of maternity leave, where they will get 100% of their pay, or 12months leave, where they will only paid 80% of their earnings. Some companies are realizing the effect the double burden of work and a family is having on their employees and are offering flexible work schedules in order to help their employees cope. Not only do these flexible hours help the employee deal with their stress, but it also benefits the company because workers are happier, less likely to be absent, more productive, and the turnover rate is lower for the company. As Sophia Mwangi says, [...] "Parenthood is a joy. Let us never be burdened by it but let's celebrate the joy that it brings.

Whatever it is, let's celebrate our children. It's not easy, but the art of juggling can always be mastered!" ...|$|E

40|$|PurposePrior studies {{reported}} homeless adolescents engage in more sexual risk than their housed peers. However, these comparisons are typically made post hoc by comparing homeless adolescent community-based samples {{with high school}} probability samples. This study utilizes {{a random sample of}} high school students to examine homelessness experiences and sexual risk behaviors. MethodsA supplemental survey to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey containing questions regarding homelessness and sexual health was administered to Los Angeles high school students (N= 1, 839). Multivariate logistic regressions assessed the associations between demographics, past year homelessness experiences (i. e., place of nighttime residence), and being sexually active and condom use at last intercourse. ResultsHomelessness experiences consisted of staying in a shelter (10. 4 %), a public place (10. 1 %), and with a stranger (5. 6 %). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ), younger, and male adolescents were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience homelessness. LGBTQ adolescents were also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>staying</b> with a stranger and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>staying</b> in a shelter. Compared <b>to</b> adolescents who <b>stayed</b> in shelters, adolescents who stayed with strangers and in public places were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in unprotected sex at last intercourse. ConclusionsAdolescents who report sexual activity and sexual risk taking are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report homelessness experiences. With regard <b>to</b> sexual health, <b>staying</b> with strangers could be a particularly risky form of homelessness; LGBTQ and Black adolescents are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience this form of homelessness.

2500|$|Most wine racks are {{designed}} to allow a wine to be stored on its side. The thinking behind this orientation is that the cork is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> moist and not dry out if it is kept in constant contact with the wine. Some wineries package their wines upside down in the box for much the same reason. Research in the late 1990s suggested that the ideal orientation for wine bottles is at a slight angle, rather than completely horizontal. This allows the cork to maintain partial contact with the wine {{in order to stay}} damp but also keeps the air bubble formed by a wine's ullage at the top rather than {{in the middle of the}} bottle if the wine is lying on its side. Keeping the ullage near the top, it has been argued, allows for a slower and more gradual oxidation and maturation process. This is because the pressure of the air bubble that is the ullage space rises and falls depending on temperature fluctuation. When exposed to higher temperatures the bubble's pressure increases (becomes positive relative to the air outside of the bottle), and if the wine is tilted at an angle, this compressed gas will diffuse through the cork and not harm the wine. [...] When the temperature falls the process reverses. [...] If the wine is completely on its side then this action will eject some wine through the cork. Through this [...] "breathing" [...] which can result from variations in temperature, oxygen may be repeatedly introduced into the bottle and as a result, can react with the wine. [...] An appropriate and constant temperature is therefore preferred. Additionally, oxidation will occur more rapidly at higher temperatures and gases dissolve into liquids faster the lower the temperature.|$|E
