5000|$|<b>Limited</b> <b>feeding</b> on {{the host}} occurs until the host pupates; after which, {{most of it}} is {{consumed}} by the wasp. [...] Usually, only one parasite per host is found, but in some cases, superparasitism occurs, and two to four wasps will attach to, and emerge from one host. [...] Once the wasps emerge, the ant colony grooms and feeds {{them as if they were}} part of the ants’ brood. In some instances, worker ants have been observed assisting the wasps to emerge from their host. The wasps gain acceptance in these ways, and the ants show no signs of aggression because the wasps acquire their host's odor upon entry into the colony. By mimicking the odor of their host, eucharitid wasps are able to keep themselves safe until the scent wears off, at which point they begin to leave the ant colony and begin mating.|$|E
50|$|The {{supporting}} {{evidence of the}} cooking hypothesis argues that compared to the nutrients in the raw food, nutrients in cooked food are much easier to digest for hominids {{as shown in the}} research of protein ingestion from raw vs. cooked egg. Such a feature is essential for brain evolution: through studying the metabolic activities between primate species, scientists had found that there is a limitation of energy harvesting through food sources due to <b>limited</b> <b>feeding</b> time. Besides the brain, other organs in the human body also demand a high level of metabolism. At the same time, the body mass portion of different organs was changing throughout the process of evolution as a means for brain expansion. Homo genus was able to break through the limit by cooking food to lower their feeding time and be able to absorb more nutrients to accommodate the increasing need for energy. In addition, scientists argue that the Homo species was also able to obtain nutrients like DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) from algae that were especially beneficial and critical for brain evolution and, as mentioned in the previous sections, the detoxification of the cooking process enabled early humans to access these resources.|$|E

40|$|The {{horse was}} domesticated about 6000 years ago. Since then humans {{have used the}} horse for {{different}} purposes, such as work force and in sports. Horses are social, group living animals that spend around 16 - 17 hours a day on grazing. Horses are often kept stabled in single boxes with a <b>limited</b> <b>feeding</b> time. The forage usually contains grain-based concentrates and roughage. The most common training method used on horses is negative reinforcement and the horse is being controlled with a bridle and the legs and feet of the rider. In sports like racing, dressage, and harness racing, different equipment is used on the horse to enhance compliance, control or to increase speed. The aim of this review article was to investigate, from an ethological point of view, how horses used for work or in sports are restricted, and what consequences may arise. The result indicate that social preferences are extremely important to horses, {{and that there are}} several benefits of group housing, including better behavior towards the trainer and improved learning ability. Deprivation of social interaction can lead to aggressiveness, apathy and stereotypic behavior. Stabled horses in single boxes that have a <b>limited</b> <b>feeding</b> time and are fed with a large amount of grain-concentrate, are at risk of developing ulcers and stereotypic behaviors. Training a horse with contradictive signals or in a coercive manner can lead to the development of learned helplessness.

40|$|Because of intake {{depression}} prior to calving and slow intake ascent post-calving, {{the transition period}} is the major risk period for abomasal displacements. Feeding and management practices that prevent other calving-related disorders {{reduce the risk of}} abomasal displacements. Cows that have excess body condition at calving are at increased risk of ketosis and abomasal displacements. Both excessive and minimal feeding of concentrates pre-calving may increase the risk of abomasal displacements. Feed bunk management is an important risk factor for abomasal displacements. Inadequate bunk space, high competition at the feed bunk, restricted bunk access time, and restricted <b>feed</b> availability may <b>limit</b> intake.

The importance of bunk management practices that <b>limit</b> <b>feed</b> intake in causing LDA is likely greatest during the early post-calving period, because of the coinciding events of the transition period. Feed delivery practices can alter the actual nutrient densities of the consumed ration relative to nutrient specifications of the formulated ration.

40|$|Cattle are {{normally}} fed under ad libitum condi tions (allowed to eat according to appetite). Generally, this allows for maximum performance because energy consumed above the maintenance requirement {{is available for}} gain. However, recent work suggests that limit-fed animals may have better feed efficiency. This has economic importance in that changes in feed efficiency have three times the impact on cost of gain as an equal change in rate of gain. <b>Limit</b> <b>feeding</b> also allows a producer to target weights for breeding cattle, grass cattle or marketing of cattle. It also reduces the amount of manure produced which must be utilized. Animals fed under ad libitum conditions will have fluctuations in feed intake. These fluctuations may result in decreased feed utilization due to digestive disturbances. It {{is also important to}} realize that as intake increases, rate of passage increases and digestibility decreases. As feed moves through the gastrointestinal tract faster, digestibility is reduced because the feed is exposed to digestive processes for a shorter time.
