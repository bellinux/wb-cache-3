50|$|Directly {{behind to}} one side of this {{building}} is a detached kitchen and pantry. This building is intact. It is rectangular in plan and is also constructed of rubble. It has a verandah roof supported on timber posts along one side over an earth floor. The gabled roof is clad with corrugated iron over a frame of poles and pit-sawn beams although the battens have been renewed. The walls are higher inside than outside and are formed around the roof beams and door lintels. The end wall to the rear contains a chimney that has been repaired with brick at the top. The interior of the structure has been limewashed and has a timber floor. There is a wide fireplace and working bench for cooking at one end with a brick floor around the hearth. At {{the other end of the}} building is a room with a <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> <b>roof</b> and a brick floor, which is thought to have been used as a pantry.|$|E
40|$|Annotation The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} a project of a new building of a family farmhouse with accommodation situated in the cadastral area of Lezník. The farmhouse {{is sitting on the}} suburb of the village and is surrounded by old original barns. This house is designed for a family of 5 members. A part of the farmhouse is used as a Bed and Breakfast for up to 12 people. Each part of the house (living and accommodation) has got its own entrance. The building is covered with a double pitched roof in an L shape. The roof above the living kitchen is designed as a shed (<b>lean</b> <b>to)</b> <b>roof.</b> For the main wall structural system we have used Porotherm system, apart from the gables which are constructed as a wooden structure due to the size and unusual shapes of windows. The facade is designed as a combination of direct external insulation and ventilated facade. Documentation has been prepared for this building construction. The graphical part of this documentation has been processed in the AUTOCAD software...|$|E
50|$|The stables have slab {{walls to}} plate height and {{comprise}} a rectangular core with a gabled roof and a verandah <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> the west, north and east. There {{is also a}} <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> extension to the east. The stables have a weatherboard hayloft added across the original gabled section. Openings along the southern side have large doors with forged pins, catches and hinges. To {{the north of the}} stables are yards.|$|R

50|$|In 2012 {{the station}} {{building}} {{was found to}} have a 10 cm <b>lean,</b> and <b>to</b> be in poor condition due <b>to</b> major <b>roof</b> leaks affecting the structure.

40|$|In two experiments, we {{investigated}} whether body posture influences people’s estimation of quantities. According to the mental-number-line theory, people mentally represent numbers along a line with smaller {{numbers on the}} left and larger numbers on the right. We hypothesized that surreptitiously making people <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> the right or to the left would affect their quantitative estimates. Participants answered estimation questions while standing on a Wii Balance Board. Posture was manipulated within subjects so that participants answered some questions while they <b>leaned</b> slightly <b>to</b> the left, some questions while they <b>leaned</b> slightly <b>to</b> the right, and some questions while they stood upright. Crucially, participants were not aware of this manipulation. Estimates were significantly smaller when participants <b>leaned</b> <b>to</b> the left than when they <b>leaned</b> <b>to</b> the right...|$|R

60|$|The fellow, {{acting on}} impulse of curiosity, stepped {{to my side}} and to his undoing, for as he <b>leaned</b> <b>to</b> peer over the eaves I grasped him by his throat and his pistol arm and threw him heavily <b>to</b> the <b>roof.</b> The weapon dropped from his grasp, and my fingers choked off his {{attempted}} cry for assistance. I gagged and bound him and then hung him {{over the edge of}} the roof as I myself had hung a few moments before. I knew it would be morning before he would be discovered, and I needed all the time that I could gain.|$|R

5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider <b>leans</b> <b>to</b> the right relative to the bike, and the bike <b>leans</b> <b>to</b> the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|R

It causes an initial steer angle to the right, a <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> the left, and eventually a steady-state <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> the left, steer angle to the left, and thus a turn to the left.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> new product development (NPD) processes has been claimed to generate {{positive impact on}} NPD performance. There are very few empirical studies, however, on how organizations should apply lean practices or on {{the exact nature of}} the impact of lean on NPD performance. To further understand how the {{application of}} lean can improve NPD performance, additional empirical studies are needed. This research was designed {{to gain a better understanding}} of how organizations can apply <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> improve NPD processes. The objectives of this research were (1) to identify common practices used <b>to</b> apply <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> NPD processes, (2) to identify performance indicators used to evaluate NPD process performance and the impact of applying lean on NPD process performance improvement, (3) to identify challenges faced by organizations in applying <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> NPD, (4) to study whether or not there was a relationship between the number of practices used and NPD process performance, and (5) to study whether or not there was a relationship between years of experience with lean and NPD process performance. Eight hypotheses were developed to support the research objectives. An internet survey was created to collect data to test the eight hypotheses. Fifty-eight organization...|$|R
