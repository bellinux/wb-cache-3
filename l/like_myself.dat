500|$|Naser Khader, a Muslim Danish MP, founded an {{organisation}} called Democratic Muslims in Denmark {{in response}} to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to speak for all Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because [...] "the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united {{and that there is a}} real difference between the Islamists and people <b>like</b> <b>myself.</b> Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic." [...] He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.|$|E

500|$|While it awarded 90%, Amiga Power {{felt the}} game was poor value for money {{compared}} to the original, while CU Amiga said it was [...] "still worth buying". AUI said {{the game was}} [...] "a must" [...] for those without the original, otherwise Cannon Fodder 2 is [...] "basically exactly the same game as before", with the [...] "saving grace" [...] of new levels. Amiga Computing enjoyed the game but {{said it was not}} as good as expected and that there are [...] "too many similarities and not enough differences to make this sequel a classic." [...] The One summarised: [...] "If you've got CF1, love it, and want seconds, only harder, look no further – but, if <b>like</b> <b>myself</b> you've played Cannon Fodder to death and would've liked to have seen the game developed in some way, I think you'll be a bit disappointed".|$|E
500|$|Critics lauded Hathaway and McAvoy for the {{chemistry}} between their characters, finding that it lent authenticity to the love story between Austen and Lefroy. While Hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics, some reviews negatively {{focused on her}} nationality {{as well as the}} inauthenticity of her accent. James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should, [...] "find the right actor…and [...] is undoubtedly brilliant." [...] Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to [...] "sound too much <b>like</b> <b>myself</b> and not at all like Jane", blaming cold weather in Ireland, which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes. Nonetheless, Jarrold praised Hathaway for her performance. In a wrap up party after the filming, the director confessed that the actress had been a different person, [...] "not just her accent but also the whole character, the way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different".|$|E
500|$|After being cast, Colfer {{said that}} he was happy [...] "to be a part of {{something}} that is so new and different and so needed at this time", and added, [...] "It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, <b>like</b> <b>myself,</b> who need a little pick-me-up." [...] Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin. Although Kolkin was thirteen {{at the time of the}} audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was [...] "so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback". Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode [...] "The Substitute", club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.|$|E

Edwards clinched his seventh pole position during his career, {{with a time of}} 26.395, which made a new track record. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Allmendinger. Kurt Busch qualified third, Biffle took fourth, and Jamie McMurray started fifth. Hamlin, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified seventeenth, while Johnson was scored twenty-first. The three drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Joe Nemechek, Michael McDowell, and Jason Leffler. Once the qualifying session completed, Edwards commented, [...] "The first thing that we’re going to have an advantage Sunday is with our pit stall, that’s going to help us a lot. I think we have an advantage because [...] {{have to be a little}} bit conservative. Guys <b>like</b> <b>myself</b> we’re really battling for fourth in points and battling for wins.

He {{added that the}} [...] "level of quality from the special effects to the script is amazing for a fan made show, and the show manages to capture what made the original Star Trek great." [...] Anthony Pascale, in his review for TrekMovie.com, said that the production design in the episode was the best yet for New Voyages. He credited this to the direction and improvements in the lighting, {{as well as the}} improved special effects. Pascale said that the guest appearances of Moses and Takei [...] "fits in the fine tradition of memorable Trek guest characters", saying that the [...] "alluring" [...] Moses played Alana with a [...] "subtle charm". Overall, he said that [...] "fans of fan films and Star Trek: New Voyages are sure to be pleased. But for those <b>like</b> <b>myself</b> who have not really bothered with fan films should really give this one a chance." ...|$|E
500|$|Fuller, however, was {{not without}} her critics. A {{one-time}} friend, the English writer Harriet Martineau, {{was one of her}} harshest detractors after Fuller's death. Martineau said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist, that she had [...] "shallow conceits" [...] and often [...] "looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely... and despised those who, <b>like</b> <b>myself,</b> could not adopt her scale of valuation". The influential editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold, who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to Woman in the Nineteenth Century as [...] "an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female". New York writer Charles Frederick Briggs said that she was [...] "wasting the time of her readers", especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not [...] "truly represent the female character". English writer and critic Matthew Arnold scoffed at Fuller's conversations as well, saying, [...] "My G–d, what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!" [...] Sophia Hawthorne, who had previously been a supporter of Fuller, was critical of her after Woman of the Nineteenth Century was published: ...|$|E

500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new <b>like</b> <b>myself</b> comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E
500|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza, Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening, and Ushkowitz, from the Broadway revival of The King and I. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. Colfer had no previous professional experience, but reminded Ryan {{of the character of}} Kurt from The Sound of Music, and was thus cast as Kurt Hummel. He originally auditioned for Artie with the song [...] "Mr. Cellophane", however Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. Colfer commented on his casting: [...] "I'm so happy {{to be a part of}} something that is so new and different and so needed at this time. It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, <b>like</b> <b>myself,</b> who need a little pick-me-up.

500|$|In February, Dodd {{turned his}} {{attention}} fully to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. When asked by the Associated Press {{on the campaign trail}} if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, [...] "There is enough time yet to change this , because there are places like Iowa and New Hampshire that give candidates <b>like</b> <b>myself</b> a chance to be heard." [...] Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come in here and do sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president. On the trail, he referred to Ahmadinejad as a [...] "thug".|$|E

500|$|The single {{also drew}} {{comparisons}} to [...] "Party O'Clock," [...] a 2010 single by American singer Kat DeLuna, also produced by RedOne. In {{a statement issued}} to the New York Daily News, DeLuna said [...] "It's cool that artists like J.Lo are inspired by my musical sound and style. ... Jennifer helped {{pave the way for}} Latinas <b>like</b> <b>myself.</b> I love her", and insisted that there wasn't an issue. DeLuna also noted Lopez as someone who inspired her, and paved the way for someone like her to perform. Following previews of the music video for [...] "On the Floor," [...] DeLuna changed her mind about how she felt with the claims of copying. In another interview with the New York Daily News, several days after the first, she said [...] "I've seen this before, where the more established artist tries to take the vision and artistic ideas away from an emerging artist, and assumes no one will notice because of their bigger shadow,... Luckily, my loyal fans {{and the power of the}} Internet have let the 'Kat' out of the bag." [...] Lopez was interviewed about the issue on Hispanic-American entertainment program ¡Despierta America!. Lopez replied [...] "What? Really? I'm not aware of that...", and when pressed by the presenter a second time, insisted she had not heard rumors of the comparisons.|$|E
500|$|Like Isler, Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Ken Tucker enjoyed Walter's transition [...] "from happy, babbling, 'I love LSD!' licorice-licking Walter to a Walter who {{yelled at}} the others when escaping", calling it [...] "one of the night's great pleasures." [...] Tucker's Entertainment Weekly colleague Jeff Jensen commented {{that he was able}} to [...] "roll" [...] with some of the less plausible plot details (such as a still existing Massive Dynamic) out of praise for guest stars Cusick and Haig, believing they [...] "worked well in this world." [...] Jensen also reserved attention for Noble's scenes, calling them variously [...] "frisky and poignant", [...] "hilarious", and [...] "touching." [...] Lastly, Jensen was happy to find more details about the Observers, but wondered at the lack of the parallel universe's mention. MTV's Alex Zalben was more critical. He wondered how the episode fit into the rest of the season, and wrote [...] "It’s a curious step, and could likely drive even more viewers away from a show that can’t afford to lose them." [...] While disliking the [...] "clunky, explainy" [...] dialogue, Zalben still commented that, [...] "for a die hard FRINGE fan <b>like</b> <b>myself,</b> this episode was crack. Huge emotion, crazy science, and epic set pieces. The end of the episode had me dying to watch the next one, even if it isn’t a direct continuation. That’s good television right there." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN Todd Gilchrist {{called it}} Bay's best film, and [...] "one {{of the few}} {{instances}} where it's OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time, mostly because it's undeniably also {{a whole lot of}} fun". The Advertiser Sean Fewster found the visual effects so seamless that [...] "you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence". The Denver Post Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having [...] "a believably rendered scale and intimacy", and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised [...] "that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon <b>like</b> <b>myself</b> became involved in the fate of these mega-machines". Ain't It Cool News's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story, and that [...] "it has a real sense of wonder, one of the things that's missing from so much of the big CGI lightshows released these days". Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun, and said that [...] " [...] manages to hold on to his audience's suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes". Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, giving it 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset." ...|$|E

500|$|A few National Socialist {{black metal}} (NSBM) bands like the Nokturnal Mortum, or Russia's Temnozor and Kroda {{have been known}} to cross over into folk metal, a {{circumstance}} that Ciaran O'Hagan, the vocalist of Waylander, views as [...] "an insult to people <b>like</b> <b>myself</b> who don’t hold with fascist ideals at all." [...] He further suggests that the NSBM bands are playing folk metal [...] "for all the wrong reasons." [...] Due to the misappropriation of pagan symbols by Neo-Nazism, several folk metal bands have also been mistaken for being part of the NSBM scene. Consequently, such bands as Cruachan, Skyforger, Moonsorrow, Månegarm and Týr have had to disassociate themselves with Nazism, fascism or racism. Skyforger went as far as to add the words 'No Nazi Stuff Here!' on the back of their album covers. In April 2008, performers on the folk metal festival Paganfest were subject to accusations of being Nazis, racists and fascists from the German Antifa. Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow and Heri Joensen of Týr issued a joint video statement to refute these accusations, noting that [...] "one of the biggest issues seems to be that we use ancient Scandinavian symbols in our imagery like the S in the Moonsorrow logo and the T in the Týr logo [...] that is how the S and the T runes have been written for thousands of years." [...] Moonsorrow has also issued a written statement in response to the controversy while Týr notes on their official website that they [...] "got the idea for the rune logo" [...] from the Black Sabbath album of the same name. On {{the other side of the}} political landscape, some folk metal bands have uttered explicit socialist sentiments. For example the aforementioned Glittertind made a leftist statement against neoliberalism in their album booklet when re-releasing the record Til Dovre Faller on Napalm Records in May 2009.|$|E
