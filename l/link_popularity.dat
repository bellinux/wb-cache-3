25|$|For {{search engine}} {{optimization}} purposes, some companies offer to sell high PageRank links to webmasters. As links from higher-PR pages {{are believed to}} be more valuable, they tend to be more expensive. It can be an effective and viable marketing strategy to buy link advertisements on content pages of quality and relevant sites to drive traffic and increase a webmaster's <b>link</b> <b>popularity.</b> However, Google has publicly warned webmasters that if they are or were discovered to be selling links for the purpose of conferring PageRank and reputation, their links will be devalued (ignored in the calculation of other pages' PageRanks). The practice of buying and selling links is intensely debated across the Webmaster community. Google advises webmasters to use the nofollow HTML attribute value on sponsored links. According to Matt Cutts, Google is concerned about webmasters who try to game the system, and thereby reduce the quality and relevance of Google search results.|$|E
50|$|Website {{saturation}} and popularity, or {{how much}} presence a website has on search engines, can be analyzed through the number of pages of the site that are indexed by search engines (saturation) and how many backlinks the site has (popularity). It requires pages to contain keywords {{people are looking for}} and ensure that they rank high enough in search engine rankings. Most search engines include some form of <b>link</b> <b>popularity</b> in their ranking algorithms. The following are major tools measuring various aspects of saturation and link popularity: <b>Link</b> <b>Popularity,</b> Top 10 Google Analysis, and Marketleap's <b>Link</b> <b>Popularity</b> and Search Engine Saturation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I study a fixed effects model of dyadic link {{formation}} for directed networks. I discuss inference on structural parameters {{as well as}} a test of model specification. In the model, an agent's linking decisions depend on perceived similarity to potential linking partners(homophily). Agents are endowed with potentially unobserved characteristics that govern their ability to establish links (productivity) and to receive <b>links</b> (<b>popularity).</b> Heterogeneity in productivity and popularity is a structural driver of degree heterogeneity. The unobserved heterogeneity is captured by a fixed effects approach. This allows for arbitrary correlation between an observed homophily component and latent sources of degree heterogeneity. The linking model accounts for link reciprocity by allowing linking decisions within each pair of agents to be correlated. Estimates of structural parameters related to homophily preferences and reciprocity can be obtained by ML but inference is non-standard due to the incidental parameter problem (Neyman and Scott 1948). I study t-statistics constructed from ML estimates via a naive plug-in approach. For these statistics it is not appropriate to compute critical values from a standard normal distribution because of the incidental parameter problem. I suggest modified t-statistics that are justified by an asymptotic approximation that sends the number of agents to infinity. For a t-test based on the modified statistics, critical values can be computed from a standard normal distribution. My model specification test compares observed transitivity to the transitivity predicted by the dyadic linking model. The test statistic corrects for incidental parameter bias that is due to ML estimation of the null model. The implementation of my procedures is illustrated by an application to favor networks in Indianvillages. JEL:C 33, C 3...|$|R

50|$|A {{reciprocal}} link is {{a mutual}} link between two objects, commonly between two websites, to ensure mutual traffic. For example, Alice and Bob have websites. If Bob's website links to Alice's website and Alice's website links to Bob's website, the websites are reciprocally linked. Website owners often submit their sites to reciprocal link exchange directories {{in order to}} achieve higher rankings in the search engines.

In 2005, with their Jagger 2 update, Google stopped giving credit to reciprocal links as it does not indicate genuine <b>link</b> <b>popularity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{knowledge}} {{workers are}} confronted with a high load of heterogeneous information {{making it difficult for}} them to identify the information relevant for performing their tasks. Particularly challenging is thereby the alignment of process-related information (process informa-tion for short), such as e-mails, office files, forms, checklists, guidelines, and best practices, with business processes. In previous work, we intro-duced the concept of process-oriented information logistics (POIL) to bridge this gap. POIL allows for the process-oriented and context-aware delivery of relevant process information to knowledge workers. So far, we have introduced concepts to integrate business processes with process in-formation. A remaining challenge is to identify the process information relevant for a given process context. This paper tackles this challenge and extends our POIL approach with techniques and algorithms for identi-fying relevant process information. More specifically, we introduce two algorithms for determining the relevance of process information based on their link and rate popularity. We use a scenario from the automotive domain to demonstrate and validate the applicability of our approach. Key words: process-oriented information logistics, process information relevance, <b>link</b> <b>popularity</b> algorithm, rate popularity algorith...|$|E
