2500|$|Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Erie County, New York, {{went missing}} on July 10, 2009. She {{had been living}} in the Bronx and working as an escort through Craigslist. On the night she went missing, she met with a client, {{deposited}} $900 in her bank account, and attempted to call an old boyfriend but did not get through. Beginning one week after her disappearance, and lasting for five weeks, her teenage sister, Amanda, received a series of [...] "vulgar, mocking and insulting" [...] calls from someone who may have been the killer using her sister's cell phone. The caller spoke in a low, calm voice, and asked if Amanda [...] "was a whore like her sister." [...] The person using Melissa's phone also claimed that she was at a [...] "whorehouse in Queens." [...] The calls became increasingly disturbing, and eventually culminated in the caller telling Amanda that Melissa was dead, and {{that he was going to}} [...] "watch her rot." [...] Police were able to trace some of the calls to Madison Square Garden, midtown Manhattan, and Massapequa, but were unable to determine who was making the calls. Melissa's mother also noted that there were [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to Manorville" [...] from Melissa's phone around the time of her disappearance.|$|E
2500|$|John Bittrolff, a Suffolk county {{resident}} {{who was convicted}} of the murders of two prostitutes in 1993 and 1994, and is a suspect in the murder of a third woman from that time period, was named as a suspect in {{at least one of the}} LISK murders on September 12, 2017. Suffolk County District Attorney's office prosecutor Robert Biancavilla released a statement noting that Bittrolf was likely responsible for the deaths of other women, and that [...] "There are remains of the victims at Gilgo that may be attributed to the handiwork of Mr. Bittrolff, and that investigation is continuing". He also noted that there were some similarities between the murders that Bittrolff was convicted of, and some of the crime scenes at Gilgo Beach. Bittrolff was a carpenter who lived in Manorville, where the torsos of official LISK victims Jessica Taylor and [...] "Jane Doe No. 6" [...] were recovered. The remains were discovered roughly three miles away from Bittrolff's home. He was also a hunter who seemed to enjoy killing and mutilating animals, and reportedly once [...] "cut out the heart of a deer he had just shot and ate it raw in the woods". Neighbors also recalled him killing small animals when he was younger. Another link between Bittrolff and the Long Island Serial Killer case became apparent when it was revealed that the grown daughter of Rita Tangredi, one of the women that Bittrolff was convicted of killing, was reportedly [...] "best friends" [...] with Melissa Barthelemy, who was one of the first LISK victims discovered strangled and wrapped in burlap at Gilgo Beach. Barthelemy's mother also reported that Melissa [...] "had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to Manorville from her phone" [...] at the time.|$|E

[...] "We get a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> from people (who) have just heard us {{talking about them}} and have wanted to hear more," [...] Fisher said that September. Also in 1997, KNDD disc jockey Marco Collins played [...] "End of May" [...] on his show. Collins, who helped launch Beck to {{national}} prominence, liked both Willis {{and the effect of}} a clock ticking in the background of the song, the sole rhythmic element in the original recording.|$|E
5000|$|This {{machine was}} similar in design to the STM machine. However, {{it had a}} feature called TLP (traffic load protection). M12s were used in larger cities that had <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> volume. When call volume got very heavy, the M12 would shorten the message and then give the time. For example, [...] "Central Brevard National Bank Time four o'clock." [...] This allowed the phone company to handle more calls without {{overwhelming}} its system.|$|R

Then all the sudden my phone started to get a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> from people saying congratulations. It was pretty cool." [...] He was the first left-handed pitcher taken in the 2009 draft by the Mariners. Dustin Ackley and Kyle Seager, Moran's teammates at North Carolina, were also drafted by the Mariners in 2009.|$|E

Gani feels guilty for all his past actions, and goes to a TV studio to reveal all the connections he had with and corrupt officials {{and the amount of}} money they had taken as bribes. He reveals a couple of connections which shocks everybody. Then he refuses to reveal all the names, requesting those corrupt officials reveal themselves. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> are flooded to the TV studio from various parts of the state. The Chief minister declares that there would no cases against those who voluntarily surrendered their illegal money and it would be utilized for the people.|$|E

And in August 2015, during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter regarding the possibility of a potential sequel Hui said, [...] "We need time to think about and prepare, it's become a phenomenon and people feel like they haven't seen enough." [...] In December 2015, Hui admitted he received a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> from agents and producers, but said he won't have time to direct other movies since he was dedicated in developing Monster Hunt 2. In April 2016, Bill Kong announced the sequel is scheduled for release in the summer of 2018 and will be released on February 16, 2018. A third film was also announced.|$|E

5000|$|Usually it is {{advised to}} combine the {{internal}} devaluation with the structural reforms in {{the government and the}} economy. In practice there had been <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to implement more structural reforms and not to have flat (bookkeeper-style) cuts of expenditures across all parts of the economy. But one should take into account that structural reforms usually contradicts the internal devaluation, because the structural reforms require flexible and skilled workforce. Structural reforms usually result in high unemployment and attract a lot of criticism if workforce can not adapt and this lack of felxibility usually is due to lack or available resources (education expenses, time for gaining new skills and experience, etc.). There is at least one case when the country is left with immensely large structural unemployment after the internal devaluation.|$|E
5000|$|On May 23, 2006, Trainer told a {{reporter}} for the Hamilton Spectator that [...] "I've had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> from people worried about how it happened," [...] and that [...] "people are very, very upset" [...] The [...] reported that [...] "Trainer says natives vandalized a hydro transformer that blacked out power in Caledonia, Simcoe, Waterford and part of the Six Nations reserve. Trainer has no hard evidence Friday to back up her claim that natives set fire to the transformer." [...] The [...] offered the opinion that [...] "Trainer as a veteran politician ought to have the sense not to point fingers without proof.

50|$|After {{everyone}} has arrived, they all {{sit down for}} Christmas dinner. Everyone is digging into an abundant pile of food, chatting away, while Sarah sits there {{with a look of}} awe on her face as she has never experienced the holidays with Mauricio's family. Edy is about to give a toast to everyone but gets a call, it seems that Edy has been getting a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> and often runs out when he does which gets Anna suspicious that he is having an affair, and cheating on her again (there was one previous incident in the past). Well, when the phone rings during Edy's toast, he stops to answer the call, and having broken the last straw, Anna proclaims that she is divorcing Edy. At first everyone thinks this is a joke, but it is soon evident that Anna is dead serious. Edy reacts with little emotion, saying that if it is what Anna wants then he can't really do anything about it. Mauricio is vehemently against this and tries to get some support from Jesse, whose response is similar to his father's, which angers Mauricio further. At this time, Johnny, Ozzy, Marissa and Fernando excuse themselves as it is a family matter. After more arguing, everyone leaves to vent, except for Sarah, who stays at her seat and continues eating, sort of a gesture of comfort/support to Anna; and the two have a somewhat awkward yet endearing bonding moment.|$|E

5000|$|Schuckmansburg was a name {{given by}} the Germans, {{replacing}} Luhonono. The name has been replaced again {{by the government and}} has retained the name by which it was called before, Luhonono.

40|$|It is a {{pleasure}} to welcome you to the 13 th Great Plains Wildlife Damage Workshop. It has been 24 years since the 1 st Great Plains Workshop was held in Manhattan, Kansas, in December 1973. Attendance has varied throughout the years; focus of the workshop has changed and has evolved to where it is today. As I look around the room, I still {{see a lot of}} interest. I still get a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> about wildlife damage control, and I realize there is a great need to share the information that each of us has about wildlife damage control. That is the purpose of these types of venues. I believe a great workshop has been prepared for us.

30|$|We {{find that}} Southern Abidjan communes - Marcory (ID: 5), Port-Bouët (ID: 6), Treichville (ID: 8), and Koumassi (ID: 9) - stand out, having a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between each other, given the {{independent}} call volume (see the blue triangle cluster {{on the left}} of Figure  5). Between the southern and northern communes as well as within the northern communes, {{we can see a}} clear scaling relation, i.e. their mutual call volume scales as a function of their individual call volume. Two possible factors may influence the communication within Abidjan: (1) Geography: Abidjan is divided into northern and southern parts by the lagoon. This geographical division may influence the communication patterns. (2) Socioeconomic differences: Northern Abidjan is {{the central part of the}} city, having the business center, administrative area, and upscale residential districts, while two of four communes in Southern Abidjan - Marcory and Treichville - are poor areas and the other two (i.e. Port-Bouët and Koumassi) have an international airport and industrial area. Besides the geographic factor and economic differences of Northern and Southern Abidjan, there could be cultural and ethical differences between them. The homophily principle, namely that people with similar characteristics (e.g. culture, religions, ethnicities, economic status) are more likely to form connections [34] may be at play, where the southern part of Abidjan may consist of more homogeneous population.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{reliability}} analysis, complex models representing physical situations are used to de-termine failure domain via a given threshold not to be overpassed. These models are often very time consuming and no analytical expression is available. Thus, the evaluation of a failure probability given a threshold or the estimation of a quantile given a targeted probability cannot be done by usual compu-tation tools. Some developments {{have been done in}} two different directions: first the use of sequential Monte-Carlo methods allows to decrease the number of necessary calls to the model ([3], [1]); in this mood Guyader et al. [6] have shown that the optimal algorithm works with limit subsets, ie. fixing the current threshold at the minimum of the working population. Another approach is to use the given computational budget to fit a surrogate model and then to use it instead of the real model to evaluate quantities of interest (see [2], [5] or [4] for examples). Both approaches suffer from several limitations. Sequential Monte-Carlo would still require quite a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to the limit-state function, while fitted surrogate models can be very far from the original ones without any possibility to control precision. However, in {{the context of}} probability or quantile estimation, only the boundary delimiting failure and safety domains is to be well approximated; especially, no good approximation of the model in both domains is necessary if data points are well classified...|$|E
