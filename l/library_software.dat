5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, At Home in the World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing like a child), and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the Beinecke <b>Library.</b> <b>Software</b> developer Peter Norton bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E

40|$|If {{the role}} of <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> is to {{communicate}} information about software artefacts between software engineers, {{it is vital that}} the information be stored in such a manner as to be readily understandable. The designs of existing <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> present several cognitive impediments to a software engineer, hindering the understanding of library organisation and content. In this paper, a focused review of existing <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> is undertaken. Shortcomings of the designs of existing <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> and resulting cognitive deficiencies are identified. The design problems to be discussed are: the hiding of underlying library structure, the inadequacy of component interfaces, the problems of querying large collections, and the subjective nature of component organisation. Having encountered these problems with existing <b>software</b> <b>libraries,</b> some avenues for alleviating them are identified.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to {{other kinds of}} <b>libraries,</b> <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> need to be conceptually organized. When looking for a component, the main concern of users is the functionality of the desired component; implementation details are secondary. Software reuse would be enhanced with conceptually organized large <b>libraries</b> of <b>software</b> components. In this paper, we present GURU, a tool that allows automatical building of such large <b>software</b> <b>libraries</b> from documented <b>software</b> components. We focus here on GURU's indexing component which extracts conceptual attributes from natural language documentation. This indexing method is based on words' co-occurrences. It first uses EXTRACT, a co-occurrence knowledge compiler for extracting potential attributes from textual documents. Conceptually relevant collocations are then selected according to their resolving power, which scales down the noise due to context words. This fully automated indexing tool thus goes further than keyword-based tools {{in the understanding of}} a document without the brittleness of knowledge based tools. The indexing component of GURU is fully implemented, and some results are given in the paper...|$|R
