In the intrusion detection field, laser scanning holds many advantages over conventional passive infrared sensors and active post-to-post laser sensors.

40|$|Invasive {{cervical}} cancer is {{second most common}} female cancer worldwide with about 493 000 new cases per year. About 273 000 women die from {{cervical cancer}} each year, 85 % of which take place in developing countries. Cervical cancer has a slow progress, from pre-invasive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to invasive phases, meaning that the disease can be diagnosed while in the phase of pre-invasive lesion, and treated successfully thanks to the regular screening of asymptomatic women (the Pap smear). The authors review new possibilities of early detection of cervical cancer with emphasis on colposcopy. The role of colposcopy is discussed among possibilities of early diagnosis. The authors discuss additional diagnostic procedures for preinvasive lesions of the uterine cervix like DNA cytometry, (flow cytometry). This method can point to dysplasia which can progress to severe stages, such as HSIL (High grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion). If the level of chromosomal disturbance is higher (aneuploidy), it is more probable that HSIL will develop. <b>Laser</b> <b>screening</b> of cells extracted with modern cytologic screening LBC (Liquid Base Cytology) enables us to automatically measure ploidy (chromosome regularity, or irregularity) and PCR provides analysis of HPV types.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a system to accurately determine {{the speed of a}} projectile (bullet) by measuring the time of flight between two parallel <b>laser</b> <b>screens</b> is described. Each screen is formed by a laser source and a set of prisms. At the detection end of each of the screens, a collector lens focuses the incident laser light beam onto a photodetector. The collector lens and detector are kept in a recess so that no stray or ambient light falls on the photodetector. Whenever a projectile crosses either of the screens, the corresponding photodetector senses the event, due to partial or full obscuration of the incident energy. An electronic circuit is used to accurately record the time when the projectile crosses each screen, and the time interval gives the time of flight. The distance between the screens being known, the velocity is displayed on a computer screen. Because a single collimated beam of light generates the entire optical curtain, the reduction in incident energy at the photodetector plane is independent of the entry point of the projectile into the screen. Due to the baffling of the photodetector from ambient light, the optical screens can be used at indoor or outdoor ranges equally effectively...|$|R
