40|$|The retina can {{function}} under {{a variety of}} adaptation conditions and stimulus paradigms. To adapt to these various conditions, modifications in the phototransduction cascade and at the synaptic and network levels occur. In this paper, we focus on the properties and function of a gain control mechanism in the cone synapse. We show that horizontal cells, in addition to inhibiting cones via a "lateral inhibitory pathway," also modulate the synaptic gain of the photoreceptor via a "lateral gain control mechanism. " The combination of lateral inhibition and <b>lateral</b> <b>gain</b> control generates a highly efficient transformation. Horizontal cells estimate the mean activity of cones. This mean activity is subtracted from the actual activity of the center cone and amplified by the <b>lateral</b> <b>gain</b> modulation system, ensuring that the deviation of the activity of a cone from the mean activity of the surrounding cones is transmitted to the inner retina with high fidelity. Sustained surround illumination leads to an enhancement of the responses of transient ON/OFF ganglion cells to a flickering center spot. Blocking feedback from horizontal cells not only blocks the <b>lateral</b> <b>gain</b> control mechanism in the outer retina, but it also blocks the surround enhancement in transient ON/OFF ganglion cells. This suggests that the effects of the outer retinal <b>lateral</b> <b>gain</b> control mechanism are visible in the responses of ganglion cells. Functionally speaking, this result illustrates that horizontal cells are not purely inhibitory neurons but have a role in response enhancement as wel...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experiment conducted {{to investigate the}} effects of roll-lateral motion cueing algorithm settings on motion fidelity for helicopter roll-lateral repositioning tasks. A total of 13 motion conditions, comprising two roll gain settings, two degrees of roll-lateral coordination and three roll washout intensities, were tested by four pilots on the CyberMotion Simulator at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. An emphasis {{was put on the}} use of objective measurements for motion fidelity determination, in addition to collected subjective handling quality ratings (HQR) and motion fidelity ratings (MFS). Higher roll gains were found to have a beneficial effect on both the subjective and the objective metrics, which is in line with previous findings. Reducing the degree of coordination had a negative effect on subjective ratings, but did not show a consistent negative effect for the considered objective metrics. Stronger roll washout had a large and consistent negative effect on the subjective ratings. This is confirmed by the obtained objective measurements, which show high control activity and less realistic vehicle trajectories during the deceleration and stabilization phase of the maneuver for conditions with strong roll washout. We conclude that roll and <b>lateral</b> <b>gain</b> are more effective than roll washout to attenuate the simulated motion...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} parabolic bow-tie laser arrays (PBTLAs) which are a novel category of laser diodes specially designed to achieve high power with high brightness at 980 nm. Output powers in excess of 2. 8 W/facet have been measured from five-element PBTLAs with output beam less than twice the diffraction limit, achieving high brightness of 275 MWcm/sup - 2 /srad/sup - 1 / at 3 A (pulsed) injection current (= 22 times the threshold). Changes in the achievable brightness due {{to changes in the}} optical cavity geometry and in the lateral optical guiding strength are discussed in detail, using the coupled-mode theory to interpret the experimental results. At threshold all devices operate in the highest (double lobed) array mode. At higher currents the arrays of tapered lasers change to quasi-in-phase operation when the modal gain of the fundamental array mode dominates because of the combined effect of carrier hole burning and spatial filtering from the narrow stripe central section of the device. Similar trends have been observed under continuous-wave operation. The reduction of lateral optical guiding strength is deleterious for the operational characteristics of PBTLAs and linear bow-tie arrays, and it leads to filamentation in gain-guided devices even at low currents. Theoretical results presented in this paper show that scalability is in principle possible; however, changes in the <b>lateral</b> <b>gain</b> profile due to hole-burning can significantly increase the modal gain of higher order modes and, therefore, strongly influence the optical output profile...|$|E

This work includes a study of post-growth selective area doping techniques in InAs required for forming planar junctions, through to developing the first planar and lateral InAs APDs to realise high gain. Be ion implantation and annealing are developed for selective area P-type doping InAs. An implantation and annealing procedure was optimised to maximise Be activation and recovery, whilst minimising Be diffusion. A planar fabrication procedure was developed and InAs planar photodiodes were characterised with high uniformity and low surface leakage achieving a detectivity of 6. 08 × 108 cmHz^- 1 / 2 W^- 1 at room temperature. InAs APDs were fabricated using a planar fabrication process. The activation energy of the bulk and surface leakage components of the dark current were analysed to determine the dominant leakage mechanisms. Utilising an optimised structure to minimise tunnelling current, a record high gain in excess of 300 was achieved at - 26 V at 200 K. The maximum gain was limited by breakdown, and the breakdown mechanism {{was found to be}} due to an unusual thermal runaway effect within an electric field hotspot at the planar junction edge. To mitigate the formation of electric field hotspots, planar APDs with guard rings were designed and characterised. Planar APDs with optimised guard ring placements were characterised with lower dark current near breakdown, and an increased breakdown voltage at 200 K compared to unguarded APDs. The gain limitations of InAs APDs utilising a conventional structure are discussed. To overcome such limitations a novel lateral APD structure was proposed. A range of lateral APD structures were simulated to evaluate the evolution of a lateral electric field that may lead to enhanced <b>lateral</b> <b>gain.</b> N-type selective area doping using Si implantation and annealing were developed, and a range of lateral APD structures were fabricated utilising Be and Si implantation and annealing.

At this large scale, catchments may have complex hydrological response because of strong surface/groundwater interactions, calling to the development of new methods to investigate stream water gains and losses from and to karst units. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} understand better the hydrogeology of large karstic catchment using a routing hydrological model that quantifies lateral flows across stream network. The model used is the diffusive wave flood routing model able to simulate the dynamic of uniformly distributed lateral flows on river reach between two gauging stations. The application was conducted on the karstic catchment of the upper Loue River (1900 km²) in the French Jura Mountains during highest flood events for 30 years on hourly data. Simulations on four reaches show globally a high spatial variability of <b>lateral</b> <b>gains</b> and losses according to hydro-meteorological conditions. First, a model application on a losing reach allows quantifying the discharge losses which were interpreted as the localised recharge of a binary karst aquifer. Second, an application on gaining reaches shows that the spatial variability of karst contributions to the stream reflects the main groundwater drainage axes identified by spring’s location and artificial tracer tests. Finally, the karst contribution decreases downstream where surface runoff is favoured locally on marly areas. Our results suggest that a distributed representation of surface/groundwater interactions can improve the understanding of how the stream signal is controlled by karst units at large scale.

The linear analysis and simulations are carried out with a constant longitudinal velocity of 80 Kph for the passive vehicle, i. e. no steering on the dolly or semitrailer.

This paper addresses these differences by comparing two different LPNP devices from the same process: one with a heavily-doped emitter and one with a lightly-doped emitter.

The three simulation tools selected for the study, namely Mechanical Simulation CarSim 8. 2. 1,IPG CarMaker 4. 0. 5, and VI-Grade CarRealTime V 14, are briefly described and discussed. In order toevaluate and compare these tools with respect to application for vehicle dynamics control, a criterialist is developed covering aspects such as tool requirements and intended usage. Based on thecriteria list and certain identified drawbacks, a ranking of the tools is made possible. Furthermore,the process of developing vehicle models for the different tools is discussed in detail, along with theprocedure of validating the vehicle models. In the second part, the concept of Collision Avoidance Driver Assistance (CADA) function isintroduced and possible approaches for developing CADA functions are discussed in brief. It isimportant to note that the CADA functions in this work are based on cornering the vehicle i. e. maneuvering around the threat, rather than solely reducing vehicle speed. A number ofimplementations of the functions are developed in Simulink. A frequency analysis of a simplifiedlinear vehicle model is performed to investigate the influence of steering, differential braking, andtheir combination on the resultant lateral displacement of the vehicle during an evasive maneuver. The developed CADA functions are then simulated using the vehicle simulation tools. Two specificmetrics - <b>Lateral</b> Displacement <b>gain</b> and DeltaX - are formulated to evaluate the effectiveness of theCADA functions. Based on these metrics, the assistance obtained due to the functions for a specificevasive maneuver is compared.

The evaluation of the CADA functions demonstrates thatcombined assistive steering with differential braking provides considerable assistance in order toavoid collisions. The simulation results also present interesting trends which provide a usefuldirection regarding the conditions for intervention by such collision avoidance functions during anevasive maneuver.

40|$|The {{honeybee}} Apis mellifera has {{a remarkable}} {{ability to detect}} and locate food sources during foraging, and to associate odor cues with food rewards. In the honeybee’s olfactory system, sensory input is first processed in the antennal lobe (AL) network. Uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs) convey the sensory code from the AL to higher brain regions via two parallel but anatomically distinct pathways, the lateral and the medial antenno-cerebral tract (l- and m-ACT). Neurons innervating either tract show characteristic differences in odor selectivity, concentration dependence, and representation of mixtures. It is still unknown how this differential stimulus representation is achieved within the AL network. In this contribution, we use a computational network model {{to demonstrate that the}} experimentally observed features of odor coding in PNs can be reproduced by varying <b>lateral</b> inhibition and <b>gain</b> control in an otherwise unchanged AL network. We show that odor coding in the l-ACT supports detection and accurate identification of weak odor traces at the expense of concentration sensitivity, while odor coding in the m-ACT provides the basis for the computation and following of concentration gradients but provides weaker discrimination power. Both coding strategies are mutually exclusive, which creates a tradeoff between detection accuracy and sensitivity. The development of two parallel systems may thus reflect an evolutionary solution to this problem that enables honeybees to achieve both tasks during bee foraging in their natural environment, and which could inspire the development of artificial chemosensory devices for odor-guided navigation in robots...|$|R

The central concept is the probing of a loaded structural specimen by a controlled <b>lateral</b> displacement to <b>gain</b> quantitative insight into its buckling behaviour and {{to measure the}} energy barrier against buckling. This can provide design information about a structure's stiffness and robustness against buckling in terms of energy and force landscapes. Developments {{in this area are}} relatively new but have proceeded rapidly with encouraging progress. Recent experimental tests on uniformly compressed spherical shells, and axially loaded cylinders, show excellent agreement with theoretical solutions. The probing technique could be a valuable experimental procedure for testing prototype structures, but before it can be used a range of potential problems must be examined and solved. The probing response is highly nonlinear and a variety of complications can occur. Here, we make a careful assessment of unexpected limit points and bifurcations, that could accompany probing, causing complications and possibly even collapse of a test specimen. First, a limit point in the probe displacement (associated with a cusp instability and fold) can result in dynamic buckling as probing progresses, as demonstrated in the buckling of a spherical shell under volume control. Second, various types of bifurcations which can occur on the probing path which result in the probing response becoming unstable are also discussed. To overcome these problems, we outline the extra controls over the entire structure that may be needed to stabilize the response.

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings display a number of root developmental responses to alkamides, including primary root growth inhibition and greater formation of <b>lateral</b> roots. To <b>gain</b> insight into the regulatory mechanisms by which these compounds alter plant development, we performed a mutant screen for identifying Arabidopsis mutants that fail to inhibit primary root growth when grown under {{a high concentration of}} N-isobutyl decanamide. A recessive N-isobutyl decanamide-resistant mutant (decanamide resistant root [drr 1]) was isolated because of its continued primary root growth and reduced lateral root formation in response to this alkamide. Detailed characterization of lateral root primordia development in the wild type and drr 1 mutants revealed that DRR 1 is required at an early stage of pericycle cell activation to form lateral root primordia in response to both N-isobutyl decanamide and N-decanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, a highly active bacterial quorum-sensing signal. Exogenously supplied auxin similarly inhibited primary root growth and promoted lateral root formation in wild-type and drr 1 seedlings, suggesting that alkamides and auxin act by different mechanisms to alter root system architecture. When grown both in vitro and in soil, drr 1 mutants showed dramatically increased longevity and reduced hormone- and age-dependent senescence, which were related to reduced lateral root formation when exposed to stimulatory concentrations of jasmonic acid. Taken together, our results provide genetic evidence indicating that alkamides and N-acyl-l-homoserine lactones can be perceived by plants to modulate root architecture and senescence-related processes possibly by interacting with jasmonic acid signaling...|$|R
40|$|The most {{promising}} technology for radiography is active matrix flat panel imaging systems (AMFPI). However, AMFPI systems are relatively expensive {{in comparison with}} conventional computed radiography (CR) systems.

The focus {{of this research is}} the fabrication and characterization of a low cost amorphous silicon metal-semiconductor-metal photodetector as a photosensitive element in a AMFPI systems. Metal-Semiconductor-Metal photodetectors (MSM-PD) are attractive as sensors due to their ease of fabrication and compatibility with thin film transistor fabrication process primarily because there is no p+ doped layer in comparison with conventional p-i-n photodiodes. We have reported low dark current lateral a-Si MSM-PD (lower than 20 pA/mm 2) with responsivity of 280 mA/W and EQE of 65 percent to green light (l = 525 nm). These improvement are achieved by introduction of a PI blocking layer and operating the device at high electric field (15 V/µm). This new structure eliminates the need of p+ and n+ layers which makes this structure fully compatible with the a-Si:H TFT fabrication process and consequently a low cost flat panel imager. Further, in this study we have investigated the effect of the spacing and width of the comb structure in the proposed lateral a-Si MSM-PD to determine the best configuration. Moreover, a-Si MSM-PD with PI blocking layer shows a linear behaviour to the photon flux in the wide range of 200 nW/cm 2 - 300 µW/cm 2 intensity of the incoming light. In comparison to vertical p-i-n structures, the reported MSM <b>lateral</b> device shows <b>gains</b> in terms of dynamic range, ease of fabrication (no p+ layer) without any deterioration in EQE and responsivity.

40|$|Ink {{spreading}} {{and lateral}} light scattering in the substrate affect {{the color of}} a halftone print. One of the most important phenomena which affects the print result is dot gain, meaning that printed dots appear larger than the dots in the digital bitmap. This is partly due to the ink spreading and ink penetration into the substrate, resulting in an enhancement of the physical dot size, referred to as the physical dot <b>gain.</b> <b>Lateral</b> propagation of light in paper causes printed dots to appear larger than their physical size, which is called optical dot gain. Characterization of total dot gain, i. e. the combination of physical and optical dot gain, is an important issue in the study of paper properties and print characteristics. Many models based on macroscopic measurements are reported in the  literature to separately characterize both physical and optical dot gains. The aim {{of this study is to}} go beyond the macroscopic models, and to study the halftone prints on a microscopic scale, by using microscale images captured by a high-resolution camera. In this dissertation, three approaches based on the Murray-Davies model are proposed to obtain the total dot gain. In the first approach, by minimizing the root-mean-square difference between the calculated spectrum and the reflected spectrum measured by the  spectrophotometer, the total dot gain is approximated. The other two approaches are based on microscale images captured by a highresolution camera. These two approaches differ in their schemes on how to obtain the gray tone of the full tone ink. By the use of microscale images, it is also possible to illustrate the shape of the effective dot area for the investigated paper substrate. A novel approach based on the histogram of microscale images is also proposed to separate physical from optical dot gain. Attaining the physical dot gain characteristic makes it possible to determine the actual physical dot shape, by which the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the paper substrate is estimated. The proposed approach is validated by comparing the estimated MTF of eleven offset printed coated papers to the MTF obtained from the unprinted papers using measured and Monte-Carlo simulated edge response. Another potential usage based on the separation of physical from optical dot gain, is to study the characterization of different color inks. In this dissertation, the dependency of dot gain and wavelength in color print is investigated. It has been illustrated that the light scattering effect, which is the reason for optical dot gain creation, must be less sensitive to different wavelength bands. It has also been shown that it is possible to separate two printed color inks by illuminating the halftone print with having light in the reflective wavelength band of one of the two colors. Comparison of the optical dot gain for different dot shapes and perimeters, but with the same area, shows the dependency of optical dot gain on the dot shape perimeter. The dependency of optical dot gain on the dot shape perimeter verifies the fact that the amount of optical dot gain is different for different types of halftoning...|$|R
40|$|Autumn QuarterThe {{majority}} of the Autumn Quarter was spent developing a suitable program. This was impeded {{by the lack of}} specific verbage both from Dr. Michael and the Office of Extended Services, and the lack of data on the subject of Continuing Education for research purposes. The client had only an approximate idea of what he wanted, and could be specific in only the number of residential units and administrative offices. The site analysis was again hindered by lack of information. The size of the site was much larger than was needed, making it difficult to do detailed research. The schematics done during this period established the basic relationships, both horizontal and vertical, between general spatial categories. Winter QuarterAfter investigating various organizations it was decided that a lineal design was most appropriate. A strong central circulation spine would enable many differing spatial types and functions to be related to one another. In addition, mechanical systems and services would have their horizontal movement concentrated in this core. The initial scheme at mid-quarter was essentially linear with a series of activity nodes along the central spine. The spine was bent for the following reasons: 1. to provide closer physical relationships between the terminal areas of the spine; 2. to provide segregation of various spatial groups in terms of noise; and 3. to provide a semi-enclosed outdoor area. After re-examining the initial scheme, other lineal schemes were investigated. The lower twenty-acre portion of the site was decided the best location and more defined circulation and site zoning concepts were developed. The residential sector of the program, primarily because of privacy, was imposed over the other activity areas, and various schemes evolved. The final scheme incorporated a central spine terminated by entrances and registration areas for out of town and community and university participants. Administrative spaces, laboratories and studios, were organized {{on the north side of}} the spine; and the dining, recreation, and remaining conference and learning areas, on the south. Residential spaces were arranged on a single-loaded corridor. The corridor related to the spine and the rooms received southern sunlight. The auditorium and resource center are centrally located as is the service entrance. Spring QuarterThe largest part of the spring was expended in developing the mechanical, electrical and structural systems for the building. The heating system is a high velocity air system with air handling units distributed in the two central and two terminal equipment areas. Fifty-five degree air is supplied at 3000 feet per minute to attenuation/reheat/distribution boxes that are each controlled by separate thermostats. Air is returned at 1500 FPM. The residential floors are air-conditioned by fan-coil units in the individual spaces. The boilers, shillers, domestic hot water and incinerator are located in the central mechanical equipment spaces and two cooling towers are on the auditorium roof. The storm sewer runs along the central core west to the end of the building and south to Bethel Pike. The sanitary sewer comes in at the service entrance from McGalliard joining the building drain which runs along the central core. Electrical service is from the east end of the building and transformer vault, emergency generators and main switchboards are located at the east end of the basement. Panelboards are located in conjunction with the elevator towers and mechanical chases. The structural system consists of reinforced concrete bearing walls and precast concrete deck. The only exception to this is in the auditorium where the roof is framed with long span structural steel bar joists. The bearing walls <b>gain</b> <b>lateral</b> stability at the terminations of the linear core where they are turned out and in the stair and elevator towers where they are turned in and out again at the interior of the central core.
