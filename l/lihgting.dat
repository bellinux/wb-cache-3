The new rules were determined since 1 st July introducing all-day lightening during a day in a full vision over all year. Updating of rules of traffic was especially ganerated by necessity of heighten the safety in traffic on roads. Automotive electronics is concerned with a lighting of vehicles and improving of lighting in unfavourable situations (mist, rain, night). Modernizing is lighting of additional lights like for example adaptive headlights, night vision systems. <b>Lihgting</b> is the most basic component of active safety which contribute to increment of safeness of traffic...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a continious variable teleportation scheme that allows to teleport the quantum state of distributed in space-time multimode electromagnetic field. Our teleportation protocol uses the spatially-multimode entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen <b>lihgt</b> beams. We evaluate the "resolving power" of teleportation in space-time and specify the {{degrees of freedom}} of electromagnetic field whose quantum state can be effectively teleported. We call this scheme "quantum holographic teleportation" {{because it can be}} considered as an extension of conventional holography to quantum domain.

40|$|Razprava želi predstaviti roman Puškinov Dom avtorja Andreja Bitova in ga osvetliti predvsem z vidika postmodernizma. Zanimale me bodo možnosti in problematika te literarne smeri znotraj ruske literarne tradicije, za katero sicer veljajo določene posebnosti, ki ruski postmodernizem razločujejo od zahodnoevropskih in ameriških variant, s katerimi ga bom soočil in poskusil ugotoviti bistvene razlike oziroma odstope. To bo pripomoglo k natančnejši opredelitvi nastanka, formalnih in vsebinskih značilnosti obravnavanega romana - Puškinovega doma. The paper {{attempts}} to present Andrej Bitov 2 ̆ 7 s novel Pushkin House and shed <b>lihgt</b> on {{it from the}} standpoint of post-modernism. The author is concerned with the options and issues of this literary direction within the Russian literary tradition, which is known for certain peculiarities. These pecularities differentiate Russian post-modernism from its West-European and American variations, which Russian post-modernism will be compared to the in order to establish the main differences or deviations. This will contribute to a more precise definition of the origin, formal and content features of the novel Pushkin House...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pathogen {{reduction}} system {{is expected to}} effectively reduce pathogen load of blood components while simultaneously maintaining the quality of cells and proteins. Pathogen reduction in human plasma treated {{with a combination of}} riboflavin (vitamin B 2) and UV light is based on irreversible, oxydative damage of nucleic acids. In this way it prevents further replication of viruses, bacteria and parasites eventually present in the plasma. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of photo-inactivation process on the coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) present in plasma. Methods: We have tested 30 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), obtained by processing single donor whole blood. We have pooled two units of fresh plasma, identical ABO blood groups, and by dividing them got 15 pairs of fresh frozen plasma (30 units). One pair included a test unit, which will be photo-inactivated (FP) and a control unit (KP). We added 35 ml of riboflavin (500 µM) in the treated unit (FP) and illuminated it with UV <b>lihgt</b> (6. 24 J/ml) on the Mirasol Illuminator (Caridian BCT Biotechnologies; USA). In order to obtain equal dilution, we added 35 ml of saline into the control unit. After illumination, we took samples (1. 5 ml aliquots) from FP and KP and froze them at - 80 °C. Control and treated plasma bags were frozen simultaneously at - 30 °C. After one month, samples were thawed and concentration of F VIII in FP and KP units were compared. Results: Median value FVIII in the treated plasma was 0. 84 IE/ml (0. 59 – 0. 92 IE/ml). Median percent recovery was 68 % (59 – 78 %). Average inactivation time was 3 minutes and 9 seconds ± 22 seconds. Conclusion: The study results showed that the pathogen reduction process using Mirasol technology affects the concentration of F VIII in plasma. FVIII concentration in the treated units is consistent with the recommendations and is comparable to the concentration of FVIII after treatment with other inactivation methods...|$|R
