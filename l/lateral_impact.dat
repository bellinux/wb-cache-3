The model segments were tested in three directions of loading showing main and coupled motions to be accurate and realistic. The model’s ability to predict the dynamic response of the head and neck, when subjected to acceleration pulses representing frontal, <b>lateral,</b> and rear-end <b>impacts,</b> is verified using experimental data derived from sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for 15 g frontal and 7 g <b>lateral</b> <b>impacts</b> and from isolated cervical spine specimen tests for rear-end impacts.

Firstly, the impacts are simulated with both passive and active muscle behaviour. Secondly, the local loads in the soft-tissue elements during the frontal impact are analysed. For rear-end impact simulation experiments using ligamentous isolated cervical spine specimens are used to evaluate the model performance before investigating the effects of muscle tensioning. Good agreement with human volunteer response corridors resulting from frontal and <b>lateral</b> <b>impacts,</b> and isolated cervical spine specimen sled test rear-end impact experiments is demonstrated for the model, highlighting the important role the muscles of the neck play in the head–neck response to acceleration impacts.

The simulation {{of these tests}} with a finite element method allows {{a better understanding of}} the shoulder response. Nevertheless, to simulate shoulder impacts, shoulder bone models have to be validated first. Thus, the aims of this study were firstly, to perform experimental dynamic tests on humerus, and then, to reproduce these tests by simulation in order to assess humerus models. Twelve humerus bones from six subjects (four males, two females, average age = 76) were submitted to flexion tests until failure. Drop tests were carried out with a 6 kg-mass at velocities from 1 to 2 m/s. Impact forces were recorded, and displacements were calculated through video analysis. Then, simulations were performed to compare humerus model responses under loading and experimental force–deflection data. Thus, this work provides experimental results that are used for the assessment of humerus models. The validated humerus bones could be integrated into global shoulder models for further applications such as simulation of car <b>lateral</b> <b>impacts...</b>|$|R

To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the severity of impact to the head and the severity and distribution of injury to the brain in fatally injured pedestrians, events in vehicle-pedestrian collisions were reconstructed to determine the peak linear and angular acceleration sustained by the pedestrians' heads. The nature and distribution of injuries to the brain were determined by neuropathologic examination of coronal sections of the brain. Study of 13 cases with occipital impacts and 18 with <b>lateral</b> <b>impacts</b> showed that the brain appeared to be more susceptible to injury from <b>lateral</b> <b>impacts.</b> The frontal and temporal regions appeared to be more susceptible to injury at low accelerations in occipital impacts, providing an explanation for "coup" and "contrecoup" injuries. For occipital impacts, a positive relationship was found between linear acceleration and the extent of injury to the brain, suggesting that there was a threshold for observable and concussive brain injury at about 1500 m/s 2 peak linear acceleration.

The ratio of length to diameter of these spacecraft is roughly equal to 5. 0.

Since the drag coefficient is essentially the drag force divided by the frontal area in flight, <b>lateral</b> <b>impacts,</b> when taken into account make the GRM drag coefficient significantly larger than the coefficients used before for shorter spacecraft. A simple formula is derived for the drag coefficient of a cylindrical body flying with its long axis along the direction of flight, and it is used to estimate the drag for the GRM.

Since they could be vulnerable to impact from passing vessels or vehicles, it is necessary to understand their behaviour under <b>lateral</b> <b>impact</b> loads.

Based on the test data, the failure mode, peak impact force, impact duration, peak reaction forces, reaction force duration, column maximum and residual global deflections and column local buckling length, depth and width under varying conditions are analysed and discussed. It is evident that the innovative HITS can successfully test structural columns under the combination of axial pre-loading and impact loading.

To mitigate the risk of these injuries, modified softballs have been developed with greater compliance than their standard counterparts. The purpose of this work {{was to investigate the}} difference between standard softball models approved for use in slowpitch play and two modified softball models in ball-to-head collisions. A finite element model of ball-to-head impacts was developed from a leading softball model and the Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS) developed by Toyota. Simulated softball models included a standard slowpitch softball, a cork-core softball and Reduced Injury Factor (RIF) softball. Both frontal and <b>lateral</b> <b>impacts</b> were simulated for initial ball velocities ranging from 26. 8 m/s to 53. 6 m/s.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study brain biomechanics between contact and non-contact head impact during vehicle crash tests in head kinematics, global brain injury metrics, and region brain strain. Nine array accelerometer package data from dummy head were extracted from 13 lateral and 14 rigid pole crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Head accelerations, HIC values and their duration were computed. Cumulative strain damage measure 15 % (CSDM), dilatational damage measure (DDM), and relative motion damage measure (RMDM) were studied using SIMon finite element head model (FEHM). Averaged regional brain strains were conducted by grouping brain element in SIMon FEHM into frontal, parietal, occipital, cerebellum, fronix and brain stem region. Head contact occurred in two lateral and six rigid pole tests. Head contact durations were less than one millisecond in rigid pole tests and ranged from 3 - 7 ms in <b>lateral</b> <b>impact</b> tests. The ratio of biomechanical measurements between contact and non-contact cases in lateral tests were: translational acceleration 4 x, rotational acceleration 3. 5 x, HIC 12 x, and CSDM 5 x, regional brain 1. 5 x. The ratios were higher for rigid pole tests: translational acceleration 14 x, rotational acceleration 25. 7 x, HIC 29. 5 x, CSDM 12 x, regional brain strain 1. 5 - 3 x.
