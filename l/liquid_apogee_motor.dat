50|$|In {{some parts}} of the space {{industry}} an LAE is also referred to as a <b>liquid</b> <b>apogee</b> <b>motor</b> (LAM), a liquid apogee thruster (LAT) and, depending on the propellant, a dual-mode liquid apogee thruster (DMLAT). Despite the ambiguity with respect to the use of engine and motor in these names, all use liquid propellant. An apogee kick motor (AKM) or apogee boost motor (ABM) such as the Waxwing, however, uses solid propellant. These solid-propellant versions are not used on new-generation satellites.|$|E

5000|$|The Yuanzheng-1 (YZ-1) (...) is a restartable rocket {{upper stage}} {{developed}} by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) used as a fourth stage to enable the Long March 3B and Long March 3C launch vehicles to deploy payloads directly to high energy orbits like medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary orbit (GSO). Since the Long March third stage cannot restart, it cannot circularize a GSO orbit from a geostationary transfer orbit. The YZ-1 was designed for restart capability, and to remain operational for more than 6 hours required to reach the transfer orbit apogee for the circularization burn. The YZ-1 enabled the deployment of satellite pairs for the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and communications satellites directly to their orbits.

40|$|The GOES {{mission profile}} used to achieve {{geostationary}} orbit following {{separation from the}} Delta launch vehicle is described. The mission profile was constrained by the solid-propellant <b>apogee</b> kick <b>motor</b> which was undersized relative to the spacecraft weight. The resulting deficiency in delivered delta-V {{had to be made}} up by the spacecraft hydrazine propulsion system. The mission profile which best utilizes the on-board hydrazine requires that the transfer orbit apogee height be biased 13, 800 km above geosynchronous altitude. This maximizes the effectiveness of the <b>apogee</b> <b>motor</b> in performing the plane change necessary to achieve near-equatorial orbit. The highly eccentric drift orbit which results from the <b>apogee</b> <b>motor</b> firing has an average drift rate of 60 deg/day. Circularizing this orbit requires maneuvers designed to achieve geostationary position within a tightly constrained hydrazine allocation. The sequence takes advantage of the orbit changes resulting from attitude maneuvers and combined inplane/out-of-plane maneuvers to achieve hydrazine savings...|$|R
