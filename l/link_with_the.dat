5|$|An Act of Parliament dated 10 June 1825 {{created the}} New Harbour Company, with powers {{to build the}} harbour at Tywyn Bach, on the sands near Pembrey. The Act {{included}} powers to build a short section of canal to <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> line of the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal. The new harbour was completed in 1832. The community of Burry Port {{did not exist in}} 1825, and it was not until 1835 that the name of the company was changed to the Burry Port Company by another Act of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|An {{international}} conference that the Government of Pondicherry and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs held in October 2004 decided {{to investigate the}} Arikamedu site jointly for conservation, as its ancient commercial <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Romans has been established. During this conference, the Government of Pondicherry also decided to propose the site for status as a World Heritage Site of UNESCO. The Archaeological Survey of India also proposed the site for UNESCO Cultural Heritage Site status, under the title Silk Road Sites in India.|$|E
5|$|Smetana had {{virtually}} no precursors in Czech opera apart from František Škroup, whose works had rarely lasted beyond one or two performances. In his mission {{to create a new}} canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses.|$|E
5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals {{found in the}} Wheel of the Year, a tradition that they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|E
50|$|Although the RSP was {{too small}} to have a real pillar of social {{organizations}} around it, it did have strong <b>links</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anarcho-syndicalist trade union National Labour Secretariat, which previously had strong <b>links</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> communist party.|$|R

50|$|The DART Underground is a {{proposed}} East-West railway tunnel under the city centre of Dublin. The tunnel {{as proposed by}} Iarnród Éireann would provide stations at Heuston (<b>linking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kildare Line), High Street, St Stephens Green (<b>linking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Green Luas line and the Airport Metro), Pearse (<b>linking</b> <b>with</b> a DART service from Greystones to Maynooth) and Spencer Dock (continuing on to Drogheda and <b>linking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Red line Luas). On 22 September 2015, {{it was announced that}} the project had been cancelled in favour of a simpler alternative.|$|R
5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E
5|$|The line {{ran from}} Yatton to Wells. When {{the rest of}} the line was closed and all {{passenger}} services ceased, the section of the line between Cheddar and Yatton remained open for goods traffic. It provided a fast <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main markets for the strawberries in Birmingham and London, but finally closed in 1964, becoming part of the Cheddar Valley Railway Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} small {{roads in}} the district, all of which <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> former State Highway, have gravel surfaces. These roads mainly link the main route with small coastal settlements, although gravel roads also extend along the valleys of the Owaka and Tahakopa Rivers, linking the main Catlins route with the small towns of Clinton and Wyndham respectively. The gravelled Waikawa Valley Road crosses the hills to join the Tahakopa-Wyndham route.|$|E

5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{invaded the}} newly {{declared}} State of Israel on May 15, 1948. Their strength was approximately one division, commanded by Major General Ahmed Ali al-Mwawi. Their advance was three-pronged: The main column moved north through what is today the Gaza Strip and attacked Kfar Darom, another column went east toward Beersheba, {{and a third}} attacked kibbutz Nirim. On May 17, a small force split off from Beersheba to link up with more Egyptian forces at Auja al-Hafir, on May 19 the main column attacked Yad Mordechai, and on May 20, the main force in Beersheba set out to <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Jordanian Arab Legion in Hebron.|$|E

5|$|Following Watkin's {{retirement}} {{relations between}} the GCR and the MR deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over the MR from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the hostile MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Great Western Railway and a route into London that bypassed the MR. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began {{construction of a new}} line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5km) north of Quainton Road. Although formally an independent company, the new line was operated {{as a part of the}} GCR. A substantial part of GCR traffic to and from London was diverted onto the Alternative Route, reducing the significance of Quainton Road as an interchange and damaging the profitability of the MR.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 the GUNT {{rebelled against}} Gaddafi, {{stripping}} Libya {{of its main}} cover of legitimacy for its military presence in Chad. Seeing an occasion to unify Chad behind him, Habré ordered his forces to pass the 16th parallel so as to <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> GUNT rebels (who were fighting the Libyans in Tibesti) in December. A few weeks later a bigger force struck at Fada, destroying the local Libyan garrison. In three months, combining the methods of guerilla and conventional warfare in a common strategy, Habré was able to retake almost all of northern Chad, and in the following months, inflicted new heavy defeats on the Libyans, until a ceasefire {{putting an end to}} the conflict was signed in September. The ceasefire left open the issue of the disputed Aouzou Strip, which was eventually assigned to Chad by the International Court of Justice in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 North Kesteven District Council {{produced}} a 25-year strategy to regenerate the town because its rapid growth since the 1990s had outgrown improvements to its infrastructure. It plans future residential developments and outlines ways {{of improving the}} town centre. It suggests developing more parking around the centre and reverting parts the one-way system, developing southern Southgate and turning Money's Yard into an attraction to <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> National Centre for Craft and Design. North Kesteven District Council granted planning permission for a £56m project to redevelop the derelict Bass Maltings site by converting it into residential and retail space and creating about 500 permanent jobs. The development including a supermarket was delayed when the town council opposed a link road through part of the recreation ground. Tesco, who had pledged {{to invest in a}} £20million store in the development withdrew in January 2015 following financial set-backs.|$|E

Sage Pulaha was <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kimpurushas, whereas <b>the</b> others were <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sage Pulastya. Another tribe viz the Valikhilyas (who follow the motion of <b>the</b> sun) where <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sage Kratu. Marichi, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu were mentioned as the six great sages, who probably originated the six great clans.

5|$|In 2379, {{two hundred}} years after the events of Alien 3, {{military}} scientists on the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The xenomorph queen's DNA has been mixed in with Ripley's, and the clone grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As {{a result of the}} xenomorphs' DNA inside her, she has enhanced strength and reflexes, blood that is somewhat acidic and a psychic <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> xenomorphs.

5|$|Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence {{coordinated the}} country's {{preparations}} for Phet, utilizing a national disaster plan that organized the various ministries, and providing early warnings. Storm warnings were broadcast in seven languages, {{a response to}} there being only English and Arabic warnings during Cyclone Gonu, which struck Oman in 2007. Residents were advised to remain away from the rough seas during the storm. Businesses and schools were shut down in the areas the storm affected, with schools operating as emergency shelters near Muscat. About 85% of the isolated Masirah Island was evacuated; the passage of Phet and subsequent storms affecting the Arabian Peninsula influenced the Omani government's decision to build a fixed <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> island 40km (25mi) offshore. Nationwide, 12,870people evacuated, utilizing 91 government-opened shelters. Omani officials shut down the country's {{oil and gas production}} facilities during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Basingstoke {{committee}} then investigated {{a link to}} the Andover Canal, but in December 1792, interest switched back to a <b>link</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Itchen. A {{meeting was}} held in Southampton, which was chaired by the mayor and included James D'Arcy on the committee. It became part of a much grander scheme to link Bristol to Salisbury, and onwards to London, but although most of this soon died away, the Itchen to Basingstoke link was still being considered in 1796, by which time it was called the London and Southampton Ports Junction Canal. Two routes were surveyed by different engineers, one costing £127,000 and the other £157,566.|$|E
