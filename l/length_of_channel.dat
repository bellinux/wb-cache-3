40|$|Geophysical basins of {{terrestrial}} surfaces have been quantitatively characterized through {{a host of}} indices such as topological quantities (e. g. channel bifurcation and length ratios), allometric scaling exponents (e. g. fractal dimensions), and other geomorphometric parameters (channel density, Hack's and Hurst exponents). Channel density, estimated by taking the ratio between the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> network (L) and the area of basin (A) in planar form, provides a quantitative index that has hitherto been related to various geomorphologically significant processes. This index, computed by taking the planar forms of channel network and its corresponding basin, {{is a kind of}} convexity measure in the two-dimensional case. Such a measure - estimated in general as a function of basin area and channel network length, where the important elevation values of the topological region within a basin and channel network are ignored - fails to capture the spatial variability between homotopic basins possessing different altitude-ranges. Two types of convexity measures that have potential to capture the terrain elevation variability are defined as the ratio of (i) <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> network function and area of basin function and (ii) areas of basin and its convex hull functions. These two convexity measures are estimated in three data sets that include (a) synthetic basin functions, (b) fractal basin functions, and (c) realistic digital elevation models (DEMs) of two regions of peninsular Malaysia. It is proven that the proposed convexity measures are altitude-dependent and that they could capture the spatial variability across the homotopic basins of different altitudes. It is also demonstrated on terrestrial DEMs that these convexity measures possess relationships with other quantitative indexes such as fractal dimensions and complexity measures (roughness indexes).

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the uplink transmission in Massive MIMO systems with OFDM over frequency selective channels. Channel state information (CSI) is essential for exploiting {{the potential benefits of}} such systems. So far, few researches have addressed the effect of pilot contamination (PC) on channel estimation. In this paper, analytical expressions on the mean square error (MSE) of two classical channel estimation algorithms in the presence of PC are presented. It is shown that minimum mean square error (MMSE) is more resistant to PC compared to least square (LS). Increasing the number of pilot subcarriers, for both algorithms, does not contribute to better suppression to PC. However, from the results given herein, a clue for mitigating PC can be obtained.
