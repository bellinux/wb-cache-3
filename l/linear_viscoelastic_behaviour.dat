The application of fractional calculus to viscoelasticity can be physically consistent and the resulting non integer order differential stress-strain constitutive relation provides good curve fitting properties, requires only a few parameters and leads to causal behaviour. When using such models the solution of direct problems, i. e. the evaluation of time or frequency response from a known excitation can still be obtained from the equations of motion using standard tools such as modal analysis. But regarding the inverse problem, i. e. the identification from measured input-output vibrations, no general technique has so far been established, since the current methods do not seem to easily work with differential operators of non integer order.

With reference to kinematic pile bending, insight into the physics of the problem is gained through a rigorous superposition scheme involving an infinitely-long pile excited kinematically, and a pile of finite length excited by a concentrated force and a moment at the tip.

40|$|Viscoelasticity, as {{the name}} implies, is a {{property}} that combines elasticity and viscosity or in other words such materials store energy as well as dissipates it to the thermal domain when subjected to dynamic loading and most interesting the storage and loss of energy depends upon the frequency of excitation. Modeling of viscoelastic materials is always difficult whereas modeling the elastic behavior is easy, modelling the energy dissipation mechanism possess difficulty. This work attempts to study the dynamics of a viscoelastic rotor-shaft system considering the effect of internal material damping in the rotor. The rotation of rotors introduces a rotary damping force due to internal material damping, which is well known to cause instability in rotor-shaft systems. Therefore, a reliable model is necessary to represent the rotor internal damping for correct prediction of stability limit of spin speed and unbalance response amplitude of a rotor-shaft system. An efficient modelling technique for viscoelastic material, augmenting thermodynamic field (ATF) {{has been found in}} literature. Here the material constitutive relationship has been represented by a differential time operator. Use of operators enables to consider general <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>behaviours,</b> represented in the time domain, for which, in general, instantaneous stress and its derivatives are proportional to instantaneous strain and also its derivatives. The operator may be suitably chosen according to the material model. The constitutive relationships for ATF approach is represented in differential time operator to obtain the equations of motion of a rotor-shaft system after discretizing the system using beam finite element method. The equations thus developed may easily be used to find the stability limit of spin speed of a rotor-shaft system as well as the time response as a result of unbalance when the rotor-shaft system is subjected to any kind of dynamic forcing function. In this work dynamic behavior of an aluminium rotor is predicted through viscoelastic modelling of the continuum {{to take into account the}} effect of internal material damping. To study the dynamics of an aluminium rotor-shaft system stability limit of spin speed, unbalance response amplitude and time response are used as three indices. It is observed that, the operator based approach is more suitable for finding the equation of motion of a viscoelastic rotor which is used to predicts the dynamic behaviour of that continuum. ...|$|R

Three different base bitumens (15 / 25, 35 / 50 and 70 / 100 pen grade) were used to produce nine bituminous mixtures with varying RAP content (0 %, 20 %, 40 % and 60 %). Moreover, a 100 % RAP mixture was produced (containing only RAP-extracted binder), {{for a total of}} ten mixtures. All mixtures have the same aggregates and grading curve. For each mixture, its corresponding binder blend was also produced, by perfectly mixing the base binder with RAP-extracted binder in the same proportions. Tension/Compression (T/C) complex modulus tests were performed on all mixtures, over a large range of frequencies (from 0. 001 Hz to 10 Hz) and temperatures (from - 25 °C to 40 °C). Experimental results were successfully fitted with the 2 S 2 P 1 D (2 Springs, 2 Parabolic elements, 1 Dashpot) analogical model, developed at ENTPE. Therefore, for each mixture, a set of 7 model parameters and 2 additional constants (to take into account Time-Temperature Superposition Principle) was obtained. All binders were subjected to penetration tests and SARA (Saturates, Aromatics, Resins and Asphaltenes) fractioning, in order to have an indication on their colloidal structure.

Twenty-eight subjects (7 females), aged 14 ± 28 yrs, were studied before orthopaedic surgery on the lower limbs. None were obese, or had clinical evidence of cardio-pulmonary disease.

It was found that the interrupter conductance increased linearly with lung volume over a larger range than used previously; and the viscoelastic resistance and time constant did not change over the entire range of tidal volumes and end-expiratory pressures studied.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a laboratory investigation aimed at evaluating the effects of filler on the rheological properties of bituminous mastics. More specifically, the mechanical behaviour of mixtures made with bitumen and inorganic aggregate is analyzed: selected fines from Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator (MSWI) ashes were used. The interaction between binder and aggregate determines a change in the rheological behaviour. Experimental data show a <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the usual operating temperatures range and in a dynamic stress configuration characterized by high strains. It can also be observed that the thermal susceptibility of the mastic markedly depends on the content of filler, which is responsible for the variations of stiffness and resilience, measured in terms of complex modulus and phase angle. In order to examine the rheological effect of inorganic filler, tests were performed with the objective of checking the mastic behaviour {{at the edge of the}} <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> region. Above the <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> threshold, the bituminous mastic is significantly sensitive to the presence of filler and a statistically robust protocol is required. The experimental data were obtained by means of a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and synthesized with a viscoelastic model. For the interpretation of the results, master curves of the main performance indices were calculated, being related to the filler content. As expected, the results confirm that artificial aggregate from MSW incinerators can be used in order to improve mastic properties...|$|R

But beyond that, the <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> parameters of Teak are frankly better than those of Ebony.|$|R
