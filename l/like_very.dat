25|$|The Wahweap Formation {{has been}} radiometrically dated as being between 81 and 76 million years old. During {{the time that}} Lythronax lived, the Western Interior Seaway was at its widest extent, almost {{completely}} isolating southern Laramidia {{off from the rest}} of North America. It has been suggested that the isolation of Laramidia may have helped tyrannosaurids develop advantageous features, <b>like</b> <b>very</b> powerful jaws. Laramidia may have been the original home of tyrannosaurid theropods. Lythronax was likely the largest predator of its ecosystem. The area where dinosaurs existed included lakes, floodplains, and east-flowing rivers. The Wahweap Formation is part of the Grand Staircase region, an immense sequence of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park and into the Grand Canyon. The presence of rapid sedimentation and other evidence suggests a wet, seasonal climate.|$|E
25|$|Molds are a {{large and}} taxonomically diverse number of fungal species in which the growth of hyphae results in {{discoloration}} and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism. The hyphae are generally transparent, so the mycelium appears <b>like</b> <b>very</b> fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. Cross-walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the hyphae, each containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. The dusty texture of many molds is caused by profuse production of asexual spores (conidia) formed by differentiation {{at the ends of}} hyphae. The mode of formation and shape of these spores is traditionally used to classify molds. Many of these spores are colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the human eye at this stage in its life-cycle.|$|E

500|$|Director Michael Lange {{felt the}} episode offered him {{excellent}} scope {{to try new}} techniques, noting that the series producers [...] "encourage cinematic stuff".

In summation of the record she stated: [...] "So half of it is a throwback and <b>like</b> <b>very</b> familiar feeling, feel-good, and then half of it is something that I've created that's sort of special and unique and refreshing and wonderful and I love it".|$|E

500|$|Poulenc, {{a highly}} {{accomplished}} pianist, usually composed {{at the piano}} and wrote many pieces for the instrument throughout his career. In Henri Hell's view, Poulenc's piano writing {{can be divided into}} the percussive and the gentler style reminiscent of the harpsichord. Hell considers that the finest of Poulenc's music for piano is in the accompaniments to the songs, a view shared by Poulenc himself. The vast majority of the piano works are, {{in the view of the}} writer Keith W Daniel, [...] "what might be called 'miniatures'". Looking back at his piano music in the 1950s, the composer viewed it critically: [...] "I tolerate the Mouvements perpétuels, my old Suite en ut , and the Trois pieces. I <b>like</b> <b>very</b> much my two collections of Improvisations, an Intermezzo in A flat, and certain Nocturnes. I condemn Napoli and the Soirées de Nazelles without reprieve." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen, born on Christmas Eve {{and named}} for the first martyr of Christianity, dreams as a child that [...] "in some queer way she [...] Jesus".

This childish desire for martyrdom prefigures Stephen's ultimate self-sacrifice for Mary's sake. After she tricks Mary into leaving her– carrying out a plan that leads Valérie to exclaim [...] "you were made for a martyr!"– Stephen, left alone in her home, sees the room thronged with inverts, living, dead and unborn. They call on her to intercede with God for them, and finally possess her. It is with their collective voice that she demands of God, [...] "Give us also the right to our existence".|$|E

In May 2014, Minaj spoke of the meaning behind the word [...] "yasss": [...] "When I watch RuPaul's Drag Race,' I live for the way they speak.
