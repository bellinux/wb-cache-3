40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design and growth of silicon-germanium p-i-n photodetectors for optical {{telecommunications}} applications. Two types of heterostructures are considered: strained silicon-germanium layers grown directly on silicon substrates, and strain-balanced silicon-germanium/silicon superlattice grown on relaxed buffer layers. The heterostructures are designed using existing band structure models and are grown using solid source molecular beam epitaxy (SS-MBE). To facilitate these growths, an atomic absorption spectroscopy- based flux monitor for the silicon source is developed and calibrated. In addition, {{the development of a}} substrate preparation procedure for relaxed buffer layers that is compatible with SS-MBE is developed and allows the growth of epitaxial films with low defect densities.

30|$|To {{overcome}} these problems, GaN-based thin-film LEDs with a bottom reflector fabricated by wafer bonding and laser lift-off (LLO) techniques {{have been proposed}} [1]. Significant improvements of light extraction and heat dissipation have been reported from the GaN-based thin-film LEDs [2]‐[6]. However, the fabrication procedures of such LEDs were complicated and would influence {{the performance of the}} devices, among which the increased <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> caused by the increase of screw dislocations {{is one of the most}} serious problems [6, 7]. There have been several reports showing that the <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> of thin-film LEDs were over three times greater than those of conventional LEDs [6]‐[8]. Although enormous efforts have been devoted to avoid electrical degradation in GaN-based thin-film LEDs, so far, the effective solution is still lacking. Previously, there has been intensive research into eliminating the negative influence of the LLO process [7]‐[9], but little work has been done to consider the effects of wafer bonding. Actually, this topic is of fundamental importance because the wafer bonding is a crucial process for thin-film LEDs which would have an important influence on electrical characteristics of the devices. To optimize the wafer bonding process may be an alternative way to solve the problem of electrical degradation in GaN-based thin-film LEDs. In this work, a double-transfer approach consisted of LLO and optimized wafer bonding processes was introduced to fabricate GaN-based thin-film LEDs. <b>Low</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents,</b> high light extraction, and superior thermal dissipation were demonstrated in the fabricated devices.|$|R
30|$|The Schottky diodes {{obtained}} by application of colloidal graphite on n-type InP and n-type GaN, marked InP-C, InP-Pd-C, and GaN-Pd-C are inexpensive but {{of very high}} quality, having <b>low</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> and high rectification ratios. Schottky barrier heights of 0.873 and 1.14 eV of InP-Pd-C and GaN-Pd-C diodes are much higher than those {{obtained by}} other methods, like thermal evaporation, which was, e.g., 0.55 eV {{in the case of}} Pd onto InP [9]. It shows on a very small or virtually negligible Fermi level pinning in these diodes so that any change in the Schottky barrier height should be equal to the change of the work function caused by an external charge appearing at the interface. Indeed, the measured values of Schottky barrier heights of 0.873 or 1.14 eV are close to differences between the electron work function of palladium metal 5.12 eV [10] and the electron affinity of InP, 4.38 eV [11] (0.74 eV) or of GaN, 4.1 eV [12] (1.02 eV). In principal, Fermi level pinning is caused by interface states in a semiconductor near the intimate contact with the metal. There are two basic ways creating interface states, physical breakings [9] and chemical reactions [13]. I believe that elimination of chemical reactions, due to forming Schottky barriers with colloidal graphite and surfactant wrapped Pd NPs, is the main reason for the absence of Fermi level pinning in the prepared diodes.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{development}} of the transistor in the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1948 [78], the semiconductor industry has transformed the world we live in. It is difficult to picture a world without the modern day cutting edge technology. Imagine performing every day functions without “trivial” devices such as computers, cell phones or microwave ovens. The ability to tailor the band gaps of various binary, ternary and quaternary semiconductor systems has opened up a whole new spectrum of potential purpose designed devices [27]. This thesis focuses on the electronic properties of gallium (III) antimonide (V). The antimonides, in general, have the smallest band gap and highest electron mobility of the III-V compound semiconductors and are well suited for long wavelength emission and detection as well as high frequency switching device applications. Furthermore, III-V ternaries and quaternaries, such as (AlGaIn) (AsSb), lattice matched to gallium antimonide (GaSb) are considered serious competitors for HgCdTe and PbSe in long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) and very long-wavelength infrared (VLWIR) technology [4, 10, 11]. Epitaxial material systems based on GaSb are suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications such as missile and surveillance systems and a host of other military and civil applications. In addition, an assortment of devices on InAs, GaSb, and AlSb, including resonant tunnelling devices, infrared detectors and mid-infrared semiconductor lasers have been demonstrated [14, 15]. Furthermore, antimonide based devices could potentially reduce optical fibre power loss by a few orders of magnitude, as their implementation can lead to use of non-silica based optical fibres that minimise Raleigh scatter related power loss [8]. GaSb related technology faces a number of challenges. A significant amount of effort is required to exploit the potential it offers. GaSb oxidises readily in the ambient, resulting in the formation of a native oxide layer as well as deposits of elemental antimony (Sb) at the oxide/substrate interface therefore it has poor surface electronic properties resulting from high surface state densities[4, 17, 18]. As grown GaSb is characterised by a high density of surface states of which many are classified as non-radiative (Auger) recombination centres. The elemental Sb layer constitutes an unwanted conduction path parallel to the active surface region [17]. The potential that GaSb and GaSb-based strained layer superlattices offer as successors to the current generation of LWIR and VLWIR optoelectronic materials has therefore been largely impeded [4]. Furthermore, processing steps in device fabrication leads to an unintentionally damaged GaSb surface exacerbating the situation. Any efforts to engineer devices of superior quality on GaSb have to address these and more material specific problems [19]. This study attempts to contribute towards an improved understanding of the structural and electrical properties of the near surface region of Te-doped bulk (100) and MOVPE grown epitaxial Te doped n- GaSb. The main focus of this study is to develop means to de-oxidise and stabilize the highly reactive GaSb surface and to develop diode structures to demonstrate the improved interface characteristics and use related current–voltage (I-V) measurements to quantify the surface state density before and after treatment. These devices were also used to probe the near surface region for electrically active deep level defects that often act as non-radiative recombination centers. Au, Pd and Al were used as metals to establish a metal semiconductor barrier and subsequent depletion region. Sulphur based chemicals, ([(NH 4) 2 S / (NH 4) 2 SO 4] + S), not previously reported for the treatment of (100) n-GaSb surfaces, and the commonly used passivants Na 2 S: 9 H 2 O and (NH 4) 2 S were compared by assessing the electrical and structural properties both before and after treatment. The effect of treatment on the electrical response of the material was determined using current-voltage, capacitance-voltage (C-V) and deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements, while the surface morphology and composition were studied by SEM, AES and XPS. XPS results show the presence of Ga 2 O 3, Sb 2 O 3 /Sb 2 O 5 and mainly adventitious carbon on the surface of as-received GaSb. Treatment of the material in any of the sulphur-based solutions employed in this study resulted in the partial removal of these native oxides from the surface. Ga 2 O 3 appears to be resistant to de-oxidation as it is only partially removed in all the treatments while Sb-O (both Sb 2 O 3 /Sb 2 O 5) are more effectively removed by treating the surface with ([(NH 4) 2 S/(NH 4) 2 SO 4] + S than with the more conventional treatments, Na 2 S: 9 H 2 O and (NH 4) 2 S. A strong, theory-based argument is supplied for this observation. XPS depth profile studies reveal that the native oxide layer present on the GaSb surface as well as the sulphide layer deposited during the sulphur treatment did not exceed 8. 5 nm. Treatment with ([(NH 4) 2 S/(NH 4) 2 SO 4] + S), Na 2 S: 9 H 2 O and (NH 4) 2 S not only partially removes the native oxides and form a sulphide species on the surface but ([(NH 4) 2 S/(NH 4) 2 SO 4] + S), and (NH 4) 2 S, both etch the substrate. ([(NH 4) 2 S/(NH 4) 2 SO 4] + S) in particular etches quite aggressively while Na 2 S: 9 H 2 O does not seem to have an etching effect. Comparison of Au, Pd and Al Schottky contacts on as-received bulk Te-doped bulk (100) n- GaSb shows that the <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> is high for all metallization schemes. The diodes are characterised by high ideality factors with Al Schotkky barrier diodes (SBDs), by comparison, being the least ideal. Annealing the Au Schottky contacts at moderate temperatures (200 °C for one minute) marginally improves the rectifying contact quality (viz. ideality factor and barrier height) while the Pd and Al SBDs remain unaltered. Annealing at higher temperatures causes deterioration of the SBD quality for Au and Pd SBDs while for Al SBDs generally improved up to 600 °C. Treatment of the GaSb surface by sulphur-based chemicals prior to contact fabrication generally improves the quality of SBDs on bulk GaSb. The improvement is most significant/effective following treatment with a ([(NH 4) 2 S/(NH 4) 2 SO 4] + S) solution as evidenced by an improved barrier height, a lower <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current,</b> a reduced series resistance and an ideality factor that approaches unity. The improvement can be attributed to a reduction of surface oxides which lower the surface state density as revealed from a calculation of these. Surface states act as recombination centres and are one of the reasons for high <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> and lower barrier heights. Passivation of the GaSb surface prior to Au contact deposition enhances the thermal stability of the SBD as shown by a comparatively delayed deterioration of I-V characteristics probably due to the formation of sulphur bonds on the surface acting as a diffusion barrier. Au, Pd and Al SBDs fabricated on epitaxial, MOVPE grown, Te:n-GaSb layers (= 2 − 5 × 1016 cm- 3) show significant improvement in rectification compared to that fabricated on bulk material with Au SBDs having the highest barrier height and <b>lowest</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current.</b> An important feature of these diodes (unlike reported for similar devices) is the saturated <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current.</b> All three metal semiconductor systems on epitaxial material are however still not ideal and they all have I-V characteristics suggesting the presence of interface states. The current transport of Au/n-GaSb (bulk) and Pd/ n-GaSb (epitaxial) SBDs were investigated by means of I-V-T measurements in the temperature range 80 - 330 K. The ideality factor increases with decreasing temperature while the barrier height, uncharacteristically (when compared to most semiconductors) increases with decreasing temperature in both structures. The series resistance increases with decreasing temperature. Furthermore, a linear relationship is found to exist between the barrier height and the ideality factor, confirming the inhomogeneity metal-semiconductor of the barrier height. A plot of the barrier height, ϕb vs kT/ 2 reveals a double Gaussian distribution for the barrier height with ϕb,mean assuming values of 0. 59 eV 0. 07 (80 - 140 K) and 0. 25 eV  0. 12 (140 - 320 K) respectively. The derived (from I-V measurements) interface state density is lower in the in epitaxial material compared to bulk material. We succeeded in fabricating excellent (of the best reported) Au and Pd SBDs on Te-doped epitaxial n-GaSb layer grown by MOVPE on bulk Te doped (100) B n+-GaSb. These films show reasonably uniform electrical response across the surface. Conventional DLTS and high resolution Laplace DLTS were used to study deep levels in these epitaxial layers. Three prominent electron traps, 0. 167 eV, 0. 243 eV, and 0. 295 eV below the conduction band were detected in this material. Ec- 0. 167 eV shows Poole-Frenkel emission enhancement and is consequently identified as a positively charged defect center...|$|R

Both experimental results and technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations suggest that Rr and Vb can be modulated by the offset length in an opposite tendency. The <b>low</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> (fA/MICRON) guarantees an ultra-low power consumption in standby mode, which is a core issue in wearable device applications. Besides the unprecedented electrical performance, the diodes exhibit good mechanical robustness with minimal degradation throughout the strain and fatigue tests. By incorporating these high-voltage diodes into half-wave and full-wave rectifier circuits, the high alternating current (AC) output voltage of TENGs is successfully rectified into direct current (DC) voltage and charged into supercapacitors (SCs), indicating their high integration and compatibility with TENGs, and thus their promising applications in various wearable electronic systems.

Good quality epitaxial growth of InAs and the lattice matched ternary AlAs 0. 16 Sb 0. 84 was developed using molecular beam epitaxy. A photodiode structure was designed, grown and characterized using an AlAs 0. 16 Sb 0. 84 layer to block the diffusion of minority electrons. Further reductions in the reverse leakage current were achieved through studies of wet etching using a range of etchants. A sulphuric acid based etchant provided the lowest surface leakage current for a single etch step, however the surface leakage current was further reduces when a two steps etching process was employed, starting with a phosphoric acid based etchant and finishing off with a sulphuric acid based etchant. Surface profile analysis showed that higher etching rates were obtained in the direction parallel to the (100) direction. The atomic composition of the etched surface was investigated using Auger analysis. By etching a test pixel array, the potential for fabricating small pitch focal plane arrays by wet etching was evaluated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDue to the {{significant}} achievements in SiC bulk material growth and in SiC device processing technology, this semiconductor {{has received a}} great interest for power devices, particularly for SiC high-voltage Schottky barrier rectifiers. The main difference to ultra fast Si pin diodes lies {{in the absence of}} reverse recovery charge in SiC SBDs. This paper reports on 4. 5 kV- 8 A SiC Schottky diodes / Si-IGBT modules. The Schottky termination design and the fabrication process gives a manufacturing yield of 40 % for large area devices on standard starting material. Modules have been successfully assembled, containing Si-IGBTs and 4. 5 kV-SiC Schottky diodes and characterized in both static and dynamic regimes. The forward dc characteristics of the modules show an on-resistance of 33 mohm. cm 2 @ room temperatue (RT) and a very <b>low</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> density (JR < 10 5 A/cm 2 @ 3. 5 kV). An experimental breakdown voltage higher than 4. 7 kV has been measured in the air on polyimide passivated devices. This value corresponds to a junction termination efficiency of at least 80 % according to the epitaxial properties. These SiC SBDs are well suited for high voltage, medium current, high frequency switching aerospace applications, matching perfectly as freewheeling diodes with Si IGBTs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Practical {{design of}} {{high-voltage}} SiC Schottky recti-fiers {{requires an understanding}} of the device physics that affect the key performance parameters. Forward characteristics of SiC Schottky rectifiers follow thermionic emission theory and are relatively well understood. However, the reverse characteristics are not well understood and have not been experimentally in-vestigated in-depth. In this paper we report the analysis and experimental results of both the forward and reverse char-acteristics of high-voltage SiC Schottky rectifiers. Ti and Ni Schottky rectifiers with boron implant edge termination were fabricated on n-type 4 H SiC samples. Ni Schottky rectifiers fabricated on a 13 -m thick 3 : 51015 cm 3 nitrogen doped epilayer have a current density of 100 A/cm 2 at approximately 2 V forward bias and a <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> density of less than 0. 1 A/cm 2 at a reverse bias of 1720 V. The <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> is observed to depend on device area, Schottky barrier height, electric field at the metal-semiconductor interface, and temperature (a decreasing temperature dependence with increasing reverse bias). In addition, the <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> magnitude is larger and the electric field dependence is stronger than predicted by thermionic emission and image-force barrier height lowering. This suggests the <b>reverse</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> is due to a combination of thermionic field emission and field emission.
