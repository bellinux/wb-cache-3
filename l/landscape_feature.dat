5|$|The {{landscape}} {{consists of}} {{the valley of the}} River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded by higher ground ranging from Dundry Down to the north, the Lulsgate Plateau to the west, the Mendip Hills to the south and the Hinton Blewett, Marksbury and Newton St Loe plateau areas to the east. The valley's boundary generally follows the top of scarp slopes except at the southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of the Chew Valley grade gently into the Yeo Valley and eastern Mendip Hills respectively. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create Chew Valley Lake, which provides drinking water for the nearby city of Bristol and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent <b>landscape</b> <b>feature</b> of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation interest, because of the bird species, plants and insects.|$|E

40|$|<b>Landscape</b> <b>features</b> {{have been}} shown to {{strongly}} influence dispersal and, consequently, the genetic population structure of organisms. Studies quantifying the effect of <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> on gene flow of large mammals with high dispersal capabilities are rare and have mainly been focused at large geographical scales. In this study, we assessed the influence of several natural and human-made <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> on red deer gene flow in the Scottish Highlands by analysing 695 individuals for 21 microsatellite markers. Despite the relatively small scale of the study area (115 × 87 km), significant population structure was found using F-statistics (F ST = 0. 019) and the program STRUCTURE, with major differentiation found between populations sampled {{on either side of the}} main geographical barrier (the Great Glen). To assess the effect of <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> on red deer population structure, the ArcMap GIS was used to create cost-distance matrices for moving between populations, using a range of cost values for each of the <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> under consideration. <b>Landscape</b> <b>features</b> wer...|$|R

500|$|There {{are various}} names for this {{topographic}} feature. The Metacomet Ridge {{is described by}} some sources as a traprock ridge beginning on the Holyoke Range in Belchertown, Massachusetts, and ending at the Hanging Hills in Meriden, Connecticut. A 2004 report conducted for the National Park Service extends that definition to include the entire traprock ridgeline from Greenfield, Massachusetts, to Long Island Sound. The Sierra Club has referred to the entire range in Connecticut as [...] "The Traprock Ridge". Geologically and visually, the traprock ridgeline exists as one continuous <b>landscape</b> <b>feature</b> from Belchertown, Massachusetts, to Branford, Connecticut at Long Island Sound, a distance of , {{broken only by the}} river gorges of the Farmington River in northern Connecticut and the Westfield and Connecticut Rivers in Massachusetts. [...] Until January 2008, the United States Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) did not recognize Metacomet Ridge, Traprock Ridge or any other name, although several sub-ranges were identified. Geologists usually refer to the overall range generically as [...] "the traprock ridge" [...] or [...] "the traprock mountains" [...] or refer to it with regard to its prehistoric geologic significance in technical terms. Further complicating the matter is the fact that traprock only accounts for the highest surface layers of rock strata on the southern three–fourths of the range; an underlying geology of related sedimentary rock is also a part {{of the structure of the}} ridge; in north central Massachusetts it becomes the dominant strata and extends the range geologically from the Holyoke Range another [...] through Greenfield to nearly the Vermont border. This article describes the entire Metacomet Ridge and all geologic extensions of it.|$|E

The overall conclusion is, that technically it seems well possible to record small <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> from existing datasets. The study was performed on a spatially limited area in The Netherlands. The {{results of this study}} show that several distinct <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> can be recorded and differentiated in an automatic way to minimize the overall manual procedures for their recording appropriately.

2500|$|The Metacomet Trail {{traverses}} {{the trap}} rock Metacomet Ridge which extends from Long Island Sound to the Massachusetts/ Vermont border. This ridge, rising {{hundreds of feet}} above the Connecticut River, Farmington River, and Quinnipiac River valleys, is a prominent <b>landscape</b> <b>feature</b> of central Connecticut. From south to north, the trail uses the ridges of the Hanging Hills, Short Mountain, Ragged Mountain, Bradley Mountain, Pinnacle Rock, Rattlesnake Mountain, Farmington Mountain, Talcott Mountain, Hatchet Hill, Peak Mountain, and West Suffield Mountain. Abrupt vertical cliffs with visible talus slopes and frequent viewpoints are common throughout. Views are generally to the west from West Suffield Mountain south through Ragged Mountain; with views in all directions at varying points in the Hanging Hills. The Farmington River cuts through the ridgeline between Hatchet Hill and Talcott Mountain in the Tariffville Gorge (east of Simsbury). Historic features along the trail include Old Newgate Prison museum and copper mine in East Granby; Heublein Tower on Talcott Mountain with [...] expansive view of four states; the Hill-Stead museum in Farmington, Connecticut, notable for its French impressionist painting collection and gardens; and Hubbard Park of the Hanging Hills of Meriden, designed {{with the help of}} famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and crowned with a small observation tower known as Castle Craig. The trap rock ridges and talus slopes of the Metacomet Ridge are also home to several unique microclimate ecosystems that support species of plants that are unusual or endangered in this part of New England, and are a seasonal migration path for raptors. Viewshed from the ledges include agrarian land, suburbs, small towns, river corridors, the eastern Berkshires ridgeline, and metropolitan Meriden and Hartford.|$|E
