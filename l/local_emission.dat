Generally, the predicted temporal variations and spatial distributions of PM 2. 5 (fine particulate matter), O 3 (ozone), and NO 2 are in good agreement with observations in BTH. The WRF-CHEM model also reproduces reasonably well the temporal variations of aerosol species compared to measurements in Beijing. The factor separation approach is employed to evaluate the contributions of trans-boundary transport of non-Beijing emissions to the PM 2. 5 and O 3 levels in Beijing. On average, in the afternoon during the simulation episode, the <b>local</b> <b>emissions</b> contribute 22. 4  % to the O 3 level in Beijing, less than 36. 6  % from non-Beijing emissions. The O 3 concentrations in Beijing are decreased by 5. 1  % in the afternoon due to interactions between <b>local</b> and non-Beijing <b>emissions.</b> The non-Beijing emissions play a dominant role in the PM 2. 5 level in Beijing, with a contribution of 61. 5  %, much higher than 13. 7  %, from Beijing <b>local</b> <b>emissions.</b> The <b>emission</b> interactions between <b>local</b> and non-Beijing <b>emissions</b> enhance the PM 2. 5 concentrations in Beijing, with a contribution of 5. 9  %. Therefore, the air quality in Beijing is generally determined by the trans-boundary transport of non-Beijing emissions during summertime, showing that the cooperation with neighboring provinces to mitigate pollutant emissions is key for Beijing to improve air quality...|$|R
