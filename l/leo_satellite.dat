2500|$|Radio {{occultation}} is {{a remote}} sensing technique where a GNSS signal tangentially scrapes the Earth, passing through the atmosphere, and is received by a Low Earth Orbit (<b>LEO)</b> <b>satellite.</b> As the signal passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted, curved and delayed. An <b>LEO</b> <b>satellite</b> samples the total electron content and bending angle of many such signal paths as it watches the GNSS satellite rise or set behind the Earth. Using an Inverse Abel's transform, a radial profile of refractivity at that tangent point on earth can be reconstructed.|$|E

2500|$|Since it {{requires}} less energy {{to place a}} satellite into a LEO and the <b>LEO</b> <b>satellite</b> needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission, LEO is used for many communication applications. Because these LEO orbits are not geostationary, a network (or [...] "constellation") of satellites is required to provide continuous coverage. (Many communication satellites require geostationary orbits, and move at the same angular velocity as the Earth. Some communications satellites including the Iridium phone system use LEO.) ...|$|E

40|$|Low Earth Orbit (<b>LEO)</b> {{communications}} <b>satellite</b> {{systems are}} emerging as attractive {{alternatives to the}} Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) systems. GEO satellites have largely dominated the commercial and government communications satellite systems for telecommunications services since the early 1960 's. A principal driver behind the move to <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> is the competition to long propagation delay geostationary orbit satellite systems created by rapid expansion of short propagation delay terrestrial land and undersea fiber optic cable links for national and global connectivity. Communication paths over <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> can have shorter propagation delay than terrestrial fiber. This because the speed of electromagnetic wave propagation via <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> is 50 % {{greater than that of}} light in fiber optic cable. This fact eliminates the long propagation delay property that has become synonymous with GEO communications satellite system. Other drivers are the use of small portable and hand-held earth terminals and the promise of low launch cost of small satellites to low earth orbits.

40|$|In {{satellite}} communication networks, low propagation delay and power requirements increase the plausibility of Low Earth Orbit (<b>LEO)</b> <b>satellites</b> over geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. High relative speed and random {{direction of motion}} of <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> provide a serious barrier for their applicability in global wireless communication. The spot beam dynamics of <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> brings about frequent handover of connections between spot-beams for the Mobile Stations (MS). This paper introduces two handover initiation algorithms with connection control. The angle and {{the distance between the}} MS and satellite after a defined sample interval serves as a data set for decision making in these two algorithms. A threshold limit is set in each algorithm (threshold angle and threshold distance) which when crossed results in handoff initiation. The simulations were performed in MATLAB 7. 8 where a virtual coded scenario with aid of available data was created and the algorithm was executed in it. 1...|$|R
40|$|The ground {{monitoring}} {{stations of}} BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) are regional distribution {{and the number}} of these stations is small. The more global ground stations cannot be built in the short term. The ground regional monitoring stations are difficult to observe the global Medium Earth Orbit Satellite (MEO) continuously, which leads to low precision of orbits in BDS real-time broadcast ephemeris. Based on the above problems, in view of real time satellite GNSS data of low earth orbit satellite can effectively make up the lack of regional monitoring stations in space overlay, a method is proposed that the GNSS receivers of <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> used as high dynamic space-based monitoring stations combining with the data of the ground monitoring stations to calculate and forecast the MEO satellite orbits. The numeral results show that, using the data of seven regional monitoring stations add 1 to 3 <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites,</b> the precision of the MEO orbit determination can be increased by about 21 %, 34 % and 55 % respectively. It also shows that, the ground regional monitoring stations combined with the data of <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> can effectively improve the orbit precision of MEO satellite.

30|$|The {{present study}} {{considered}} AIS data received by terrestrial stations. Meanwhile <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> can also receive AIS data of far offshore ships within the satellite footprint. If {{the number of}} <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> increases, successive ship data during whole navigation over quasi-global ocean may become available. Although GNSS ship positioning used in the current AIS is generally low precision, using high-precision positioning will give us incentives of geophysical applications {{as well as of}} safe berthing (Oda et al. 2009). If the number of the users of high-precision GNSS positioning increases as a result of decreasing prices, such a crowdsourced dataset will have wide potentials including geophysical applications (Foster et al. 2012; Ichikawa et al. 2013; Roggenbuck et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|At present, the SLR {{measurements}} to <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> {{were mainly}} used for precision orbit determination {{together with other}} space geodetic techniques or as an independent way of orbit validation (Thaller et al. 2015; Bruni et al. 2017). The inter-technique combination between GNSS and SLR can be performed in a limited way. Up to now, the majority of <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> are tracked by GNSS and SLR. In this study, we present a kinematic method based on the LEO satellite-borne GNSS technique for the precise estimation of SLR station coordinates. As moving stations, <b>LEO</b> <b>satellites</b> can attach the network of SLR sites to the GNSS-derived TRF. This method can quickly estimate the coordinates of SLR stations and {{also can be used}} as a means to estimate the scale difference between SLR and GNSS. This method aims at a combination using only a satellite as a connection between different space geodetic techniques. The data of GRACE-A satellite, as one of twin satellites in the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (Tapley et al. 2004), were used. To validate this method, the coordinates of SLR stations are estimated based on GRACE-A data for January–December 2012.|$|R
