5|$|In February 2002, Curtis {{introduced}} TotalFark as {{a subscription}} service, charging $5 per month. By May 2007 {{there were an}} estimated 2,000 subscribers, generating $120,000 per year.

However, as of 2010 an estimated 40% of <b>links</b> submitted to TotalFark are deleted within one minute of being submitted. In a typical 24-hour period, TotalFark's main page includes 1,200 to 1,800 <b>links</b> with associated comment threads, whereas Fark's main page includes only 60 to 80 <b>links</b> from that total.|$|E
5|$|In early 2016, Intersection {{announced}} that it could install about 100 <b>Links</b> in a mid-sized city in the United States, provided that it wins the United States Department of Transportation's Smart City Challenge.

Locations like St. George, Jamaica, South Bronx, and Flatbush Avenue were prioritized for LinkNYC kiosk installations, with these places receiving <b>Links</b> by the end of 2016. By mid-July 2016, the planned roll-out of 500 hubs throughout New York City was to occur, though the actual installation proceeded at a slower rate. , there were 400 hubs in three boroughs (most of which were in Manhattan along lower Second Avenue, Third Avenue, Eighth Avenue, upper Amsterdam Avenue, Lafayette Street, parts of Broadway, and the Bowery; at least 25 along Grand Concourse and in Fordham in the Bronx; and some along Queens Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue in Queens). In November 2016, the first two <b>Links</b> were installed in Brooklyn, along Fulton Street in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, with plans to install nine more <b>Links</b> in various places around Brooklyn before year's end, especially around Prospect Park and LIU Brooklyn. Around this time, Staten Island also received its first <b>Links,</b> which were installed in New Dorp. The <b>Links</b> were being installed at an average pace of ten per day throughout the boroughs with a projected goal of 500 hubs by the end of 2016. , there were 920 <b>Links</b> installed across the city.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of knot theory, a split <b>link</b> is a <b>link</b> {{that has a}} (topological) 2-sphere in its complement separating one or more <b>link</b> components from the others.

Whether a <b>link</b> is split or non-split corresponds to whether the <b>link</b> complement is reducible or irreducible as a 3-manifold.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} nontrivial {{example of}} a <b>link</b> {{with more than one}} component is called the Hopf <b>link,</b> which consists of two circles (or unknots) <b>linked</b> together once.
