40|$|Raptors are {{confirmed}} predators of Asian slow <b>lorises</b> (<b>Nycticebus</b> <b>spp.),</b> {{the only}} primates with a toxic bite. A possible function of this venom {{is to protect}} against predators. Slow lorises release volatile chemicals when threatened, thus potentially communicating their venomous status towards predators. Crested Serpent-eagles (Spilornis cheela) and Changeable Hawk-eagles (Nisaetus cirrhatus) are known to prey on venomous snakes and small mammals and are potential predators of slow lorises. We tested the anti-predator potential of slow loris venom by presenting pieces of chicken combined with swabs of Greater Slow Loris (Nycticebus coucang) venom to 10 Changeable Hawk-eagles and 5 Crested Serpent-eagles. The eagles showed few behavioural responses in reaction to slow loris venom, examining swabs with venom or control scents equally. Both eagle species did show higher rates of face-rubbing behaviour following consumption of foods paired with venom compared with control scents. Our data suggest that slow loris venom does not function to repel avian predators, but may have an anti-predator defence function. While the eagles are not repelled {{by the smell of}} slow lorises, contact with their venom causes discomfort, potentially limiting the palatability of slow lorises to eagles...|$|E
40|$|The venom {{produced}} by slow <b>lorises</b> (<b>Nycticebus</b> <b>spp.)</b> is toxic both intra- and inter-specifically. In {{this study we}} assessed the ecoparasite repellent properties of their venom. We tested venom from two Indonesian slow loris species: Nycticebus javanicus and Nycticebus coucang. Arthropods directly exposed to brachial gland secretions mixed with saliva from both species were immediately impaired or exhibited reduced activity (76 %), and often {{died as a result}} (61 %). We found {{no significant difference in the}} result of 60 -min trials between N. coucang and N. javanicus [X 2 (1, n = 140) = 2. 110, p = 0. 3482]. We found evidence that the degree of lethality of the venom varies according to the arthropod taxa to which it is exposed. While most maggots (84 %) were initially impaired from the venom after 10 min, maggots died after a 1 h trial 42 % of the time. In contrast, at the end of 1 h trial, spiders died 78 % of the time. For all arthropods, the average time to death from exposure was less than 25 min (M = 24. 40, SD = 22. 60). Ectoparasites including ticks, members of the arachnid order, are known to transmit pathogens to hosts and may be an intended target of the toxic secretions. Our results suggest that one function of slow loris venom is to repel parasites that affect their fitness, and that their topical anointing behaviour may be an adaptive response to ectoparasites...|$|E
40|$|Within the Kingdom Mammalia, venom {{evolution}} is rare, occurring in only six orders. Arguably the most cryptic, and academically neglected venom occurs within primates among slow <b>lorises</b> (<b>Nycticebus</b> <b>spp.).</b> Venoms comprise novel biological compounds {{with a potential}} plethora of proteins and peptides available for utilisation in bio-medical research. We collected samples of slow loris saliva from eight captive-bred pygmy slow lorises (N. pygmaeus) at Paignton Zoo and Shaldon Wildlife Trust UK, given voluntarily as slow lorises chewed on Salimetrics children’s swabs. From January to March 2017, we employed MTT assays, and microscopy assessments to determine cell survival on human epidermal carcinoma cells (A 431 line) after the application of concentrations of slow loris salivary venom. Cell survival from {{both male and female}} derived saliva was half that of untreated cells. Cytotoxic action is demonstrated in concentrations as low as 0. 01 % venom. Results demonstrate a cytotoxic effect with ensuing physiological damage on human cancer cells, demonstrating the cytotoxic action of slow loris saliva only, without the admixture of brachial gland exudate. We show that even captive-bred slow loris saliva harbours potentially dangerous substances, with functional applications towards slow loris husbandry. Knowledge of slow loris salivary venom increases understanding of the novel salivary composition and supports discussions of slow loris conservation by proposing a functional narrative to oppose the illegal pet trade, by contradicting their ‘cute and cuddly’ appeal. Evidence of salivary venom shows that cytotoxic effects can result {{even in the absence of}} a bite puncturing the skin, and further demonstrates their inappropriateness as pets...|$|E

5000|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> (<b>Nycticebus</b> coucang, Nycticebus bengalensis) and pygmy slow <b>lorises</b> (<b>Nycticebus</b> pygmaeus), are {{arboreal}} prosimians. They {{are considered}} indirectly or secondarily venomous, because their venom {{is produced in}} the brachial gland {{on the inside of}} the elbows, licked, and injected into the victim by a specialized tooth comb. [...] A protein in the secretion, which is similar to the allergen protein isolated from the domestic cat, may be introduced by the bites of these lorises, resulting in anaphylaxis. The brachial gland is a specialized apocrine sweat gland and the tooth comb is a set of spaced incisors on the lower jaw, primarily used for grooming. The lack of physical connection between the brachial gland and the tooth comb makes it hard for lorises to fit in most of the definitions of a venomous animal. Additionally, this “venom” is toxic only for some incidentally susceptible species.|$|R

40|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> (<b>Nycticebus</b> <b>spp.)</b> are small-bodied nocturnal {{primates}} {{found throughout}} South-east Asia. All slow lorises {{are threatened by}} habitat loss and trade for pets and traditional medicine. They are easily distinguishable from other primates by a myriad of unique morphological, behavioural, physiological and ecological characteristics, yet are amongst the least-known of all primates. During February 2010 and March 20111 assisted a reintroduction programme for slow lorises initiated by International Animal Rescue (IARI) at their rescue centre in Java, Indonesia. Throughout the reintroduction process, I collected data that would enhance the reintroduction process, but also provide a deeper understanding oftheir behaviour, ecology and evolution. I analyse data compiled by IARI over a four year period revealing demographic trends in slow lorises admitted to the rescue centre and discuss the role that rescue centres and reintroduction programmes have in regard to their contribution to conservation. Rescue centres working in collaboration with local governments {{have the potential to}} help mitigate trade through ensuring better enforcement and awareness campaigns. I conclude that they do have an important role in conservation. I examine the presence of stereotypic behaviours at IARI in relation to various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. 33 % of slow lorises displayed stereotypies. Time in captivity and type of social group are shown to be significant predictors of stereotypies. For better welfare in captivity and for increased reintroduction success these findings should be addressed further. I monitored six reintroduced Javan slow lorises on Mount Salak, Java using radio telemetry. Of the feeding observations noted, floral nectar of Calliandra calothyrsus comprised 90 % of the total.

40|$|In Cambodia, {{the sale}} {{of large numbers of}} dried pygmy slow loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus) {{carcasses}} has been frequently reported since the 1990 s, and recent large-scale deforestation has occurred within its distributional range. It is listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List, and in Appendix 1 of CITES based on increasing and unsustainable trade, habitat loss and degradation. However, little was known of the ecology, behaviour, and conservation status of this small nocturnal primate; this thesis aimed to determine the ecology and use of the species in Cambodia. The first experiment (Chapter 3) evaluated the effectiveness of three sampling methods in detecting animals at two field sites. Spotlighting with a red filter was found to be an effective method, recording a mean encounter rate of 0. 33 animals km- 1. No animals were detected in arboreal wire cage traps or on tracking plates. I collected spotlighting data and interview data from local communities to survey the relative abundance, distribution, diet, sociality and habitat preference of the species in three protected areas in eastern Cambodia and found these were consistent between the two data sets (Chapter 4). Importantly, these data indicated recent severe population declines. I radio-collared 10 individuals and conducted focal animal follows across two seasons in 2008 and 2009 to collect ecological data (Chapter 5, 6 and 7). Mean (± SD) home range sizes were 22. 23 ± 10. 28 ha in adult males (n = 3), 12. 08 ± 1. 73 ha in adult females (n = 4) and 12. 49 ± 2. 16 ha in sub-adults (n = 3). Animals primarily slept alone at sleep sites (43 / 45 observations) located in thick vegetation high in the canopy (mean ±SD) height = 8. 45 ± 3. 74 m). Adult males displayed a large testes volume (mean (±SD) = 2326. 54 ± 132. 67 mm 3) when compared to other nocturnal primates. Adult males had a larger and more variable home range size and nightly travel distance when compared to adult females, and {{there was no significant difference}} in mean body weight (p= 0. 67), or head-body length (p= 0. 74) between the sexes. Adult males slept at sites along the perimeter of their home range and rarely returned to the same sleep sites. Adult females usually returned to the same sleep sites, and these sites were located closer to the centre of home ranges. These findings suggest this species may have a promiscuous copulatory pattern. Observations of feeding and analysis of scats indicated a diverse diet, consisting of gums, fruits, arthropods, flower parts, fungi, parts of bamboo culms, reptiles, small mammals, lichen and/or fungi. Radio-tracked animals were consistently active on dark nights (p= 0. 02). Temperature alone did not have an effect on activity (p= 0. 81). There was a significant interaction between moonlight and temperature (p= 0. 04), with animals increasing activity with higher ambient temperatures only on bright nights. This interaction indicated that both predation and heat loss influence activity. Lastly, I conducted interviews and questionnaires to determine the use and users of lorises, and whether access to alternative therapies may reduce the use (Chapter 8). Traditional medicine sellers identified slow <b>lorises</b> (<b>Nycticebus</b> <b>spp.)</b> are the most requested animal product in Phnom Penh (84. 68 %, 94 / 111) and the primary user group was women (76 %, 38 / 50) between 25 to 45 years old (92 %, 46 / 50) from middle to upper class backgrounds (84. 61 %, 55 / 65). Slow lorises were predominantly used in a tonic for women after childbirth (69 %, 77 / 111), stomach problems (54. 1 %, 60 / 111), healing wounds (54. 1 %, 60 / 111) and broken bones (53. 2 %, 59 / 111), and treating sexually transmitted diseases (16. 2 %, 18 / 111). Supplies are sourced from protected areas, and the market price per animal had more than doubled from 1997 to 2007. Respondents expressed reluctance to substitute loris medicines with alternatives. Low encounter rates and reports of large-scale decline (Chapter 4), large spatial requirements (Chapter 5), and the popularity and use of this species in traditional medicines (Chapter 8) indicate that if the current decimation of populations and forests across Eastern Cambodia continues, extinction of these populations is likely. These findings highlight the urgent need for protection of remaining habitats, and education and enhanced law enforcement initiatives to curtail large-scale hunting and sale of this species in Cambodia...|$|E

500|$|In 1785, the Dutch {{physician}} and naturalist Pieter Boddaert {{was the first}} to officially describe a species of slow loris using the name Tardigradus coucang. This species was based on the [...] "tailless maucauco" [...] described by Thomas Pennant in 1781, which is thought to have been based on a Sunda slow loris, and on Vosmaer's description of a Bengal slow loris. Consequently, there has been some disagreement over the identity of Tardigradus coucang; currently the name is given to the Sunda slow loris. The next slow loris species to be described was Lori bengalensis (currently Nycticebus bengalensis), named by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1800. In 1812, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire named the genus Nycticebus, naming it for its nocturnal behavior. [...] The name derives from the , genitive form of [...] ( [...] , [...] "night"), and [...] ( [...] , [...] "monkey"). Geoffroy also named Nycticebus javanicus in this work. Later 19th-century authors also called the slow <b>lorises</b> <b>Nycticebus,</b> but most used the species name tardigradus (given by Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of Systema Naturæ) for slow lorises, until mammalogists Witmer Stone and James A.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of food ingested by a primate affect its assimilation of energy by modulating food passage rate. In general, digestive time increases in folivorous primates and decreases in frugivorous primates {{when they are}} fed higher fibre diets but this relationship is understudied in exudativorous primates. We compared the food passage rate of five slow loris species. We studied 34 wild-caught slow <b>lorises</b> (15 <b>Nycticebus</b> coucang, 15 N. javanicus, and four N. menegensis) in an Indonesian rescue centre and four captive-born slow lorises (two N. bengalensis and two N. pygmaeus) in a UK institution. We fed the Indonesian animals two different diets: a captive-type diet comprising fruits, vegetables and insects, and a wild-type diet formulated to be similar in nutrients to that consumed by slow lorises in the wild, consisting of gum, insects, vegetables and nectar. We fed the UK animals a diet of gum, vegetables, insects and hard-boiled eggs. We formulated this diet to mimic the wild diet, with notably higher fibre fractions and lower soluble sugars than the previous diet. We measured two variables: the transit time (TT) and the mean retention time (MRT). We mixed 1 tsp of glitter in bananas or gum as our markers and fed them to the slow lorises immediately prior to their main diet. We noted the date and time of feeding and of appearances of the marker in faeces. We weighed food given and left over for each animal to calculate ingested foods and nutrients. We found that TTs were not affected by diet treatment but MRTs were significantly longer for all species fed the wild type diet. Our results show that <b>Nycticebus</b> <b>spp.</b> have long MRTs for their body weight, and N. pygmaeus may have the slowest MRT of all primates in relation to body mass. The digestive flexibility of exudativorous primates should allow them to maximise fermentation opportunities when they ingest more (appropriate) fibre by {{increasing the amount of}} time the fibre substrate stays in the large intestine. Exudativorous primates appear to have plastic digestive strategies that may be an adaptation to cope with relatively nutrient-poor staple food sources such as gum.

40|$|Illegal and {{unsustainable}} {{trade in}} wildlife {{is a major}} conservation challenge. For Asian primates, economic and cultural traditions, and increased forest access mean that trade may have become detrimental for certain species. Slow and slender <b>lorises</b> (<b>Nycticebus</b> and Loris) are primates particularly prevalent in trade, determined until now by focused counts of lorises in regional markets. Here, we use international trade statistics and a participant–observer approach to assess culturally specific drivers for trade in lorises in South and Southeast Asia, to provide a broader context to help mitigate this practice. Analysis of international records for the last 30 years revealed that live animal trade was more prevalent than trade in body parts (slow lorises, 86. 4 %; slender lorises, 91. 4 %), with Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand the largest exporters. We then examine drivers of international and domestic trade based on long-term data from 1994 – 2009 in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Indonesia.

Slow lorises also were more active in higher humidity and when it was cloudy, whereas potential predators were equally active across conditions. As slow lorises are well-adapted to avoid/defend predators by crypsis, mimicry and the possession of venom, we argue that lunarphobia may be due to prey availability.

After its introduction in 2013, chayote (Sechium edule), a gourd grown on bamboo lattice frames, became an important cash crop. To evaluate people’s use of this crop and to measure the effect of this increase on slow loris behavior, home ranges, and sleep sites, we conducted interviews with local farmers and analysed the above variables in relation to chayote expansion between 2011 and 2015. Interviews with farmers in 2011, 2013, and 2015 confirm the importance of chayote and of bamboo and slow lorises in their agricultural practices. In 2015 chayote frames covered 12 % of land in Cipaganti, occupying 4 % of slow loris home ranges, which marginally yet insignificantly increased in size with the increase in chayote. Slow lorises are arboreal and the bamboo frames increased connectivity within their ranges.

We combine these 3 cases with 2 previous ones to test the hypothesis that slow loris captures by orangutans are seasonal and dependent on fruit availability. We also provide the first (to our knowledge) quantitative data and high-definition video recordings of meat chewing rates by great apes, which we use to estimate the minimum time necessary for a female Australopithecus africanus to reach its daily energy requirements when feeding partially on raw meat. Captures seemed to be opportunistic but orangutans may have used olfactory cues to detect the prey. The mother often rejected meat sharing requests and only the infant initiated meat sharing. Slow loris captures occurred only during low ripe fruit availability, suggesting that meat may represent a filler fallback food for orangutans. Orangutans ate meat more than twice as slowly as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), suggesting that group living may function as a meat intake accelerator in hominoids. Using orangutan data as a model, time spent chewing per day would not require an excessive amount of time for our social ancestors (australopithecines and hominids), as long as meat represented no {{more than a quarter of}} their diet.

500|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> (genus <b>Nycticebus)</b> are {{primates}} {{that belong}} to the suborder Strepsirrhini. They are found throughout South and Southeast Asia and the surrounding islands, {{and live in the}} upper canopy of tropical rainforests. They are nocturnal, sleeping during the day curled up in the fork of a tree. Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers and rarely come to the ground. They have a round face, woolly fur, a dark stripe down their back, and a tail that is reduced to a stump. Their head and body length ranges from [...] Their hands and feet are strong and good at grasping for long periods of time. Slow lorises are either solitary or live in pairs; the males are territorial and mark their territories with urine. Their diet consists of mollusks, small vertebrates, and fruit.|$|R
40|$|More {{species of}} nocturnal {{primates}} are now recognized {{than in the}} past, because many are cryptic species. Subtle morphological disparities, such as pelage pattern and color variation, vocal cues, and genetics have aided in elucidating the number of diagnosable species in a genus. The slow <b>lorises</b> (genus <b>Nycticebus)</b> once included only two species, but recent taxonomic studies resulted {{in the description of}} three additional species; further incompletely explored variability characterizes each of the currently described species. The Bornean loris in particular is characterized by pelage and body size variation. In this study, we explored facemask variation in the Bornean loris (N. menagensis). Differing facemask patterns, particularly influenced by the amount of white on the face, significantly clustered together by geographic regions, separated by notable geographic boundaries. Our results support the recognition of four species of Bornean lorises: N. menagensis, N. bancanus, N. borneanus, and N. kayan. Genetic studies are required to support these findings and to refine further our understanding of the marke...|$|R
40|$|Slow loris (<b>Nycticebus</b> <b>spp.)</b> captive diets {{have been}} based on routine and anecdotes rather than {{scientific}} fact. The growing body of evidence contradicts the high fruit diet supported by such anecdotes. Non-human primate nutrient requirements are grouped into new (based on the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus) or old world (based on rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta) primates. Slow lorises are known to suffer from many health ailments in captivity such as dental disease, obesity, wasting and kidney issues all of which have been linked to diet. This study aimed to estimate nutrient intake from free-ranging slow lorises and to determine whether this intake can be used as nutrient recommendations. We collected data of nutrient intake, food passage rate and digestibility of captive slow lorises on three diet treatments 1 : current captive type diet which is mostly fruits, 2 : wild-type diet made only of food items from their natural diet, 3 : new diet made to reflect wild slow loris nutrient intake. In order to validate our nutrient recommendations, diets 2 and 3 would have to be significantly different to Diet 1 in terms of nutrients, but not different from each other. Captive diets were significantly higher in soluble carbohydrates and lower in minerals and fibre fractions than both diets 2 and 3. Diets 2 and 3 led to a significantly increased food passage time and to more effective fibre and calcium digestion compared to Diet 1. We also observed obese individuals lost weight and underweight individuals gained weight. Our nutrient recommendations have been validated by our trials, and new or old world monkey nutrient recommendations are not consistent with our results. Diets should be high in protein and fibre and low in soluble carbohydrates and fats...|$|R
