40|$|The {{review of}} {{existing}} information has identified the following: - the juvenile core in Araucaria is probably {{contained within the}} first 15 growth rings in the pith, with spiral grain being a chief determinant of its extent within the stem; - a reduction in rotation length for a given site index will reduce ASV and mature wood volume, {{with an increase in}} the proportion of juvenile wood; - for a given rotation length, lower ASV stems were estimated to contain a lower proportion of juvenile wood (based on the assumptions made and crude simulations using WEEDS, PL YSIM and STEPS software); regardless of juvenile wood proportions, smaller stems will yield a higher proportion of pith-in material; - an increase in the proportion of juvenile wood, due to a reduction in rotation length, could affect wood quality due to an increase in the proportion of the recovery containing high spiral grain, shorter tracheids and higher micellar angle; - high spiral grain and high micellar angles adversely impact on wood quality through their influence on twist and longitudinal shrinkage, respectively; - positive outcomes from a reduction in rotation length might include an increase in the proportion of <b>live</b> <b>knots</b> in upper stem sections and a reduction in the extent of brown-stain heartwood; - the uniformity in basic density within Araucaria stems means reduced rotation lengths and lower stem ASVs are unlikely to {{have a major impact on}} this wood property, and - the effect of a reduction in rotation length on the incidence of compression wood and timber susceptible to kiln staining could not be established from the available information...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In {{this work}} a new fuzzy min-max neural network for color image segmentation, called FMMIS neural network, is proposed. The FMMIS {{algorithm}} uses seed pixels to grow hyperboxes, and a criterion of homogeneity for controlling {{the size of}} these hyperboxes. The algorithm has been implemented for 2 D images and tested on the segmentation of <b>live</b> and dead <b>knots</b> in images of wood boards. On a test set, all knots were correctly detected {{and most of them}} were precisely segmented (the area recognition rate was 91 %). The method is very fast and may be applied on real-time visual inspection systems. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the pursued {{research}} is to increase knowledge {{of the effects of}} knots in structural timber so that characteristics of weaker timber may be determined and applied to improve current grading techniques. In the process, a three-dimensional fiber paradigm was established, which describes variations of local principle material axes in timber containing knots. The adaptability of the paradigm allows practically any softwood knot and its effect on surrounding wood material to be modeled with an accuracy that is limited only by input data. In the description of the fiber paradigm, considerations are given to Shigoâ€™s knot formation theory, which predicts two separate patterns of fiber direction within annual growth layers related to <b>live</b> <b>knots.</b> In order to determine the possibility to practically and non-destructively predict local material directions in structural timber with the three-dimensional fiber paradigm, variations of knot and knot bump geometry and related fiber disturbance of eleven knots from two trees of Nordic Spruce (Picea Abies) grown in Southern Sweden were analyzed. Results showed that the paradigm could be calibrated to describe measured projected fiber orientations in the radial and tangential planes from two visual knot parameters with a coefficient of correlation R 2 = 0. 88. Spiral grain was considered in the investigation, and was shown to correspond well to results from previous research on Nordic Spruce. When modeling the mechanical behavior of timber containing knots, variation of material properties within the stem wood, and the effect of altering fiber patterns within a single annual growth layer were modeled with the principles of homogenization and assumed constant material properties of the earlywood, transientwood, and latewood. Flatwise bending stiffness along a timber beam was predicted numerically with the model and compared to measured values. The results indicated that the proposed model of the effect of knots on sawn timber, and the assumed properties of earlywood, transientwood, and latewood in relation to variations of annual ring thickness throughout the beam account for the measured variations of stiffness. The results also suggest that variation of annual ring thickness may cause larger variations in stiffness than the distribution and properties of knots along the beam. The derived and verified model of knot effects on sawn timber was applied to predict the severity of stress states for various knot positions in tensile loaded timber members. From these results a definition of a critical knot was derived. The applicability of the critical knot definition was analyzed in relation to actual tensile load carrying capacities experimentally determined for structural timber. Based on these results it is concluded that the derived critical knot definition offers an efficient method to sort out particularly weak members (tensile capacity less than 20 MPa) ...|$|R

Chinese merchant ship set sail from Canton during November, with the aid of fair wind sailed nonstop day and night, arrived at Pukalong in about one month. The people made wine from coconuts, produced very delicious red and white cane sugar, the kingdom made coins out of bronze and copper, 60 copper coins exchanged for one tael of gold.

5000|$|Greg kills Mark St. Claire, who {{was holding}} Abby hostage on a boat. After being shot, Karen refuses to have risky surgery, fearing she would die in the process, {{although}} she soon recovers. Meanwhile, Gary and Abby reconcile and the couple, along with Karen, agreed to become partners in Lotus Point. Lilimae's secret son and Valene's half-brother, Joshua Rush (Alec Baldwin), whom Lilimae abandoned as an infant, arrives in Knots Landing and moves in with Lilimae and Valene. Joshua, a televangelist, soon starts a romance with Cathy, who has moved into the cul-de-sac with Laura and her children. Abby starts running a television station, World Pacific Cable, that Ben becomes a journalist for after Gary purchased it. Abby was stunned to learn that Gary {{was the father of}} Valene's twins, and Abby tells Scott Easton (Jack Bannon), an influential lobbyist with shady connections, about her problem. As a favor to Abby, Scott arranges to have Valene's babies kidnapped at birth, though without Abby's approval, who becomes furious at his actions. Valene is told the babies were stillborn, although she insists she saw them alive, and thereby <b>lives</b> <b>Knots</b> Landing for Tennessee, where she assumes the identity of Verna Ellers (a character from one of her books) and works as a waitress. Karen and Mack reconcile, and Karen eventually gets the operation she needed {{in order to make a}} full recovery. Gary befriends the aging millionaire Paul Galveston (Howard Duff), and Galveston offers Gary the opportunity to develop Empire Valley, a large piece of real estate. Galveston soon dies, and he leaves his millions to Greg, who is proven to have been his son. Assuming he had been left Empire Valley, Greg resigns from the Senate, but is shocked to learn that the land had been left to Gary. Greg's devious mother, Ruth (guest star Ava Gardner), comes to visit her son after Galveston's death. Ruth becomes close to Abby (since they have similar interests), but loathes Laura, who, by this time has started a relationship with Greg. Around this same time, Joshua and Cathy grow closer, and the two soon marry. Valene (still believing she is [...] "Verna") becomes engaged to a man in Tennessee, but Gary finally finds her and brings her back to Knots Landing, where she rekindles her romance with Ben, still believing her babies to be alive. Karen and Ben discovered that Valene's doctor had paid off a nurse to assist in the kidnapping of Valene's children. Mack thereby tracked down Valene's babies, who had been adopted illegally. Abby confided in Greg that she inadvertently caused the kidnapping of Valene's babies, but she wanted to get them back. With Ruth's help, Abby was able to get address to the home where Valene's babies had been living. In the season finale, Abby goes to Valene and tells her that she knows where her babies are, and the two go to the home of Sheila (Robin Ginsburg) and Harry Fisher (Joe Regalbuto). Sheila disbelieves their claims that the babies were adopted illegally, and Harry takes off with one of the twins.|$|R
30|$|The length, width, thickness, {{percentage}} of visible rot, {{percentage of}} heartwood, size, location and condition of <b>knots</b> (<b>live,</b> dead, rotten), number of resin pockets and clear-cuttings dimensions were measured and recorded for each board. All timber from the pruned logs was reconstructed into the logs and {{the locations of}} defects (i.e. length along the board, knot depth and occlusion depth) noted. The {{presence or absence of}} heartwood was recorded at 0.5 m intervals along the board. Board dimensions and saw kerf thickness measurements were converted into x, y and z coordinates (z being the axial distance along the log) so that maps could be created at a later date. This information would also be useful for future construction of virtual pruned logs in a sawing simulator. A sawn timber conversion percentage (proportion of sawn timber volume to log volume) was calculated for each log and mathematical relationships were defined for SED, Conversion Potential (CP) factor, PLI, heartwood content and percentage of dead and rotten branches.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{unwrapped}} Fukaya category of Lagrangian branes ending on a Legendrian <b>knot.</b> Our <b>knots</b> <b>live</b> at contact infinity in the cotangent bundle of a surface, the Fukaya category {{of which is}} equivalent to the category of constructible sheaves on the surface itself. Consequently, our category can be described as constructible sheaves with singular support controlled by the front projection of the knot. We use a theorem of Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira to show that the resulting category is invariant under Legendrian isotopies, and conjecture it {{is equivalent to the}} representation category of the Chekanov-Eliashberg differential graded algebra. We also find two connections to topological knot theory. First, drawing a positive braid closure on the annulus, the moduli space of rank-n objects maps to the space of local systems on a circle. The second page of the spectral sequence associated to the weight filtration on the pushforward of the constant sheaf is the (colored-by-n) triply-graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology. Second, drawing a positive braid closure in the plane, the number of points of our moduli spaces over a finite field with q elements recovers the lowest coefficient in 'a' of the HOMFLY polynomial of the braid closure.

40|$|Abstract. The {{shape and}} {{structure}} of branches attached internally to the stem (knots) for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees were modeled. Data on knot shape {{were obtained from the}} dissection of branches taken from 34 22 -yr-old sample trees growing under ten different initial spacings. A total of 341 branches located below the live crown were dissected in the radial/tangential plane. Afterward, a procedure was implemented to reconstruct the branch diameter perpendicular to the branch pith. This information was used to develop a model for representing knot shape, which assumed that the live portion of a knot can be modeled with a one-parameter equation and the dead portion by assuming a cylindrical shape. To study the variability in shape of individual <b>knots</b> (<b>live</b> portion), the model was fitted to 218 branch profiles using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling techniques. A graphical analysis indicated that the random-effects parameter was related to branch diameter. Thus, branch diameter was included as a predictor variable to reduce between-individual variability in knot shape. Reconstructed knots with smaller diameters were more cylindrical; those with larger diameters were more parabolic or conical in shape. Analytical ex-pressions were derived for estimating the volume of knots (live/dead portions) for three types of branch conditions on simulated trees: 1) live branches; 2) nonoccluded dead branches; and 3) occluded dead branches. The knot model assumes a substantial simplification of branch morphology, but should be useful for representing knots as 3 -D entities in the stems of loblolly pine trees...|$|R
