She went to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> with Vicki Blue, former bassist of The Runaways.

500|$|Another {{symbolic}} {{sound is}} {{the hum of}} a mosquito. Although his producer insists that these parasites don't <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> (since [...] "mosquitos breed in swamps; this is a desert"), its distinctive sound is heard clearly as Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room. Later, he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face. The insect also figures prominently into the revelation of Audrey's death; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she's been murdered. The high pitch of the mosquito's hum is echoed in the high strings used for the movie's score. During filming, the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated.|$|E

500|$|During this era, American {{television}} programs were either broadcast live to local television stations via microwave relay and AT's coaxial cable service or were recorded on kinescope and delivered {{through the mail}} to local stations. The live broadcast method was expensive, but was preferred by executives {{at each of the}} four major U.S. television networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and DuMont); in 1954, DuMont alone spent $3 million on live television broadcasts. The major networks sent kinescopes to stations when live transmissions were not possible. [...] "Film networks", which sent out only prerecorded material, also existed; kinescopes were cheap to produce and cost little to mail. Paramount's television service was a hybrid of the two systems, with a live connection between KTLA and KFMB-TV in San Diego, and other affiliates broadcasting programs from kinescope recordings. Paramount executives considered a live connection between Los Angeles and San Francisco too expensive. Uniquely, Paramount's The Harry Owens Show was broadcast <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> and San Francisco by having the program's performers and crew commute via airplane between the two stations for sequential performances.|$|E

500|$|Mike Reagan, a music {{composer}} {{noted for}} his work in video games such as Darkwatch and God of War, was hired by THQ to write the music for Conan. [...] To begin, he wanted to compose simple but powerful melodies, and looked to Basil Poledouris's score for the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian for inspiration. [...] As Reagan played development copies of the game, he was influenced by two other works: Igor Stravinsky's barbaric and sensual ballet music The Rite of Spring, and Bernard Hermann's score from the 1958 action film The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. [...] Each week, Nihilistic and Reagan updated each other with copies of their work-in-progress, synchronizing their efforts. Reagan also studied with noted percussion artists Denny Seiwell, Emil Richards, and Michael Duffy to gain further insight on the use of drums to accompany the game's bloody and violent plot. [...] After mastering the soundtrack, he brought the music of Conan to an October 2007 Video Games Live show, performing it <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> United States.|$|E
500|$|Sheen {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with English actress Kate Beckinsale from 1995 until 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995, and began living together shortly afterwards. Their daughter, Lily Mo Beckinsale-Sheen, was born in 1999 in London, England. The actress has said she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] that Sheen never proposed, but {{felt as if she were}} married. Their relationship ended in January 2003, soon after the couple moved to Los Angeles from London. Beckinsale had persuaded director Len Wiseman to cast Sheen in Underworld; but while on set, she and Wiseman fell in love, and subsequently married in 2004. Sheen has said he continues to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> to be close to his daughter. He remains friends with Beckinsale.

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
