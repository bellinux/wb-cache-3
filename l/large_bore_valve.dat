2500|$|According to Jeep's chief engineer, Roy Lunn, [...] "unlike most engines {{available}} today [...] {{was not designed}} for passenger cars and then adapted for trucks. We specifically developed it with our Jeep vehicles and Eagle in mind. That's the reason that performance and durability were of such prime consideration from the very beginning." [...] Although some of components were interchangeable between the AMC 258 cubic inch six-cylinder and the new engine, the four-cylinder was not a cut down version of the big six. Noted Roy Lunn, [...] "There are some common parts, but the 4-cylinder includes many unique items such as its own electronics systems. It also has a shorter stroke and <b>larger</b> <b>bore.</b> The <b>valves</b> are <b>larger</b> and the pistons are new." [...] Roy Lunn recalled: [...] "We wanted as much displacement - for power and torque - as possible {{within the confines of}} bore centers of the tooling. The only parameter we could influence substantially was stroke. So we picked the <b>largest</b> <b>bore</b> and stroke in order to get 2.5 Liters." ...|$|R
50|$|The 379 cuin L V8 is {{the main}} variant of the Boss engine. The V8 shares design {{similarities}} with the modular engine family such as a deep-skirt block with cross-bolted main caps, crankshaft-driven gerotor oil pump, overhead cam valve train arrangement, and bellhousing bolt pattern. In particular, the 6.2-L features a two-valve per cylinder SOHC valve train with roller-rocker shafts and two spark plugs per cylinder, as well as dual-equal variable cam timing. Just as notable is that they use a much wider 4.53 in bore spacing (compared to the Modular's 3.937 in), allowing {{for the use of}} <b>larger</b> <b>bore</b> diameters and <b>valves.</b> The 6.2-L V8 has a bore diameter of 4.0150 in with a 3.740 in stroke. It has lightweight aluminum cylinder heads and pistons, but makes use of a cast-iron cylinder block for extra durability since most applications for the engine will be trucks.|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} {{trombone}} techniques and how they have developed {{over the course of}} the twentieth century. The focal point of the study is the extension and expansion of the available performance vocabulary for trombone, using a series of case studies, scores and existing research. The expansion of techniques can be particularly identified by studying some of the most prominent performers and composers as well as the changing role of the trombone in the context of ensemble performance and some of the most prominent works that changed the role of the trombone for its future use through to the twenty first century. Included in this study is an overview of the change of the trombone due to the improvement of manufacture and addition of the <b>larger</b> <b>bore</b> and thumb <b>valve</b> and how these developments affected technique. The work of performers and composers Arthur Pryor, Tommy Dorsey, Luciano Berio, Christian Lindberg and Jan Sandstrom is looked at in more detail to establish their role in the development of trombone techniques. Important developments in technique in this study include the use of voice, mutes, theatricals, electronics, microtones and early twentieth century developments such as technical virtuosity and the singing style legato. ...|$|R
50|$|The affinities of Aplacophorans {{have long}} been uncertain. Molecular and fossil {{evidence}} seemed to put Aplacophorans in the clade Aculifera, as a sister group to Polyplacophora.

40|$|Abundant worm borings {{were found}} in some brachiopod shells (Clitambonites, Estlandia, Nicolella) from the Ordovician (Caradoc) oil shale in North Estonia. 9 of 21 brachiopod genera (43 %) have been bored. Excluding the size and {{thickness}} of valves, no common morphological feature discriminates the brachiopods with borings from those without them. The Trypanites are host-specific, {{and the frequency of}} <b>bored</b> <b>valves</b> varies from 6. 5 % in Bekkerina to 51 % in Estlandia. The worm larvae preferred hosts with thick lamellose shells, such as those of the clitambonitids, especially Clitambonites schmidti. The boring organisms were size-selective; they preferred large adult specimens. The majority of the borings are oriented, and living hosts were preferred to dead shells. Some clitambonitidine brachiopods, like C. schmidti tolerated a large number of the borer's shafts in their <b>valves.</b> Few <b>bored</b> <b>valves</b> have the blister-like shell-repair structures in their interior...|$|R
