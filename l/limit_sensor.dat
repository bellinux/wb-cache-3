The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, travel switch, <b>limit</b> <b>sensor,</b> and a single lamp. The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} the slot wheel-type seedling storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether the seedling storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the single lamp and instructs the start of the sprocket drive motor. The stroke switch mainly detects the displacement of the sprocket drive of the seedling storage tray and determines whether the seedling storage tray reaches the feeding position. Its signal is used to instruct the push rod mechanism to push the seedling tray to the conveyor belt. The <b>limit</b> <b>sensor</b> is installed at the starting position of the conveyor belt, and its signal is used to control the reset action of the pushing mechanism.|$|E

The task al-location becomes difficult {{when there is no}} communication among the UAVs and the UAVs <b>sensors</b> have <b>limited</b> range to detect the targets and neighbouring UAVs, and assess target status. In this report, we propose a team theoretic approach to efficiently allocate UAVs to the targets with the constraint that UAVs do not communicate among themselves and have <b>limited</b> <b>sensor</b> range. We study the performance of team theoretic approach for task allocation on a battle field scenario. The performance obtained through team theory is compared with two other methods, namely, <b>limited</b> <b>sensor</b> range but with communication among all the UAVs, and greedy strategy with <b>limited</b> <b>sensor</b> range and no communication. It is found that the team theoretic strategy performs the best even though it assumes <b>limited</b> <b>sensor</b> range and no communication. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} <b>limited</b> <b>sensor</b> resolution, {{although}} usually ignored in target tracking, occurs in multi-target scenarios whenever the target distance falls below {{the size of}} the sensor resolution cell. Typical examples are the surveillance of aircraft in formation, and convoy tracking for ground surveillance. Ignoring the <b>limited</b> <b>sensor</b> resolution in a tracking system may lead to degraded tracking performance, in par-ticular unwanted track-losses. In this paper, an extension of the resolution model by Koch and van Keuk to the case of arbitrary object numbers is discussed. The model is incorporated into the Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF) and applied to a simulated scenario with partially unresolved targets. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} finding {{outliers}} in data has broad applications in areas {{as diverse as}} data cleaning, fraud detection, network monitoring, invasive species monitoring, etc. While {{there are dozens of}} techniques that have been proposed to solve this problem for static data collections, very simple distance-based outlier detection methods are known to be competitive or superior to more complex methods. However, distance-based methods have time and space complexities that make them impractical for streaming data and/or resource <b>limited</b> <b>sensors.</b> In this work, we show that simple data-editing techniques can make distance-based outlier detection practical for very fast streams and resource <b>limited</b> <b>sensors.</b> Our technique generalizes to produce two algorithms, which, relative to the original algorithm, can guarantee to produce no false positives, or guarantee to produce no false negatives.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{performance test}} of a new odor detection instrument based on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor array was conducted in the Department of Agricultural Engineering, University of Bonn. The performance test includes the sensor’s response time {{to the presence of}} odor, sensor sensitivity and detection <b>limit,</b> <b>sensor</b> frequency stability, the influence of water content on the sensor frequency change and the response pattern of the sensor array to the presence of odor substances at various concentrations. In the test, nine odor substances were used as odor samples, i. e., acetone, acetic acid, 2 -butanone, 1 -butanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, limonene, and methanol. The results showed that the QCM sensor array was responsive to all nine odor compounds in the gas phase. The frequency of the sensor array was stable.

40|$|A new sensor {{provides}} an absolute position measurement. A schematic {{view of a}} motorized linear-translation stage that contains, at each end, an electronic unit that functions as both (1) a non-contact sensor that measures the absolute position of the stage and (2) a non-contact equivalent of a limit switch that is tripped when the stage reaches the nominal limit position. The need for such an absolute linear position-sensor/limit-sensor unit arises {{in the case of}} a linear-translation stage that is part of a larger system in which the actual stopping position of the stage (relative to the nominal limit position) must be known. Because inertia inevitably causes the stage to run somewhat past the nominal limit position, tripping of a standard limit switch or other <b>limit</b> <b>sensor</b> does not provide the required indication of the actual stopping position.

40|$|An on-line and {{continuous}} technique based on electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) {{was developed for}} measuring the concentration and time response function of fibroblastic V 79 cells exposed to toxicants. Mercury chloride (HgCl 2), cadmium chloride (CdCl 2), benzalkonium chloride (BAK), sodium arsenate (Na 2 HAsO 4), and trinitrobenzene (TNB) were used as five test models. The first four chemicals {{serve as a model}} for acute toxicants, and TNB represents a model for long-term cytotoxicity effects. Adhesion, spreading, and proliferation of V 79 fibroblastic cells cultured on a microarray of small gold electrodes precoated with fibronectin were detected as resistance changes. The response function was derived to reflect the resistance change as a result of cell attachment, spreading, mitosis and cytotoxicity effect. Exposure of V 79 cells to toxicants led to alterations in cell behavior, and therefore, chemical cytotoxicity was easily screened by measuring the response function of the attached and spread cells in the presence of inhibitor. The half inhibition concentration, the required concentration to achieve 50 % inhibition, was obtained from the response function to provide dynamic information about cytotoxicity during the course of the assay. A simple mathematical model was developed to describe the responses of ECIS that were related to the adhesion, spreading, and proliferation of V 79 fibroblastic cells. The novel results of this paper are mainly characterized by the systematic study of several parameters including the cell number, detection <b>limit,</b> <b>sensor</b> sensitivity, and cytotoxicity, and they may motivate further research and study of ECIS sensors.

First, <b>limited</b> <b>sensor</b> data are measured from various sensors which are preset on the complex structure.

After the local stress responses at critical spots are determined, fatigue life evaluation can be performed for structural health management and risk assessment. Fatigue life evaluation using the reconstructed stresses from remote strain gauge measurement data is also demonstrated with detailed error analysis. Following this, the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a three-dimensional frame structure and a simplified airfoil structure. Finally, several conclusions and future work are drawn based on the proposed study...|$|R

Our algorithm can be used to measure blur due to <b>limited</b> <b>sensor</b> resolution by estimating a sub-pixel, super-resolved PSF even for in-focus images. It operates by predicting a “sharp ” version of a blurry input image and uses the two images to solve for a PSF.
