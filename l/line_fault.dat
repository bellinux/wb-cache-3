50|$|Each {{paralleling}} station bus {{is connected}} to both north and south track catenary and feeder lines via automatic circuit breakers. The autotransformer {{is connected to}} the bus bars by an additional circuit breaker. The track breakers at the paralleling stations trip on sensing no-voltage. Thus when a <b>line</b> <b>fault</b> causes the supplying substation breakers to trip, the paralleling stations also trip. This action separates the two tracks from one another electrically and allows the substation to automatically restore one of the tracks (the non-faulted one). After a variable time delay (to reduce simultaneous inrush current), over-voltage relays will re-shut the track circuit breakers on the non-faulted track.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a fault {{location}} method using power quality monitoring data is proposed. The {{fault location}} {{is divided into}} two classes including <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> recognition and <b>fault</b> distance calculation. Along the each power line in the target network some fictitious fault points are set and the fault voltage of each monitoring bus is calculated. The voltage dip calculation results and the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> data are matched to form the learning samples and then train the designed <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> recognition BP artificial neural network. The trained neural network searches the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> when actual <b>fault</b> occurs. After it finishes <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> searching the <b>fault</b> position is calculated using the function of voltage dip amplitude and fault position. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the simulation results in standard IEEE- 14 bus system...|$|R

30|$|Using {{the same}} {{approach}} as in [7] to create the marginally stable cases, a sequence of three-phase <b>line</b> <b>faults</b> is used in this case to drive the interface between area “ 0 ” and “ 1 ” to its marginally stable point.

The first four clearing time of <b>line</b> <b>faults</b> was fixed (five cycles), {{and the last one}} was adjusted to make this case to be marginally stable, which means the system would collapse if the clearing time of the last fault increase by 0.001  s.

Please note that each fault is cleared by opening the <b>fault</b> <b>line.</b> They increasingly weaken the interface but do not break the connection.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{probabilistic}} method for evaluating transmission grid security after <b>line</b> shunt <b>faults.</b> The most efficient contributions to system reliability enhancement {{can be found}} in probabilistic methods applicable to real transmission grids. One aim of the research was also to get an estimate of the Finnish 400  kV transmission grid reliability. The method developed in this thesis takes into account the effect of the following issues: frequency of <b>line</b> <b>faults,</b> fault location on the line, protection system, different substation structures, failure rates of substation components and the dynamic behaviour of the power system after different contingencies. Mathematical modelling and computational methods were used in this research. Statistical analyses for the estimation of initiating events such as <b>line</b> <b>faults</b> were made. A failure mode and effect analysis was made for substation components using both the Finnish 400  kV device-failure database and expert judgments. Reliability analyses for substation post-fault operations were made with event and fault trees. Different event tree end states (fault duration and circuit breaker trips) were then simulated with a power system dynamic analysis program using a particular load flow and grid topology. The dynamic analysis results were classified as secure, alert, emergency and system breakdown. A special alert case 'partial system breakdown' was also classified. The event trees were then reanalysed, now focusing on the power system states rather than the substation consequences. The method was applied to the Finnish transmission system and some quantitative estimates for grid reliability were obtained. Several grid-level importance measures (Fussell-Vesely, risk decrease factor, risk increase factor and sensitivity of parameters) for substation components and model parameters, as well as estimates of the total and partial system breakdown frequencies, were calculated. In this way, the relative importance of the substation components regarding the total and partial system breakdown was reached. Contributing factors to partial and total system breakdown after <b>line</b> <b>faults</b> were also found and ranked. On the basis of the results, some recommendations for improving the transmission grid reliability, in terms of maintenance planning and investments, were made. reviewe...|$|R
