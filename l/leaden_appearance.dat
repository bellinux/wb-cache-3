500|$|Woodfull {{batted in}} a manner which had little {{aesthetic}} pleasure or grace, with Wisden describing stating that [...] "at first sight, he {{gave the impression of}} being clumsy". Affected by a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood, he had stiff-jointed style, and played with little noticeable backlift. This gave the impression of a laboured playing style. Despite this, he scored consistently through good placement and powerful drives generated by his strong forearms. Despite his <b>leaden</b> <b>appearance,</b> he often advanced down the pitch to spin bowling. He was known for playing with a straight bat and a close watch on the ball, which were the core features of a strong defensive ability. He typically took block on leg stump and shuffled across to cover his stumps. His defensive prowess yielded names such as [...] "the unbowlable" [...] (a reference {{to the fact that he}} was rarely bowled as a result of missing the ball) and [...] "wormkiller". The latter epithet was given to him by English bowlers who said that his backlift was so small that it was only enough to decapitate worms that had raised their heads above ground level. He was also known for his reliability in crisis match situations, leading to epithets such as [...] "The Rock" [...] and [...] "Old Steadfast". Woodfull formed an opening partnership with Bill Ponsford at state and international level which yielded 18 century opening stands. Dubbed [...] "Mutt and Jeff" [...] by teammates after the famous comic strip duo, as well as [...] "Willy Wo and Willy Po", they were regarded as one of the finest opening partnerships in Test history. Their Victorian teammates had such faith in the pair that if they were batting, the wicket-keeper and bowlers who batted low in the order would leave the ground to go to work.|$|E
