The ACLDT {{was applied to the}} digital autopilot of a first stage boost vehicle with a single gimballed engine at the maximum dynamic pressure point of the trajec-tory, with the purpose of maximizing the <b>load</b> <b>relief</b> performance of the control system. The purpose of <b>load</b> <b>relief</b> feedback for a boost vehicle is to reduce aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during atmospheric flight by minimizing the angle of attack. The design tool automates the lengthy process of fine tuning control loop parameters through the use of linear programming methods. Subject to stability margin constraints, the ACLDT minimized the maximum vehicle angle of attack in a simulation of the vehicle tran-sient response to a ramped wind input profile. Since the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle are proportional to the angle of attack, this maximum angle of attack excursion gave a rea-sonable measure of <b>load</b> <b>relief</b> performance.

40|$|Power system {{reliability}} is the overall objective in power system design and operation. It includes two main aspects: adequacy and security. During the last decades, outages and blackout emerged {{more and more}} frequently which affected the normal consumption of consumers. In {{order to meet the}} increase the power system security, a self-healing grid is needed to monitor and response to the change within the whole network in time. Smart islanding is considered as an effective way to prevent small outages in the system from propagating into big blackout. In this paper, two common methods used to find the islands are introduced and the formation of islands was conducted by a C++ minimal cutset algorithm based program which was implemented on the platform of Dev cpp in the simulation part, moreover the proposed approach was applied to a Nordic 32 -bus test system and was used to save the network from voltage collapse. On the other hand, since the large amounts of sustainable resources are being widely used by taking into account of the ever-increasing load demand throughout the world, people are exploring new resources to replace the existing non-renewable resources. As one of the renewable energy, wind power, draws people‟s attentions more and more. Renewable resource generation connected to the existing network will incur plenty of problems which will decrease the power {{system reliability}}. The wind energy injection will probably induce transmission overloaded problem which reduce the power system adequacy. It is critical to allocate the wind energy optimally. In order to find good locations to set up large-scale wind power projects, a Weighted Transmission <b>Loading</b> <b>Relief</b> (WTLR) / Equal Transmission <b>Loading</b> <b>Relief</b> (ETLR) sensitivity was introduced in this work to help find the positions of injecting the wind power so that the increasingly load demand can be satisfied as well as reduce the contingency overloads within the system to enhance the power system reliability...|$|R

40|$|Demand {{relief from}} {{customers}} {{can help a}} utility solve a variety of problems. There exist all sorts of different demand management programs that utilities use. A critical issue is the incentive paid to the customer to participate in demand management programs and provide <b>load</b> <b>relief.</b> The utility has to design cost effective yet attractive demand management contracts. The main {{goal is to get}} <b>load</b> <b>relief</b> when needed. If the contracts are designed to be cost effective they can help the utility reduce costs. Customers sign up for programs when the benefits they derive in the form of up front payments and interruption payments exceed their cost of interruption. In order to design such contracts, mechanism design with revelation principle is adopted from Game Theory and applied to the interaction between a utility and its customers. The idea behind mechanism design is to design an incentive structure that encourages customers to sign up for the right contract and reveal their true value of power (and thus, the value of power interruptibility).

40|$|New {{concepts}} are presented for aerospace vehicle ascent wind profile biasing. The purpose for wind biasing the ascent trajectory {{is to provide}} ascent wind <b>loads</b> <b>relief</b> and thus decrease the probability for launch delays due to wind loads exceeding critical limits.

The analytical expressions are presented to permit generalizations. Specific examples are given to illustrate the procedures. The wind profile models can be used to establish the ascent trajectory steering commands to guide the vehicle through the first stage. For the National Space Transportation System (NSTS) program these steering commands are called I-loads...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{deals with}} the {{increasing}} need of a more coherent integration between generation and trans-mission system development in restructured electricity markets, where the planning of these two systems is driven by different objectives so resulting in an inevitable conflict between economics and security. On the basis of that, a MATLAB coded {{procedure for the calculation}} of a nodal index called Weighted Transmission <b>Loading</b> <b>Relief</b> factor (WTLR) is developed, in order to obtain an useful means of choosing the most adequate generation and transmis-sion investments in terms of both system security and electricity market efficiency improvement. Furthermore, a metric based on WTLR factors is tested as an helpful instrument that allows to rank the network reinforcements in terms of their impact on congestion mitigation and consequently on market efficiency.

5000|$|Throughout the 1880s, Brayton {{continued}} {{trying to}} improve his engines. In 1887 Brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke direct injection oil engine (US patent #432,114 of 1890, application filed in 1887) The fuel system used a variable quantity pump and liquid fuel high pressure spray type injection. The liquid was forced through a spring <b>loaded</b> <b>relief</b> type valve (injector) which caused the fuel to become divided into small droplets (vaporized). Injection was timed to occur {{at or near the}} peak of the compression stroke. A platinum igniter or ignitor provided the source of ignition. Brayton describes the invention as follows: [...] "I have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder, or in a communicating firing chamber." [...] Another part reads [...] "I have for the first time, so far as my knowledge extends, regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion". This was likely the first engine to use a lean burn system to regulate engine speed / output. In this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed / output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected.|$|R
40|$|A new guidance, steering, {{and control}} concept is {{described}} and evaluated for the Third Phase of an asymmetrical {{configuration of the}} Advanced Launch System (ALS). The study also includes the consideration of trajectory shaping issues and trajectory design {{as well as the}} development of angular rate, angular acceleration, angle of attack, and dynamic pressure estimators. The Third Phase guidance, steering and control system is based on controlling the acceleration-direction of the vehicle after an initial launch maneuver. Unlike traditional concepts, the alignment of the estimated and commanded acceleration-directions is unimpaired by an add-on <b>load</b> <b>relief.</b> Instead, the acceleration-direction steering-control system features a control override that limits the product of estimated dynamic pressure and estimated angle of attack. When this product is not being limited, control is based exclusively on the commanded acceleration-direction without <b>load</b> <b>relief.</b> During limiting, control is based on nulling the error between the limited angle of attack and the estimated angle of attack. This limiting feature provides full freedom to the acceleration-direction steering and control to shape the trajectory within the limit, and also gives full priority to the limiting of angle of attack when necessary.
