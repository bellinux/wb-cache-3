The very idea of social complexity arises out of the historical-comparative methods of early sociologists; obviously, this method is important in developing, defining, and refining the theoretical construct of social complexity.

2500|$|Materialism {{is often}} {{associated}} with reductionism, according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>description,</b> if they are genuine, must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description—typically, at a more reduced level. Non-reductive materialism explicitly rejects this notion, however, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties, or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents. Jerry Fodor influentially argues this view, according to which empirical laws and explanations in [...] "special sciences" [...] like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics. A lot of vigorous literature has grown up around the relation between these views.|$|E

An affirmative example from cognitive neuroscience addresses the relation between neurobiological and mental <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>description.</b> For a particular class of partitions of the underlying neurobiological phase space, so-called generating partitions, the emergent mental states are stable under the dynamics.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{argues that}} Implicit Learning Theories usually adopt one <b>of</b> three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> description: macro-descriptions, phenomenal descriptions, or task-specific descriptions. It {{is argued that}} all three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>description</b> are {{necessary}} and that complete understanding of implicit learning will exist only when explanations from all three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>description</b> are pieced together seamlessly. Chapter 1 reviews several accounts of implicit learning which adopt different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>description.</b> Chapter 2 presents a series of task-specific work on the flanker task {{in which it was}} shown that cross-dimensional contingency learning could occur in some conditions. It is argued that when dimensional maps have unused processing capacity (i. e., when a given dimension has relatively little variation to capture) 2 ̆ 2 cross-talk 2 ̆ 2 between neighboring dimensional maps is possible. It is further argued that the obtained results refuted the theoretical claim of Cohen and Shoup (in press) that 2 ̆ 2 cross-talk 2 ̆ 2 was not possible. Chapter 3 presents a phenomenal framework capable of explaining the implicit learning effects of four commonly used implicit learning paradigms (i. e., flanker tasks, serial learning tasks, control tasks, and artificial grammar tasks). Several advantages of the model are discussed. ...|$|R

We test this theory in a computational model of reading, implementing anatomical features of the visual system. We demonstrate that, when callosal transfer is impaired, the model reads nonwords {{as well as an}} unimpaired model, but reads exception words poorly: a pattern of behaviour similar to surface dyslexia. This computational modelling provides a causal link between brain-based theories of dyslexia to cognitive-level theories that refer specifically to phonological impairments within the reading system...|$|R
