25|$|At Woo-jin's penthouse, Woo-jin {{reveals the}} truth, that Mi-do is Dae-su's daughter. Woo-jin had {{arranged}} their meeting by using hypnosis to guide Dae-su into the sushi restaurant, {{hoping that they}} would fall in <b>love,</b> <b>so</b> that Dae-su might experience the same pain which Woo-jin had. Dae-su attempts to attack Woo-jin but is beaten badly, until Woo-jin intervenes, killing his own bodyguard. Woo-jin proceeds to threaten {{to tell the truth}} to Mi-do, who is being held by Mr. Park in his new prison. Dae-su apologizes for driving Woo-jin's sister to suicide and begs him not to tell Mi-do. When Woo-jin is unimpressed, Dae-su cuts out his own tongue as a symbol of penance. Woo-jin accepts Dae-su's pleading, and tells Mr Park to keep the truth from Mi-do. Woo-jin then boards the elevator, recalls the events of his sister's suicide, and shoots himself {{in the head with a}} Derringer pistol. In the aftermath of the event, Dae-su finds the hypnotist from the prison to erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter, so that they can stay together and have a nice relationship. Mi-do then finds Dae-su and embraces him. Dae-su breaks into a wide smile, which is then slowly replaced by a look of pain, bringing into question whether the hypnosis worked.|$|E
25|$|Outside the Indian subcontinent, in Indonesia, {{a version}} was {{developed}} in ancient Java as Kakawin Bhāratayuddha in the 11th century under the patronage of King Dharmawangsa (990–1016) and later it spread to the neighboring island of Bali, which remains a Hindu majority island today. It has become the fertile source for Javanese literature, dance drama (wayang wong), and wayang shadow puppet performances. This Javanese version of the Mahābhārata differs slightly from the original Indian version. For example, Draupadi is only wed to Yudhishthira, not to all the Pandava brothers; this might demonstrate ancient Javanese opposition to polyandry. The author later added some female characters to be wed to the Pandavas, for example, Arjuna is described as having many wives and consorts next to Subhadra. Another difference is that Shikhandini does not change her sex and remains a woman, to be wed to Arjuna, and takes {{the role of a}} warrior princess during the war. Another twist is that Gandhari is described as antagonistic character who hates the Pandavas: her hate is out of jealousy because during Gandhari's swayamvara, {{she was in love with}} Pandu but was later wed to his blind elder brother instead, whom she did not <b>love,</b> <b>so</b> she blindfolded herself as protest. Another notable difference is the inclusion of the Punakawans, the clown servants of the main characters in the storyline. These characters include Semar, Petruk, Gareng and Bagong, who are much-loved by Indonesian audiences. There are also some spin-off episodes developed in ancient Java, such as Arjunawiwaha composed in 11th century.|$|E

500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked.

[...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true <b>love,</b> <b>so</b> she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|E

500|$|Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and {{executive}} producer Ray Winninger had experience developing both tabletop games and video games. One of the studio's motivations for developing the game was to combine the two mediums, with Winninger explaining [...] "One of the spaces we're interested in exploring at Harebrained, and Golem is the first effort, is how can we take those tabletop games that we know and <b>love</b> <b>so</b> much and leverage technology to enhance that experience in some way." [...] Weisman and Winninger also stressed the social nature of the game. Winninger, comparing Golem Arcana to Skylanders, another game with both physical and digital components, stressed that Golem Arcana was less focused on components and more focused on the social experience. Weisman pointed to his disappointment that [...] "kids' idea of playing together after school these days usually means just meeting online from their own houses" [...] in stressing that participants playing {{against each other in}} Golem Arcana would do so face-to-face.|$|E
500|$|Her early poems usually {{picture a}} man and a woman {{involved}} in the most poignant, ambiguous moment of their relationship, much imitated and later parodied by Nabokov and others. Critic Roberta Reeder notes that the early poems always attracted large numbers of admirers: [...] "For Akhmatova was able to capture and convey the vast range of evolving emotions experienced in a love affair, from the first thrill of meeting, to a deepening love contending with hatred, and eventually to violent destructive passion or total indifference. But [...] her poetry marks a radical break with the erudite, ornate style and the mystical representation of <b>love</b> <b>so</b> typical of poets like Alexander Blok and Andrey Bely. Her lyrics are composed of short fragments of simple speech that do not form a logical coherent pattern. Instead, they reflect the way we actually think, the links between the images are emotional, and simple everyday objects are charged with psychological associations. Like Alexander Pushkin, who was her model in many ways, Akhmatova was intent on conveying worlds of meaning through precise details." ...|$|E
