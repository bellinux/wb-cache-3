In <b>lactating</b> <b>ruminants,</b> the SCD 1 protein is highly {{expressed}} in the mammary gland and is relevant for the fatty acid composition of milk and dairy products. Bovine mammary epithelial cells (BME-UV 1), cultured in vitro, have been proposed as a model to reproduce the biology of the mammary gland.

A luciferase-based reporter assay was used to monitor the transcriptional activity of the SCD 1 promoter region in BME-UV 1 cells treated or not with insulin and/or oleic acid. The level of endogenous SCD 1 mRNA was evaluated by Real time PCR. Insulin (20  ng/mL) induced a 2. 0 to 2. 5 -fold increase of SCD 1 promoter activity. Additionally, the effect of insulin was inhibited by oleic acid, serum components, and NFY enforced expression.

5000|$|Livestock include beef cattle, dairy cattle, horses, goats, {{sheep and}} llamas. There is no {{specific}} requirement of feed intake for each livestock because their feed continuously varies based on the animals’ age, sex, breed, environment, etc. However basic nutrient requirement of a livestock’s feed must consist of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Dairy cattle need more energy in their feed than other type of cattle. Studies have shown that energy supplied by feed is provided by various carbohydrate sources include non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) such as fermentable feeds or neutral detergent fiber (NDF) such as forage. Feeds with high NDF is good for rumen health, however provides less energy and vice versa. Fats are added in the livestock feed to increase energy concentration, especially when the NFC content is already too high since excessive NFC lessens the NDF fraction, affecting the rumen digestion. In ruminants, most proteins consumed are breakdown by microorganisms and the microorganism later get digested by the small intestine. The [...] suggested that the crude protein required in livestock feed should be less than 7%. <b>Lactating</b> <b>ruminant</b> especially dairy cattle require highest amount of protein, especially for milk synthesis.

40|$|Background Brucellosis is a {{worldwide}} zoonosis with {{significant impact on}} rural livelihoods and a potentially underestimated contributor to febrile illnesses. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in humans and small ruminants in The Gambia. Methods The study was carried out in rural and urban areas. In 12 rural villages in Kiang West district, sera were collected from humans (n = 599) and small ruminants (n = 623) from the same compounds. From <b>lactating</b> small <b>ruminants,</b> milk samples and vaginal swabs were obtained. At the urban study sites, sera were collected from small ruminants (n = 500) from slaughterhouses and livestock markets. Information on possible risk factors for seropositivity was collected through questionnaires. Sera were screened for antibodies against Brucella spp. with the Rose Bengal Test, ELISA and Micro Agglutination Test (human sera only). PCR was performed on 10 percent of the milk samples and vaginal swabs from small ruminants. Results One human and 14 sheep sera were positive by the Rose Bengal Test. The rest were negative in all serological tests used. The PCR results were all negative.

A total of 390 lactating animals comprising 255 goats and 135 sheep {{were randomly selected from}} population and screened for evidence of subclinical mastitis. The overall prevalence of subclinical mastitis was found to be 18. 03 % (46 / 255) and 28. 14 % (38 / 135) in goats and sheep, respectively. California mastitis test (CMT) positive milk samples were subjected to bacteriological examination and the following bacteria were isolated; coagulase negative Staphylococcus (44. 7 %), Staphylococcus aureus (27. 7 %), Escherchia coli (17. 0 %) and streptococci (10. 63 %). Risk factors; species (p = 0. 021), study site (p < 0. 001), sheep breed (p = 0. 018) and goat breed (p = 0. 009) showed statistically significant association with the occurrence of subclinical mastitis in small dairy ruminants. However, there was no statistically significant association between risk factors such as Age (p = 0. 779), parity (p = 0. 201) and stage of lactation (p = 0. 952). Therefore, it can be concluded that mastitis is a significant disease in small ruminants that affects their productivity and measures need to be taken to control the disease. [Vet.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} produce {{intrinsically}} L-[1 - 13 C]phenylalanine labeled milk and beef for subsequent use in human nutrition research. The {{collection of the}} various organ tissues after slaughter allowed for us to gain insight into the dynamics of tissue protein turnover in vivo in a lactating dairy cow. One lactating dairy cow received a constant infusion of L-[1 - 13 C]phenylalanine (450 µmol/min) for 96 h. Plasma and milk were collected prior to, during, and after the stable isotope infusion. Twenty-four hours after cessation of the infusion the cow was slaughtered. The meat and samples of the various organ tissues (liver, heart, lung, udder, kidney, rumen, small intestine, and colon) were collected and stored. Approximately 210 kg of intrinsically labeled beef (bone and fat free) with an average L-[1 - 13 C]phenylalanine enrichment of 1. 8 ± 0. 1 mole percent excess (MPE) was obtained. The various organ tissues differed substantially in L-[1 - 13 C]phenylalanine enrichments in the tissue protein bound pool, the highest enrichment levels were achieved in the kidney (11. 7 MPE) and the lowest enrichment levels in the skeletal muscle tissue protein of the cow (between 1. 5 – 2. 4 MPE). The estimated protein synthesis rates of the various organ tissues {{should be regarded as}} underestimates, particularly for the organs with the higher turnover rates and high secretory activity, due to the lengthened (96 h) measurement period necessary for the production of the intrinsically labeled beef. Our data demonstrates that there are relatively small differences in L-[1 - 13 C]phenylalanine enrichments between the various meat cuts, but substantial higher enrichment values are observed in the various organ tissues. We conclude that protein turnover rates of various organs are much higher when compared to skeletal muscle protein turnover rates in large <b>lactating</b> <b>ruminants...</b>|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the role of insulin in milk protein production in pasture-fed <b>lactating</b> <b>ruminants</b> (ewes and cows), using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (HEC) technique. Three experiments were carried out. In the first 2 experiments, the response of pasture-fed ewes and dairy cows to the HEC were established and compared to concentrate-fed ruminants (dairy cows and goats). Use of the HEC technique in pasture-fed ruminants did not result in an increase in milk protein yield or concentration. However, a reduction in feed intake along with maintenance of milk protein yield resulted in a change in efficiency of utilisation of dietary crude protein for milk protein production. This indicated that changes in blood insulin could result in changes in nutrient partitioning to maintain milk protein production. In Experiment 3, mechanisms were examined that could maintain milk protein production despite a reduction in feed intake. The arterio-venous concentration difference technique and a leucine tracer infusion were used to measure amino acid (AA) uptake and subsequent metabolism for milk protein production under conditions imposed by the HEC. This experiment demonstrated that the HEC reduced AA supply to the mammary gland and there was a decrease in the uptake of some AA. There was no increase in mammary blood flow to compensate for this. The deficit in the ratio of AA uptake to their secretion in milk protein suggests the use of plasma free AA concentrations underestimates uptake of AA by the mammary gland and there are contributions by alternative sources such as peptide AA and erythrocytes. There was no decrease in leucine oxidation in the mammary gland, indicating that AA were not conserved for milk protein production through an alteration in this mechanism. These results support the theory that the mammary gland has the ability to respond to modified precursor supply to maintain milk protein output...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the effects of supplementing rumen-protected choline (RPC) on metabolic profile, selected liver constituents and transcript levels of selected enzymes, transcription factors and nuclear receptors involved in mammary lipid metabolism in dairy goats. Eight healthy lactating goats were studied: four received no choline supplementation (CTR group) and four received 4 g RPC chloride/day (RPC group). The treatment was administered individually starting 4 weeks before expected kidding and continuing for 4 weeks after parturition. In {{the first month of}} lactation, milk yield and composition were measured weekly. On days 7, 14, 21 and 27 of lactation, blood samples were collected and analysed for glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids and cholesterol. On day 28 of lactation, samples of liver and mammary gland tissue were obtained. Liver tissue was analysed for total lipid and DNA content; mammary tissue was analysed for transcripts of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS), sterol regulatory binding proteins 1 and 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and liver X receptor alpha. Milk yield was very similar in the two groups, but R PC goats had lower (P < 0. 05) plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate. The total lipid content of liver was unaffected (P = 0. 890), but the total lipid/DNA ratio was lower (both P < 0. 05) in RPC than CTR animals. Choline had no effect on the expression of the mammary gland transcripts involved in lipid metabolism. The current plasma and liver data indicate that choline has a positive effect on liver lipid metabolism, whereas it appears to have little effect on transcript levels in mammary gland of various proteins involved in lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, the current results were obtained from a limited number of animals, and choline requirement and function in <b>lactating</b> dairy <b>ruminants</b> deserve further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{persistent}} organic pollutants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are of {{risk for the}} human health because {{of their ability to}} accumulate in food and their highly toxic properties, especially for the brain. Recent findings demonstrate that these contaminants can be found in significant quantities in the milk of <b>lactating</b> women and <b>ruminants,</b> suggesting a greater danger for milk consumers like newborns and infants. Thus, the objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the neurobehavioural toxicity of a chronic administration of PCB-contaminated cow milk in adult rats. Two groups of Wistar male rats (n = 10) were used. The "treated" group was daily administered by gavage with 0. 5 ml/ 100 g b. w. of PCB-contaminated milk for 90 days, which corresponded to daily intake concentrations of "dioxin-like PCBs" and "non dioxin-like PCBs" of 1. 8 pg TEQOMS and 6. 1 ng per kg bodyweight, respectively. In parallel, the control animals received the same volume of a commercial milk preparation. At the end of the period of exposure, the animals were tested for their behavioural performances related to activity in the open-field, locomotor coordination in the Locotronic®, anxiety in the elevated-plus maze, and spatial learning and memory in the T-maze and the eight-arm maze. The results showed a significant decrease in general activity of rats that were fed with PCB-contaminated milk in several tests like the open-field, the elevated plus maze, and the T-maze, whereas the body weight, the level of anxiety, the learning performances and the locomotor coordination were unaffected by PCBs.

40|$|It is {{an often}} overlooked, but vital, {{research}} question {{to understand how}} what is fed to food-producing animals ultimately affects quality and consumer acceptability of food products produced by those animals. Of interest in recent years, particularly in the Midwest, has been the effect of inclusion of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) in the rations of lactating dairy cows on milk and cheese quality. Because of the high unsaturated oil content of DDGS, feeding DDGS to dairy cows could potentially lead to decreased oxidative stability of milk and cheese and {{also contribute to the}} late blowing of eyes in Swiss type cheeses. Therefore, it was of interest to investigate if feeding full-fat DDGS (~ 13 % fat) would result in increased development of off-flavors in milk and could result in milk that was unsuitable for use in baby Swiss cheese production. Additionally, the recent development of reduced-fat DDGS (RF-DDGS) (~ 6 % fat) offers the possibility of feeding increased amounts of DDGS, compared to feeding full-fat DDGS, without adversely affecting milk and milk fat production. Because of the possibility of higher rates of inclusion of RF- DDGS in the rations of dairy cows than was possible with full-fat DDGS, it was necessary to investigate the effects of feeding RF-DDGS on milk production efficiency and the quality of milk for the production of baby Swiss cheese. Finally, feedstuffs containing high concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids, in particular DDGS, can adversely affect the quality of pork fat, potentially resulting in pork that is unacceptable to the producer and consumer. Specific project summaries are described in the subsequent pages. Quality of Milk from Lactating Dairy Cattle Fed Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of feeding DDGS to healthy mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows (n= 24) on production parameters and flavor and oxidative stability of milk. Cows were assigned to two groups and fed one of three treatment diets (0 % DDGS, 10 % DDGS, 25 % DDGS by dry matter (DM)) as an isocaloric total mixed ration. Each group was fed all three diets after a wash-out period of 7 days. Milk yield was unaffected by both the 0 % and 10 % DDGS diets but decreased significantly when fed the 25 % DDGS diet. The quality of milk from cows fed DDGS was characterized through chemical analyses profiling fatty acids and analyzing milk composition. Rumen volatile fatty acids were unaffected by treatment. Milk protein and solids-not-fat (SNF) increased with increasing inclusion of DDGS, but milk fat decreased concomitantly. Milk fatty acid composition, on a weight percent basis, was significantly affected; cows fed higher concentrations of DDGS produced milk with higher concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids. An assessment of milk quality by a trained sensory panel showed no effect of dietary treatment on milk oxidative stability or milk flavor. The results of this study indicate that feeding of DDGS to lactating dairy cows, under controlled conditions, does not negatively affect milk oxidative stability or flavor; feeding 25 % DDGS, however, did negatively impact milk production and changed the milk fatty acid profile. Lactational Performance of Lactating Holstein Dairy Cows Fed Full-Fat and Reduced-Fat Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles Our objective was to evaluate production performance of lactating Holstein dairy cows fed two different dietary concentrations of full-fat DDGS (13. 6 % fat). Thirty cows were fed 0, 10, and 20 % DDGS (DM basis) as a total mixed ration (TMR) in a 3 ÃÂÃÂ 3 crossover. Cows were stratified into groups of 10 by parity and days in milk and fed each of three diets in three 28 -day periods. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that feeding 20 % DDGS (DM basis) would negatively influence production and feed efficiency of dairy cattle. Milk yield was decreased significantly when fed 20 % DDGS, and feeding DDGS caused milk fat depression and decreased daily fat yield, resulting in significant decreases in 3. 5 % fat-corrected milk (FCM) yield and energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield. Both protein and lactose percentages increased significantly when cows were fed 20 % DDGS; neither protein nor lactose yield, however, was significantly affected. Protein efficiency, a measure of the utilization of dietary protein for milk protein synthesis, decreased significantly for cows fed 20 % DDGS, likely resulting from heat-damaged protein, as indicated by proximate analyses. All three measures of energetic efficiency (ECM/DMI, kg ECM/net energy for lactation (NEL) intake (Mcal) and gross energy of milk produced (Mcal) /NEL caloric intake (Mcal)) were significantly decreased when cows were fed 20 % DDGS but not when cows were fed 10 % DDGS. These results indicate that, with the exception of an approximate loss of milk fat of 0. 5 % percentage points, full-fat DDGS used in this study can be effectively fed at 10 % without a loss in production performance when compared with a traditional TMR. Feeding the full-fat DDGS at 20 %, however, is not advisable. In contrast with results from feeding FF-DDGS, negative effects of feeding RF-DDGS to lactating dairy cows did not occur when 36 multiparous and mid lactation Holstein dairy cows were fed either 0 or 20 % reduced-fat DDGS (RF-DDGS) in a 2 ÃÂÃÂ 2 crossover design. Cows were assigned randomly to treatment groups and were fed individually to allow for collection of feed intake data. Feeding RF-DDGS as 20 % DM of a TMR supplemented with rumen-protected lysine did not negatively influence production parameters related to milk composition or nutritional physiology of the cow. Milk urea nitrogen (MUN) was, however, decreased, and milk protein percentage was increased. Total milk solids concentration were not influenced by inclusion of RF-DDGS. Additionally, RF-DDGS did cause a decrease in FCM efficiency as a result of an increase in DMI. When ECM efficiency was calculated (accounting for fat, protein, and lactose concentration in milk), no difference in feed efficiency resulted. These data indicate that RF-DDGS can be included effectively in rations of multiparous lactating dairy cows, at least when supplemented with lysine. Additionally, decreased MUN and increased milk protein percentage indicate that dietary protein utilization may be improved by including RF-DDGS as a protein source in the ration, presumably because DDGS are generally considered to be a good source of rumen undegradable protein. Taken together, these results indicate that RF-DDGS may be an attractive feed ingredient for 20 % inclusion in <b>lactating</b> <b>ruminant</b> diet. Reduced-Fat Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles Did Not Reduce Quality of Baby Swiss Cheese Thirty-six multiparous and mid lactation Holstein dairy cows were fed either 0 or 20 % reduced-fat DDGS (RF-DDGS) in a 2 ÃÂÃÂ 2 crossover design. Cheeses were produced a total of six times from each treatment. In this experiment, feeding RF-DDGS as 20 % DM of a total mixed ration (TMR) supplemented with lysine did not negatively influence flavor attributes of baby Swiss cheese. Eye appearance in all cheeses was atypical but was not related to diet. Any defects in appearance of Baby Swiss cheese appeared in both control and RF-DDGS fed cows. The results indicate that lactating Holstein dairy cows can be fed RF-DDGS as 20 % DM of a TMR without negatively affecting usability of milk, when compared with control, for production of Baby Swiss cheese. Relationship of Fat Quality and Meat Quality Traits of Fresh Pork Feeding distillers grains to pigs can lead to undesirable traits in meat quality that adversely affect both consumer acceptability and the ability of the processor to produce high quality pork products. Additionally, interest has been expressed by both processors and the research community about how fat quality varies among anatomical locations. Barrows and gilts (n= 347) of five purebred lines and one commercial crossbred line were fed commercial swine diets with FF-DDGS inclusion at 30 % of DM. For the final 30 days of feeding, DDGS were removed from the diet. Pigs were harvested at a minimal weight of 111. 4 kg. At harvest, fat was collected from the back, belly, and jowl, and meat samples were taken from the longissimus muscle for evaluation of fat and meat quality characteristics. Jowl fat iodine values were significant predictors of back and belly fat iodine values, and increases in iodine value of the fat of the pork chop were moderately and negatively correlated with several measures of meat quality. This study demonstrates that iodine value of fat from one anatomical location (i. e., back and belly) is related to iodine value of a less valuable anatomical location (i. e., jowl); additionally, increases in iodine value correlate negatively with predictors of meat quality...|$|R
40|$|Fat is an {{important}} constituent contributing to the organoleptic, processing and physical properties of ruminant milk. Understanding the regulation of milk fat synthesis {{is central to the}} development of nutritional strategies to enhance the nutritional value of milk, decrease milk energy secretion and improve the energy balance of <b>lactating</b> <b>ruminants.</b> Nutrition is the major environmental factor regulating the concentration and composition of fat in ruminant milk. Feeding low-fibre/high-starch diets and/or lipid supplements rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids induce milk fat depression (MFD) in the bovine, typically increase milk fat secretion in the caprine, whereas limited data in sheep suggest that the responses are more similar to the goat than the cow. Following the observation that reductions in milk fat synthesis during diet-induced MFD are associated with increases in the concentration of specific trans fatty acids in milk, the biohydrogenation theory of MFD was proposed, which attributes the causal mechanism to altered ruminal lipid metabolism leading to increased formation of specific biohydrogenation intermediates that exert anti-lipogenic effects. Trans- 10, cis- 12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is the only biohydrogenation intermediate to have been infused at the abomasum over a range of experimental doses (1. 25 to 14. 0 g/day) and shown unequivocally to inhibit milk fat synthesis in ruminants. However, increases in ruminal trans- 10, cis- 12 CLA formation do not explain entirely diet-induced MFD, suggesting that other biohydrogenation intermediates and/or other mechanisms may also be involved. Experiments involving abomasal infusions (g/day) in lactating cows have provided evidence that cis- 10, trans- 12 CLA (1. 2), trans- 9, cis- 11 CLA (5. 0) and trans- 10 18 : 1 (92. 1) may also exert anti-lipogenic effects. Use of molecular-based approaches have demonstrated that mammary abundance of transcripts encoding for key lipogenic genes are reduced during MFD in the bovine, changes that are accompanied by decrease in sterol response element binding protein 1 (SREBP 1) and alterations in the expression of genes related to the SREBP 1 pathway. Recent studies indicate that transcription of one or more adipogenic genes is increased in subcutaneous adipose tissue in cows during acute or chronic MFD. Feeding diets of similar composition do not induce MFD or substantially alter mammary lipogenic gene expression in the goat. The available data suggests that variation in mammary fatty acid secretion and lipogenic responses to changes in diet composition between ruminants reflect inherent interspecies differences in ruminal lipid metabolism and mammary specific regulation of cellular processes and key lipogenic enzymes involved in the synthesis of milk fat triacylglycerides.

Effects on nutrient intake, ewe and lamb live weight changes, milk yield and composition, and nitrogen (N) balance were assessed. Nine abomasally cannulated lactating 4 year-old Coopworth ewes with mean initial weight of 66. 41 ± 5. 90 kg each suckling twin lambs with initial litter weight of 5. 72 ± 1. 22 kg were used. All ewes were fed the same basal diets in 12 equals meals at 2 -hour interval. Treatments consisted of abomasal infusions of water (control), casein (150 g/d), and ammonia (85 g/d) in two periods with a carry-over design. Lambs were fed with milk from their own mothers throughout the experimental periods and also given {{the same amount of}} 200 g/d of creep feed in the second period. Ewe dry matter intakes and live weight gain (LWG) were not different between treatments. Lamb LWG was lowest in the ammonia group (p< 0. 05). Casein infusion tended to increase (p< 0. 10) mean milk yield by 33 % while ammonia infusion tended (p< 0. 10) to reduce it by 15 % of that of control. Milk fat yield was lower (p< 0. 05) in the casein group while no differences were found in milk protein, lactose, total solids, and solid non fat (SNF) yields. Ewes in the ammonia group had the lowest milk protein (p< 0. 05), highest fat (p< 0. 01), and lowest milk SNF concentrations. Milk lactose and total solids concentrations were not affected by treatments. Dry matter and organic matter digestibilities, digestible dry matter and digestible organic matter intakes were not different between treatments. Casein and ammonia treatments increased N digestibilities (p< 0. 05) and slightly increased N intake (p< 0. 10). Nitrogen retention per kg metabolic weight was highest in the ammonia group (P< 0. 05). The efficiencies of absorbed N utilisation for milk protein synthesis were higher in the control and casein groups (P< 0. 05) while that for body protein synthesis was higher in the ammonia group (P< 0. 05). Compared to ewes in the control group, those in the ammonia group showed a higher preference for partitioning the absorbed N into body protein synthesis by about 17 % (P< 0. 05) and a lower preference for partitioning the absorbed N into milk protein synthesis by about 20 % (P< 0. 05). No differences in the partitioning of absorbed N between body and milk protein syntheses were found between the control and casein groups. It was concluded that the form of excess N (ammonia vs amino acids) differentially affects the partitioning of nutrients between milk production and body weight change in <b>lactating</b> <b>ruminants...</b>|$|E

Oral {{administration}} of cobalt acetate alters milk fatty acid composition, consistent with an inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase in lactating ewes. Journal of Dairy Science, 97 (2), 1036 - 1046 Previous investigations {{have shown that}} cobalt (Co) modifies milk fat composition in cattle, consistent with an inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity, but it remains unclear whether other ruminant species are also affected. The present study {{examined the effects of}} oral {{administration of}} Co acetate on intake, rumen function, and milk production and fatty acid (FA) composition in sheep. Twenty lactating Assaf ewes were allocated into 1 of 4 groups and used in a continuous randomized block design that involved a 15 -d adaptation, a 6 -d treatment, and a 10 -d posttreatment period. During the treatment period, animals received an oral drench supplying 0 (control), 3 (Co 3), 6 (Co 6), and 9 (Co 9) mg of Co/kg of BW per day, administered in 3 equal doses at 8 -h intervals. Cobalt acetate had no influence on intake or milk fat and protein concentrations, whereas treatments Co 6 and Co 9 tended to lower milk yield. Results on rumen parameters showed no effects on rumen fermentation, FA composition, or bacterial community structure. Administration of Co acetate decreased milk concentrations of FA containing a cis- 9 double bond and SCD product:substrate ratios, consistent with an inhibition of SCD activity in the ovine mammary gland. Temporal changes in milk fat composition indicated that the effects of treatments were evident within 3 d of dosing, with further changes being apparent after 6 d and reverting to pretreatment values by d 6 after administration. Effect on milk FA composition did not differ substantially in response to incremental doses of Co acetate. On average, Co decreased milk cis- 9 10 : 1 / 10 : 0, cis- 9 12 : 1 / 12 : 0, cis- 9 14 : 1 / 14 : 0, cis- 9 16 : 1 / 16 : 0, cis- 9 17 : 1 / 17 : 0, cis- 9 18 : 1 / 18 : 0, and cis- 9,trans- 11 18 : 2 /trans- 11 18 : 1 concentration ratios by 30, 32, 38, 33, 21, 24, and 25 %, respectively. Changes in milk fat cis- 9 10 : 1, cis- 9 12 : 1, and cis- 9 14 : 1 concentrations to Co treatment indicated that 51 % of cis- 9 18 : 1 and cis- 9,trans- 11 18 : 2 secreted in milk originated from Delta(9) -desaturation. In conclusion, results demonstrated the potential of oral Co administration for the estimation of endogenous synthesis of FA containing a cis- 9 double bond in the mammary gland of <b>lactating</b> <b>ruminants.</b> Indirect comparisons suggest that the effects of Co differ between sheep and cattle. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{comprised}} of field survey, agronomic trial, laboratory and animal evaluation of desho grass. A total of 240 households (hh) {{were involved in}} the field survey conducted to assess the status of desho grass production and utilization in Burie Zuria and Doyogena districts, with the use of pre-tested and semi- structured questionnaire. The grass was planted at mid and highland altitudes using vegetative root splits in randomized complete block design {{to determine the effects of}} altitude and harvesting dates (90, 120 and 150 days after planting) on morphology, dry matter (DM) yield and chemical composition of desho grass. Feeding & digestibility trials were conducted using 25 Washera yearling rams with mean body weight of 19. 4 + 1. 89 kg in randomized complete block design to evaluate the feed potential of desho grass as a basal diet. The dietary treatments studied were; 100 % Natural Pasture Hay (NPH) (T 1), 75 % NPH+ 25 % Desho Grass Hay (DGH) (T 2), 50 % NPH + 50 % DGH (T 3), 25 % NPH+ 75 % DGH (T 4), and 100 % DGH (T 5). All the treatment groups were supplemented with 300 g/h DM of concentrate & data on feed intake, daily body weight gain, feed conversion efficiency & fecal samples were collected during the 90 and 7 days of feeding and digestibility trial respectively. The field survey data were analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics and probit model using SAS 9. 2. The agronomic characteristics and laboratory analytical data were subjected to two-way ANOVA and correlation analysis of SAS 9. 2. Animal evaluation data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA of SAS. Tukey’s Honest Significant Test was used to separate means that showed significant difference. The results of the field survey revealed that the mean landholding, livestock holding and family size of the respondents was 0. 95 hectare, 3. 56 tropical livestock units and 6. 5 persons/hh, respectively. The proportion of farmers who use desho grass as a feed were 60 % and 35 % use it for more than one purpose including feed. About 42, 3 and 53 % of the respondents reported that they feed desho grass to <b>lactating</b> cattle, small <b>ruminants</b> and to all livestock species respectively. There was significant positive correlation (P< 0. 01) between experience of desho grass production practice and utilization for different purposes in the study areas. About 43 % of desho grass producers have received training on desho grass production and utilization. The utilization of the grass for many purposes is not well practiced by many farmers, due to in adequate extension services and lack of training. The results of the agronomic trials indicated that leaf length per plant (LLPP) of the grass planted in mid altitude (28. 98 cm) was greater than that (21. 81 cm) planted in the high altitude. Highest harvesting date significantly increased (P< 0. 05) plant height (PH), number of tillers per plant (NTPP), number of leaves per plant (NLPP), leaf length per plant (LLPP) and re-growth dates (RGD). The DM yield of desho grass significantly increased, while crude protein (CP) content significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) as the harvesting date increased from 90 to 150 days. Agronomic results xviii revealed that desho grass performs well both in mid and high altitude areas and represent potential livestock feed resource at early stage (90 to 120 days after planting) of feeding. The daily DM intake and mean daily body gain of the experimental sheep showed significant improvement (P< 0. 05) with increased level of inclusion of desho grass into the basal ration. The digestibility coefficient of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF were significantly different (P< 0. 05) among the treatments (in the order of T 1 <T 2 <T 3 <T 4 <T 5). The result of the feeding trial indicated that desho grass hay could safely be included at 50 - 100 % into small ruminant basal ration at the expense of natural pasture hay in Ethiopia. The grass performed well in both mid and highlands, multifunctional in use and appropriate for smallholder farming systems of the country...|$|R
