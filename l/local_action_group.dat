40|$|Abstract. The European Union Leader {{initiative}} {{is an important}} chance for the development and tightening of the rural-urban continuum in Romania. Fundamental elements of this initiative are the <b>local</b> <b>action</b> <b>groups.</b> These <b>local</b> <b>action</b> <b>groups</b> are conceived rather as an ad hoc framework for exchanging ideas, for debate on matters of local interest, on initiatives to boost economic activities. Thus, these local partnership structures can be self-organized by very real problems and directions: to promote a brand of product made in a certain area, {{the image of a}} tourist attraction, of traditional occupations, crafts of products etc. This paper aims to highlight the difficulties of economic progress for the Romanian rural area, considering that the Leader initiative would be a good opportunity to accelerate this process. To emphasize this, a review of the dimension of the Romanian rural problem was done. Also, I examined how specific indicators and official recommendations have stimulated the initiatives for organizing <b>local</b> <b>action</b> <b>groups.</b> Finally, arguments in favour of <b>local</b> <b>action</b> <b>groups</b> as the solution to the rural problem of Romania are provided...|$|R

40|$|Romania has {{the highest}} share of EU rural areas (44. 9 %), which generates and {{maintains}} {{a long series of}} regional disparities. Because of these disparities, the economy faces a number of elements that undermine the quality of human and social capital and reduces the potential for growth: precarious social and economic infrastructure, reduced access to markets and thus to goods, a low level of both economic cohesion and living standards, and a difficult access to education and training. During the communist era, a forcefully reduction of the rural share was undertaken through various means, most often destructive. Even the transition to a market economy has failed to improve the situation because, in recent years, the urban-rural migration flows have surpassed the rural-urban flows making the too large rural share problem to block the structural changes needed on one hand to modernize the economy, {{and on the other hand}} for the European integration. When analyzing the use structure of work resources we observe even greater differences, especially on account of population employed in agriculture. From this perspective, the authors consider that the program impact of sustaining <b>local</b> <b>action</b> <b>groups,</b> LEADER+, extends beyond the horizon of the National Plan of Rural Development, tending to a medium or even long run, when the rural problem of Romania can be solved. Thus the <b>local</b> <b>action</b> <b>groups</b> can contribute to urban areas revitalization and development, through the promotion of economic activities in adjacent rural areas in a manner similar to LÃ¶sch's theory. The authors effectuate a diagnosis of the Romanian rural problem and its negative effects.
