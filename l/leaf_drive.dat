40|$|A size-structured plant {{population}} model is developed {{to study the}} evolution of pathogen-induced leaf shedding under various environmental conditions. The evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) of the leaf shedding rate is determined for two scenarios: i) a constant leaf shedding strategy and ii) an infection load <b>driven</b> <b>leaf</b> shedding strategy. The model predicts that ESS leaf shedding rates increase with nutrient availability. No effect of plant density on the ESS leaf shedding rate is found even though disease severity increases with plant density. When auto-infection, that is increased infection due to spores produced on the plant itself, {{plays a key role}} in further disease increase on the plant, shedding leaves removes disease that would otherwise contribute to disease increase on the plant itself. Consequently leaf shedding responses to infections may evolve. When external infection, that is infection due to immigrant spores, is the key determinant, shedding a leaf does not reduce the force of infection on the leaf shedding plant. In this case leaf shedding will not evolve. Under a low external disease pressure adopting an infection <b>driven</b> <b>leaf</b> shedding strategy is more efficient than adopting a constant leaf shedding strategy, since a plant adopting an infection <b>driven</b> <b>leaf</b> shedding strategy does not shed any leaves in the absence of infection, even when leaf shedding rates are high. A plant adopting a constant leaf shedding rate sheds the same amount of leaves regardless of the presence of infection. Based on the results we develop two hypotheses that can be tested if the appropriate plant material is available...|$|R

40|$|In fireprone ecosystems, two {{important}} alternative fates for leaves are burning in a wildfire (when alive or as litter) or they get consumed (as litter) by decomposers. The influence of leaf traits on litter decomposition rate is reasonably well understood. In contrast, less {{is known about}} the influence of leaf traits on leaf and litter flammability. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to determine which morphological and chemical <b>leaf</b> traits <b>drive</b> flammability and (ii) to determine whether different (combinations of) morphological and chemical <b>leaf</b> traits <b>drive</b> interspecific variation in decomposition and litter flammability and, in turn, help us understand the relationship between decomposability and flammability. To explore the relationships between leaf traits and flammability of individual leaves, we used 32 evergreen perennial plant species from eastern Australia in standardized experimental burns on three types of leaf material (i. e. fresh, dried and senesced). Next, we compared these trait-flammability relationships to trait-decomposability relationships as obtained from a previous decomposition experiment (focusing on senesced leaves only). Within the three parameters of leaf flammability that we measured, interspecific variation in time to ignition was mainly explained by specific leaf area and moisture content. Flame duration and smoulder duration were mostly explained by leaf dry mass and to a lesser degree by leaf chemistry, namely, nitrogen, phosphorus and tannin concentrations. The variation in the decomposition constant across species was unrelated to our measures of flammability. Moreover, different combinations of morphological and chemical leaf properties underpinned the interspecific variation in decomposability and flammability. In contrast to litter flammability, decomposability was driven by lignin and phosphorus concentrations. The decoupling of flammability and decomposability leads to three possible scenarios for species' influence on litter fates: (i) fast-decomposing species for which flammability is irrelevant because there will not be enough litter to support a fire; (ii) species with slow-decomposing leaves and a high flammability; and (iii) species with slow-decomposing leaves and a low flammability. We see potential for making use of the decoupled trait-decomposition-flammability relationships when modelling carbon and nutrient fluxes. Including information on leaf traits in models can improve the prediction of fire behaviour. We note that herbivory is another key fate for leaves, but this study was focused on fire and decomposition...|$|R

40|$|The Hyrcanian {{forests in}} the Northern Iran are {{originally}} poor of coniferous and are considered as a refugium of temperate broad-leaved trees during the Quaternary glaciations. In this study mass loss and nutrients dynamic of Norway spruce needles when combined with oriental beech litter was investigated in a 50 -year plantation of pure Norway spruce in the Hyrcanian forests. The litter bags technique was used to monitor the mass loss and nutrients concentration after 60, 120, 180, 270 and 400 days. The results showed that when decomposed alone the mass loss rate of spruce needles was generally lower than what reported in Europe. However, when combined with oriental beech litter the mass loss rate was hastened compared to when decomposed alone. A positive non-additive effect of beech leaf litter was observed on spruce nutrients dynamic. The concentration of N, P, K, and Mg in combined spruce needles with beech litter was generally higher compared to when spruce needles decomposed alone during decomposition time. While the concentration of Mn and Ca in combined spruce needles with beech litter was generally higher than when spruce needles decomposed alone. At {{the end of the}} decomposition period the release of Mn and N was significantly higher in combined spruce needles than when it decomposed alone.

40|$|Our limited {{understanding}} of the climate controls on tropical forest seasonality {{is one of the}} biggest sources of uncertainty in modeling climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Combining leaf production, litterfall and climate observations from satellite and ground data in the Amazon forest, we show that seasonal variation in leaf production is largely triggered by climate signals, specifically, insolation increase (70. 4 % of the total area) and precipitation increase (29. 6 %). Increase of insolation <b>drives</b> <b>leaf</b> growth in the absence of water limitation. For these non-water-limited forests, the simultaneous leaf flush occurs in a sufficient proportion of the trees to be observed from space. While tropical cycles are generally defined in terms of dry or wet season, we show that for a large part of Amazonia the increase in insolation triggers the visible progress of leaf growth, just like during spring in temperate forests. The dependence of leaf growth initiation on climate seasonality may result in a higher sensitivity of these ecosystems to changes in climate than previously thought. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
