5|$|On the one hand, {{there is}} <b>little</b> <b>question</b> {{that they are}} most closely related to three other {{families}} of streamlined, surface water fishes: the flyingfishes, needlefishes, and sauries. Traditionally, these four families {{have been taken to}} together comprise the order Beloniformes. The halfbeaks and flyingfishes are considered to form one group, the superfamily Exocoetoidea, and the needlefishes and sauries another, the superfamily Scomberesocoidea.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{discussed}} potential nominees is Paul Henderson, who scored the winning goal in the final moments of the deciding eighth game of the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union. This {{is one of the}} best-known moments in hockey and Canadian sports history. While there is <b>little</b> <b>question</b> of the historical significance of that goal, Henderson's NHL statistics are not at a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction. His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists.|$|E
5|$|The John Bull had {{remained}} on static display for another 15 years, but the locomotive's significance {{as one of}} the oldest locomotives in existence, or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey, was not very plainly noted in the display's literature. As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very <b>little</b> <b>question</b> that special publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be so much more than that.|$|E
5000|$|Five <b>Little</b> <b>Questions</b> That Reveal the Life God Designed For You, 2007 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, some {{plan for}} {{investing}} some persons with authority. There {{must always be}} authority to decide <b>little</b> <b>questions</b> without debate, and for getting the opinions of all, on great questions, regularly.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hohoff was {{a terrific}} editor. She would go through the {{manuscript}} and jot down <b>little</b> <b>questions</b> in the margins. From those questions, you would start questioning your own work." [...] —Wayne Greenshaw ...|$|R
500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the game that has {{attracted}} criticism is the reuse of graphical designs from Final Fantasy X. One reviewer at RPGamer commented that [...] "there is <b>little</b> <b>question</b> that the graphics in Final Fantasy X-2 could rival just about any other RPG on the market ... one does not get ... that the graphics have been improved in any significant way since Final Fantasy X", while GameSpot said [...] "X-2 doesn't look that much better than X did two years ago". Electronic Gaming Monthly regarded this reuse of code as [...] " [...] in the one area where Final Fantasy titles usually shine".|$|E
500|$|Cope {{was raised}} as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their {{religious}} views, Osborn writes that Cope {{was at least}} aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: [...] "If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible... he did not express them in his letters to his family but there can be <b>little</b> <b>question...</b> that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period." [...] Lanham writes that Cope's religious fervor (which seems to have subsided after his father's death) was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs {{as an act of}} respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support. Frazer's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear, rather than his true views.|$|E
500|$|The band's debut album, Mer de Noms (French for [...] "Sea of Names"), was {{released}} on May 23, 2000. The album was well received commercially and critically. It debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, selling 188,000 copies in its first week and making it the highest selling debut album for a rock band. [...] Mer de Noms was later certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating 1 million copies sold, on October 31, 2000. The album was also well received by critics. The release earned the band the [...] "Best Debut Album" [...] award from the California Music Awards. In the album review by Rolling Stone, Pat Blashill wrote that Keenan [...] "added an almost operatic angst to Howerdel's songs" [...] and concluded that [...] "A Perfect Circle sound like a desperate dream of what rock used to be. Maybe that's the point." [...] AllMusic's review expressed that [...] "there's <b>little</b> <b>question</b> that the addicting combination of Keenan's aching voice and Howerdel's accomplished songs and production skills made for one of 2000's best splashes in whatever was left of 'modern rock'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't praise me!" [...] he exclaimed, hastily. [...] "Only help me.... Mary, {{will you}} answer a few <b>little</b> <b>questions,</b> if I swear by my honor I'll never reveal {{what you tell}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary, [...] "a commander, to {{take the}} lead, and decide the {{thousand}} <b>little</b> <b>questions</b> which are likely to occur. Unless there is somebody to decide them, there will be endless disputes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{rather go}} into another room, for a moment, Mr. Warren, if I may," [...] said Sir Thomas. [...] "There {{are just one}} or two <b>little</b> <b>questions</b> I would like to put to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Washington Post {{has also}} claimed that Alcatraz {{is a place}} [...] "where {{visitors}} can sense the dread of past inhabitants still trapped in the atmosphere." [...] New York Magazine has said that although the penitentiary hasn't been operational since 1963, it [...] "remains ultra sinister, perversely fascinating, iconic." [...] A documentary Haunted Alcatraz, broadcast on the Travel Channel, has said [...] "there is <b>little</b> <b>question</b> that Alcatraz holds a particular place in our collective imagination, consistently evoking feeling, stirring and dark" [...] and that the [...] "power of the island" [...] still captivates visitors after departure. A 1995 book included Alcatraz as one of The 25 Scariest Places in the World.|$|E
2500|$|On appeal once again, the Minnesota Supreme Court {{ruled that}} its first {{decision}} left <b>little</b> <b>question</b> {{as to the}} constitutionality of the statute, both under the defendants' state constitutional challenge and a new argument based on due process under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The defendants also argued that the trial court's injunction went too far because it effectively prevented them from operating any newspaper, but their appeal did not request a modification of the order. The court in any case disagreed with their interpretation of the order's scope, stating that it did allow them to publish a newspaper, so long as it was operated [...] "in harmony with the public welfare." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1854, the Great Globe {{was enough}} {{in the public eye}} to inspire an {{entertainment}} by James Robinson Planché at the Haymarket: Mr Buckstone's Voyage Round the Globe, but by 1862, there was <b>little</b> <b>question</b> of it continuing to operate even if the Tulks had not been keen to exercise their option to buy. In 1861 in The Adventures of Philip, Thackeray noted that he had heard that the Globe was [...] "coming to an end". The agreement with the Tulks expired in April 1862, and in the same month, Henry Webb threatened legal action because of Wyld's failure to remove the building and restore the gardens. Wyld was somewhat hamstrung as he had sold the building to William Wilde, the proprietor of the Alhambra, but Wilde had failed to pay and it took two court cases before Wyld regained possession in August. He immediately sold it to a contractor for demolition. In October the building was torn down and the globe itself broken up and sold for scrap. By November the site was completely cleared.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the basic}} facts are <b>little</b> <b>questioned</b> {{and the case}} explores {{differences}} between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud, other state Supreme Courts, including Iowa and Tennessee, have cited Parker v. Parker when writing opinions of their own for paternity fraud type cases.|$|R
60|$|Olga Davidoff {{was fairly}} {{fascinated by the}} {{accomplished}} young baron. She met him everywhere, and he paid her always the most marked and flattering attention. He was a Buriat, to be sure: but at Tobolsk, you know----. Well, one mustn't be too particular about these <b>little</b> <b>questions</b> of origin in an Asiatic city.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{years after}} the first film, Stuart <b>Little</b> <b>questions</b> his ability after a {{disastrous}} soccer match alongside his brother George, who accidentally kicked him with a soccer ball. He grows more discouraged after accidentally breaking George's model airplane. Stuart's father, Frederick, tries to encourage him, telling him that [...] "every cloud has a silver lining".|$|R

60|$|While my {{thoughts}} were still pursuing this direction, my attention was recalled to passing events by a sad little voice, putting a strange <b>little</b> <b>question,</b> close at my side.|$|E
60|$|I believe Solivet a <b>little</b> <b>questioned</b> {{whether one}} so headstrong had not better {{be left to}} himself, but he allowed {{that no one had}} ever done as much with Armand d'Aubepine as my husband and myself, and when he heard my urgent wish to {{forestall}} the intendant, whose wife was Cecile's old tyrant, Mademoiselle de Gringrimeau, he thought it worth the venture. He said I was a warlike Gildippe still, and that he would stand by me.|$|R
6000|$|... "At least," [...] replied Jonas, [...] "one {{must take}} the lead, and the other follow, {{in order to work}} to advantage. There must be subordination. For you see that, in all sorts of work, there are a great many <b>little</b> <b>questions</b> coming up, which are of no great consequence, only they ought to be decided, one way or the other, quick, or else the work won't go on. You act, in your work, like Jack and Jerry, when they ran against the horse-block." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{discernment}} of an infant's sex {{is almost}} universally considered an observation or recognition of an inherent {{aspect of a}} baby. The rationales for sex assignment and consequential registration {{appear to have been}} <b>little</b> <b>questioned.</b> A Dutch report on gender registration states that sex registration was introduced in 1811 as an intrinsic component in population registration, due to gender-specific rights and responsibilities, such as military conscription. Many discriminatory provisions in legislation no longer exist, but the provisions remain for rationales that include [...] "speed of identification procedures".|$|R
60|$|Although {{there was}} but <b>little</b> <b>question</b> {{in their minds}} that he was guilty of some crime, {{not one of them}} was willing he should yield to the order of arrest which they {{believed}} had already been issued.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our <b>little</b> <b>question</b> itself?" [...] Her {{appearance}} had in fact, at the moment, such {{an effect}} on {{him that he could}} answer but in marvelling mildness. [...] "Hadn't we better wait a while till we call it a catastrophe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|All Neelie's meditated {{objections}} dwindled, {{in spite}} of her, to one feeble <b>little</b> <b>question.</b> [...] "Suppose I allow you to go, Allan?" [...] she whispered, toying nervously with the stud in the bosom of his shirt. [...] "Shall you be very long away?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{result of}} all these {{researches}} was {{a history of the}} province, during the reign of the Dutch governors, which he published some years since. There have been various opinions as to the literary character of his work, and, to tell the truth, it is not a whit better than it should be. Its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy, which indeed was a <b>little</b> <b>questioned</b> on its first appearance, but has since been completely established; and it is now admitted into all historical collections, as a book of unquestionable authority.|$|R
6000|$|BRASSBOUND. Yes: she was mad too; {{and whether}} drink {{drove her to}} madness or madness drove her to drink matters <b>little.</b> The <b>question</b> is, who drove her to both? ...|$|R

60|$|Bob waited {{half an hour}} {{longer before}} firing the alcohol, and then the evening shadows were {{beginning}} to lengthen into the gloom of night. All the stranger's spars could be seen quite distinctly, and there was but <b>little</b> <b>question</b> {{that she was a}} yacht.|$|E
60|$|RANKIN (reservedly). No: I cannot say that, Leddy Ceecily. I {{doubt he}} has imposed on your good nature and sweet disposeetion. I had a crack with the Cadi {{as well as}} with Sir Howrrd; and there is <b>little</b> <b>question</b> in my mind but that Captain Brassbound is no better than a breegand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{always have}} {{everything}} out--that's quite my own idea. It's you," [...] said Mr. Mitchett, [...] "who {{are by no}} means always so frank with me as I recognise--oh, I do THAT!--what it must have cost you to be over this <b>little</b> <b>question</b> of Harold. There's one thing, Mrs. Brook, you do dodge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, you can't," [...] persisted the philosopher; [...] "how could two men {{fight on}} a raft where there's not {{room for a}} fair {{stand-up}} scrimmage between two rats? Come now, don't argue, Burr, but answer <b>little</b> Wilkins's <b>question</b> if you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|The dictee now commenced. My three belles {{interrupted}} me perpetually with <b>little</b> silly <b>questions</b> and uncalled-for remarks, to some {{of which}} I made no answer, and to others replied very quietly and briefly.

60|$|The bishop {{said nothing}} further to excuse either himself or his chaplain, and having shown himself passive and docile, was again taken into favour. They soon went to dinner, {{and he spent}} the pleasantest evening he had had in his own house for a long time. His {{daughter}} played and sang {{to him as he}} sipped his coffee and read his newspaper, and Mrs. Proudie asked good-natured <b>little</b> <b>questions</b> about the archbishop; and then he went happily to bed and slept as quietly as though Mrs. Proudie had been Griselda herself. While shaving himself in the morning and preparing for the festivities of Ullathorne, he fully resolved to run no more tilts against a warrior so fully armed at all points as was Mrs. Proudie.|$|R
