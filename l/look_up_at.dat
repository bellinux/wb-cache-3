5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, and follows a rōnin named Shiren and his companion, the talking weasel Koppa, on a quest for the Land of the Golden Condor. They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the Blinder, a travelling woman who has the power to blind people and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the condor, flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the condor and make a wish. The condor lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking away into the night.|$|E

25|$|In 207 BCE, Xiang Yu's army {{advanced}} towards Julu {{and he sent}} Ying Bu and Zhongli Mo to {{lead the}} 20,000 strong vanguard army to cross the river and attack the Qin forces led by Zhang Han, while he followed behind with the remaining majority of the troops. After crossing the river, Xiang Yu ordered his men to sink their boats and destroy all but three days worth of rations, in order to force his men to choose between prevailing against overwhelming odds within three days or die trapped before {{the walls of the}} city with no supplies or any hope of escape. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Chu forces scored a great victory after nine engagements, defeating the 300,000 strong Qin army. After the battle, other rebel forces, including those not from Chu, came to join Xiang Yu out of admiration for his martial valour. When Xiang Yu received them at the gate, the rebel chiefs were so fearful of him that they sank to their knees and did not even dare to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E

They cross the bergschrund and climb [...] "a few feet of easy rock". Carless suggests rappelling 200 feet (60 m) to the next glacier. They agree [...] "it would be difficult" [...] to get back if they did that. They return to their base camp and try again the next morning, again finding their way blocked. They wish the climbing waitresses from Wales were with them.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} half of the scenario, heavy rain descends on the city and the {{citizens}} try to flee, all again seen in slow motion. From the safety of shelter, the six [...] "strangers" [...] watch everyone's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather. Eventually they decide to go outside, where they <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky and allow the rain to soak them. The video ends with Michael whipping his hair.

500|$|In {{spite of}} the informality {{suggested}} by the cigarette, University of Tennessee photography professor Baldwin Lee {{points out that the}} photo was carefully planned and posed. According to Lee, Westcott instructed Oppenheimer to sit [...] "slightly askance" [...] and to lean forward slightly, and then he took the photograph from a low vantage point that [...] "makes the viewer physically <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the man," [...] thus enhancing the subject's perceived importance. Lee's critique also notes that Oppenheimer's gaze {{does not appear to be}} directed anywhere in the room, but instead is aimed at [...] "something very distant and something only he can see." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Jake & Jim and grew from an idea the band had to record a video in Iceland {{at the start of}} 2003 which didn't come off. The video begins with a close up of a cardboard box featuring a logo of two apples with the title 'Golden'. The band is shown playing along to [...] "Golden Retriever" [...] inside the box with Gruff Rhys wearing a red sports visor. Bassist Guto Pryce and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are both sat on settees with guitars on their laps which they are not playing. As the chorus begins the band transform into yetis and all begin playing [...] "Golden Retriever", several members headbanging in time with the track. The group wear their regular clothes for the second verse before the yeti costumes reappear for the second chorus. As the video ends the camera zooms out to show a Golden Retriever approach the box in an alleyway. The Super Furries raise their hands in the air and <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the dog who then urinates on the box and runs away.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I would do it again and again. This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. I remember the first season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes and I thought it was revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|Skyrim {{is powered}} by Bethesda's Creation Engine, created {{specifically}} for Skyrim. After Fallout 3s release, the team devised numerous design objectives to meet for Skyrim, and according to Howard, the team [...] "got all those done and kept going". Had the team {{not been able to}} meet their design goals with current hardware, they would have waited for the next generation and released Skyrim then, but Howard felt that the technology of the time did not hold the team back at all. The Creation Engine allows for numerous improvements in graphical fidelity over Bethesda's previous efforts. For example, the draw distance renders farther than in previous Elder Scrolls games; Howard provided an example where the player can stare at a small object such as a fork in detail, and then <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a mountain and run to the top of it. Dynamic lighting allows shadows to be created by any structure or item in the game world, and the Creation Engine allowed for greater detail in flora production than SpeedTree had in previous Bethesda games. For example, with Bethesda's own technology, developers were able to give weight to the branches of trees, which affects how trees blow in the wind. In addition, the technology allows wind to affect the flow of water in channels such as rivers and streams. Because of the large presence of snow in Skyrims game world, the technological upgrades were applied to weather effects and allow for dynamic snow fall upon the terrain, instead of snow that was rendered as a textural effect in previous games.|$|E
