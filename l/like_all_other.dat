5|$|The {{film was}} advertised to the American churchgoer {{as a moral}} picture. The film was {{generally}} well received by critics, but the faults of story {{for the sake of}} a moral lesson was noted. Adrift, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> American silents of the day, had no musical accompaniment, but a letter written into a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The silent {{film was}} shot in black and white; its intertitles were bilingual, written in both Malay and Chinese. The American film {{historian}} Richard Abel writes that the film's technical quality, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> local productions of the time, was poor and unable to compete with imported works, and the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran writes that the shots were considered blurry even at the time.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, as Cluj-Napoca is {{the capital}} of Cluj County, the city hosts the palace of the prefecture, the {{headquarters}} of the county council (consiliu județean) and the prefect, who is appointed by Romania's central government. The prefect is not allowed {{to be a member of}} a political party, and his role is to represent the national government at the local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at the local level. <b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> local councils in Romania, the Cluj-Napoca local council, the county council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population.|$|E

5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. <b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|E
5|$|Deshasthas, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> Hindu Brahmins, {{trace their}} {{paternal}} ancestors {{to one of}} the seven or eight sages, the saptarshi. They classify themselves into eight gotras, named after the ancestor rishi. Intra-marriage within gotras (Sagotra Vivaha) was uncommon until recently, being discouraged as it was likened to incest, although the taboo has considerably reduced in the case of modern Deshastha families who are bound by more practical considerations.|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> sharks, have {{an extra}} sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> large whales, the {{fin whale}} was heavily hunted during the 20th century {{and is an}} {{endangered}} species. Over 725,000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived. Recovery of the overall population size of southern species is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> {{non-human}} primates, strepsirrhines face {{an elevated}} risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions. Much of their habitat {{has been converted}} for human use, such as agriculture and pasture. The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories: habitat destruction, hunting (for bushmeat or traditional medicine), and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade. Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-43 <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> state trunkline highways. As a part {{of those}} responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roadways using a metric called average annual daily traffic. This is a calculation of the traffic levels for a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that the highest traffic volume along M-43 was east of the I-96/I-69 interchange at 38,927vehicles per day. The highest commercial traffic was west of the interchange at 645trucks daily. The lowest volumes were at Woodland with only 1,700vehicles and 120trucks traveling along that section of the highway daily.|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine {{system is}} typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal ganglion, three {{thoracic}} ganglia, and six abdominal ganglia. Strong neuron connections connect the neurohemal corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal ganglion, where the closely related median corpus allatum produces juvenile hormone III {{in close proximity to}} the neurohemal dorsal arota. The digestive system of earwigs is <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and hindgut, but earwigs lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect. Long, slender (extratory) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut.|$|E
5|$|Upper {{secondary}} education or framhaldsskóli (lit. “continued school”), follows lower {{secondary education}}. These schools are {{also known as}} gymnasia in English. It is not compulsory, but everyone who has had their compulsory education {{has the right to}} upper secondary education. The typical course length is four years, for students aged between 16 and 20. The length of the course can vary, especially in vocational courses. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 2007. <b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>other</b> schools in Iceland, upper secondary schools are mixed sex.|$|E
