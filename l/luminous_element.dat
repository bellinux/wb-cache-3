5000|$|... "Radio premiums" [...] {{were offered}} to listeners, {{as was the}} case with many radio shows of the day. For example, the Sky King Secret Signalscope was used on November 2, 1947, in the [...] "Mountain Detour" [...] episode. Listeners were advised to get their own for only 15 cents and the inner seal from a jar of Peter Pan Peanut Butter, which was {{produced}} by the sponsor, Derby Foods. The Signalscope included a glow-in-the-dark signaling device, whistle, magnifying glass, and Sky King's private code. With the Signalscope, one could also see around corners and trees. The premiums were innovative, such as the Sky King Spy-Detecto Writer, which had a [...] "decoder" [...] (cipher disk), magnifying glass, measuring scale, and printing mechanism in a single package slightly over two inches long. Other notable premiums were the Magni-Glo Writing Ring, which had a <b>luminous</b> <b>element,</b> a secret compartment, a magnifier, and a ballpoint pen all in the crown piece of a [...] "fits any finger" [...] ring.|$|E
40|$|Typical {{progressive}} radiosity {{starts with}} the emission of all {{the energy of the}} most <b>luminous</b> <b>element</b> in the world. We do the radiosity calculations proportionally allowing us to emit a portion of the energy left in the entire world, without preferences. This allows us to see the effects of the radiosity without missing the effects of medium o low emissive elements even in the first iterations. The radiosity estimation is made tracing the destination of light particles. Finally, a Java applet is used to specify the quality parameters, to send de data to a CGI, and to update the result in Cosmo Player...|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is located}} on the south breakwater of Ventspils port and harbour. Before that, the lighthouse was located on the left bank of the river Venta, which was built in 1897 and destroyed during World War I by the retreating Russian army leaving the town of Ventspils. Both these constructions were not originally lighthouses - although they did have <b>luminous</b> <b>elements,</b> but similarly to factory chimneys and high church spires in the local area, they served as navigational marks for sailors which travelled into the port of Ventspils.|$|R
40|$|The PSVD (Progressive Signal for Vehicle Deceleration) is {{a device}} that furnish {{response}} to intense need for an road safety increase. The device could be mounted on any new or old vehicle. It supply to the vehicles that they follow quantitative information on the vehicular deceleration rate. That difference of the traditional stop light («all or nothing» kind) and has built with more <b>luminous</b> <b>elements</b> to diversified lighting: an only element for low deceleration (the simple accelerator release), all the elements for greatest allowed deceleration. The vehicle that follow a vehicle on wich the PSVD ha s mounted are informed with wich energy this vehicle is braking. At least, the device allows to the drivers to have the proportionate reactions for real situation...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} dark matter {{in the form of}} multi-eV axions on the extragalactic background light. Our treatment differs from that of other workers in that we assume axions to be clustered in Galactic halos, with nonzero velocity dispersions. We also approach the problem in a fully general relativistic manner, treating the axion halos as <b>luminous</b> <b>elements</b> of a pressure-free perfect fluid in a standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We find that the ultraviolet extragalactic background light places a firm upper limit of 9 eV on the axion rest energy, and that this drops to 4 eV for the simplest axion models, all but closing the multi-eV axion window (which begins at 3 eV). These results are close to earlier upper limits of 5 and 8 eV derived from the extragalactic background by Turner and Ressell, respectively. Although our methods differ somewhat from theirs, our findings support their conclusion that axions, if they exist, are likely to have rest energies well below the eV range...|$|R
40|$|Sprites are Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) {{that can}} extend {{vertically}} from 40 to 90 [*]km and horizontally over several tens of km to form clusters of individual or multiple column or/and carrot-shaped <b>luminous</b> <b>elements.</b> They can even extend {{over more than}} 100 [*]km {{in the form of}} sequential luminous emissions that are called “dancing sprites”. Their optical detection and other parameters describing the storm and the lightning activity associated allow us to understand the conditions of their production and their links with the lightning activity. Our observations confirm some characteristics of the sprites and put forward others: (i) the sprites are essentially produced above the stratiform region of the Mesoscale Convective Systems after positive cloud-to-ground lightning flashes that produce large Charge Moment Change (CMC), with a shorter delay if the impulsive CMC (iCMC) is larger. (ii) The dancing sprites reflect the timing and the location of the successive lightning strokes that generate them. (iii) The sprite elements can be shifted from the stroke location when their delay is large. (iv) Bright sprites produce current signatures in ELF radiation a few milliseconds (< 5 [*]ms) after the positive strokes that generate them...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{interaction}} in apparent motion between perceived three-dimensional forms defined by stereopsis and local <b>luminous</b> <b>elements</b> is reported. Vertical stripes of cyclopean square gratings were simulated by random-dot stereograms. Alternation of two-frame stereograms whose phases differed by 90 deg caused {{two kinds of}} percepts, planes' motion in depth (first-order stereoscopic motion, first-order SM) or lateral motion of gratings (higher-order stereoscopic motion, higher-order SM). Experiment 1 explored {{the conditions under which}} higher-order SM frequently arose, as opposed to local luminance-based in-depth motion (first-order SM). The results show that, when the spatial arrangements of two-frame random dots were correlated, higher-order SM dominated for long ISI conditions (ISI > 73 msec). When they were uncorrelated, higher-order SM dominated even under zero ISI conditions. Subjects reported that, when higher-order SM was seen, dots were attached to the surfaces of the moving cyclopean figure (motion capture). Experiment 2 tested which factor caused the domination of higher-order SM under uncorrelated conditions in Experiment 1, the larger distance of dot jump or the varied directions of the dots' motion. The results show that, when the distance of dot jump is large or when the directions of dots' motion are incoherent, higher-order SM arises more frequently. When local first-order motion signals are weakened by appropriate temporal and spatial conditions or by incoherent motion directions, higher-order SM dominates and it captures the motion of dots...|$|R
40|$|Sprites, {{a form of}} brief {{luminous}} discharge in {{the upper}} atmosphere above a thunderstorm, were observed and imaged on two video cameras in Australia's Northern Territory. These were the first such ground-based observations made outside the United States. Sprite discharges typically took place between the altitudes of 50 km and 80 km and spanned an average width of 44 km. Many of the sprite events were of long duration, {{with an average of}} 145 ms. These spatial and temporal features were similar to those observed from the ground and the air in the United States. During the longer events, some <b>luminous</b> discharge <b>elements</b> were observed to decay as other new elements formed. As the new elements were often laterally displaced from the old, the sprites sometimes appeared to dance across the sky. This phenomenon has been observed in Colorado and named “dancing sprites. ” The lateral progression of sprite elements observed in the Northern Territory was overwhelmingly in one direction and covered distances of up to 90 km...|$|R
40|$|The unique {{value of}} Mickiewicz’s “Vision” is its {{included}} {{image of the}} structure of the supernatural order. The poet described is as an infinite, continually spreading space, spherical in shape and filled with a <b>luminous</b> divine <b>element</b> penetrating everything most easily, in the middle of which there is an eternally sinking well that emits out that element. The well emitting the luminous transparent matter is God Himself. Contrary to Christian dogmas He is obviously de-anthropomorphised but not de-animated, as also in that form He means the source of life and love. In ecstasy, the experiencing individual adopted godly attributes: he united with the material-spiritual being that continually came out of God, and he found himself in the centre of the universe where he was given the ability of receiving all its movements and signals, and at the same time — the privilege of being everywhere. According to Mickiewicz’s “Vision”, eternal life has an active and creative nature - it is characterised by supply of the animating love element, endless development and growth, the grace of eternal watching the transcendental reality, excellent contact with Creator, and the gift of creation. The second fragment of the “Vision” reveals valuable information on the nature of extrasensory perception. It is absolute, free from any difficulties, prompt and insensible; it is perfect perception.

2500|$|The work depicts Weda Cook, a [...] "respected Camden vocalist... {{recognized}} for her 'powerful contralto voice, unassuming manner, and thorough training.'" [...] She stands center stage, wearing pink slippers and a low-necked sleeveless pink dress, a <b>luminous</b> and central <b>element</b> in the picture, fringed with lace and pearl beads. Eakins's realism is notable {{in the painting}} of skin tones, with Cook's bare neck, chest, arms, and shoulders visibly paler than her head and hands. The figure is solidly and subtly modeled, its warm light pinks set against a cooler and darker yellow-green background. Narrative details are minimal. In the lower-left foreground, a conductor's hand and baton are visible, although {{the rest of the}} figure is not pictured. Initially, {{as can be seen in}} the preliminary sketch, the hand grasped the baton as if it were a paint brush. For verisimilitude Eakins had Charles M. Schmitz, the conductor of the Germania Orchestra and Cook's teacher, pose holding the baton. A bouquet at the lower right suggests that the singer is performing an encore; apparently a fresh supply of roses was provided at each sitting by the sculptor William Rudolf O'Donovan, who had fallen in love with Cook.|$|R
40|$|The digital {{phenomena}} {{constitute a}} fundamental change in how designers accomplish a wide range of the complex processes of design. This thesis investigates the use of computation in the context of architectural lighting design. It particularly looks into how cutting edge computational tools [...] such as digital fabrication and parametric tools [...] can be combined with the Light Emitting Diodes (LED) technology to create <b>luminous</b> architectural <b>elements.</b> Work in this field is of most relevance in a moment when the implementation of LED systems is expected to establish a new paradigm in architectural illumination. Results from recent technology roadmaps show that by the year 2020 LEDs will be replacing incandescent, halogen and fluorescent lamps and will become the primary choice for general lighting applications. Because LED architectural applications are not widely understood by the industry, a successful implementation process will be highly dependant on multidisciplinary design research, where many design experimentations will have to occur. New approaches are needed where the technical advantages of LEDs - they are more efficient, have longer life of operation, are rugged and compact, produce the entire color spectrum, and are fully controllable - are used to promote better lighting design quality. It is in this context that my research takes place, utilizing advanced computational tools to explore innovative design possibilities for lighting systems with embedded LEDs. This thesis describes a sequence of experiments to design and build a system of luminous ceiling tiles made of acrylic pieces and equipped with embedded LEDs. First, I use programming to generate parametric 3 D models of the ceiling tiles. A series of(cont.) variations of an initial design of the tiles are accomplished through the manipulation of control parameters. After the first set of 3 D models is created, I use digital fabrication techniques to build prototypes of the models, which are tested with LEDs and evaluated in terms of their lighting performance. Finally, I develop the experiments to create an entire luminous ceiling area, and the design achieves an overall result rather than being restricted to individual elements. Advanced lighting systems enhance the quality, flexibility and cost effectiveness of light, and digital fabrication techniques improve the optimization of computer-based methods of design. The results of my experiments show that lighting systems can greatly benefit from the testing of the design and the technical performance before installation in the architectural space. In this context, parametric tools and digital fabrication technologies demonstrate exceptional wealth for both the conceptual and the optimization phases of lighting design in architecture. by Rita Saad.
