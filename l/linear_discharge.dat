40|$|Un nombre {{important}} de grands tunnels profonds ont été, ou seront à l'avenir, percés dans les massifs montagneux. Le suivi de l'évolution de la température des venues d'eau dans cinq grands tunnels alpins (Vereina, Gothard-N 2, Mont-Blanc, Simplon et Gothard-AT) {{montre que}} la température de l'eau dans les ouvrages est fortement influencée par la perméabilité des massifs et les circulations d'eau souterraine qui s'y produisent. Les eaux froides qui s'infiltrent à haute altitude possèdent un effet réfrigérant sur le massif. Dès lors, la mesure de la température de l'eau en cours d'avancement d'un ouvrage souterrain constitue un outil de prévision efficace et peu coûteux des venues d'eau. Celles-ci peuvent être très localisées et provoquer une diminution de la température dans une zone du massif ou être diffuses et provoquer une diminution globale du gradient thermique des eaux dans le massif. Une corrélation négative a été mise en évidence entre le gradient thermique des eaux dans chacun des massifs étudiés et l'intensité des venues d'eau qui ont été ensuite observées dans les ouvrages les traversant. Numerous long tunnels {{have been and}} will be drilled at great depths in mountainous alpine massifs. Water inflow temperatures in five existing long alpine tunnels (Vereina, Gothard-N 2, Mont-Blanc, Simplon and Gothard-AT) have been studied and compared with the volume of water inflows. The Vereina railway tunnel drilled in Austroalpine nappes encountered little water inflow. The <b>linear</b> <b>discharge</b> rates vary between 0. 003 and 0. 006 L/s/m. Water temperatures series have been observed in both {{the northern and southern}} parts of the tunnel trace: the northern thermal gradient is equal to 0. 018 °C/m, whereas the southern thermal gradient is not very different with a value equal to 0. 016 °C/m. No special thermal anomaly has been observed at this site. The Gothard-N 2 road tunnel (National route number two) intersects the Aar and Gothard External Crystalline Massifs. A general thermal gradient equal to 0. 015 °C/m is observed {{in the southern part of}} the tunnel trace in the Monte Prosa massif. Positive thermal anomalies have been measured in both the northern and central parts of the tunnel trace. They are due to topographical effects: in this region, the tunnel is situated beneath the Reuss river valley. Water inflows are weak in this tunnel: about 0. 020 L/s/m in the Monte Prosa zone, for example. The Mont-Blanc road tunnel intersects the Mont-Blanc External Crystalline Massif. A water thermal gradient equal to 0. 016 °C/m has been observed on the northern part of the massif, at depths less than 1000 meters. This region corresponds to a low-permeability crystalline schist zone. The <b>linear</b> <b>discharge</b> rate is equal to 0. 008 L/s/m in this zone. A large negative thermal anomaly was measured during the drilling of this tunnel. The water temperatures decreased from 32 °C to 11. 5 °C beneath the Pointe Helbronner. This decrease corresponds to large water inflows (about 1000 L/s) in a strongly fractured zone. A second water thermal gradient (very weak: 0. 007 °C/m) corresponds to the granitic unit which is globally more permeable than the schist with a <b>linear</b> <b>discharge</b> rate equal to 0. 193 L/s/m. The Simplon railway tunnel, drilled through the Penninic nappes, is also characterized by a negative thermal anomaly situated in the very permeable marbles of the Teggiolo zone. In this tunnel, the water temperatures decrease from 55 °C in the Berisal gneissic zone to less than 15 °C in the Teggiolo zone. The water thermal gradient in the northern part is high, in conformity with the weak water inflows (<b>linear</b> <b>discharge</b> rate less than 0. 001 L/s/m). A third zone is observed in the Veglia marbles: it is characterized by a water thermal gradient equal to 0. 010 °C/m for a <b>linear</b> <b>discharge</b> rate equal to 0. 203 L/s/m. The Gothard-AT gallery has been drilled in Penninic gneiss. A water thermal gradient equal to 0. 013 °C/m has been measured over the first 3000 m. A negative thermal anomaly was encountered at the end of the gallery, due to the presence of very permeable metasedimentary rocks with important water circulation. These results show that the water temperature in underground works is strongly dependent on the massif permeability and the existence of groundwater flows. Cold waters coming from high infiltration zones have a refrigerating effect on the massif. Thus, measuring water temperature during drilling constitutes a prediction tool for eventual water inflows. Two cases are possible: the observation of a local thermal anomaly due to a very localized aquifer zone, or the decrease of the water thermal gradient due to diffuse water inflows in the massif. Local thermal anomalies, correlated with large water inflows along discrete zones, have been shown in the Simplon, Mont-Blanc and Gothard-AT tunnels. Such thermal anomalies can be measured hundreds of meters before the intersection of the tunnel with the aquifer zone: temperature monitoring thus constitutes a prediction tool for large water inflows localized in a particular aquifer zone. The use of 3 D numerical simulations allows one to improve the prediction quantitatively, by taking into account the problem geometry, the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the thermal and hydrogeological properties of rocks, and the boundary conditions. The comparison of water thermal gradients at the massif scale with <b>linear</b> <b>discharge</b> rates in the tunnels through the massif allows us to determine a mathematical relationship between these characteristics of the massif. This relation permits one to predict the water quantity expected during drilling, knowing the water thermal gradient. These results show that water temperature measurements during drilling of an underground work constitute an efficient and cheap predicting tool for water inflows. Anomalies due to relief must be taken into account; these can be very important in such mountainous massifs. A 3 D modeling of heat transfer in the massif is, in all cases, necessary to improve the precision of predictions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwo {{innovative}} {{approaches for}} upscaling and regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity at watershed scale are proposed. They {{are based on}} the concept that large-scale variations in hydraulic head may characterize large-scale properties and were tested on an unconfined granitic aquifer exposed to deep weathering, located in South India (Maheshwaram watershed, 53 km 2). Both methods are based on field data such as water levels, discharge rates of irrigation wells, geological observations and the results of small-scale hydraulic tests. The resulting hydraulic-conductivity map uses the statistical empirical relationship between log-normal distributions of hydraulic conductivity from small-scale tests and <b>linear</b> <b>discharge</b> rates from exploited wells, i. e. the ratio between discharge rate and the saturated aquifer thickness. The empirical relationship agrees with Thiem-Dupuit's assumption for unconfined aquifers. The performance of the method was compared to the values of local hydraulic-conductivity estimates deduced from small-scale tests (not used for drawing the map). About 90 % of simulated values varies less than 20 % from local measurements (LogK ± 0. 4 on average), which is reasonable considering the complexity of the studied fractured aquifer. The regionalization of the effective porosity was based on a method that combines both water-table fluctuation and groundwater-budget techniques in the absence of recharge from rainfall. However, the use of these techniques at cell scale requires a good knowledge of groundwater flux to and from the cells, which here is unknown. To avoid this difficulty a coarse-graining method was used, assuming that increasing the cell size for such computations leads to a negligible contribution of these flux compared to net groundwater abstraction from the cell. Our results show that cell sizes over 520 * 520 m achieve a negligible balance. In addition, porosity maps provide average values of around 1. 5 % that are almost identical to the ones previously found at watershed scale. The proposed methods for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields provide access not only to the average large-scale values, but also to their spatial distribution, which is of prime interest in terms of flux and contaminant transport in a hard-rock environment. The uncertainty introduced by field data, the choice of the computation scale as the impact of cell size on the calculated effective porosity value and the possible meaning of their spatial variations are also discussed...|$|E

Compared to the well known observations at low densities in this high density range the instant of the first breakdown in the discharge tube {{is found to be}} shifted to later halfcycles with increasing initial pressure. In addition, the further development of the discharge at high initial densities shows a very different structure compared to the low density behaviour. Comparison of optical observations with measurements of the current density distribution obtained by means of magnetic probes (using a special difference method on account of the very small plasma currrents) shows the following result: In the half cycle immediately following the breakdown, a typical shock wave pinch is produced at high densities. The regions near the axis are heated only by an ionizing shock, while the contraction of the current sheath, which initially started the shock, is stopped very early in far outer regions. During the following half-cycle quite a different behaviour of the discharge is observed on account of the enhanced electrical conductivity: The contraction runs much faster and therefore the separation between the shock front and the driving current sheath decreases. © 1965, Walter de Gruyter.

40|$|For the {{simulation}} of protocols and algorithms of mobile devices, an ideal energy source, i. e. a battery with <b>linear</b> charge and <b>discharge</b> characteristics, is often assumed. However, real batteries like lithium-ion cells show nonlinear behavior, taking Rate Capacity Effect and Recovery Effect into account. The battery model presented by Rakhmatov and Vrudhula models non-linear battery behavior {{and can be}} utilized for lifetime optimization strategies since it provides a formal cost metric. A drawback of this lifetime optimization algorithm is that the load profile of the battery has to be known completely in advance. An estimation of battery lifetime at simulation runtime is not feasible. We present an algorithm for a runtime estimation of battery lifetime of lithium-ion cells. Our algorithm allows the integration of a non-linear battery model into network simulation environments for mobile devices. As an example, we describe the integration of our algorithm for battery lifetime estimation into a popular network simulation tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of an alkaline S 2 O 42 −/air-fuel cell was evaluated at room temperature, using a cell with an {{anion exchange membrane}} and a platinum oxygen reduction reaction catalyst. The tests performed were open circuit voltage analysis, <b>linear</b> sweep voltammetry, <b>discharge</b> analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with registration of anode half-cell potential. With 0. 85 M Na 2 S 2 O 4 in 2 M KOH, the cell achieved a maximum power density of 2 mW cm− 2, and the open circuit cell voltage was about 0. 9 V. In a potentiostatic discharging at 0. 2 V cell voltage, an energy efficiency of 12. 3 % was achieved at an energy density of 8. 6 Wh L− 1. The low power density was mainly due to the low reaction kinetics of dithionite oxidation at graphite electrodes. The low energy efficiency was mainly caused by a low cathode potential, which probably resulted from mixed potential formation and the low anode kinetic...|$|R
40|$|Salsa is an {{invariant}} checker for specifications in SAL (the SCR Abstract Language). To {{establish a}} formula as an invariant without any user guidance Salsa carries out an induction proof that utilizes tightly integrated decision procedures, currently {{a combination of}} BDD algorithms and a constraint solver for integer <b>linear</b> arithmetic, for <b>discharging</b> the verification conditions. The user interface of Salsa is designed to mimic the interfaces of model checkers; i. e., given a formula and a system description, Salsa either establishes the formula as an invariant of the system (but returns no proof) or provides a counterexample. In either case, the algorithm will terminate. Unlike model checkers, Salsa returns a state pair as a counterexample and not an execution sequence. Also, due to the incompleteness of induction, users must validate the counterexamples. The use of induction enables Salsa to combat the state explosion problem that plagues model checkers [...] it can handle [...] ...|$|R
