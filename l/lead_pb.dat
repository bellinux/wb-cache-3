5|$|For {{surface water}} {{sources such as}} lakes and reservoirs, the volume {{available}} for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large. The most abundant components of ash leachates (Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, F and SO4) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most surface waters and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall, and are also of low concern in drinking water, {{with the possible exception}} of fluorine. The elements iron, manganese and aluminium are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall. These elements may impart a metallic taste to water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a health risk. Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and <b>lead</b> (<b>Pb)</b> which occur at very low levels in ash leachates.|$|E
25|$|EDX spectrometers are {{different}} from WDX spectrometers {{in that they are}} smaller, simpler in design and have fewer engineered parts, however they are not as accurate. WDX has greater resolution power than EDX. They can also use miniature X-ray tubes or gamma sources. This makes them cheaper and allows miniaturization and portability. This type of instrument is commonly used for portable quality control screening applications, such as testing toys for <b>lead</b> (<b>Pb)</b> content, sorting scrap metals, and measuring the lead content of residential paint. On the other hand, the low resolution and problems with low count rate and long dead-time makes them inferior for high-precision analysis. They are, however, very effective for high-speed, multi-elemental analysis.

2500|$|During subduction, the subducted oceanic {{crust is}} {{submitted}} to increasing pressure and temperature, leading to metamorphism. Hydrous minerals such as amphibole, zeolites, chlorite etc. (which {{are present in}} the oceanic lithosphere) dehydrate as they change to more stable, anhydrous forms, releasing water and soluble elements into the overlying wedge of mantle. Fluxing water into the wedge lowers the solidus of the mantle material and causes partial melting. [...] Due to the lower density of the partially molten material, it rises through the wedge until it reaches the lower boundary of the overriding plate. Melts generated in the mantle wedge are of basaltic composition, but they have a distinctive enrichment of soluble elements (e.g. potassium (K), barium (Ba), and <b>lead</b> (<b>Pb))</b> which are contributed from sediment that lies {{at the top of the}} subducting plate. Although there is evidence to suggest that the subducting oceanic crust may also melt during this process, the relative contribution of the three components (crust, sediment, and wedge) to the generated basalts is still a matter of debate.|$|E
2500|$|The sodium {{carbonate}} test (not {{to be confused}} with {{sodium carbonate}} extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or <b>lead</b> (<b>Pb).</b> Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu2+ ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe2+ ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+ ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+ ion. [...] The compounds formed are, respectively, copper(II) carbonate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) oxide, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, and lead(II) carbonate. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium. For the complete sequence of tests used for qualitative cation analysis, see qualitative inorganic analysis.|$|E
2500|$|PLUME – this is magma {{associated}} with the plume itself and is similar to magmas from other ocean islands within the Pacific. It has the characteristics of intermediate Strontium (Sr), Neodymium (Nd) and <b>Lead</b> (<b>Pb)</b> ratios. The PLUME lavas are found predominately in {{the west of the}} islands, around Ferdinandina and Isabela Islands, which is near to the current position of the hotspot. The PLUME lavas erupted on Fernandina and Isabela are relatively cool. Analysis shows that they are as much as 100 degrees Celsius cooler than those in Hawaii. The cause of this is not fully understood but may be due to cooling in the lithosphere or being relatively cool at formation in the mantle. They are then found in lower quantities in a horseshoe pattern north and south of the central islands mixing with the other reservoirs as it progresses east. PLUME lavas are also found in the lavas from the Galapagos Spreading Centre due to convection and mixing of all of these lavas. In the upper mantle convection currents bring in mantle material at shallow angles from the south of the Galapagos Spreading Centre. [...] These convection current will draw in some PLUME type magma to the spreading centre where it is then erupted.|$|E

The concentration of uranium (234 U, 238 U), radium (226 Ra, 228 Ra), radon (222 Rn), and <b>lead</b> (210 <b>Pb)</b> isotopes was determined in selected mineral waters in this area.

Sand iron and <b>lead</b> oxide <b>Pb</b> 3 O 4 as fine aggregate are tested to obtain its density and unit weight as a basis to calculate the mix design. The specimens of each variable of mortar are tested on its physical and mechanical properties, namely weight per m 3, compressive strength, tensile strength, and water absorption {{with the number of}} specimens are 3 (three) of each variable of mortar. After that, the specimens are tested with Gamma radiation with energy 1170 keV, 1330 keV (Cobalt 60), 662 keV (Cesium 137), and 323 keV (Cr 51) and X Ray radiation with energy 70 kV and 90. The specimens are block shaped size 10 cm x 10 cm with thickness variation of 1 cm up to 12 cm.

Weight per m 3 of mortar was increased caused by the increasing of <b>lead</b> oxide <b>Pb</b> 3 O 4 on mortar. The compressive strength significantly increased starting on M 2 (37, 328 MPa) from M 1 (7, 594 MPa) and a bit decreased on M 3 and M 4, i. e. 32, 188 Mpa and 30, 144 Mpa respectively caused by the increase of water cement ratio. The value of water absorption was decreased as an effect of <b>lead</b> oxide <b>Pb</b> 3 O 4 addition.

The attenuation coefficient values of M 1, M 2, M 3, and M 4 are 0. 102 cm- 1, 0. 145 cm- 1, 0. 152 cm- 1, and 0. 184 cm- 1 respectively for energy 1330 keV; 0. 060 cm- 1, 0. 104 cm- 1, 0. 120 cm- 1, and 0. 155 cm- 1 respectively for energy 1170 keV; 0. 157 cm- 1, 0. 212 cm- 1, 0. 242 cm- 1, and 0. 284 cm- 1, respectively for energy 662 keV, and 0. 202 cm- 1, 0. 309 cm- 1, 0. 330 cm- 1, and 0. 426 cm- 1 respectively for energy 323 keV.
