50|$|In {{automotive}} design, a RMR or Rear Mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (now simply {{known as}} MR or Mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout) {{is one in}} which the rear wheels are driven by an engine placed just in front of them, behind the passenger compartment. In contrast to the rear-engined RR layout, the center of mass of the engine is in front of the rear axle. This layout is typically chosen for its low moment of inertia and relatively favorable weight distribution (the heaviest component is {{near the center of the}} car, making the main component of its moment of inertia relatively low). The layout has a tendency toward being heavier in the rear than the front, which allows for best balance to be achieved under braking. However, since there is little weight over the front wheels, under acceleration, the front of the car is prone to lift and cause understeer. Most rear-engine layouts have historically been used in smaller vehicles, because the weight of the engine at the rear has an adverse effect on a larger car's handling, making it 'tail-heavy'. It is felt that the low polar inertia is crucial in selection of this layout. The mid-engined layout also uses up central space, making it impractical for any but two-seater sports cars. However, some microvans use this layout, with a small, low engine beneath the loading area. This makes it possible to move the driver right to the front of the vehicle, thus increasing the loading area at the expense of slightly reduced <b>load</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E

A clear improvement in the optical, mechanical properties of the deposited films is seen with the increasing magnitude of RF self-bias. It is seen that with increasing magnitude of bias values, C content increases continuously in these films at the expanse of Si and O content and they finally got close towards ideal diamond like character beyond - 150 V bias values.

The base diameter of fracture conical cup is used to determination of diametrical Ratio. The diametrical ratio is the ratio between base diameter of fracture of conical cup with respect to outer edges of cup to original blank diameter. This indicates formability of sheet metals through this test. So formability can be represented as formability index. Hence the formability index expressed as diametrical ratio.

However, the energy is usually spent in various processes so that one is forced to supplement the experiments with a theoretical analysis so as to delineate the various energy consuming processes. Schapery's variant of internal variable theory is very promising in this respect because, in this theory, one is able to link microstructural information of the induced damage to its contribution to the dissipated energy. The present paper reports on the experimental validation {{of one of the}} basic assumptions of Schapery's theory, namely that the process, in this case indentation, should be rate independent. This was checked — and found to be true for rates up to 20 nm/s — for TiN and Ti(C,N) coatings on tool steel substrates of varying roughness. The dissipated energy vs. depth was found to be a power law. No delamination was observed and both coating types showed only ring shaped cracking.

40|$|An {{indentation}} experiment involves five variables: indenter shape, {{material behavior}} of the substrate, contact size, applied load and indentation depth. Only three variable are known afterwards, namely, indenter shape, plus load and depth as function of time. As the contact size is not measured and {{the determination of the}} material properties is the very aim of the test; two equations are needed to obtain a mathematically solvable system. For elastic materials, the contact size can always be eliminated once and for all in favor of the depth; a single relation between <b>load,</b> <b>depth</b> and material properties remains with the latter variable as unknown. For viscoelastic materials where hereditary integrals model the constitutive behavior, the relation between depth and contact size usually depends also on the (time-dependent) properties of the material. Solving the inverse problem, i. e., determining the material properties from the experimental data, therefore needs both equations. Extending Sneddon's analysis of the indentation problem for elastic materials to include viscoelastic materials, the two equations mentioned above are derived. To find the time dependence of the material properties the feasibility of Golden and Graham's method of decomposing hereditary integrals (J. M. Golden and G. A. C. Graham.

40|$|A high-speed, high-precision chip formation-based micro-groove {{cutting process}} has been {{developed}} for cutting grooves in metals with nearly arbitrarily shaped cross-sections, which have widths and depths {{of a few hundred}} nanometers to a few microns, and lengths of tens of millimeters. A flexible tool, consisting of a single-point cutting geometry mounted {{on the end of a}} small cantilever, is moved along a workpiece surface while a constant cantilever deflection is maintained to apply a cutting <b>load.</b> <b>Depth</b> of cut for a given tool shape is determined by cutting load and workpiece material properties. A major advantage of the flexible tool concept is increased depth of cut precision. Furthermore, the use of a flexible tool enables the process to be robust against machine tool registration error, guide misalignment, and component inertial deflections. The process was implemented by fitting a 5 -axis micro-scale machine tool with a specially constructed micro-groove cutting assembly. Early, experiments using diamond-coated AFM probes as tools demonstrated process viability up to cutting speeds of 25 mm/min and chip formation at the sub-micron scale. However, AFM probe geometries proved too fragile for this demanding application. High quality tools with improved cutting geometries were designed and fabricated via focused ion beam machining of single-crystal diamond tool blanks, and tool edge radii of 50 - 64 nm were achieved. The improved tools enabled well-formed rectangular grooves to be cut in aluminum at up to 400 mm/min with widths of 300 nm to 1. 05 microns and depths up to 2 microns. Complex compound v-shaped grooves were also produced. Virtually no tool wear (less than 20 nm) was observed over a cutting distance of 122. 4 mm. Small amounts of side burr formation occurred during steady-state cutting, and exit burr formation occurred when a tool exited from a workpiece. Parallel 1. 05 micron wide grooves were controllably cut as close as 1. 0 micron apart, and machining of intersecting grooves was successfully demonstrated. 	 To better understand process mechanics including chip formation, side burr formation, and exit burr formation at the small size scale involved, a 3 D finite element model of the process was developed. Validation with experimental results showed that on average the model predicted side burr height to within 2. 8 %, chip curl to within 4. 1 %, and chip thickness to within 25. 4 %. An important finding is that side burr formation is primarily caused ahead of a tool by expansion of material compressed after starting to flow around a tool rather than becoming part of a chip. Also, three exit burrs, two on the sides of a groove and one on the bottom of a groove, are formed when a thin membrane of material forms ahead of a tool and then ruptures as the tool exits a workpiece. Finally, conclusions about the process are drawn and recommendations for future work are presented...|$|E

Since indentation means contact between an indenter and surface of specimen, calibrating the contact area is the key issue in estimating tensile properties. By defining a representative stress and strain, indentation load-depth data can be converted to corresponding stress and strain points from the tensile curve.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{majority}} of fatal avalanches, skiers and snowmobilers apply load to the snow cover which triggers the initial failure in a weak layer. Understanding how the stress due to the dynamic surface load transmits through the snow cover can help people avoid situations where they can trigger avalanches. Capacitive sensors were used to measure this stress within the mountain snow cover. The three main variables affecting stress transmission through the snow cover investigated in this paper are the type of <b>loading,</b> <b>depth</b> and snow cover stratigraphy. At specific depths, snowmobiles added more stress than skiers did, thus increasing the probability of initiating a fracture in a weak layer and releasing a slab avalanche. The increased penetration depth of snowmobiles into the snow cover compared to skiers was {{the primary reason for}} this increase in stress. A decrease in stress was observed with increasing depth.

A wide range of materials with different elastic moduli, yield stresses, strain-hardening exponents, and friction coefficients were examined. Results show that during asignificant portion of the spherical indentation process, the amount of pile-up cannot be related solely to the strain-hardening exponent, as is oftenassumed. Rather, after initially sinking-in at small depths of penetration, the pile-up for many materials evolves and increases gradually asthe indenter is driven into the material. Even when deformation enters the fully developed plastic stage, the pile-up geometry continues to change in manner that can significantly affect the contact area. It is also shown that contact friction affects the pile-up geometry, and that the pile-up heights before and after the indenter is unloaded can be quite different.
