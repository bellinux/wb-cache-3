5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
25|$|Another {{traditional}} {{element that}} Baum intentionally omitted was {{the emphasis on}} romance. He considered romantic <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uninteresting for young children, as well as largely incomprehensible. In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the only element of romance lay {{in the background of}} the Tin Woodman and his love for Nimmie Amee, which explains his condition and does not otherwise affect the tale, and that of Gayelette and the enchantment of the Winged monkeys. The only other stories with such elements were The Scarecrow of Oz and Tik-Tok of Oz, both based on dramatizations, which Baum regarded warily until his readers accepted them.|$|E
25|$|Emin had {{previously}} been invited to include works at the R.A. Summer Exhibitions of 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2001. For 2004's Summer Exhibition, Emin was chosen by fellow artist David Hockney to submit two monoprints, one called And I'd <b>Love</b> <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> The One (1997) and another {{on the topic of}} Emin's abortion called Ripped Up (1995), as that year's theme celebrated the art of drawing as part of the creative process, while 2007 saw Emin exhibit a neon work called Angel (2005). Her art was first included at the Royal Academy as part of the Sensation exhibition in 1997.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{the truth}} is, Lillie would have <b>been</b> quite {{astonished}} <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> told this. She, {{and many other}} women, suppose that they love their husbands, when, unfortunately, they have not {{the beginning of an}} idea what love is. Let me explain it to you, my dear lady. <b>Loving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> admired by a man, <b>loving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> petted by him, <b>loving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> caressed by him, and <b>loving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> praised by him, is not loving a man. All these may be when a woman has no power of loving at all,--they may all be simply because she loves herself, and <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flattered, praised, caressed, coaxed; as a cat likes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coaxed and stroked, and fed with cream, and have a warm corner.|$|R

25|$|One of Caragiale's {{main and}} {{earliest}} types {{is that of}} the young man gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clichés—its main representative is O noapte furtunoasăs Rică Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme to so much success that it took another generation for youthful <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of Ştefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel). At the other end are patriarchal figures, heads of families who seem unable or unwilling to investigate their wives' adulterous relations with younger men. This behavior is notably present in O noapte furtunoasă, where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac. A more complex situation is present in O scrisoare pierdută, where political boss Trahanache cannot tell that his wife Joiţica is having an affair with Tipătescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, is more interested in proving that she is not.|$|E

His friend Herbie Worthington explained: [...] "You wouldn't expect {{somebody}} {{with that kind of}} <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that violent... He just couldn't drink... he simply turned into a bastard". According to journalist and friend Sharon Lawrence, Hendrix [...] "admitted he could not handle hard liquor, which set off a bottled-up anger, a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise".|$|E

[...] Moore changed her schedule at late notice to participate in filming, and Draper wrote Moore's scene as it was being filmed; Draper quickly created a set that depicted the backstage green room of the talk show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Moore and Nat filmed the scene in one take, and Draper was impressed with her son's performance, while saying that Moore's presence added credibility to the project.|$|E

500|$|Fleming's books {{had always}} sold well, but in 1961 sales {{increased}} dramatically. On 17 March 1961, {{four years after}} its publication and {{three years after the}} heavy criticism of Dr. No, an article in Life listed From Russia, with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. Kennedy and Fleming had previously met in Washington. This accolade and the associated publicity led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. Fleming considered From Russia, with <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his best novel, although he admitted, [...] "the great thing is that each one of the books {{seems to have been a}} favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{received}} generally well by critics. Brian Zoromski of IGN stated that: [...] "Any episode that places Michael and Dwight {{outside of their}} normal office environment is set up for some very funny (and usually awkward) situations and 'The Convention' is no exception. Some of the episode's best uncomfortable moments centered on Michael believing he's {{the life of the}} party and that he's Jim's friend. Michael and Dwight pretending to laugh along to an inside joke made by Jim's new boss, Josh, is a prime example. Michael's comment, 'I love inside jokes. <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of one someday,' creates the kind of uncomfortable silence that The Office excels at." [...] Also on IGN, the show received a 9.8 out of 10 [...] "incredible" [...] rating from the site's editorial staff.|$|E

Zipp noted trust and redemption to be themes promising {{to continue in the}} final book, which she thought [...] "would add a greater layer of nuance and complexity to some characters who could sorely use it." [...] Deepti Hajela also pointed out Harry's character development, that he was [...] "no longer a boy wizard; he's a young man, determined to seek out and face a young man's challenges".

500|$|Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney {{chairman}} and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations {{more difficult than}} they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Disney forming Circle 7 Animation and Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney. Despite this announcement, Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors, although a Warner Bros. spokesperson told CNN, [...] "We would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in business with Pixar. They are a great company." [...] After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars from November 4, 2005, to June 9, 2006, was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract, {{to see how things}} would play out between the two companies.|$|E

However, {{towards the end of the}} book, Pari is informed that she was adopted and that she has a brother, Abdullah; she locates him in the United States only to discover that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and has forgotten her. Hosseini stated, [...] "The question is raised a number of times about whether memory is a blessing — something that safeguards in all the things that are dear to you — or is memory a curse — something that makes you relive the most painful parts of your life, the toil, the struggle, the sorrows." [...] Thus, the combination of these events make And the Mountains Echoed [...] "kind of like a fairytale turned on its head".|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Activision {{community}} manager Dan Amrich attempted {{to explain the}} acquisition history of the No One Lives Forever IP in a public video.

After the merger, Activision decided to sell off some IPs and retain others. In order to find out the legal details behind NOLF, Amrich asked his colleagues, saying that [...] "he person that I normally talk to about this stuff does not believe that we [...] currently have the rights.
