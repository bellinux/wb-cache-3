500|$|Author of the 1985 book Fresh: Hip Hop Don't Stop, writer Nelson George further {{elaborated}} on {{the appeal}} of Radio to listeners at the time, describing LL Cool J as a [...] "minimalist homeboy who knows his beats", and stating [...] "You can call it rap, hip hop or street, {{but it really is}} a way of hearing music—and partying hard—that expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids. L.L. Cool J {{is one of the best}} young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E

Moore mentioned that [...] "he whole thing with Watchmen {{has just been}} loads of these <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> synchronicity popping {{up all over the}} place". Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic, citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship. In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater, which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, [...] "We found {{a lot of these things}} started to generate themselves as if by magic", in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the [...] "Gordian Knot Lock Company".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Cooper reprised {{his role}} as Phil Wenneck {{in the third and}} final {{installment}} of The Hangover trilogy, The Hangover Part III, which was poorly reviewed by critics. A reviewer for The Independent argued that Cooper is [...] "reduced to mugging for the camera, offering reaction shots to nothing." [...] Nevertheless, like its preceding entries, the film was a commercial success, grossing $362 million worldwide, and remains one of Cooper's highest-grossing releases. Later that year, he took on the supporting role of an unhinged FBI agent in David O. Russell's crime comedy-drama American Hustle. Inspired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Abscam sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. It also starred Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. American Hustle was a critical and commercial success with global revenues of $251.1 million. Kim Newman of Empire wrote: [...] "Cooper is stuck with the least rewarding role, but keeps finding brilliant <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> business to hold the attention", praising his [...] "spot impersonations of his overly cautious (but smart) boss." [...] Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, but did not win any.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E

Betti recalled, [...] "All of this had to occur in a forest. But where was it? Bava said, 'Don't worry. I will do the forest.' And he found a florist who was selling these little stupid branches with <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> foliage on them, and he began to make them dance in front of the camera!

2500|$|Epicurus's teachings {{represented}} {{a departure from}} the other major Greek thinkers of his period, and before, but was nevertheless founded on many of the same principles as Democritus. Like Democritus, he was an atomist, believing that the fundamental constituents of the world were indivisible <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> matter (atoms; Greek: ἄτομος atom os, [...] "indivisible") flying through empty space (Greek: κενόν kenon). Everything that occurs {{is the result of the}} atoms colliding, rebounding, and becoming entangled with one another. His theory differs from the earlier atomism of Democritus because he admits that atoms do not always follow straight lines but their direction of motion may occasionally exhibit a [...] "swerve" [...] (Greek: παρέγκλισις parenklisis; Latin: clinamen). This allowed him to avoid the determinism implicit in the earlier atomism and to affirm free will.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the annual}} Saturday Book {{recorded}} in 1956 {{a view that}} [...] "London's now nothing but flash coffee bars, with teddies and <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> girls in jeans", the [...] "Edwardian" [...] ("teddy boy") look of the times did not coincide with Bohemian tastes. For women, {{the legacy of the}} [...] "New Look" [...] was still apparent, although hemlines had generally risen as, as one journalist put it in 1963, [...] "photographs of those first bold bearers of the New Look make them seem strangely lost and bewildered, as though they had mistaken their cue and come on stage fifty years late". The Bohemian foci during this period were the jazz clubs and espresso bars of Soho and Fitzrovia. Their habitués usually wore polo necks; {{in the words of one}} social historian, “thousands of pale, duffel-coat-clad students were hunched in coffee bars over their copies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Jack Kerouac”. Various public houses and clubs also catered for Bohemian tastes, notably the Colony Room Club in Soho, opened in 1948 by Muriel Belcher, a lesbian from Birmingham. As with the literary phenomenon of the so-called [...] "Angry Young Men" [...] from 1956 onwards, the image was more a male, than a female, one. However, when the singer Alma Cogan wished to mark her success by buying mink coats for her mother and sister, the actress Sandra Caron, the latter asked for a duffel-coat instead because she wanted to be regarded as a serious actress and [...] "a sort of a beatnik". In 1960 the future author Jacqueline Wilson, who, as a teenager, lived in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, captured this look after spotting two acquaintances in a record shop [...] "in turquoise duffle coats, extremely tight jeans and cha-cha shoes being cuddled by a group of horrible spotty teddy boys".|$|E
