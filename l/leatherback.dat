5|$|All Jaegers except Gipsy Danger are {{dispatched}} to intervene. Otachi destroys Crimson Typhoon, while <b>Leatherback</b> destroys Cherno Alpha and paralyzes Striker Eureka with an EMP blast. Out of options, Pentecost reluctantly allows Mako and Raleigh to pilot Gipsy Danger. Gipsy successfully kills <b>Leatherback</b> and Otachi, while almost destroying Hong Kong in the process. Examining Otachi's body, Newton and Hannibal {{find out that}} it is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out and devours Hannibal but soon dies from being strangled by its own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant’s brain, discovering that The Breach can only open {{in the presence of a}} Kaiju's DNA.|$|E
5|$|Crawling with an {{alternating}} gait, hawksbill tracks left in {{the sand}} are asymmetrical. In contrast, the green sea turtle and the <b>leatherback</b> turtle have a more symmetrical gait.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is a soft-tissue {{feature that}} is rarely {{preserved}} in the fossil record, but rare fossilised skin samples from the Cretaceous period show that some marine reptiles were countershaded. The skins, pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin, reveal that both <b>leatherback</b> turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies.|$|E
5000|$|Adult D. coriacea turtles subsist {{almost entirely}} on {{jellyfish}}. [...] Due to their obligate feeding nature, <b>leatherbacks</b> help control jellyfish populations. <b>Leatherbacks</b> also feed on other soft-bodied organisms, such as tunicates and cephalopods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Leatherbacks</b> {{have been}} viewed as unique among extant {{reptiles}} {{for their ability to}} maintain high body temperatures using metabolically generated heat, or endothermy. Initial studies on their metabolic rates found <b>leatherbacks</b> had resting metabolisms around three times higher than expected for reptiles of their size. However, recent studies using reptile representatives encompassing all the size ranges <b>leatherbacks</b> pass through during ontogeny discovered the resting metabolic rate of a large D. coriacea is not significantly different from predicted results based on allometry.|$|R
5000|$|Rather {{than using}} a high resting metabolism, <b>leatherbacks</b> appear to take {{advantage}} of a high activity rate. Studies on wild D. coriacea discovered individuals may spend as little as 0.1% of the day resting. This constant swimming creates muscle-derived heat. Coupled with their countercurrent heat exchangers, insulating fat covering, and large size, <b>leatherbacks</b> are able to maintain high temperature differentials compared to the surrounding water. Adult <b>leatherbacks</b> have been found with core body temperatures that were [...] above the water in which they were swimming.|$|R
5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the <b>leatherback,</b> loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|E
5|$|Countershading {{existed in}} marine {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both <b>leatherback</b> turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest.|$|E
5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the <b>leatherback</b> sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers {{are difficult to}} determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
50|$|Barbados is host to four {{species of}} nesting turtles (green turtles, loggerheads, hawksbill turtles, and <b>leatherbacks)</b> {{and has the}} second-largest hawksbill turtle {{breeding}} population in the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Despite low {{observer}} coverage, usually 5% or less, it {{was estimated}} that prior to 2001, a total of 666 turtles were caught annually in the Hawaii longline fishery: 418 loggerheads, 146 olive ridleys, 112 <b>leatherbacks</b> and 40 green turtles.|$|R
50|$|Several Caribbean {{countries}} started conservation programs, {{such as the}} St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network, {{focused on}} using ecotourism to highlight the <b>leatherback's</b> plight. On the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica, the village of Parismina has one such initiative. Parismina is an isolated sandbar where {{a large number of}} <b>leatherbacks</b> lay eggs, but poachers abound. Since 1998, the village has been assisting turtles with a hatchery program. The Parismina Social Club is a charitable organization backed by American tourists and expatriates, which collects donations to fund beach patrols. Mayumba National Park in Gabon, Central Africa, was created to protect Africa's most important nesting beach. More than 30,000 turtles nest on Mayumba's beaches between September and April each year.|$|R
5|$|Puerto Rico's turtle fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the hawksbill turtle and the <b>leatherback</b> sea turtle, are critically endangered. Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The spectacled caiman, an introduced species, {{is the only}} representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Jairo Mora Sandoval (March 22, 1987 – May 31, 2013) was a Costa Rican {{environmentalist}} who {{was murdered}} {{while attempting to}} protect <b>leatherback</b> turtle nests. Just before midnight on May 30, 2013, Mora and four female volunteers were abducted {{by a group of}} masked men. The women eventually escaped and informed the police. Mora's bound and beaten body was found on the beach the next morning. An autopsy determined he died by asphyxiation after suffering a blow to the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters of}} {{south-west}} Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks, Atlantic grey seals, <b>leatherback</b> turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion {{in particular are}} recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins {{in the whole of}} the UK. River fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and Arctic char, whilst the Gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is also known for its shellfish, including cockles, limpet, mussels and periwinkles. Herring, mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's seafish.|$|E
50|$|The refuge {{provides}} nesting habitats {{for approximately}} one-fourth of all sea turtles nesting in the United States. About 15,000-20,000 sea turtles nests are laid annually, mostly loggerheads, green sea turtles, and some <b>leatherbacks.</b> The refuge also provides habitat for several other threatened and endangered species.|$|R
40|$|Natural and {{anthropogenic}} activities cause {{injured or}} dead sea turtles to wash ashore or strand along coastlines. In North Carolina, the NC Wildlife Resources Commission collects stranding information on sea turtles {{as part of}} the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network, which was formed in 1980. In this study, I characterized temporal and spatial trends in sea turtle strandings in North Carolina. I described temporal trends in sea turtle strandings by year, season, sex, cause of death (if known), and mean body size, overall and by species. I also looked at spatial trends in stranding locations to determine if they were uniformly or aggregately distributed, overall and seasonally, by dividing the shoreline into 10 km bins and creating histograms. Stranding numbers have increased over the past 23 years, but seem consistent since 1995 when effort {{is believed to have been}} standardized. Strandings generally increased from May through July as well as from November to December. For turtles whose sex was reliably classified by observers, all species except <b>leatherbacks</b> exhibited a heavy female bias; <b>leatherbacks</b> showed a male bias. Mean size of strandings per species appears roughly constant. With the exception of <b>leatherbacks</b> whose mean stranding size corresponded with adults, the mean size of all species corresponde...|$|R
50|$|Barbados is host to four {{species of}} nesting turtles (green turtles, loggerheads, hawksbill turtles, and <b>leatherbacks)</b> {{and has the}} second-largest hawksbill turtle {{breeding}} population in the Caribbean. The driving of vehicles on beaches can crush nests buried {{in the sand and}} such activity should be avoided in nesting areas.|$|R
5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. <b>Leatherback</b> turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
5|$|Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Herman Gottlieb. Hermann {{claims that}} the Breach will {{stabilize}} and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed, while Newton suggests drifting with a Kaiju’s brain {{to learn more about}} them. Newton goes ahead with his plan despite Herman's protests and discovers that the Kaiju are actually bioweapons grown by alien colonists, that live on the dimension {{on the other side of}} the breach called the Anteverse, who plan on wiping out humanity. With Pentecost's permission, Newton searches for black market dealer Hannibal Chau who sells body parts of dead Kaiju to obtain a fresh Kaiju brain to drift with. However, he soon figures out that since drifting is a two-way link, the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his knowledge just as he did theirs. Soon after, two new Kaijus, <b>Leatherback</b> and Otachi, emerge simultaneously to find Newton.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is an apex {{predator}} {{and has a}} reputation for eating anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), spotted dolphins (Stenella), dugongs (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the <b>leatherback</b> (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{are prone}} to long-distance migration. Migration occurs between the cold waters where mature <b>leatherbacks</b> feed, to the {{tropical}} and subtropical beaches in the regions where they hatch. In the Atlantic, females tagged in French Guiana have been recaptured {{on the other side}} of the ocean in Morocco and Spain.|$|R
30|$|Luschi et al. (2006) {{tracked the}} journey of post nesting <b>leatherbacks</b> by {{satellite}} between 1996 and 2003, from their nesting site at the Maputaland coast of KwaZulu-Natal of southeastern Africa, and showed that two females entered the southeast Atlantic Ocean, which demonstrated that turtles can migrate between MZC and Atlantic Ocean waters.|$|R
50|$|The Great Turtle Race is an {{international}} sea turtle conservation event that brings together corporate sponsors and conservation organizations. The race tracks sea turtles as they move toward feeding areas south of the Galapagos Islands after nesting at Playa Grande in Costa Rica’s Las Baulas National Park, the primary nesting area for <b>leatherbacks</b> in the Pacific.|$|R
5|$|In Florida, {{waves of}} over 10feet (3m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two {{occupants}} were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced a sailboat {{that had previously}} been washed ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight <b>leatherback</b> sea turtle nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for about a day. Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall with sand. One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77inches (20mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state. The winds spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami. High winds from Andrea were reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Four {{species of}} turtles {{are found in}} Andros' waters: loggerhead, green, hawksbill and, rarely, the <b>leatherback.</b>|$|E
25|$|Strandings of <b>Leatherback</b> turtles {{have been}} {{recorded}} in Baltic Sea, too. Other notable megafauna include the basking sharks.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} that the larger sea turtles, primarily large loggerheads and <b>leatherbacks</b> are too large to fit through the escape hatches installed in most TEDs. These turtles remain trapped within the net and perish. U.S. legislation introduced in 2003 has attempted {{to address this issue}} by increasing the size of the escape chutes in the devices.|$|R
50|$|Pacific <b>leatherbacks</b> {{divide into}} two {{population}}s. One population nests on beaches in Papua, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands, and forages across the Pacific in the Northern Hemisphere, along {{the coasts of}} California, Oregon, and Washington in North America. The eastern Pacific population forages in the Southern Hemisphere, in waters along the western coast of South America, nesting in Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the effects of jaguars on the {{population}} of marine turtles nesting in Tortuguero National Park, Costa Rica. This study assessed jaguar predation impact on three species of marine turtles (Chelonia mydas, Dermochelys coriáceaand Eretmochelys imbricata) that nest in Tortuguero beach. Jaguar predation data was obtained by using two methodologies, literature review (historical records prior the year 2005) and weekly surveys along the 29 km stretch of beach during the period 2005 - 2013. Our results indicated that jaguar predation has increased from one marine turtle in 1981 to 198 in 2013. Jaguars consumed annually an average of 120 (SD= 45) and 2 (SD= 3) green turtles and <b>leatherbacks</b> in Tortuguero beach, respectively. Based on our results we concluded that jaguars do not represent a threat to the population of green turtles that nest in Tortuguero beach, and it is not the main cause for population decline for <b>leatherbacks</b> and hawksbills. Future research should focus on continuing to monitor this predator-prey relationship as well as the factors that influence it so the proper management decisions can be taken...|$|R
25|$|The Río de la Plata is {{a habitat}} for the loggerhead sea turtle, green sea turtle, <b>leatherback</b> sea turtle, the rare La Plata dolphin, and {{many species of}} fish.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles: eastern diamondback and pygmy rattlesnakes, gopher tortoise, {{green and}} <b>leatherback</b> sea turtles, and eastern indigo snake. In 2012, {{there were about}} one million American {{alligators}} and 1,500 crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|The aquatic {{species are}} not left with sharks, {{humpback}} whales, dolphins and <b>leatherback</b> turtles {{that come to}} lay on the beaches. The equatorial forest and the mangroves are home to abundant species of precious trees and plants.|$|E
50|$|Dead <b>leatherbacks</b> that wash ashore are microecosystems while decomposing. In 1996, a drowned carcass held sarcophagid and calliphorid flies {{after being}} picked open {{by a pair}} of Coragyps atratus vultures. Infestation by carrion-eating beetles of the {{families}} Scarabaeidae, Carabidae, and Tenebrionidae soon followed. After days of decomposition, beetles from the families Histeridae and Staphylinidae and anthomyiid flies invaded the corpse, as well. Organisms from more than a dozen families took part in consuming the carcass.|$|R
50|$|The four longest rivers are the Essequibo at 1010 km long, the Courantyne River at 724 km, the Berbice at 595 km, and the Demerara at 346 km. The Corentyne river {{forms the}} border with Suriname. At {{the mouth of the}} Essequibo are several large islands, {{including}} the 145 km wide Shell Beach lies along the northwest coast, which is also a major breeding area for sea turtles (mainly <b>leatherbacks)</b> and other wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Juveniles often {{reside in}} coastal feeding grounds {{as is the}} case with green sea turtles and loggerheads. Adult sea turtles can be divided into 3 {{categories}} according to their movements. <b>Leatherbacks</b> and olive ridley turtles roam widely and unpredictably before returning to specific breeding sites. Satellite tracking of <b>leatherbacks</b> showed however that they tended to stay within relatively food-rich areas of the ocean during their migration. Kemp's ridley sea turtles, loggerheads and flatback sea turtles migrate between breeding areas and a series of coastal foraging areas. Green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles shuttle between fixed foraging and nesting sites. Both species of ridley sea turtle nest in large aggregations, a phenomenon called an arribada. It is thought to be an adaptation against predators — there are simply too many eggs for the predators to consume. One unifying aspect of sea turtle migrations is their ability to return to specific nesting sites over vast areas of ocean year after year. They may return to the beach where they hatched, an ability called natal philopatry and this has been demonstrated in green turtles using mitochondrial DNA analysis.|$|R
