40|$|During this {{training}} course, I {{study in the}} Microgravity <b>Labotory</b> at the Castelldefels School of Technology (EPSC) of the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC). Today, the NASA turns on the conquest of the Moon. It is for it that studies are made so that the man can live in this new environment. The problem of the waste is then evoked, because the Moon having a gravity much lower than ours, sorting of the waste will raise problem. Furthermore, {{it is necessary to}} know that without gravity (or little, as the case of the Moon), all which is solid and liquid do not part in a homogeneous way as we can see it on Earth. So, my study bases itself on the separation of sediments in a fluid. Thus, the work have consisted on studying the effects of the acoustic wave on bubbles and particles. The influence of the acoustic wave on the bubbles and the particles has been studied for a long time by many researchers...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that habitat {{selections}} of riverine fish differ {{within and between}} rivers. In our past study, the preference intensity of Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes) to three environmental factors of water depth, current velocity and cover ratio was quantified on laboratory open-channel experiments for developing a general habitat preference model. A simplified fuzzy reasoning method was introduced in consideration of essential vagueness of fish behaviors. The fuzzy preference intensity model was then optimally searched with a simple genetic algorithm and was successfully verified by both <b>labotory</b> water tank experiments and on-the-spot examination. The results indicated that this general model showed agreement between predicted and observed spatial distribution of target fish, but the habitat preference models are still desired to be developed through field studies. In this study, we propose and adaptive modeling technique for instream fish habitat preference by conjugating the fish preference intensify model developed in laboratory experiments. The adaptive prediction model was also determined by simple genetic algorithm, which enabled us to model the habitat preference of instream resident fosh with insufficient data...|$|E
40|$|Title: Hobby runners' {{nutrition}} {{during and}} after a long-distance performance Objectives: The main aim of the thesis was to find out hobby runners' nutritional strategies {{during and after}} long-distance performance. Then to examine their diet from qualitative and quantitative view of points. By labratory testing find out maximal functional parameters and body composition. Use of mouth rinse of carbohydrate solution during 60 minutes running performance. Methods: There were used biomedical measurements as body composition, bioelectrical impedance, <b>labotory</b> spiroergometric measuring by maximal stress testing. Field trials using sporttesters and mouth rinse of carbohydrate solution during 60 min running performance. Also during the 60 min running performance there was use of Borg's RPE scale to evaluate subjective perceived exertion. Another methods were interview with open questions and online survey. Results: Hobby runners'nutrition during and after long- distance performance is not in agreement with sports nutrition requirements, especially with requirements to maximalize the performance. Nutritional strategies don't meet the conditions to optimalize body regeneration and fullfilling energy substrates. The positive effect of 8 % carbohydrate solution mouth rinse on 60 min running performance was [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Diversity 22 local {{varieties}} of rice South Sumatra {{has the potential}} to be developed into rice varieties. The similarity (similarity) among 22 local {{varieties of}} rice South Sumatra became one of the obstacles for scientists to develop rice varieties. One solution to this problem is to determine the genetic relatedness between 22 rice local vaietas South Sumatra. Identification of genetic relatedness among 22 local varieties of rice South Sumatra can be carried out using PCR-RAPD. This study aims to determine the phylogenetic relationship among 22 local varieties of rice South Sumatra. This research about DNA isolation and visualitation has been carried out in August 2015 until December 2015 in Microbiology Laboratory and Laboratory of Genetics and Biotechnology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Sriwijaya and research about DNA quality and quantity test and PCR-RAPD has been done in Biotechnology <b>Labotory</b> Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Sriwijaya University. Obtained 22 local varieties of rice accessions South Sumatra. Genetic relatedness identified using PCR-RAPD technique. 7 primer (OPA, OPA- 9, OPA- 10, OPA- 13, OPA- 16, OPA- 19, OPB- 8) was used for amplification. Local varieties of rice South Sumatra is divided into two major groups in association coefficient of 0. 76, namely groups A and B. Group A consists of groups A 1 and A 2 in association coefficient of 0. 78. In the large group B also consists of two groups: the B 1 and B 2 in association coefficient of 0. 84. Local varieties of rice genetic relatedness South Sumatra are not influenced by geographical location...|$|E
