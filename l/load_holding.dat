40|$|Dwell {{sensitivity}} in {{titanium alloys}} is generally {{attributed to the}} phenomenon of load shedding, which is a time dependent redistribution of stress from weak grains, with their c-axis perpendicular to the loading direction, to strong grains, with their c-axis approximately parallel to the loading direction. This leads {{to the formation of}} internal quasi-cleavage facets on the basal planes of strong grains. In this paper, the effect of <b>load</b> <b>holds</b> on the fatigue behaviour of drawn Ti- 6 Al- 4 V wires is investigated, because these wires do not contain strong α grains. It has been found that this leads to a different dwell fatigue behaviour compared to what has been described in literature. In the case of drawn wires, introducing <b>load</b> <b>holds</b> promoted crack initiation at the surface, through the formation of a facet on a prismatic plane of a surface grain that was oriented for very easy prismatic slip. This was confirmed by sectioning facets, using focused ion beam milling, and electron backscatter diffraction measurements. Because of the specific crystallographic texture of drawn wires, the phenomenon of load shedding is less pronounced, and there is no formation of internal facets. The amount of cycles to failure was reduced by two to three orders of magnitude compared to fatigue tests without <b>load</b> <b>holds.</b> The time to failure remained similar, and was even higher for some dwell fatigue tests. There was a significant amount of strain accumulation during dwell fatigue tests. The maximum strain increased more rapidly in tests with 30 s <b>load</b> <b>holds</b> compared to tests with 120 s <b>load</b> <b>holds,</b> due to creep recovery during the periods in between <b>load</b> <b>holds.</b> During these periods, the strain decreased, even though a small tensile load was still applied. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the long-term mechanical, hydraulic, and transport characteristics of rock fractures should be predicted in advance by considering {{the issue of the}} underground deposits of the energy byproducts of high-level radioactive waste. This paper presents slide-hold-slide direct shear–flow coupling experiments conducted for mortar and granite specimens with single fractures so as to investigate the effects of <b>load</b> <b>holding</b> on the mechanical properties of rock joints. From the experimental results, it is confirmed that the shear strength of the mortar replica specimens increases and the permeability decreases during 3 days of <b>load</b> <b>holding.</b> However, no significant changes are observed for the mechanical or the hydro-mechanical properties of the granite specimen even after 20 days of <b>load</b> <b>holding.</b> It is also confirmed that the shear strength of the mortar specimens increases in both short- and long-time holding cases. However, the {{evolution of}} shear strength recovery is found to be different for the two cases. This is because the dominant factor in the shear strength recovery during short-time holding may be attributed to a purely mechanical process, like creep deformation at the contacting asperities, while the shear strength recovery during long-time holding is affected by both mechanical and chemical processes. Moreover, to reproduce the shear strength recovery during short-time holding, we develop a direct shear model by employing a temporal variation in the dilation that occurs during <b>load</b> <b>holding.</b> The model predictions are in relatively good agreement with the experimental observations in the range of the short-holding period...|$|E

However, the behavior of damage evolution in T 700 / 6808 composite when it suffered from tensile loading is seldom researched. In this paper, the acoustic emission (AE) technology is employed to research the process of damage evolution in T 700 / 6808 composite under tensile loading. Results show that the damage in T 700 / 6808 composite is small in the initial stage of tensile loading, and main damage is the matrix cracking.

40|$|International audienceCallovo-Oxfordian argillite, {{obtained}} from the ANDRA underground research laboratory in Meuse/Haute-Marne (France), is characterized as a multiphase material. The argillite is composed of carbonate inclusions (10 - 50 mu m) embedded in an argillaceous matrix (representing expanding clay minerals, such as smectites). The matrix itself is also multiphase, composed of clay aggregates of 1 pm-size carbonate and quartz inclusions. The high sensitivity of the mechanical behaviour of argillite to saturation is an important characteristic of this material {{as it has been}} previously demonstrated in macro-scale mechanical experiments performed under varying degrees of humidity. The study presented here consists of grids of nano-indentation tests performed under controlled saturation conditions. The influence of the <b>load</b> <b>hold</b> time before unloading has been studied. Series of indentations were performed without or with <b>load</b> <b>hold,</b> which led to consider instantaneous or deferred unloading moduli respectively. The experimental procedure employed allows the micro-mechanical properties of the different phases (matrix and inclusions) to be determined under controlled hydration and therefore under partially, saturated conditions. Several series of measurements were performed at relative humidity levels of 50 %, 85 %, 90 % and 95 %, and at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. A statistical analysis enabled to discriminate the deferred unloading modulus of the different phases. At 50 % humidity, we measured a mean deferred unloading modulus of 16 GPa for the clay matrix (a mean instantaneous unloading modulus of 13 GPa was observed for the clay matrix and moduli higher than 70 GPa were measured for the carbonate macro-inclusions). The mean deferred unloading modulus of the matrix appears to decrease with increasing saturation; at 95 % humidity (near-saturation) it is less than 5 GPa. However, it was impossible to verify the instantaneous unloading modulus of the carbonate macro-indusions at this high-level of saturation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} and describes an innovative design solution for a compact Electro-Hydraulic Actuator (EHA). Although {{the current trend}} in many mobile applications is towards the use of Electro Mechanical Solutions (EMAS) instead of Hydraulic Actuation Systems (HAS), HEAs can actually represent the best technological compromise. In fact, EHAs can combine the {{power to weight ratio}} advantage of hydraulic technology with the versatility and ease of installation and control of electric technology. Compared to EMAS, which are often equipped with low efficient <b>load</b> <b>holding</b> mechanisms, EHAs can also offer superior energy efficiency. Moreover, the EHAs do not suffer of jamming problems, which make them a strong candidate to be employed in harsh environments. Applications of EHAs like the one proposed in this work include aircrafts, cargo and vehicle doors, hatches and landing gears. The system studied in this research is based on miniature bi-directional gear pump (from 0. 13 cc/rev), specifically designed to maximize performance in terms of efficiency, noise emissions and durability for the reference application. This pump is used in a system layout architecture that includes built-in valves to allow a power on demand strategy control of a differential linear actuator. In particular, a novel pressure compensation system was formulated to minimize power losses associated with the internal lubricating gaps in the whole field of operation. The paper details the numerical modelling of the system, showing also results which describe its main features of operation. Advantages in terms of energy consumption, with respect to a more common configuration of EHA are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|A knuckle boom crane is {{characterized}} by being a versatile machine that during operation experiences large load variations caused by the changes in position and payload. Common uses are as a mobile loader crane mounted on trucks and in offshore applications. Since their introduction the use of counterbalance valves (CBV) have been the de facto standard on load-carrying hydraulically actuated applications like the knuckle boom crane. It offers a simple and practical solution {{to one of the}} issues of mobile cranes: Controlling the load safely when lowering. By law (e. g. European Standard) the hydraulic circuit of load-carrying applications is required to contain a <b>load</b> <b>holding</b> protection device. The classical way of actuating such a crane is to use a circuit containing a pressure compensator valve and a directional control valve (DCV) in series with a CBV. This circuit {{is referred to as the}} base circuit. It is well known that this combination of valve components tends to introduce instability in the base circuit. This is mainly a problem when the controlled actuator is subjected to a negative load, because this will require the CBV to throttle the return ﬂow. The instability presents itself as pressure oscillations in the hydraulic circuit which cause the mechanical structure to oscillate. The consequence of the oscillations is a decreased accuracy of the boom motion which create a safety risk, reduces productivity and introduces an undesirable extra fatigue load. The objective of this project was to investigate the oscillations created in the hydraulic circuit of knuckle boom cranes and reduce their severity. The effort has mainly been split in two: First, was looked into existing solutions with the focus on the ones not requiring control systems to function. This was done with reliability and robustness in mind. The investigation identiﬁed the pressure control valve (PCV) as the best commercially available solution. The use of a PCV to control the inlet ﬂow in crane applications was rather uncharted territory. The valve, a DCV with a pressure control spool manufactured by Danfoss, has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A linear stability analysis has been performed with the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. This analysis of the valve used together with a hydraulically actuated experimental setup indicates that the combination is stable in all situations. The use of the pressure control spool in the DCV is a simple and robust solution to the stability problem of the base circuit. Not related to the PCV’s ability to reduce the oscillations the use of it in knuckle boom cranes, however, comes with certain drawbacks. The drawbacks include a load dependent dead band and a load dependent inlet ﬂow. In order to achieve similar behavior as the normal pressure compensated DCV a closed loop control system is required. These issues are addressed in this project, where control schemes are proposed to handle them. In the second part the perspective of the search was broadened to include solutions using control systems. This has lead to the development of a novel, patent pending, concept that signiﬁcantly reduces the oscillations of the base circuit. It introduces a secondary circuit where a low-pass ﬁltered value of the load pressure is generated and fed back to the compensator of the ﬂow supply valve. The work has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement of stability obtained for a system with the novel concept implemented both theoretically and experimentally. The stability has been investigated both using a linear and a nonlinear model of a hydraulically actuated experimental setup. The presented novel concept circuit has the same steady state characteristics as the base circuit but without the corresponding oscillatory nature. Because the main spool of the DCV is not used for stabilising the system, the novel concept can be combined with any feedback control strategy. In this project, the novel concept is presented with linear actuators only. However,its use covers circuits with rotational actuators and CBV’s as well. The base circuit is used as a reference for comparison. Therefore, the stability of the base circuit is also investigated with a linear model...|$|E

In this study, new {{insight into the}} phase transformation of diamond-cubic germanium (dc-Ge) was attempted by controlled cyclic nanoindentation combined with Raman spectroscopic analysis. Phase transformation from dc-Ge to rhombohedral phase (r 8 -Ge) was experimentally confirmed for both single and cyclic nanoindentation under high loading/unloading rates. However, compared to single indentation, double cyclic indentation with a low <b>holding</b> <b>load</b> between the cycles caused more frequent phase transformation events.
