The analysis of 22, 500 discharges shows that more than 18 % of disruptions are due to <b>locked</b> or quasi-stationary <b>modes</b> with rotating precursors (not including born <b>locked</b> <b>modes).</b> A parameter formulated by the plasma internal inductance $l_i$ divided by the safety factor at 95 % of the poloidal flux, $q_{ 95 }$, is found to exhibit predictive capability over whether a <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> will cause a disruption or not, and does so up to hundreds of milliseconds before the disruption. Within 20 ms of the disruption, the shortest distance between the island separatrix and the unperturbed last closed flux surface, referred to as $d_{edge}$, performs comparably to $l_i/q_{ 95 }$ {{in its ability to}} discriminate disruptive <b>locked</b> <b>modes.</b> Out of all parameters considered, $d_{edge}$ also correlates best with the duration of the <b>locked</b> <b>mode.</b> Within 50 ms of a <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> disruption, average behavior includes exponential growth of the $n= 1 $ perturbed field, which might be due to the 2 / 1 <b>locked</b> <b>mode.</b> Even assuming the aforementioned 2 / 1 growth, disruptivity following a <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> shows little dependence on island width up to 20 ms before the disruption. Separately, greater deceleration of the rotating precursor is observed when the wall torque is large. At <b>locking,</b> <b>modes</b> are often observed to align with a residual error field.

More torque is directed to the rear wheels than in 4WD Auto mode to provide greater power off the line, better control when accelerating on snowy or loose surfaces, and enhanced stability at high speeds.

40|$|In the FFX (reversed field experiment), one of {{the most}} {{important}} reversed field pinch (RFP) devices in the fusion community, wall <b>locked</b> <b>modes</b> have always been present. Recently, a new technique has demonstrated the possibility of inducing a continuous rotation of the modes with respect to the wall. The non-linear coupling of the m= 0 and m= 1 modes has been used to decouple the modes themselves, and the mode rotation has been induced by means of a pre-programmed waveform of a toroidal magnetic field rotating ripple. Consequently, a feedback system for detecting the <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> position along the toroidal co-ordinate and able to create a continuous rotation with variable speed has been envisaged. Neural networks (NNs) represent a promising approach for rapid detection of the <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> angular position in such a system, and in this paper the performances of different NNs trained to identify the <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> position are compared and discussed.

40|$|OAK A 271 MULTI-MODE ERROR FIELD CORRECTION ON THE DIII-D TOKAMAK. Error field {{optimization}} on DIII-D tokamak plasma discharges has routinely {{been done}} {{for the last ten}} years {{with the use of the}} external ''n = 1 coil'' or the ''C-coil''. The optimum level of correction coil current is determined by the ability to avoid the <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> instability and access previously unstable parameter space at low densities. The <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> typically has toroidal and poloidal mode numbers n = 1 and m = 2, respectively, and it is this component that initially determined the correction coil current and phase. Realization of the importance of nearby n = 1 mode components m = 1 and m = 3 has led to a revision of the error field correction algorithm. Viscous and toroidal mode coupling effects suggested the need for additional terms in the expression for the radial ''penetration'' field B{sub pen} that can induce a <b>locked</b> <b>mode.</b> To incorporate these effects, the low density <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> threshold database was expanded. A database of discharges at various toroidal fields, plasma currents, and safety factors was supplement 4 ed with data from an experiment in which the fields of the n = 1 coil and C-coil were combined, allowing the poloidal mode spectrum of the error field to be varied. A multivariate regression analysis of this new low density <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> database was done to determine the low density <b>locked</b> <b>mode</b> threshold scaling relationship n{sub e} {proportional_to} B{sub T}{sup - 0. 01 } q{sub 95 }{sup - 0. 79 } B{sub pen} and the coefficients of the poloidal mode components in the expression for B{sub pen}.
