60|$|In {{those days}} {{there were not}} so many sailors' homes and temperance coffee-houses as there are now. In the {{locality}} about which we write there were none. If Jack wanted his <b>lunch</b> <b>or</b> his <b>dinner</b> he found the low tavern almost {{the only place in}} which he could get it comfortably. Tobacco smoke was no objection to him;--he rather liked it. Swearing did not shock him;--he was used to it. Gentle folk are apt to err here too. Being shocked at gross sin does not necessarily imply goodness of heart; it implies nothing more than the being unused to witness gross sin. Goodness of heart may go along with this capacity of being shocked, so, equally, may badness of heart; but neither of them is implied by it.|$|R
