We then introduce the notion of classification calibration dimension of a multiclass <b>loss</b> <b>matrix,</b> which measures the smallest `size' of a prediction space for which it is possible to design a convex surrogate that is classification calibrated with respect to the <b>loss</b> <b>matrix.</b> We derive both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze various loss matrices. In particular, as one application, we provide a different route from the recent result of Duchi et al. (2010) for analyzing the difficulty of designing `low-dimensional' convex surrogates that are consistent with respect to pairwise subset ranking losses. We anticipate the classification calibration dimension may prove to be a useful tool in the study and design of surrogate losses for general multiclass learning problems...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} online linear optimization over symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, {{which has}} various applications including the online collaborative filtering. The problem is formulated as a repeated {{game between the}} algorithm and the adversary, where in each round t the algorithm and the adversary choose matrices X_t and L_t, respectively, and then the algorithm suffers a loss given by the Frobenius inner product of X_t and L_t. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the cumulative loss. We can employ a standard framework called Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) for designing algorithms, {{where we need to}} choose an appropriate regularization function to obtain a good performance guarantee. We show that the log-determinant regularization works better than other popular regularization functions in the case where the <b>loss</b> <b>matrices</b> L_t are all sparse. Using this property, we show that our algorithm achieves an optimal performance guarantee for the online collaborative filtering. The technical contribution of the paper is to develop a new technique of deriving performance bounds by exploiting the property of strong convexity of the log-determinant with respect to the <b>loss</b> <b>matrices,</b> while in the previous analysis the strong convexity is defined with respect to a norm. Intuitively, skipping the norm analysis results in the improved bound. Moreover, we apply our method to online linear optimization over vectors and show that the FTRL with the Burg entropy regularizer, which is the analogue of the log-determinant regularizer in the vector case, works well.

40|$|Consider the {{following}} canonical online learning problem with matrices [WK 06]: In each trial t the algorithm chooses a density matrix Wt ∈ Rn×n (i. e., a positive semi-definite matrix with trace one). Then nature chooses a symmetric <b>loss</b> <b>matrix</b> Lt ∈ Rn×n whose eigenvalues {{lie in the}} interval [0, 1] and the algorithms incurs loss tr(WtLt). The goal is to find algorithms that for any sequence of trials have small regret against the best dyad chosen in hindsight. Here a dyad is an outer product uu ⊤ of a unit vector u in Rn. More precisely the regret after T trials is defined as follows: T∑ t= 1 tr(WtLt) − L ∗, where L ∗ = inf u:‖u‖= 1 tr (uu ⊤) L≤T with L≤T = T∑ Lt.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} an {{experimental study of}} pruning methods for decision tree classiers when the goal is minimizing loss rather than er-ror. In addition to two common methods for error minimization, CART's cost-complexity pruning and C 4. 5 's error-based pruning, we study the ex-tension of cost-complexity pruning to loss and one pruning variant based on the Laplace correction. We perform an empirical comparison of these methods and evaluate them with respect to loss. We found that apply-ing the Laplace correction to estimate the probability distributions at the leaves was benecial to all pruning methods. Unlike in error minimiza-tion, and somewhat surprisingly, performing no pruning led to results that were on par with other methods {{in terms of the}} evaluation criteria. The main advantage of pruning was in the reduction of the decision tree size, sometimes by a factor of ten. While no method dominated others on all datasets, even for the same domain dierent pruning mechanisms are better for dierent <b>loss</b> <b>matrices...</b>|$|R

40|$|Passive {{acoustic}} monitoring {{is increasingly}} {{used to study}} the distribution and migration of marine mammals. Marine mammal vocalizations are transient sounds, but the combined sound energy of a population continuously repeating a vocalization, {{adds up to a}} quasi-continuous chorus. Marine mammal choruses can be identified as peaks in ocean ambient noise spectra. In the North Atlantic, the fin whale chorus is commonly observed as peak at 20 Hz. This thesis proposes a method to estimate the distribution of vocalizing fin whales based on a set of fin whale chorus recordings. This is an extremely under-determined inverse problem. The method is based on Bayesian inverse theory and uses simulated annealing to estimate the most likely distribution of sound sources (vocalizing whales) on a geodesic grid. This includes calculating a transmission <b>loss</b> <b>matrix</b> connecting all grid nodes and recorders, using an arbitrary sound propagation model. Two models were successfully implemented: geometrical spreading and the ray trace model BELLHOP. The inversion method was tested under different scenarios. The results indicated that an imprecise transmission <b>loss</b> <b>matrix</b> is tolerated by the inversion method. The accuracy of the method depended mainly on the number and distribution of recorders. For the Norwegian sea, simulations showed that fin whale chorus inversion is possible using as few as 12 recorders between Iceland and Svalbard. An inversion based on data from published fin whale chorus observations indicated realistic winter distribution patterns. Existing methods to study marine mammal distribution are often confined to the summer months and a limited area. Future application of the proposed method admits automatic year-round monitoring of marine mammal distribution on a basin-wide scale...|$|E

Intramedullary temperature was 15 C {{at a depth of}} 5 mm. In 10 control animals oil at 37 or 5 C was circulated over the exposed cords (normal-normothermic and normal-hypothermic controls with 1 and 2 hours hypothermia). Three animals had circulatory arrest and recirculation in normothermia (ischemic-normothermic) and 3 in hypothermia (ischemic-simultaneous hypothermia). Three had circulatory arrest and 15 minutes of recirculation in normothermia followed by 1 hour of hypothermia (ischemic-delayed hypothermia). The medial and lateral portions of the anterior gray horns of the last lumbar spinal segment were studied in the light and electron microscopes. Ischemic-normothermic tissue showed 20 % shrinkage in mean areas of neuronal perikarya and massive “watery” swelling of astrocytic cell bodies and processes. Within neuronal perikarya and dendrites, cytoplasm increased in electron density, ribosomes dispersed, Golgi apparatus swelled and mitochondria swelled with <b>loss</b> of <b>matrix</b> density and disruption of cristae. Axons and axon terminals did not increase in size, but mitochondria within these structures doubled in size without <b>loss</b> of <b>matrix</b> density or change in pattern of cristae. Synaptic vesicles were no longer uniform in size, and they were clumped away from the synaptic cleft and diminished in number. Lysosomes were unchanged in appearance and size. Mitochondria of astrocytes underwent approximately fourfold enlargement without <b>loss</b> of <b>matrix</b> density or pattern of cristae. Bundles of astrocytic microfilaments were fragmented, spread apart and diminished in quantity. Oligodendroglia and endothelial cells were unchanged. Normal-hypothermic animals were similar to normal-normothermic except for clefts in rough endoplasmic reticulum of neurons and dendrites. These clefts were formed by a separation of the cisternal membrane from the adjacent row of ribosomal rosettes. Ischemic-simultaneous hypothermia animals had findings identical to normal-hypothermic animals. Ischemic-delayed hypothermia animals were similar to ischemic-normothermic animals except for less swelling of astrocytic processes, greater swelling of astrocytic mitochondria and less alteration of microfilaments. The findings show that ischemia in normothermia brings about alterations in virtually every organelle of the neurronal perikaryon except the lysosome. Simultaneous hypothermia in ischemia prevents the protean alterations of ischemia, whereas hypothermia delayed until after the ischemic episode only slightly modifies the cellular lesions found in ischemic-normothermic animals...|$|R
