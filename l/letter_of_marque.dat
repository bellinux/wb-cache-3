5|$|On 26 March, Enfant de Patria {{arrived at}} Plymouth. Patria, of 500 tons (bm), 10 guns, and 60 men, had sailed from France for Île de France when Emerald and Amethyst {{captured}} her. Two days later Emerald captured a second <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> the 4-gun Aventurier, {{bound for the}} relief of Guadeloupe. She had a crew of 30 men.|$|E
5|$|Plans changed, and Tarleton {{appointed}} Captain James Thomson (or Thompson) {{to command}} of Prince of Wales, {{with the intent}} of sailing her on the Liverpool-Africa trade, i.e., as a slaver. James Thomson received a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> on 4 September 1793. His letter indicated that he would have a crew of 40 men.|$|E

5|$|After Prince of Wales {{return to}} Britain her owners {{deployed}} {{her as a}} whaler in the South Seas fisheries. She was later used as a privateer under a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> before performing a voyage as a slave ship. After a period under French control, she returned to Britain and was used to carry trade goods between London, the West Indies and the Mediterranean. The last records of her existence date to 1810; her fate thereafter is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Mather & Co. sold Prince of Wales to Clayton Tarleton in 1793. Tarleton armed {{her with}} twenty 6-pounder guns and placed her {{under the command}} of William Scales. Scales {{received}} a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> on 1 March 1793. The letter indicated that Prince of Wales had a crew of 100 men, many more than she needed to sail her, suggesting that Tarleton intended her to sail as a privateer.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Machias men {{refitted}} {{and armed}} {{a variety of}} ships—including the Margaretta—and sailed off looking for battle with the British. The Machias Liberty and the Diligent were used to intercept merchant ships that were supplying the British in the Siege of Boston. Jeremiah O'Brien and John Lambert built a twenty-gun ship and began privateering under an American <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque.</b> Both men were commissioned into the Continental Navy for their work. O'Brien was captured {{off the coast of}} New York in late 1777, but was able to escape from prison in Britain to continue privateering throughout the war.|$|E
5000|$|President Davis was not {{confident}} of his executive authority to issue <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> and called {{a special session}} of Congress on April 29 to formally authorize the hiring of privateers {{in the name of}} the Confederate States. On 6 May the Confederate Congress passed [...] "An act recognizing the existence of war between the United States and the Confederate States, and concerning <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> prizes, and prize goods." [...] Then, on May 14, 1861, [...] "An act regulating the sale of prizes and the distribution thereof," [...] was also passed. Both acts granted the president power to issue <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> and detailed regulations as to the conditions on which <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> should be granted to private vessels, the conduct and behavior of the officers and crews of such vessels, and the disposal of such prizes made by privateer crews. The manner in which Confederate privateers operated was generally similar to those of privateers of the United States or of European nations.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Bonnet resumed command, a bumboat's crew {{told him}} that Blackbeard was moored in Ocracoke Inlet. Bonnet set sail at once to hunt down his treacherous ex-confederate, but could not find him, and Bonnet never met Blackbeard again. Although Bonnet {{apparently}} never discarded his hopes of reaching St. Thomas and getting his <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> two pressing problems now tempted him back into piracy. First, Blackbeard had stolen the food and supplies {{he and his men}} needed to subsist (one pirate testified at his trial that no more than ten or eleven barrels remained aboard the Revenge). Second, St. Thomas was now {{in the midst of the}} Atlantic hurricane season, which would last until autumn. However, returning to freebooting meant nullifying Bonnet's pardon.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ about Morgan's {{activities}} in 1666. H. R. Allen, in his biography of Morgan, considers the privateer was the second-in-command to Captain Edward Mansvelt. Mansvelt had been issued a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> {{for the invasion}} of Curaçao, {{although he did not}} attack Willemstad, the main city, either after he decided that it was too well-defended or that there was insufficient plunder. Alternatively, Jan Rogoziński and Stephan Talty, in their histories of Morgan and piracy, record that during the year, Morgan oversaw the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica; Fort Charles at Port Royal was partly constructed under his leadership. It was around this time that Morgan purchased his first plantation on Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Surcouf {{started his}} career as a sailor and officer on the slave ships Aurore, Courrier d'Afrique and Navigateur. Having risen to captain, and in spite of the {{prohibition}} of slave trading by the National Convention in 1793, he engaged in the business himself as a captain on Créole. He then captained the merchantman Émilie, on which he engaged in commerce raiding despite lacking a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque.</b> He preyed on British shipping, capturing the East Indiaman Triton, before returning to Île de France in the Indian Ocean, where his prizes were confiscated. He then returned to France, where he obtained prize money from the government.|$|E

50|$|The United States however, {{was not a}} signatory. During the American Civil War, Confederate privateers cruised against Union {{merchant}} shipping. Likewise the Union (though {{refusing to}} recognize the legitimacy <b>of</b> Confederate <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque)</b> allowed its navy to take Confederate vessels as prizes. Under US Constitution Article 1 Section 8, it is still theoretically possible for Congress to authorize <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> {{but in the last}} 150 years it has not done so.|$|R
5|$|Much of Morgan's {{early life}} is unknown. He {{was born in}} south Wales, {{but it is not}} known how {{he made his way to}} the West Indies, or how he began his career as a privateer. He was {{probably}} a member of a group of raiders led by Sir Christopher Myngs in the early 1660s. Morgan became a close friend of Sir Thomas Modyford, the Governor of Jamaica. When diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of England and Spain worsened in 1667, Modyford gave Morgan a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> a licence to attack and seize Spanish vessels. Morgan subsequently conducted successful and highly lucrative raids on Puerto Principe (now Camagüey in modern Cuba) and Porto Bello (in modern Panama). In 1668 he sailed for Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo in modern-day Venezuela. He raided and plundered both cities before destroying a large Spanish squadron as he escaped.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thomas Modyford {{had been}} {{appointed}} the Governor of Jamaica in February 1664 with instructions to limit {{the activities of the}} privateers; he made a proclamation against their activities on 11 June 1664, but economic practicalities led to him reversing the policy {{by the end of the}} month. About 1,500 privateers used Jamaica as a base for their activity and brought significant revenue to the island. As the planting community of 5,000 was still new and developing, the revenue from the privateers was needed to avoid economic collapse. A privateer was granted a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> which gave him a licence to attack and seize vessels, normally of a specific country, or with conditions attached. A portion of all spoils obtained by the privateers was given to the sovereign or the issuing ambassador.|$|E
5|$|Amazon {{went on to}} join Nelson in {{the chase}} to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on {{specific}} instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but {{did not want to}} lose time by ordering his ships to heave to. Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly a yard of ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. Principe was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four swivels. Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain François Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard Principe, as was a considerable amount of specie.|$|E
