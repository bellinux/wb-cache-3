50|$|Hypera nigrirostris, {{commonly}} known as the <b>lesser</b> <b>clover</b> leaf <b>weevil,</b> is a species of weevil that is native to Europe and northern Africa and has been introduced to North America and Japan.

50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>clover</b> leaf <b>weevil</b> is an oligophage, {{limited to}} certain {{plants in the}} legume family. Its main hosts are red clover (Trifolium pratense), white clover (T. repens) and alsike clover (T. hybridum), {{but it can also}} feed on pea, alfalfa and vetch. Adults chew holes in leaves and create hollows in stems, while the larvae target the buds and flowers, each larva {{damaging}} some three or four inflorescences.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>clover</b> leaf <b>weevil</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 3 to 4 mm. The rostrum or beak is three times {{as long as it}} is broad, and is notched at its base. The eyes are large, {{transverse}} and non-protuberant. The frons is narrower than the rostrum while the pronotum is broad. The proximal ends of the elytra have parallel sides and bear prominent humeral humps. The general colour of the insect is black, with a reddish tinge to the legs and antennae. The pronotum has a greenish-gold sheen and the elytra have a greenish metallic appearance, both being the result of the presence of dissected scales.|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{response of}} the larval parasitoid Spintherus dubius (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) to volatile compounds derived from its Apion weevil hosts was investigated in two-choice bioassays. Odor source candidates were the larval and adult stages of <b>weevils,</b> <b>clover</b> flowers, and feces from adult weevils. Despite S. dubius being a larval parasitoid, the odor of weevil larvae isolated from the clover flowers was not attractive to female parasitoids. Surprisingly, S. dubius females were instead attracted by the odor from the feces of adult weevils. The female parasitoids were similarly attracted to the feces produced by the two main hosts, the red <b>clover</b> <b>weevil</b> (A. trifolii) and the white <b>clover</b> <b>weevil</b> (A. fulvipes). Chemical analysis of the volatile composition of feces produced by the two hosts revealed qualitatively similar odor profiles, correlating with the observed attraction by the parasitoid towards both odor sources. Some of the identified volatile compounds are commonly present in clover plant headspace fractions and may function as a kairomone to facilitate orientation by S. dubius to Apion-infested clover flowers. Larval and adult weevils were not attractive for parasitoid females, whereas, for the white clover weevil-plant association, infested flowers were highly attractive. These data show the use by the <b>clover</b> <b>weevil</b> parasitoid of an alternative source of olfactory information for locating its host...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} from 1990 through 1992 to determine consumption rates and feeding duration of adult <b>clover</b> leaf <b>weevils,</b> Hypera punctata (F.), {{to characterize the}} injury potential of this species during alfalfa regrowth. Adults were fed for 29 d in 1990 and 18 d in both 1991 and 1992. The mean cumulative consumption per adult was 27. 2 ± 1. 6 cm 2 and 92. 7 ± 3. 5 mg dry weight in 1991 and 24. 6 ± 0. 9 cm 2 and 87. 5 ± 2. 9 mg dry weight in 1992. The mean cumulative consumption pattern was curvilinear for both dry weight and leaf area consumption. Most consumption was within 11 d of adult eclosion. The peak consumption rate occurred ~ 5 d after adult emergence. Because the highest consumption rates and the greatest percentage of defoliation were within the first 11 d of emergence, adult <b>clover</b> leaf <b>weevils</b> potentially can delay regrowth of alfalfa stubble when adult emergence coincides with the 1 st harvest. Further, because adult consumption patterns between <b>clover</b> leaf <b>weevils</b> and alfalfa weevils are similar, alfalfa stubble defoliation thresholds developed for alfalfa weevils and cutworms {{also can be used}} for <b>clover</b> leaf <b>weevils.</b> Injury equivalents (injury by 1 species in terms of another species) are determined for adult <b>clover</b> leaf <b>weevils,</b> larval variegated cutworm, Peridroma saucia (Hubner), and larval and adult alfalfa weevils, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) ...|$|R

40|$|The agricutural {{industry}} plays a {{key part}} of the New Zealand economy. However the incidence of plant pests in New Zealand threaten the viability of the sector. There are various options for controlling and mitigating the impact of these pests, and biological controls offer one potentially valuable solution. Economic analysis of these pests are vital to forming an appropriate policy response at the government level. Much of the literature on bio-security and biological controls focusses on a biological perspective rather than an economic one. This dissertation presents a more comprehensive framework for economic valuations of plant pests, with the use of a modified cost-benefit analysis (incorporating inputs from partial equilibirum trade modelling) to test the economic impact of plant pests and controls responses in New Zealand. Specifically, two case studies are examined: <b>clover</b> root <b>weevil</b> (Sitona lepidus), and its biological control Microctonus aethiopoides; and glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis), and its biological control Gonatocerus ashmeadi. The analysis shows the impacts of <b>clover</b> root <b>weevil,</b> and glassy-winged sharpshooter, if left unchecked, are –NZ$ 604 million, and –NZ$ 5 million per year respectively. The biological control options for each pest would mitigate between NZ$ 338 - 431 million per year in the case of <b>clover</b> root <b>weevil,</b> and NZ$ 4 million in the case of glassy-winged sharpshooter...|$|R

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis {{produces}} a 65 kilodalton polypeptide toxin which is lethal to various coleopteran insect larvae. The gene encoding this toxin was cloned in E. coli {{in the broad}} host range vector pKT 230 and subsequently transferred to Rhizobium leguminosarum by conjugation. Western blot analysis showed that the toxin gene was expressed in the free living state of Rhizobium producing two major polypeptides of 73 and 68 kilodalton in size. The level of expression of the toxin gene in Rhizobium varied from strain to strain. Cell extracts from toxin-producing rhizobia were toxic to larvae of Gasterophysa viridula. Bioassays also showed that the ?-endotoxin was toxic to larvae of the <b>clover</b> <b>weevil</b> Sitona lepidus. Furthermore, pea (Pisum sativum) and white clover (Trifolium repens) plants suffered less root and nodule damage by Sitona larvae when they were inoculated with Rhizobium strains containing the toxin gene.

The species appears to be not uncommon throughout Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the large order of hard-shelled insects called beetles (Coleoptera) and in a group generally called snout-beetles (Family Curculionidae).

Demelza, Katja, Linnéa, Orion and Natalya – I love you very much {{and thank you for}} the sacrifices you have made, knowingly or not, to allow this research and thesis to be completed. i Isoflavonoids are a class of plant secondary metabolites which have multiple biological roles in plants as pest feeding deterrents, phytoalexins and signals to rhizobial microbes. Some isoflavonoids, or their breakdown products, are estrogenic when ingested by animals, and pastures with high levels of the isoflavonoid formononetin can cause sterility in ewes. White clover has low levels of isoflavonoids and is susceptible to pests like the <b>clover</b> root <b>weevil.</b> The overall aim of this project was to test whether isoflavonoids could be manipulated in white clover through metabolic engineering.
