The linear {{portion of the}} curve is the elastic region and the slope is the modulus of elasticity or Young's Modulus ( [...] Young's Modulus is {{the ratio of the}} compressive stress to the longitudinal strain).Many ductile materials including some metals, polymers and ceramics exhibit a yield point.

40|$|The {{effect of}} prestraining (PS) and bake {{hardening}} (BH) on the microstructures and mechanical properties {{has been studied}} in transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and dual-phase (DP) steels after intercritical annealing.

It was found for both steels that the BH behavior depends on the dislocation rearrangement in ferrite with the formation of cell, microbands, and shear band structures after PS.

Steel specimens of five grain sizes were produced for testing. The average grain diameter of these specimens ranged from 1. 1 x 10 (- 3) in. to 8. 1 x 10 (- 3) in. Two types of tensile tests were performed, one by the application of very low loading rates and the other by the rapid application of a constant stress. Both types of tests were performed at temperatures of 72 °F and - 320 °F, while a few rapid loading tests were performed at a temperature of - 109 °F. Both the static upper and <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> are observed to increase linearly with [ [...] . ], where d equals the average grain diameter.

These models are shown to be incapable of describing the experimental results of this investigation. A more detailed model, based on Cottrell's yielding mechanism, is described. Plastic deformation by twinning occurred in both static and rapid loading tests performed at a temperature of - 320 °F. A critical stress for twinning was observed.

40|$|Introduction: Intervertebral disc (IVD) {{herniation}} is {{a common}} injury to the IVD and a frequent source of low back pain. IVD herniation occurs when the nucleus pulposus migrates through both the inter- and intralamellar matrices of the annulus fibrosus (AF). There {{are a number of}} mechanical risk factors associated with herniation, including repetitive flexion and twist. In vivo, twist combined with repetitive flexion has been associated with increased experience of low back pain and herniation. Additionally, in vitro, when repetitive flexion is combined with twist, IVD herniation occurs more easily than repetitive flexion alone. However, the mechanisms behind this relationship are not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of the current {{study was to determine the}} effect of twist on the mechanical properties of the inter- and intralamellar matrices. Methods: Thirty-six bovine IVDs from the caudal region were exposed to a combination of either 0 ° or 12 ° of static twist and 0 N or 1000 N of compression for two hours. Following mechanical loading, three samples were dissected from each disc. One sample, containing at least two adjacent layers of the AF, was mechanically delaminated to measure interlamellar matrix strength. The variables of interest from this test were adhesion peel strength and peel strength variability. The other two samples were single layers of the AF which were mechanically tested in tension until failure. The single layer samples were pulled perpendicular to the orientation of the collagen fibres in order to measure intralamellar matrix strength. The variables of interest from the single layer tensile test were the stress and strain at the end of the toe region, Young’s modulus, and the <b>yield</b> <b>point.</b> Finally, one IVD per condition underwent histological analysis in order to visually assess any damage within the AF. Results: There were significant differences between the twisted and untwisted samples on the mechanical properties of the intralamellar matrix. Specifically, lower stress at the end of the toe region (p= 0. 006), lower Young’s moduli (p= 0. 010), and <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) were observed in the twisted samples compared to the untwisted samples. Additionally, histological analysis demonstrated more disruption within individual lamellae of the twisted samples compared to the untwisted samples. However, there were no significant differences between the twisted and untwisted samples on the mechanical properties of the interlamellar matrix. Additionally, there was no effect of compression on the inter- or intralamellar matrices. Discussion and Conclusion: Twist, regardless of compression exposure, negatively affected the strength of the intralamellar matrix. This may explain why, when twist is combined with repetitive flexion, the occurrence of IVD herniation is accelerated compared to repetitive flexion alone. A mechanism of IVD herniation is migration through the AF layers via clefts within the intralamellar matrix, therefore, if the intralamellar matrix is weakened, such as from twist, then this progression will occur more easily and thus herniation will occur more easily. These findings suggest that twist may put the IVD at an increased risk for injury as a result of damage to the intralamellar matrix...|$|R

The marked temperature {{dependence of the}} stress-strain curve is recalled first and some {{attention is paid to}} the correlation between the lower yield stress and dislocation dynamics at moderate temperatures. In Si, some suitable pre-strain yields a very favourable situation where measurements of both mobile dislocation density and local stresses can be done and where activation parameters at the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> fairly agree with those of dislocation glide. In CSC, polarity effects result from the very different mobility of α and β dislocations and activation parameters apparently fail to reproduce those derived from velocity measurements. Generally, the mechanical behaviour is affected by doping in the sense expected from velocity measurements, but « metallurgical » effects appear at high concentrations if doping atoms are mobile at the deformation temperature. At lower temperatures, SC can be deformed under high stresses, if brittle fracture is prevented by a confining pressure. Experimental techniques are discussed and present results point to different rate controlling mechanisms in this range, where environment effects are in addition suspected.

First, we examined the morphology and histology of the uterine wall repair. We identified wound granulation tissue 3 days post-CD in both strains, albeit less in the MRL strain. Macroscopically, no scar could be identified either in MRL or C 57 Bl/ 6 mice on day 60 post-CD. However, histologically, we found significant differences in wound integration, inflammation, and collagen birefringence between the two strains of mice. Using a histological index, we provided evidence for significant differences in mitotic activity in the initial phases of uterine healing among strains. Functional behavior of the uterine scar also was analyzed by using biomechanical parameters such as slope (measure of stiffness), yield point (measure of elasticity), and break point (measure of strength). There were significant differences in stiffness of the scarred myometrium between the two phenotypes.

In this modelling study the equivalent plastic strain and von-Mises equivalent stress distributions were determined as a function of rolling reduction. During hot rolling, the secondary arms experienced larger elongations than the segregated regions within strain bands due to the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> of the dendrite arms. The primary dendrite arms rotated about the rolling direction and align with the rolling direction at rolling reductions of more than 70 % while secondary dendrite arms located between two (harder) segregated regions experience significant thinning during rolling until the segregated regions latch onto each other at a rolling reduction of about 70 %. At rolling reductions between 65 and 75 %, the primary and secondary dendrite arms as well as the inter-dendritic regions (roughly spherical) pre-existing in the as-cast structure, were destroyed and transformed into distinctive elongated microchemical bands that align parallel to the rolling direction. In order to further explore how banding originates, an attempt was made to directly observe the formation of micro-structural bands by the use of high-temperature laserscanning confocal microscopy. These observations have been made in real time and at temperatures typically used in industrial hot-rolling practice. During cooling from the austenite phase field, ferrite nucleates on austenite grain boundaries and grows progressively into the austenite grains. Pearlite/ferrite band formation could clearly be observed in-situ when care was taken to prevent surface decarburisation. The banding observed in-situ in the high-temperature microscope was similar to that detected by optical microscopy following the same heat treatment that was used in the microscope.
