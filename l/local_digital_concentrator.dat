5000|$|Each {{line module}} unit {{converts}} analogue signals from {{a maximum of}} 64 subscriber lines in the access network to the 64 kilobit/s digital binary signals used in the core network. This is done by sampling the incoming signal {{at a rate of}} 8 kS/s and coding each sample into an 8-bit word using pulse code modulation (PCM) techniques. The line module also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a <b>digital</b> <b>concentrator</b> switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The <b>digital</b> <b>concentrator</b> switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto 30 time slots on up to 32-channel high speed paths for connection to the <b>digital</b> <b>local</b> switching unit via the digital line termination units. The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling.|$|R
50|$|The {{concentrator}} unit {{consists of}} four main sub-systems, line modules, <b>digital</b> <b>concentrator</b> switch, <b>digital</b> line termination (DLT) units and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the <b>digital</b> <b>local</b> exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if connection to the DLE is lost.|$|R
