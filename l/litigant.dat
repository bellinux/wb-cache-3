5|$|The Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust was {{established}} on December 2, 1909, {{for the care}} of orphaned and destitute children in Hawaii. Effective upon her death, the proceeds of her estate, with the exception of twelve individual inheritances specified therein, were to be used for the Trust. The largest of these hereditary estates were willed to her hānai sons and their heirs: John ʻAimoku Dominis would receive Washington Place while Joseph Kaiponohea ʻAeʻa would receive Kealohilani, her residence at Waikiki. Both men predeceased the Queen. Before and after her death, lawsuits were filed to overturn her will establishing the Trust. One notable <b>litigant</b> was Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, the nephew of her brother Kalākaua and his wife Kapiʻolani and Liliʻuokalani's second cousin, who brought a suit against the Trust on November 30, 1915, questioning the Queen's competency in executing the will and attempting to break the Trust. These lawsuits were resolved in 1923 and the will went into probate. The Queen Liliʻuokalani Children's Center was created by the Trust.|$|E
5|$|The term in Athens {{seems to}} have always been {{somewhat}} loosely used in legal proceedings. Apollodorus, an Athenian politician and <b>litigant</b> from the 4th century BCE, {{in one of his}} speeches attempted to use an Athenian law about betrothal to make his mother an epikleros. He claimed that the law defined an epikleros as a female without father, a brother who shared a father with her, or a paternal grandfather. His opponent, however, {{seems to have}} disputed this interpretation of the law. A speech by Isaeus, a 4th-century BCE speechwriter, rests on the claim that the speaker's mother only became an epikleros after her young brother died following their father's death. Whether the legal authorities recognized the speaker's claim as valid is unknown. It appears, at least according to some plays, that a woman with a brother who died after their father was considered the epikleros of her brother, not her father.|$|E
25|$|Frequently a <b>litigant</b> {{wishes to}} bring a civil action for a declaratory {{judgment}} against a public body or official. This is considered an aspect of administrative law, sometimes with a constitutional dimension, as when the <b>litigant</b> seeks to have legislation declared unconstitutional.|$|E
40|$|Examines the {{findings}} from research commissioned by the Department of Constitutional Affairs on <b>litigants</b> in person, considering whether {{there has been a}} {{rise in the number of}} unrepresented <b>litigants</b> and vexatious <b>litigants</b> in county and family courts and the High Court and the reasons for <b>litigants</b> to represent themselves. Outlines the problems caused to the court by <b>litigants</b> in person, assesses whether they tend to be claimants or defendants and questions the advice available to such <b>litigants.</b> Concludes on whether <b>litigants</b> in person are disadvantaged...|$|R
40|$|Considers {{the extent}} to which the role and skills of the {{judiciary}} are tested by unrepresented <b>litigants,</b> based on a Department for Constitutional Affairs funded research project published in March 2005, entitled <b>Litigants</b> in Person: Unrepresented <b>Litigants</b> in First Instance Proceedings. Discusses: (1) the aims and findings of the research, focusing on <b>litigants</b> in person in civil and family cases in the High Court and the county courts; (2) the problems faced by <b>litigants</b> in person; (3) the forms of judicial intervention with regard to <b>litigants</b> in person; and (4) issues raised by the research, such as the procedural complexity of hearings, and possible solutions...|$|R

25|$|Spain has a {{division}} {{but it does}} not correspond to the division in Britain between barristers/advocates and solicitors. Procuradores represent the <b>litigant</b> procedurally in court, generally under the authority of a power of attorney executed by a civil law notary, while abogados represent the substantive claims of the <b>litigant</b> through trial advocacy. Abogados perform both transactional work and advise in connection with court proceedings, and they have full right of audience in front of the court. The court proceeding is carried out with abogados, not with procuradores. In a nutshell, procuradores are court agents that operate under the instructions of an abogado. Their practice is confined to the locality of the court to which they are admitted.|$|E
25|$|Menzies {{trained as}} a barrister, but in 1996 he was {{declared}} a vexatious <b>litigant</b> by HM Courts Service which prohibits him from taking legal action in England and Wales without prior judicial permission. Menzies is an honorary professor at Yunnan University in China.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the availability and}} accessibility of legal information for lay <b>litigants</b> - {{those people who have}} chosen to represent themselves in legal proceedings. It looks specifically at the information held in libraries and whether these libraries and the information held in them can be accessed by lay <b>litigants.</b> Although this study looks at the ability of lay <b>litigants</b> to access legal information, it also discusses legal information access by the public in general. Distinctions have however been drawn between those seeking general legal information and lay <b>litigants</b> The overall purpose of this research is to establish the current levels of access to information that lay <b>litigants</b> have, and whether the current situation is adequate and tenable. Principles and policies such as that of equal access to the law and the New Zealand government's commitment towards open government; enabling online access and its e-policy have been taken into consideration in evaluating whether the current situation is sufficient. Distinctions have also been drawn between those seeking general legal information and lay <b>litigants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} <b>litigants</b> {{represent}} themselves in court. Advisory systems {{designed to help}} <b>litigants</b> understand the available legal remedies and satisfy the substantive and procedural requirements to obtain those remedies {{have the potential to}} assist these <b>litigants</b> and thereby reduce the burden that they impose on the courts. This paper presents a four-component model of advisory systems for pro se <b>litigants.</b> This model was implemented in the Protection Order Advisory (POA), an advisory system for pro se Protection Order applicants. POA illustrates how existing inference, document-drafting, and interface-design techniques can be used to construct advisory systems for pro se <b>litigants</b> {{in a wide range of}} legal domains for which (1) determining whether a prima facie case is satis ed does not require opentextured reasoning, and (2) the documents required to initiate an action are characterized by homogeneity and simple structure...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{reasonable}} suspicion test asks whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting {{in court and}} knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the <b>litigant</b> is not possible. Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the Singapore courts.|$|E
25|$|States {{are also}} {{protected}} against lawsuits by their sovereign immunity. Even where states waive their sovereign immunity, they may nonetheless {{have their own}} rules limiting standing against simple taxpayer standing against the state. Furthermore, states {{have the power to}} determine what will constitute standing for a <b>litigant</b> to be heard in a state court, and may deny access to the courts premised on taxpayer standing alone.|$|E
25|$|Since his incarceration, Bittaker {{has filed}} more than 40 {{frivolous}} lawsuits over issues as trivial as his being served a broken cookie and crushed sandwiches by the prison cafeteria, which he cited {{as an example}} of his being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Bittaker was declared a vexatious <b>litigant</b> in 1993. As a result of this declaration, he may no longer file suits without the express permission of an attorney or a judge.|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} define the {{different}} ways in which unrepresented <b>litigants</b> manifest themselves within proceedings, and explore the difficulties posed to unrepresented <b>litigants,</b> court staff, judges and opponents. The report explores detailed quantitative and qualitative data on unrepresented <b>litigants</b> in first instance civil and family cases, excluding small claims. It finds that unrepresented parties are common, and more likely to be defendants. In civil cases in particular, there is a strong link between non-representation and non-participation. Parties go unrepresented for a range of reasons, including inability to afford representation. Problems faced by unrepresented <b>litigants</b> demonstrate struggles with substantive law and procedure. The boundary between the provision of information and advice by court staff also presents problems. Both court staff and judges perceived that improvements can be made in the way that unrepresented <b>litigants</b> are handled, including improvement to court-based services providing greater assistance...|$|R
50|$|After the {{commercial}} break following {{the presentation of the}} case, the <b>litigants</b> were taken out of the courtroom and the home audience was shown the panel's deliberations. Whatever they decided was revealed to the <b>litigants</b> in the next segment.|$|R
50|$|Many jurisdictions offer a {{simplified}} process for filing a civil complaint for unrepresented <b>litigants.</b> For example, in North Carolina, pro se <b>litigants</b> can file a 50B (also called a DVPO, for Domestic Violence Protective Order) {{complaint with the}} Clerk of Court.|$|R
25|$|The SCJA {{does not}} contain any {{provisions}} {{similar to the ones}} referred to above that apply to Supreme Court judges. Nonetheless, at common law a judge can be disqualified from hearing or deciding a case {{if he or she is}} actually biased against a party, or appears to biased. The test for apparent bias is whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the <b>litigant</b> is not possible.|$|E
25|$|The courts {{within the}} {{building}} {{are open to}} the public, although there may be some restrictions depending upon the nature of the cases being heard. Those in court who do not have legal representation may receive some assistance within the building. There is a citizens' advice bureau based within the Main Hall which provides free, confidential and impartial advice by appointment to anyone who is a <b>litigant</b> in person in the courts. There is also a Personal Support Unit where litigants in person can receive emotional support and practical information about court proceedings.|$|E
25|$|The hegemon (ἡγεμών) of {{the court}} was {{responsible}} for the registration of the suits and complaints. After holding a preliminary investigation, he also had to subpoena the <b>litigant</b> parties and the witnesses before the jury. In the morning of the day of hearings, the hegemon had to determine by lot the jury that would judge the case as well as the place where it would convene. After the formation of the jury, the hegemon had to submit the conclusions of his preliminary investigation, announcing and defining the litigation on which the court should decide. Then it was the time for the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses to be heard. The arguments were exposed by the litigants themselves, without the legal support of a lawyer, {{in the form of an}} exchange of single speeches timed by water clock. In a public suit each <b>litigant</b> had three hours to speak, whereas they had much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). In this way the judicial cases became a vehement fight of impressions, since the jurors did not constitute a little group of mature citizens, such as the Court of Areios Pagos, which was interested only in the correct application of the law. Additionally, before the Chambers of Heliaia each citizen had to become an effective orator and to act solely in his capacity as citizen, in order to protect his interests and to enforce his views.|$|E
5000|$|The {{growth of}} pro se <b>litigants</b> can be {{attributed}} to the high cost of litigation, anti-lawyer sentiment, and the advent of do-it-yourself law services. However, self-represented <b>litigants</b> may still need legal representation in order and to navigate the litigation process.|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research has now been undertaken {{in response to the}} emerging phenomenon of self-represented <b>litigants</b> in the Family Court. Some of this research has been concerned with the impact of legal aid cuts. Other studies have documented how the presence of self-represented <b>litigants</b> impacts on participants in Family Court processes. A third group of studies are those addressing how courts might best accommodate self-represented <b>litigants.</b> This study is the first research to focus in a sustained way on the link between self-representation and the availability of legal aid funding in family law, to employ both quantitative and qualitative approaches to the question, and to gather information from both self-representing <b>litigants</b> and Legal Aid Commissions...|$|R

25|$|A 1771 {{graduate}} of the College, and an ordained minister in the Church of England, Reverend James Madison was a teacher at William & Mary as the hostilities of the American Revolution broke out, and he organized his students into a local militia. During 1777, he served as chaplain of the Virginia House of Delegates. The same year, Loyalist sympathies of the College President, Reverend John Camm (who had been the initial <b>litigant</b> in the Parson's Cause case 1758-1764), brought about his removal from the faculty. Reverend Madison became the 8th president of The College of William & Mary in October, 1777, the first after separation from England.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily, {{families}} or lineages settle disputes between individuals. Nevertheless, such disputes {{can be brought}} to trial before a chief by uttering the taboo oath of a chief or the King. In the end, the King's Court is the sentencing court, for only the King can order the death penalty. Before the Council of Elders and the King's Court, the litigants orate comprehensively. Anyone present can cross-examine the defendant or the accuser, and if the proceedings do not lead to a verdict, a special witness is called to provide additional testimony. If there is only one witness, their sworn oath assures the truth is told. Moreover, that he favors or is hostile to either <b>litigant</b> is unthinkable. Cases with no witness, like sorcery or adultery are settled by ordeals, like drinking poison.|$|E
25|$|A barrister, {{who can be}} {{considered}} as a jurist, is a lawyer who represents a <b>litigant</b> as advocate before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. A barrister speaks in court and presents the case before a judge or jury. In some jurisdictions, a barrister receives additional training in evidence law, ethics, and court practice and procedure. In contrast, a solicitor generally meets with clients, does preparatory and administrative work and provides legal advice. In this role, he or she may draft and review legal documents, interact with the client as necessary, prepare evidence, and generally manage the day-to-day administration of a lawsuit. A solicitor can provide a crucial support role to a barrister when in court, such as managing large volumes of documents in the case or even negotiating a settlement outside the courtroom while the trial continues inside.|$|E

40|$|We briefly review {{two basic}} models of {{settlement}} bargaining based on concepts from information economics and game theory. We then discuss how these {{models have been}} generalized to address issues that arise when {{there are more than}} two <b>litigants</b> with related cases. Linkages between cases can arise due to exogenous factors such as correlated culpability or damages, or they can be generated by discretionary choices {{on the part of the}} <b>litigants</b> themselves or by legal doctrine and rules of procedure.

40|$|This Article {{draws upon}} both {{the theory of}} and {{research}} on procedural justice holding that <b>litigants</b> often focus on the appearance of fairness {{rather than on the}} actual outcome. Thus, when <b>litigants</b> are able to choose the modality of fact-finding, they may be more accepting of the legal process, even if the outcome is not favorable to them. Allowing the option of a jury, even if not exercised, may dramatically improve the perceptions of <b>litigants</b> and may affect the legitimacy and longevity of case outcomes...|$|R
25|$|Finally, the writ of coram nobis is {{unavailable}} when a <b>litigant</b> {{has some}} other remedy at law. A writ of coram nobis {{is not available}} where the defendant had a remedy by (a) appeal or (b) motion {{for a new trial}} and failed to avail himself of such remedies. The writ of coram nobis is not a catch-all by which those convicted may litigate and relitigate the propriety of their convictions ad infinitum. In the vast majority of cases a trial followed by a motion for a new trial and an appeal affords adequate protection to those accused of crime. The writ of coram nobis serves a limited and useful purpose. It will be used to correct errors of fact which could not be corrected in any other manner. But it is well-settled law in this and in other states that where other and adequate remedies exist the writ is not available.|$|E
25|$|The {{view has}} been taken by {{scholars}} {{that there is no}} practical difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In a 2008 paper, Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan concede that there is a slight difference in the meaning of the terms real likelihood and reasonable suspicion, but are of the view that this difference is hardly material. The gap between the two tests is considerably narrow and, in practice, the two tests are unlikely to yield different results in most cases. It was stated in Cook International Inc. v. B.V. Handelmaatschappij Jean Delvaux (1985) that the contrast between the tests was between reasonable suspicion of bias on the one hand, and the appearance of a real likelihood of bias on the other. Hence what must be established is the appearance of a real possibility of bias and this is not very different from establishing that a fair-minded member of the public could have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the <b>litigant</b> was not possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom that Thomas's votes follow Antonin Scalia's is reflected by Linda Greenhouse's observation that Thomas voted with Scalia 91 {{percent of the time}} during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time. Jan Crawford asserts that to some extent, this is true in the other direction as well, that Scalia often joins Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia. Statistics compiled annually by Tom Goldstein of SCOTUSblog demonstrate that Greenhouse's count is methodology-specific, counting non-unanimous cases where Scalia and Thomas voted for the same <b>litigant,</b> regardless of whether they got there by the same reasoning. Goldstein's statistics show that the two agreed in full only 74% of the time, and that the frequency of agreement between Scalia and Thomas is not as outstanding as is often implied by pieces aimed at lay audiences. For example, in that same term, Souter and Ginsburg voted together 81% of the time by the method of counting that yields a 74% agreement between Thomas and Scalia. By the metric that produces the 91% Scalia/Thomas figure, Ginsburg and Breyer agreed 90% of the time. Roberts and Alito agreed 94% of the time.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT There are an {{increasing}} number of <b>litigants</b> who are forced to represent themselves in court. This causes havoc in the judicial system and raises issues of access to justice. We believe that important support for unrepresented <b>litigants</b> can be provided by the construction of web-based legal decision support systems. We discuss tools we have constructed for building web-based legal decision support systems and give examples from the domains of Family Law and eligibility for legal aid. We also illustrate how such decision support tools can help <b>litigants</b> negotiate their disputes...|$|R
50|$|Legal {{financing}} can be {{a practical}} means for <b>litigants</b> to obtain financing while they wait for a monetary settlement or an award in their personal injury, workers' compensation, or civil rights lawsuit. Often, plaintiffs who were injured or forced to leave their jobs still have mortgages, rent, medical expenses, or other bills to pay. Other times, <b>litigants</b> may simply need {{money to pay for}} the costs of litigation and attorneys' fees, and for this reason, many <b>litigants</b> turn to reputable legal financing companies to apply for a cash advance to help pay for bills.|$|R
