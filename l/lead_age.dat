5000|$|His first poems were {{published}} in periodicals while a student at Leeds. However, becoming heavily involved in the late fifties and early sixties, in anti-nuclear protest, with the Committee of 100 and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, with his wife, Anne Shaw, a Civil Disobedience activist who illegally distributed the government's secret Spies for Peace document, he did not resume literary work again until 1965. His early work - Private Time, Public Time,1969, illustrated by Rigby Graham and published with the financial support of The Arts Council of Great Britain, Causes,1972, and Work in Progress, 1975, - was complex and cerebral, with considerable use of ambiguity -William Empson and Robert Lowell were influences, but The Wrath Valley Anthology, 1981, (taking its cue from The Epigrams of Martial and The Spoon River Anthology of Edgar Lee Masters!)), with Grindley's Bairns, 1988, marked a more direct, colloquial, even [...] "reductive" [...] approach to irony [...] The Times Literary Supplement commented, [...] "His wry humour produces a refreshing antidote to the bleak treatment that region (The Pennines) regularly provokes. He can include in his characteristic irony {{a sense of the}} predicament of suburban exile. His charmless eccentrics are treated with respect as well as irony." [...] Despite interest from mainstream publishing houses, his major works (except Causes, from The Byron Press) continued to be published by Alan Tarling's Poet & Printer, a small publishing house with a distinguished, eclectic list that included Ted Hughes, Jonathan Williams, Christopher Logue, Peter Redgrove, and Iain Crichton Smith. In addition, smaller collections like Poems from Haworth, The <b>Lead</b> <b>Age,</b> and Masquerade appeared from fugitive private presses. Shaw also contributed poems to BBC radio and TV arts programmes and leading periodicals like Spectator, Poetry Review, The Times Literary Supplement, Phoenix , Cambridge Review, Tribune (magazine) [...] and The Scotsman. He compiled and edited, with a critical survey, the anthology of modern British poetry, Flash Point, 1964, and was himself anthologised in Brian Patten and Pat Krett's The House that Jack Built. Two of his poems - we are going to need poems and A North Country Lass Tells Her Sorrows - were designed as poster-poems by Rigby Graham and Roy Sandford. In 1981 the BBC commissioned a long poem. His reading of this was used as background to a BBC 2 television film about his work in its Pennine setting. His last published collection, in 2000, was Catullus: The Love-Hate Poems Translated by Robert Shaw, in free verse.|$|E

40|$|Background—Transvenous {{pacemaker}} and defibrillator implantation is {{an expanding}} practice in pediatric and {{congenital heart disease}} patients, and given the finite longevity of current lead designs, lead extraction is an eventuality for a significant subset of these patients. Data on the safety and efficacy of different lead extraction techniques in this specific patient population are limited. Methods and Results—We report our experience from a single-center cohort study with a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on all lead extractions performed between January 2002 and December 2008. Lead extraction procedures involved a total of 144 patients and 203 leads. Of these, 61 patients (42 %) were female and 86 (60 %) had structural heart disease. Successful simple extraction, requiring the use of only a nonlocking stylet, was achieved in 59 (29 %) leads. Of the remaining leads, 35 were abandoned and 109 underwent complex extraction techniques, including a radiofrequency-powered sheath used in 78 of 109 leads. Successful extraction was achieved in 80 % (162 / 203) of all leads and 94 % (103 / 109) of leads undergoing a complex extraction. On multivariable analysis, older <b>lead</b> <b>age</b> (odds ratio [OR], 0. 63; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 48 to 0. 82; P 0. 0001), ventricular lead position (OR, 0. 40; 95 % CI, 0. 20 to 0. 79; P 0. 015), and polyurethane insulation (OR, 0. 34; 95 % CI, 0. 14 to 0. 80; P 0. 017) {{were found to be}} associated with a decreased likelihood of simple extraction.

40|$|Abstract: Blood {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 113 subjects (56 males and 57 females) living {{in the district of}} Alfenas, in southern Minas Gerais state, Brazil, to establish reference values for deltaaminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity (ALA-D, EC 4. 2. 1. 24).

Means (standard deviations) for blood lead, tibia lead, and patella lead were 6. 2 (4. 1) /xg/dl, 21. 9 (13. 3) pig/g, and 32. 0 (19. 5) /xg/g, respectively. In multiple regression models adjusting for age, education level, smoking, and alcohol consumption, men in the lowest quintile of total dietary intake levels of vitamin D (including vitamin supple-ments) ( 589 lU/day). Higher calcium intake was associated with lower bone lead levels, but this relation became insignificant when adjustment was made for vitamin D. The authors also observed inverse associations of blood lead levels with total dietary intake of vitamin C and iron. When analyses were controlled for patella <b>lead,</b> <b>age,</b> smoking, and alcohol consumption, men in the lowest vitamin C intake quintile ( 339 mg/day), while men in the lowest iron intake quintile ( 23. 5 mg/day). This study suggests that low dietary intake of vitamin D may increase lead accumulation in bones, while lower dietary intake of vitamin C and iron may increase lead levels in the blood.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{predictors of}} tibial and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) chelatable lead in 543 organolead manufacturing workers with past exposure to organic and inorganic lead. METHODS: In this cross sectional study, tibial lead (by 109 Cd K-shell x ray fluorescence), DMSA chelatable lead (4 hour urinary lead excretion after oral administration of 10 mg/kg), and several exposure measures were obtained on study participants, mean (SD) age 57. 6 (7. 6) years. RESULTS: Tibial lead concentrations ranged from - 1. 6 to 52. 0 micrograms lead/g bone mineral, {{with a mean}} (SD) of 14. 4 (9. 3) micrograms/g. DMSA chelatable lead ranged from 1. 2 to 136 micrograms, with a mean (SD) of 19. 3 (17. 2) micrograms. In a multiple linear regression model of tibial <b>lead,</b> <b>age</b> (p < 0. 01), duration of exposure (p < 0. 01), current (p < 0. 01) and past (p = 0. 05) cigarette smoking, and diabetes (p = 0. 01) were all independent positive predictors, whereas height (p = 0. 03), and exercise inducing sweating (p = 0. 04) were both negative predictors. The final regression model accounted for 31 % {{of the variance in}} tibial lead concentrations; 27 % was explained by age and duration of exposure alone. DMSA chelatable lead was directly associated with tibial lead (p = 0. 01), cumulative exposure to inorganic lead (y. microgram/m 3, p = 0. 01), current smoking (p < 0. 01), and weight (p < 0. 01), and negatively associated with diabetes (p = 0. 02). The final model accounted for 11 % of the variance in chelatable lead. When blood lead was added to this model of DMSA chelatable lead, tibial lead, cumulative exposure to inorganic lead, and diabetes were no longer significant; blood lead accounted for the largest proportion of variance (p < 0. 001); and the total model r 2 increased to 19 %. CONCLUSIONS: The low proportions of variance explained in models of both tibial and chelatable lead suggest that other factors are involved in the deposition of lead in bone and soft tissue. In epidemiological studies of the health effects of lead, evaluation of associations with both these measures may allow inferences to be made about whether health effects are likely to be recent, and thus potentially reversible, or chronic, and thus possibly irreversible. The data also provide direct evidence that in men the total amount of lead in the body that is bioavailable declines with age...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis {{was to assess the}} {{occurrence}} of early lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) in patients with diabetes and to assess novel potential risk markers for development or worsening of LEAD in the same patients. In parallel different measures of impaired peripheral circulation were evaluated. The measurement of ankle-to- brachial blood pressure index (ABI) to screen for asymptomatic LEAD in diabetic subjects is unreliable since a large proportion of patients have stiff ankle arteries (mediasclerosis) and thus may display a too high ABI. We studied type 1 -, type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic subjects without a previous history of LEAD and a composite variable of ankle – plus toe blood pressures and indices was compared to ABI alone in detecting LEAD. Significantly more subjects with reduced peripheral circulation were detected using the composite variable compared to ABI alone. This was particularly true in diabetic subjects, about 30 % of whom had signs of impaired peripheral circulation. Thus, it was found that toe blood pressure measurements, alone or in combination with ankle blood pressure measurements, increase the sensitivity for finding early asymptomatic LEAD in diabetic subjects. No significant difference in reproducibility between measurements of absolute ankle- and toe blood pressure and indices was found, but a correlation between systemic (brachial) and toe blood pressure variations over time may suggest that indices are more correct in assessing peripheral arterial circulation. Furthermore, toe blood pressure measurements can be performed using either the great toe or dig II and a strong concordance is found between these measurements. In addition, since the pole-test, another non-invasive method to measure peripheral blood pressure which is less sensitive to the presence of mediasclerosis compared to ABI, correlated significantly with toe blood pressure measurements this method may be used as an alternative screening method in subjects with previously known <b>LEAD.</b> <b>Age,</b> hypertension and glycemic control are well known risk factors and, in addition, high tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity {{turned out to be a}} novel early marker for asymptomatic LEAD in diabetic subjects, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes. Age and hyperglycemia are the most important risk factors for development and progression of subclinical lower extremity arterial disease in type 2 diabetic subjects. No independent associations between markers of inflammation, such as CRP, interleukin- 6 and TNF-α and early asymptomatic LEAD were seen among non-diabetic or diabetic subjects. In conclusion, impaired arterial circulation in the lower extremities is common in diabetic subjects even in the absence of symptoms. Including toe blood pressure measurement when screening for asymptomatic LEAD in diabetic subjects improves the ability to detect reduced peripheral circulation and this method avoids falsely elevated blood pressures readings due to mediasclerosis in the ankle arteries. Moreover, an altered fibrinolytic activity should be further evaluated as an early marker of atherosclerosis and LEAD...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{determine}} {{patterns of}} childhood lead exposure {{in a community}} living near a lead and zinc smelter in North Lake Macquarie, Australia between 1991 and 2002. Methods An analysis of serial blood lead levels (BLL) of children less than 13 years of age in North Lake Macquarie participating in voluntary blood lead screening. Distance to the smelter and soil lead concentration of the child's place of residence was calculated. Categorical analysis of BLL by residential distance from smelter, residential soil <b>lead</b> concentration, <b>age</b> and year of sample was calculated. Linear regression models were fit for blood lead levels against residential distance from smelter, the log of residential soil <b>lead</b> concentration, <b>age</b> and year of BLL sample. Results Geometric mean BLLs were statistically significantly higher for distances less than 1. 5 kilometres from the smelter and for residential soil lead concentrations greater than 300 ppm. Yearly BLLs since 1995 were statistically significantly lower than for preceding years, with an average decrease of 0. 575 μg/dL per year since 1991. BLLs are statistically significantly higher for children whose age is 1 to 3 years old. Linear regression modelling of BLL predicted a statistically significant decrease in BLL of 3. 0831 μg/dL per kilometre from the smelter and a statistically significant increase in BLL of 0. 25 μg/dL per log of lead in residential soil. The model explained 28. 2 % {{of the variation in}} BLL.
