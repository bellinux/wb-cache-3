5|$|The lake is {{surrounded}} with fringing reedbeds, carr woodland and grassland, which are managed by Bristol Water. The water conditions are eutrophic with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), <b>lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pusillus), opposite-leaved pondweed (Groenlandia densa) and water-crowfoot (Ranunculus spp.). On neutral soils around the reservoir, pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), burnet-saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga) and devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) occur, and on calcareous soils fairy flax (Linum catharticum), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor subspecies minor) are found.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> was one {{of several}} pondweeds first named by Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum (1753). The {{specific}} epithet pusillus means 'small'.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{should not}} be {{difficult}} to grow in a garden pond and its tolerance of poor water quality would be advantageous. However, it is not very ornamental.|$|E
5000|$|Potamogeton pusillus is {{a species}} of aquatic plant known by the common names small pondweed, [...] <b>lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> or least pondweed. It occurs in {{standing}} and slow-flowing freshwater habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The various pits support varied aquatic and marinal flora {{including}} the nationally scarce whorled water milfoil. Other species include the fan- leaved water crowfoot, flowering rush, lesser reedmace, frogbit, blunt-leaved pondweed, <b>lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> and the brown sedge.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} globally, occurring across most of Europe (including Scandinavia) and North America. It is reported from scattered locations in Central and Southeast Asia and is widespread in China. It is also widespread in South America [...] and Africa.|$|E
50|$|Other {{plant species}} which are {{otherwise}} scarce or absent in the Bristol region but found in high concentrations on the North Somerset Levels are: Flowering-rush (Myles, p. 210), Lesser Water-plantain (Myles, p.210-1), Frogbit (Myles, p. 210-1), <b>Lesser</b> <b>Pondweed</b> (Myles, p.212-3), Small Pondweed (Myles, p. 212-3), Hairlike Pondweed (Myles, p213), Opposite-leaved Pondweed (Myles, p.213) and Horned Pondweed (Myles, p.213).|$|E
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} {{composed}} of reed, common club-rush, flowering rush, yellow iris, greater water-parsnip, brooklime, bulbous rush, toad rush, eight-stamened waterwort, needle spike-rush, spring quillwort, amphibious bistort, pale persicaria, rigid hornwort, horned pondweed, perfoliate pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, grass-wrack pondweed, fennel pondweed, various-leaved pondweed, <b>lesser</b> <b>pondweed,</b> fan-leaved water-goosefoot, whorled water-milfoil, alternate water-milfoil, spiked water-milfoil, Canadian waterweed, Nuttall's waterweed, and common duckweed. There are stoneworts such as Chara delicatula and Nitella flexilis.|$|E
50|$|Like most fine-leaved pondweeds, Potamogeton pusillus is diploid, with 2n=26. <b>Lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> can be {{difficult}} to distinguish reliably from other fine-leaved pondweeds, especially P. berchtoldii. Hybrids are recorded with Potamogeton octandrus (P. × apertus Miki), P. polygonus (P. × attenuatus Hagstr.), P. obtusifolius (P. × saxonicus Hagstr.), P. trichoides (P. × grovesii Dandy & G.Taylor), P. berchtoldii (P. × mucronulatus (G.Fisch.) Papch.), P. oxyphyllus (P. × orientalis Hagstr.).|$|E

50|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{grows in}} {{standing}} or slow-flowing water bodies such as ponds, lakes, ditches, slow-moving streams, and river backwaters. It is a lowland plant and requires calcareous water, with a marked preference for high nutrient levels, and may form extensive beds in favourable situations, growing with other nutrient-tolerant {{species such as}} Myriophyllum spicatum and Zannichellia palustris. It is tolerant of turbid water and is a good colonist, often exploiting temporary or disturbed habitats such as livestock drinking ponds, canals and ditches. In lakes it is very tolerant of eutrophication and the resulting competition from phytoplankton and periphyton, and is often {{one of the last}} submerged plants to disappear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>pondweed</b> is a superficially grasslike herb {{producing}} a very slender, branching, somewhat compressed stem, usually less than 70 cm but occasionally {{up to one}} metre in length. Nodal glands, if present, are generally poorly developed. The leaves are narrow and linear, translucent, mid or olive green, usually 20-50 mm long × 0.8-1.4 mm wide, but rarely up to 100 mm long and 1.9 mm wide. The midrib often lacks lacunae (transparent areas {{either side of the}} midrib) either side of it, and if present, lacunae are restricted to {{the lower half of the}} leaf. There are no floating leaves. The stipules are tubular when young, but tend to split with age.|$|E
