5|$|Shooting of Rashomon {{began on}} July 7, 1950, and, after {{extensive}} <b>location</b> <b>work</b> in the primeval forest of Nara, wrapped on August 17. Just one week {{was spent in}} hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyo's Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day.

The city expanded {{the office of the}} city's attorney, and in 1982 the Portland Building was finished across the street. This allowed the city to move many city offices into a single <b>location.</b> <b>Work</b> was also completed on the exterior, while a new roof was finished. In 1985, the building began a conversion from steam heating.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{exterior}} shots were always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live studio audience at BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of <b>location</b> <b>work</b> increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series {{to do away with the}} live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter.|$|E

25|$|The {{transfer}} to film meant that episodes would be shot using the single camera setup, giving the production greater flexibility. The use of film {{production and the}} single-camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles and more outdoor location shots, all of which greatly improved {{the look of the}} series. As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s, all <b>location</b> <b>work</b> on series four was shot mute with the soundtrack created in post production.

25|$|With {{the role}} recast, and the script {{restructured}} accordingly, filming resumed in Vancouver on 24 February 2008, {{a month later}} than originally planned; this push-back in filming also required another film produced by Samuel Hadida, an adaptation of the video game Onimusha, to be delayed indefinitely. Exteriors required for the film's ending, featuring Christopher Plummer and Verne Troyer, were shot during this time; the <b>location</b> <b>work</b> also required the presence of Tom Waits (on the first day) and Lily Cole (on the second). All of Plummer's scenes, including exterior flashbacks shown {{early on in the}} film, had to be filmed first in the Vancouver schedule, within three weeks, as he was due to leave to begin filming on The Last Station, which was to start production in Germany on 7 April.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Peckinpah {{was hired}} as a {{dialogue}} coach for the film Riot in Cell Block 11. His job entailed acting as an assistant for the movie's director, Don Siegel. The film was shot on location at Folsom Prison. Reportedly, the warden was reluctant to allow the filmmakers to work at the prison until he was introduced to Peckinpah. The warden knew his family from Fresno and was immediately cooperative. Siegel's <b>location</b> <b>work</b> and his use of actual prisoners as extras in the film made a lasting impression on Peckinpah. He worked as a dialogue coach on four additional Siegel films: Private Hell 36 (1954), An Annapolis Story, (1955, and co-starring L. Q. Jones), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Crime in the Streets (1956). Invasion of the Body Snatchers, in which Peckinpah appeared as Charlie the meter reader, starred Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. It {{became one of the most}} critically praised science fiction films of the 1950s. Peckinpah claimed to have done an extensive rewrite on the film's screenplay, a statement which remains controversial. Nevertheless, Peckinpah's association with Siegel established him as an emerging screenwriter and potential director.|$|E

40|$|In 2004, data {{obtained}} from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) indicated a total of 891 underground (6. 2 %) and 13, 587 surface (93. 8 %) mining operations. A total of 46, 360 employees, or 48, 183 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, were reported to MSHA as working at underground mining locations in 2004. This corresponded to 249, 457 employees (or 222, 839 FTE employees) that were reported as working at surface <b>locations.</b> Surface <b>work</b> <b>location</b> employee hours accounted for 82. 2 % of all hours reported to MSHA, while 17. 8 % of employee hours were reported for underground <b>work</b> <b>locations.</b> The majority of surface employee hours were for mine operator employees (83. 4 %) as opposed to independent contractor employees (16. 6 %). Coal operators were the mining sector reporting the most underground worker employee hours to MSHA (n= 73, 512, 625; 76. 3 %). Of the 55 occupational mining fatalities reported to MSHA in 2004, 16 occurred at underground <b>work</b> <b>locations,</b> while 39 occurred at surface locations.

The overall underground nonfatal lost-time injury rate was greater than the surface injury rate (5. 7 vs. 2. 4 per 100 FTE workers).
