Although the experts agreed that collusion among the bidders (which ultimately did occur; The Economist, May 17, 1997, p. 86) is more easily sustained within an open auction, in the end the faith placed in the <b>linkage</b> <b>principle</b> outweighed this concern and an open auction format was employed.

The findings indicate that spatial behaviour, specifically the distance between theft locations and between dump locations, is a highly consistent and distinctive aspect of vehicle theft behaviour; thus, intercrime and interdump distance represent the most useful aspects of vehicle theft for the purpose of case linkage analysis.

Target selection, acquisition, and disposal behaviours, as well as geographical and temporal behaviours, were examined. The effects of temporal proximity and offender expertise were also investigated as moderating factors of behavioural consistency. As in previous case linkage research, geographical and some target selection behaviours were able to predict whether crime pairs are linked or unlinked at a statistically significant level. Crucially, it was also found that temporal behaviours demonstrate a significant capability to predict linkage status, a variable which has never before been applied to the prediction of linkage in serial car theft. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that changing the operationalisation of the behavioural domains can affect the results obtained. No support was found for the moderation of behavioural consistency on the basis of temporal proximity or expertise. Overall, the results support previous case linkage studies, furthering their practical applicability within the criminal justice system. 12093...|$|R

USA 81, 7098 - 7102] has {{inferred}} {{that the}} Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for ligand binding by hemoglobin would require (contrary to experimental evidence) that increased ligand binding must promote stabilization of alpha 2 beta 2 tetramers {{with respect to}} dissociation into alpha beta dimers. Reexamination of the MWC model, however, {{in the light of}} general <b>linkage</b> <b>principles</b> and the specific analysis by G. K. Ackers and M. L. Johnson [(1981) J. Mol. Biol. 147, 559 - 582] shows that the opposite relation must hold, in agreement with experiment. The T form of the tetramer, with low ligand affinity, must be destabilized and progressively dissociates into the high-affinity dimers, designated D, as ligand binding increases. Each ligand molecule bound shifts the standard Gibbs free energy delta G 2 T for the D-T equilibrium by approximately 3 kcal/mol in favor of the dimer. Thus, T must exist in (at least) five delta G levels of cooperative free energy as it becomes progressively destabilized by successive binding of ligand molecules. Dissociation of the R tetramer to dimers, in contrast, is independent of the amount of ligand bound, so long as dimers and R-state tetramers possess the same (high) affinity for ligand. While the intrinsic ligand-binding constants of the T and R states (KT and KR) remain unchanged throughout by the postulates of the model, the model should not be regarded as a strictly two-state system in view of the multiple free-energy levels indicated above. The present analysis gives approximate, though not precise, agreement with experimental findings on the dimer-tetramer equilibrium considered by Weber and provides a rationale for interpreting other recent experiments concerning this equilibrium...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the words}} of Evan Kwerel, [...] "In the end, the FCC chose an {{ascending}} bid mechanism, largely because we believed that providing bidders with more information would likely increase efficiency and, as shown by Milgrom and Weber (1982), mitigate the winner's curse."

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is twofold: First, to {{demonstrate}} how the cooperative business structure, rooted in democratic principles, when analyzed within the framework of recent legal and critical theory, can be shown to have a transformative effect in alleviating the adverse effects of globalization. Second, to analyze the international legal environment, particularly trade arrangements, to examine the capacity for co-operatives to serve as social policy instruments for promoting social cohesion. This paper uses Habermasian legal and critical theory in illustrating the close <b>linkages</b> cooperative <b>principles</b> have with modern sources of legal legitimacy and democratic theory. It is argued that cooperatives contribute to a healthy public sphere and alleviate the â€œlegitimation deficitsâ€ increasingly manifest by the anti-globalization movement. This movement opposes the increasing power of transnational capital and institutions vis-Ã -vis national governments, and the lack of democratic control over such institutions and organizations. In order for cooperatives to have an influence on social cohesion and social capital, they must fully engage their democratic potential. Cooperatives are one means of democratizing the market system, thereby alleviating the negative effects of globalization. Consequently, there is a policy interest in promoting cooperative development. Cooperation can offer a viable alternative to global capitalism and transnational corporatism. Policy recommendations will be offered for facilitating cooperative legislation and for the promotion of cooperative development under international trade arrangements. A number of United Nations sponsored international conventions, such as the Co-operatives (Developing Countries) Recommendation of 1966 (No. 127), already advocate cooperatives as an effective means of social policy. With the increasing opposition to transnational corporatism, opposition rooted in the democratic aspirations of citizens; there is an increasing role for co-operatives to assert a democratic market alternative for policymakers to facilitate this demand in the social economy.
