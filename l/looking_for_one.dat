5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one.</b> That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks earlier, in the Beaufort Sea, crewmen {{on a ship}} spot a {{light in}} the sky that soon crashes into the sea. A body is {{retrieved}} from the crash, revealed to be an Alien Bounty Hunter. Two days later, the Bounty Hunter arrives in Scranton, Pennsylvania, at an abortion clinic and kills a doctor by stabbing {{him in the back}} of the neck with a stiletto weapon, then sets the building on fire and escapes. Mulder receives emails containing the doctor's obituary along with two other identical doctors. After interviewing a pro-life priest who had threatened one of the doctors, they are able to use a newspaper advertisement <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> of the men to track another one, Aaron Baker, to Syracuse, New York.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Moore scoured {{public domain}} films <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> that exuded a certain mood, {{intending}} {{to write a}} pseudo-soundtrack to it. The film he chose was Age 13, an educational film from the 1950s, originally for use in schools. He took the existing film, slowed it to half speed, and let it dictate the moods, textures, and even running times of the songs he wrote to it. The resulting album is titled Graveyard Mountain Home, which included a DVD containing the movie set to Moore's music.|$|E

Álvarez was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> shot and got it in the sixth round.

25|$|Brown et al. (1983) {{noted that}} time series studies {{to that point}} had found that for a 10 percent {{increase}} in the minimum wage, there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1–3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one).</b> In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 {{percent increase in the}} minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate. The study also found a small, but statistically significant, increase in unemployment for adults aged 20–24.|$|E
25|$|In its mature version, Vico's {{conception}} of sensus communis {{is defined by}} him as “judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race”. Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by Plato, Tacitus, Francis Bacon and Grotius. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, {{is to find the}} common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss Natural Law, improving upon Grotius, John Selden, and Pufendorf who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them. This is comparable to both Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws, as well as much later Hegelian historicism, both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.|$|E

500|$|New Line {{contracted}} with two {{high schools in}} Illinois, Elk Grove High School and John Hersey High School, to use their location for scenes in the remake. According to Principal Nancy Holman, of Elk Grove High, the studio contacted schools across the nation <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> that had a swimming pool. Although filming took place at both schools, neither was identified by name. The studio also cast 200 extras for various school scenes, including one in the pool, but required that all auditioning students be at least 16 years old. School board President Lenore Gonzales Bragaw was initially apprehensive about the deal, as she disliked {{the idea of the}} studio filming [...] "scenes of violence" [...] at the schools; Bragaw agreed to the filming after being assured that no one would be killed during the swimming scenes.|$|E
500|$|Gatiss and Moffat had {{considered}} adapting {{the character of}} Charles Augustus Milverton for some time, considering {{him to be a}} [...] "brilliantly realised" [...] villain. Moffat viewed Magnussen as Sherlock's [...] "intellectual mirror" [...] and a [...] "unique baddy", and stated that {{he fell in love with}} him. The character of Magnussen was originally conceived as an American retaining the name of Milverton, but Moffat changed both his nationality and name when Mikkelsen was cast. He found the name Magnussen on a website of Danish names, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> that resembled Milverton, the name of the original character from Doyle's short story. Gatiss noted that the character is a [...] "fascinating new place to go" [...] due to his differences from Moriarty. When Mikkelsen received the script, he stated that his first impression was that it was [...] "the best script I've ever read". Contrasting Magnussen to Moriarty, Cumberbatch stated that he was [...] "so chilling because of how real he is, how normal he is", and that he is [...] "not driven by a mad, chaotic joker's energy that Moriarty has".|$|E

Cena made his WWE television debut on the June 27, 2002 episode of SmackDown! by answering an open challenge by Kurt Angle. After declaring that he possessed [...] "ruthless aggression", Cena lost by a pinning combination. After the match, Cena was congratulated by Billy Kidman, Faarooq, Rikishi, and The Undertaker. Following the near-win, Cena became a fan favorite and started feuding with Chris Jericho, defeating Jericho at Vengeance. Then, Cena feuded with Los Guerreros (Chavo and Eddie Guerrero) and Cena picked up a victory over Chavo Guerrero on the September 3, 2002 taping of Velocity. On the September 12 episode of SmackDown!, Cena teamed with Edge in a losing effort against Los Guerreros, thus ending the feud in the process. Cena went on to defeat the likes of Albert and D-Von Dudley as he was restricted to appearances on Velocity for the rest of September.|$|E

Caspary went through a string of menial office jobs, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> where she could write instead of taking dictation from people with bad grammar. While working at an advertising agency composing copy, she invented the fictitious [...] "Sergei Marinoff School of Classic Dancing", a mail order dance course. [...] Caspary wrote all the materials for this and other correspondence courses she had little knowledge of, including one that taught screenwriting. She was also producing articles for publications such as Finger Print Magazine, and the New York -based Dance Lovers Magazine.
