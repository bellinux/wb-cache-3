40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. South Africa will be {{implementing}} Basel II on 1 January 2008. Basel II provides {{regulatory capital}} requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk. The purpose of capital requirements is {{to level the}} playing field for all internationally active banks and to protect consumers against these risks. Although there is an obvious threat of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and it is important to correctly measure and manage <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk,</b> it is almost glaringly omitted from Basel II. The result of not managing <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> properly may have dire consequences for banks because a liquidity crisis may happen without warning. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore current practices and to propose guidelines for effective <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> regulation in South Africa. A literature study and quantitative analysis on <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> in South Africa were conducted to assess whether it is valid for regulators to require banks to hold capital for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> This study provides conclusions and recommendations on the regulatory treatment of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> in South Africa under Basel II. Although Pillar 2 reviews a variety of other risks and not only <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk,</b> it is proposed that the <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> part of such reviews is conducted on the basis of a questionnaire used to determine possible gaps between banks' practices and prescribed criteria regarding the management and measurement of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> It is important to note that such an approach has a constraint in terms of the substantial amount of work that would have to be done on the regulation of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> by both regulators and banks. Therefore resource constraints and the cost versus the benefit of such an approach would have to be considered carefully. The all-encompassing conclusion to this study is that capital would not be an effective mitigant for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> for a number of reasons. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> differs from bank to bank and a general capital charge for all banks may not be sensible, therefore <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> should be analysed on a bank-by-bank basis. In other words, capital could be charged for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> under Pillar 2 (b) of Basel II. Such a capital charge would not serve the purpose of covering losses resulting from <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk,</b> but would instead impose a penalty on banks that are deemed to manage and measure <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> imprudently. Such a penalty would typically be quite small but would serve as an incentive for banks to improve their management and measurement techniques to the desired level as set out by prescribed criteria. The criteria that should be used for determining whether banks measure and manage <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> prudently should be of such a nature that the Bank Supervision Department (BSD) of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) complies with Basel Core Principle 14 : <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Risk</b> in regulating <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> In addition, it should align the criteria used to the 14 Principles for the sound management of liquidity as prescribed by the Bank for International Settlements and the Institute of International Finance. Furthermore, it is proposed that the BSD should not prescribe to banks which methods to use to report their <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk,</b> because all banks are not the same in terms of size and sophistication. For this reason, banks should be allowed to follow an internal models approach for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> whereby banks are, subject to regulatory approval, allowed to use their own internal <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> measures to report <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> to the BSD. This approach is similar to the approach followed by the Bundesbank in Germany. A <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> questionnaire could be drafted according to which banks' <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> management and measurement is assessed in terms of the sound Principles for managing <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and the Basel Core Principles. One questionnaire could be used for the purposes of assessing the quality of banks' <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> management and measurement in terms of a Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) as well as for banks applying for approval of an internal models approach for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> The same questionnaire could be used for both purposes, or the questionnaire could be divided into two clear sections whereby all banks are required to answer the SREP (or Pillar 2 (b)) section, and only banks applying for the use of an internal models approach for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> are required to complete this section. A further conclusion to this study is that the BSD should publish a framework in which its approach to regulating <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> is described in detail. Some aspects that should be included in such a document include a widely-accepted definition for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and guidelines/minimum standards for measurement and management techniques for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and the process that will be followed under Pillar 2 of Basel II. If the BSD is concerned about the level of potential <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> in the South African banking system, it should consider having the additional instruments that are eligible as collateral included as instruments eligible for liquid asset reserve requirements. An additional mitigant for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> may be that the BSD requires banks to report their <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> more frequently than the current monthly basis. Master...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{formulate}} a concept of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and to incorporate <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> in market risk measurement. We first review two types of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and the relation between <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and market risk. To achieve our aim, we use a new framework of portfolio theory introduced by Acerbi. A novelty of Acerbi’s framework is that portfolio valuation includes a consideration of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> in portfolio valuation. Under the new framework, the valuation of a portfolio becomes a convex optimization problem. We give some examples of calculation schemes for the convex optimization problem.

40|$|Recent {{economic}} turmoil {{has forced}} institutional investment firms to place {{more emphasis on}} liquidity. Firms such as banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, endowments, and pension funds all face {{a unique set of}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> factors. There are several methods for measuring <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> available to firms. However, these measures are subject to interpretation errors as well as errors in definition. Institutional investment firms need to understand <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> measures as well as the factors that are involved in determining these measures. Firms can only manage their <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> if they understand the risks that they are subject to and how to measure that <b>risk.</b> <b>Liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> management techniques that are viable for certain firms may not pertain to others. Regulatory requirements as well as firm-specific liquidity profiles are also important factors in determining the appropriate methods of quantifying and managing <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> This paper analyzes the <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> profile of banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, endowments, and pension funds and offers several liquidity measures that can be utilized by firms.

50|$|Asset and {{liability}} management (ALM) {{is the process}} of evaluating, monitoring, and controlling balance sheet risk (interest rate risk and liquidity risk). A sound ALM process integrates strategic, profitability, and net worth planning with risk management. Examiners review (a) interest rate risk sensitivity and exposure; (b) reliance on short-term, volatile sources of funds, including any undue reliance on borrowings; (c) availability of assets readily convertible into cash; and (d) technical competence relative to ALM, including the management of interest rate risk, cash flow, and liquidity, with a particular emphasis on assuring that the potential for loss in the activities is not excessive relative to its capital. ALM covers both interest rate and <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks</b> and also encompasses strategic and reputation risks.|$|E
50|$|Market {{and funding}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks</b> {{compound}} {{each other as}} {{it is difficult to}} sell when other investors face funding problems {{and it is difficult to}} get funding when the collateral is hard to sell. Liquidity risk also tends to compound other risks. If a trading organization has a position in an illiquid asset, its limited ability to liquidate that position at short notice will compound its market risk. Suppose a firm has offsetting cash flows with two different counterparties on a given day. If the counterparty that owes it a payment defaults, the firm will have to raise cash from other sources to make its payment. Should it be unable to do so, it too will default. Here, liquidity risk is compounding credit risk.|$|E

Even though, during the time, these two components of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> were approached independently, recent studies consider them interdependent. We want to emphasize with this study that in the actual framework of capital markets the two components of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> should always be analyzed together, in order to provide the best premises for decision makers...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} of Zimbabwe adopted a multiple currency regime in January 2009 {{after a decade}} of economic decline. The new regime brought with it benefits to the economy and helped restart financial intermediation. Despite these benefits, many banks are facing challenges of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> This paper empirically investigates the determinants of Zimbabwean commercial banks <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> after the country adopted the use of multiple currencies exchange rate system. To do so, panel data regression analysis is used on monthly data from March 2009 to December 2012. From the panel data regression results, capital adequacy and size have negative significant influence on <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> As size increases, <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> reduces. Spreads have positive influence on <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> Non-performing loans have a positive significant relationship with <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> Reserve requirement ratios and inflation were also significant in explaining <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> during the studied period. For commercial banks to manage <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> there is need to pay attention to bank capitalisation, the size of the bank and on the differences between the deposit rates and lending rates. There is also need for improved credit risk analysis if banks are to have good financial assets in the dollarised environment...|$|R
40|$|We offer a new {{explanation}} of loan syndicate structure based on banks' comparative advantage in managing systematic <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> When a syndicated loan to a rated borrower has systematic <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk,</b> {{the fraction of}} passive participant lenders that are banks is about 8 % higher than for loans without <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> In contrast, <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> does not explain the share of banks as lead lenders. Using a new measure of ex-ante <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> exposure, we find further evidence that syndicate participants specialize in liquidity-risk management while lead banks manage lending relationships. Links from transactions deposits to liquidity exposure are about 50 % larger at participant banks than at lead arrangers. ...|$|R
50|$|Security dealers {{choose the}} degree of price and {{liquidity}} risk to bear, their price risk is evidenced by their price quotes, meanwhile, their liquidity risk {{comes in the form}} of their yield quotes. Dealers find themselves constrained by their quantity of cash and the securities available to them in the market. Dealers will choose a short position when they can sell borrowed securities priced above their anticipated, fundamental value. Dealers profit from such short position transactions if the price for the security borrowed falls at the time they must return the security to its owner. Conversely, dealers elect long positions, taking on positive inventories of securities as assets, to compensate for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks.</b> If dealers believe the fundamental price for a security to be lower than the future price, the dealer will buy low and sell high. Crucially for the money markets, dealers can be thought of as borrowing short term and lending long term, motivated by liquidity. VBTs, by contrast, are the bargain hunters in the market for securities, they search for differences in prices and intrinsic values, therefore, motivated by a price quote and in no hurry to transact.|$|E

Imposing countercyclical capital adequacy ratio may amplify procyclicality or result in disintermediation, when <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks</b> are only moderate and financial stability is barely a threat.

40|$|From American {{subprime}} crisis to European debt crisis, {{the problem of}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> in commercial banks is never out of the public’s sight. At each financial crisis, banks {{are the first to}} get into a dilemma. Due to the implicit government guarantee and a macro-economic liquidity surplus, Chinese banking system has experienced {{a relatively small number of}} bankruptcy and liquidity crises, which makes it not urgent to manage <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> However, the 2013 June Currency Shortage in China exposes the severe potential liquidity difficulties. Therefore, this dissertation aims to study current status of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> management in Chinese banking system in the post-crisis era. Through the analysis of a series of static indicators, such as the non-performing loan ratio, the loan-to-deposit ratio and the liquidity ratio, it is believed that Chinese commercial banks are still in a condition of excessive liquidity. However, under the influences of new features in financial operation, such as financial disintermediation, inter-bank transaction and off-balance-sheet business, the <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> exposure in Chinese commercial banks enlarges. Additionally, through empirical study of determinants of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> in Chinese commercial banks, it can be estimated that the <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> in Chinese commercial banks is generally under greater role by internal factors than by external ones. Banks’ asset size and profitability replenish the <b>liquidity</b> to withstand <b>risks,</b> while higher equity-to-assets ratio and non-performing loan ratio intensify the risk exposure. Banks which have implemented Basel III standards face less likelihood of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> exposure than banks which have not implemented. After analysing the differences between Basel III and Chinese regulatory rules and differences in the <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> management modes between other countries and China, it can be concluded that the diversified, hierarchical and elaborated tendency of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> management and regulation in China is necessary.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} pricing of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks</b> in London Stock Exchange. Liquidity Adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Model i. e.
