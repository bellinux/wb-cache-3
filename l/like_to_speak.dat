500|$|On 2 February, Benfica {{played host to}} Boavista. They {{had several}} {{opportunities}} to beat William, but Boavista prevented them all. The match ended in a goalless draw, leaving Benfica one point away from the Estádio da Luz. Santos accepted the draw, saying, [...] "I do not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> about luck or misfortune. The ball just would not go in. That is it." [...] Eight days later, Benfica travelled to Estádio do Varzim to play the sixth round of the Portuguese Cup against Segunda Liga-side Varzim. The hosts opened the score with an own goal from Nélson in the 13th minute, but Benfica equalizer with a goal from Simão at the half-hour mark. In the second half, Varzim pressed again and António Mendonça scored a match-winning 77th-minute goal. Benfica's elimination {{at the hands of}} Varzim was the third time in Santos' career he was knocked-out of the Portuguese Cup by a team from lower divisions, the other clubs being Porto and Sporting.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the press}} conference Conner {{declined}} to comment on allegations of illicit drug use and claimed she was not an alcoholic but acknowledged making serious mistakes. After coming out of rehab less than two months later in February 2007, Conner admitted in an interview with Matt Lauer that she had abused cocaine and anti-depressants. Conner said that she had faced her [...] "demons" [...] and hinted her problems may have stemmed from some unspecified abuse during her childhood with someone she recently confronted. She would not comment on whether this abuse was sexual. [...] "I will not deny that I have witnessed some abuse, but out of respect for my family ... it's something I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with my family about first", Conner told NBC's Today show. [...] "Later on, maybe I'll feel more comfortable about speaking on these topics, but right now not so much." [...] She also participated in an interview on Larry King Live.|$|E
2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E

60|$|Vincent {{watched the}} list of {{advertisements}} of slaves to be sold, and {{a day or two}} later saw a notice to the effect that Dinah Moore, age twenty-two, with a male baby at her breast, would be sold on the following Saturday. He mounted his horse and rode into Richmond. He had not <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> his mother on the subject, for she had not told him of the letter she had written to Jackson; and he thought that she might disapprove of any interference in the matter, consequently he went down to Mr. Renfrew, the family solicitor.|$|R
30|$|Preventing {{students}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{in their}} L 1 is another exosystem factor affecting speaking anxiety, {{yet it is}} one of the institute policies. Two of the participants <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> their L 1 whenever they did not know what to say and they forgot a word, but since the regulations of the institute prevented them <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in their native language, Persian, they felt anxious and afraid to lose mark. Parisa reported: “I feel highly anxious in this case because switching to Persian can affect my speaking point.“ (Interview 4, February, 2016).|$|R

60|$|I am {{ashamed to}} jot down thus obscurely the points on which I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> and I {{know that our}} brethren can fully deal with them.

60|$|A man {{lay on a}} pile of new-made hay, in a great barn, {{looking up}} at the {{swallows}} who darted and twittered above him. He envied the cheerful little creatures; for he wasn't a happy man, though he had many friends, much money, and the beautiful gift of writing songs that everybody loved to sing. He had lost his wife and little child, and would not be comforted; but lived alone, and went about with such a gloomy face that no one <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him. He took no notice of friends and neighbors; neither used his money for himself nor others; found no beauty in the world, no happiness anywhere; and wrote such sad songs it made one's heart ache to sing them.|$|R

In Belarus, they sing anti-Putin songs at football stadiums; in Ukraine they simply hate us. In Ukraine now, there are no politicians {{who do not have}} extreme anti-Russian positions. Being anti-Russian is the key to success now in Ukraine, and that is our fault".|$|R
