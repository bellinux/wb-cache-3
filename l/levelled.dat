5|$|Fellow Premier League side Aston Villa {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the match at their home ground, Villa Park. They {{took the lead in}} the 20th minute when striker Darius Vassell scored a penalty. Midfielder Danny Murphy <b>levelled</b> the score seven minutes later. Liverpool took the lead in the second half when Baros scored and extended it when Steven Gerrard scored in the 67th minute. Two goals for Villa courtesy of midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger and an own goal by defender Stéphane Henchoz <b>levelled</b> the score at 3–3 late in the match. However, a Murphy goal in the 90th minute of the match meant Liverpool won 4–3 to progress to the semi-finals.|$|E

5|$|Reigning champions Tottenham Hotspur {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the semi-final. Liverpool won an attacking match at Anfield 1–0. The second leg at White Hart Lane was equally eventful.

Seven minutes Liverpool equalised when Steve Heighway scored this <b>levelled</b> the match and gave Liverpool a 2–1 lead on aggregate. Tottenham went 2–1 up when Peters scored again, this <b>levelled</b> the aggregate score at 2–2, but Liverpool had scored an away goal, and would therefore progress to the next round as a result.|$|E

5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually <b>levelled</b> as waterholes filled.

50|$|Critical care {{nurses in}} Australia {{do not need}} to have extra {{training}} than regular RNs do unless they have completed a postgraduate qualification. Therefore, their salaries are usually similar. Pay <b>levels</b> in nursing are bases on the position/level and experience. The average salary are approximately $55,617 for <b>level</b> 1.1, $57,841 for <b>level</b> 1.2, $60,155 for <b>level</b> 1.3, $62,561 for <b>level</b> 1.4, $65,063 for <b>level</b> 1.5, $67,666 for <b>level</b> 1.6, $70,373 for <b>level</b> 1.7, $73,187 for <b>level</b> 1.8, $75,488 for <b>level</b> 2.1, $77,028 for <b>level</b> 2.2, $78,600 for <b>level</b> 2.3 and $80,204 for <b>level</b> 2.4.

5|$|The {{original}} investigations <b>levelled</b> accusations at Silverio Nungo (who {{was later}} executed) and Lazaro Kavandame, FRELIMO leader in Cabo Delgado.

5|$|Two of {{the accused}} women, Laing and Nicholas Lawson, were imprisoned again in 1708–1709 after charges of {{witchcraft}} were <b>levelled</b> against them by Cowper and another local minister.

Another {{of the accused}} women, Janet Horseburgh, sued the bailies responsible for her incarceration; she received an apology and monetary recompense.|$|E
5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now <b>levelled</b> area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were <b>levelled</b> by the Soviets. Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old bunker complex that were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of the <b>levels</b> of Luxor 2 {{are similar to the}} {{arrangement of}} rounds in Zuma. There are four <b>levels</b> in the first stage, five in the second, and six in the third. The order of <b>levels</b> repeats after every third stage, however, one stage is added in this repetition. For example, <b>levels</b> 1-1 to 1-4 are repeated as <b>levels</b> 4-1 to 4-4, but <b>level</b> 4-5 is added. <b>Levels</b> 4-1 to 4-5 are repeated as <b>levels</b> 7-1 to 7-5, but <b>level</b> 7-6 is added. This is also true for the other <b>levels,</b> except that for the 13th stage, four additional <b>levels</b> are used before entering <b>level</b> 13-5, the last <b>level.</b>|$|R
50|$|These <b>levels</b> are {{classified}} as <b>Level</b> 1, <b>Level</b> 2 or <b>Level</b> 3. These <b>levels</b> differ in that <b>Level</b> 1 inputs have active markets, <b>Level</b> 2 inputs use models for similar assets, and <b>Level</b> 3 inputs are unobservable, relying on model assumptions. Since <b>Level</b> 2 and <b>Level</b> 3 inputs do not have active markets with identical assets, the discretion of management is required when determining the fair value of these assets. This provides room for managerial manipulation.|$|R
50|$|The mapping to the ISCED 1997 {{international}} statistical classification <b>levels</b> has research {{courses at}} both doctoral and master's <b>level</b> (codes D and L) corresponding to ISCED <b>level</b> 6; taught courses at doctoral, master's and honours <b>level</b> (codes E, M and H) corresponding to <b>level</b> 5A; courses at non-honours bachelor's-level and foundation degree/diploma <b>level</b> (codes I and J) corresponding to <b>level</b> 5B; and courses at certificate <b>level</b> (code C) corresponding to <b>level</b> 5B or <b>level</b> 4.

5|$|All {{but four}} of the women from Lidice were {{deported}} immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp (four were pregnant– they were subjected to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and the women were then sent to the concentration camp).

Both towns were burned and Lidice's ruins were <b>levelled.</b> At least 1,300 people were massacred after Heydrich's death.|$|E
