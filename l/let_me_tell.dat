5|$|There {{seems to}} prevail the opinion in some {{quarters}} that this meeting has been called {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|Auerbach was {{the author}} of seven books. His first, Basketball for the Player, the Fan and Coach, has been {{translated}} into seven languages and is the best-selling basketball book in print. His second book, co-authored with Paul Sann, was Winning the Hard Way. He also wrote a pair of books with Joe Fitzgerald: Red Auerbach: An Autobiography and Red Auerbach On and Off the Court. In October 1991 M.B.A.: Management by Auerbach was co-authored with Ken Dooley. In 1994, Seeing Red was written with Dan Shaughnessy. In October 2004, his last book, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Tell</b> You a Story, was co-authored with sports journalist John Feinstein.|$|E

60|$|I had {{intended}} to remonstrate with him pretty sharply for taking Lucilla to Browndown. After what he had now said, it was useless to attempt anything of that sort--and doubly useless to hope that he would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> extricate myself from my difficulties by <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> her the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have to play, you see--it's all I can do. But {{the people}} next door don't like it, though my room, you know, is not against their wall. Therefore I {{thank you for}} <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> them that you, in the house, don't find me a nuisance." ...|$|R
25|$|Ophelia, in Paul Griffiths' novel <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you (2008), is a {{derivative}} of Shakespeare's character who tells her story {{in her own}} words, in the literal sense that she can use only the words she is given in the play. She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of {{events leading up to}} {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
500|$|St. Leger took {{advantage}} of his victory to deliver another demand for the fort's surrender, which Gansevoort also rejected. The next day St. Leger sent in a third surrender demand, which included (false) news that Burgoyne was in Albany as well as threats that the Indians would be permitted to massacre the garrison and destroy the Mohawk valley communities from which the garrison was drawn. [...] In an eloquent refusal, Lieutenant Colonel Willett responded, [...] "By your uniform you are British officers. Therefore <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you that the message you have brought is a degrading one for a British officer to send and by no means reputable for a British officer to carry." ...|$|E
500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you something, I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] the {{policeman}} said, {{looking at me}} sulkily, [...] "she may open her door for that, but it'll no <b>let</b> <b>me</b> in. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> mair. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> wha the leddy at the manse is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right," [...] she said. [...] "So I'll just {{resolve that}} I will say 'no' if I don't {{want to say}} 'yes.' That really amounts to the same thing, you know. Thank {{you so much for}} <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you all about it. It must have bored you terribly, but it has done me so much good. I feel quite calm and {{rational}} now, and can go home and behave myself. Goodbye." ...|$|R

500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E
500|$|She made {{statements}} {{critical of}} the Bush administration for not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War. [...] Her close examination of the financial books of the McCain campaign during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you something: For {{the first time in my}} adult lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you—if you heard those words earlier—I am very proud of my country." [...] Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you what I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Aunt Mary {{is afraid}} of <b>me</b> <b>let</b> her <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> so, and I will {{contrive}} to go somewhere else." [...] Poor Nora knew that this threat was futile. There was no house to which she could take herself.|$|R
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>tell</b> {{the story}} of the Committee in greater detail, partly as a {{contribution}} to history; partly because, like most true stories, it is more amusing than the official story.|$|R

500|$|In 1925, Szigeti met Leopold Stokowski {{and played}} the Bach Chaconne in D minor for him. Less than two weeks later, Szigeti {{received}} a telegram from Stokowski’s manager in Philadelphia inviting him to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra later that year: it was his American debut. Szigeti had never played with an American orchestra before, nor heard one, and later he wrote of suffering stage fright. He was {{taken aback by the}} American concert scene, and the way that its publicity and popularity driven agents and managers determined much of what was heard in American concert halls. He believed they were not interested in works by the great masters, but preferred the popular light salon pieces he had left behind in his prodigy days. (To the end of his life, Szigeti loved to quote one memorable, cigar-chewing impresario who told him, with regard to Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata, [...] "Well, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, Mister Dzigedy—and I know what I’m talking about—your Krewtzer Sonata bores the pants off my audiences!") ...|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{found a home}} in the gay {{group that}} formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a {{professional}} association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is {{as proud}} as a queen,' {{he had once}} said as he was rowing from Hampton to Searle's Wharf, and lay on his oars as the falling tide carried his boat softly past the green banks of Richmond--'she is as proud as a queen, and yet as timid as a fawn. She <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> her that I love her, but she will not {{say a word to}} me in reply; as for {{touching}} her {{in the way of a}} caress, I should as soon think of putting my arm round a goddess.' ...|$|R
60|$|Father, {{will you}} believe me just this once? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> go. I <b>tell</b> you I haven't the documents.

And if I were a {{young man}} I would go {{to say good-bye to}} Mrs. Bowen as often as she would <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> honestly, Mr. Colville, did you ever see such an exquisite, perfect creature?" ...|$|R
500|$|Cash {{notes that}} when {{constructing}} his orrery, Horsefield asked a local man to manufacture a golden ball {{to represent the}} sun and the man replied that [...] "Aw'll mak' thee one an' charge thee now't for't; but, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> thee, fancy folk like thee 're a'lus poor". Indeed, he was: all of his interests were indulged despite a background of dire poverty, and he remarked of his celebrity in botanical circles that [...] "fame is not bread". He remained a gingham weaver and during his lifetime the sole financial benefit from his interests came when he raised a new hybrid lily– Tigridia conchiflora– in his garden and sold it to a Manchester nurseryman, Thomas Watkinson, for £10. His poverty caused him to be exempted from contributing to the book fund of the Prestwich Botanical Society from the mid-1820s, and he was later exempted from paying into the liquor funds of both that society and the wider-based group. These concessions demonstrate the extent to which his knowledge was appreciated and occurred despite the teetotal Hobson having to pay into a liquor fund of which by definition he took no advantage. Horsefield received £13 10s. from a subscription that was started in 1853 in another attempt to alleviate his penurious state. After his death on 6 March 1854, Esther, with whom he had six sons and five daughters, received £37 from this fund, and he left 37 bulbs of one of the earliest hybrid daffodils to be cultivated, Narcissus horsefieldii, that raised another £2 11s (£2.55). N. horsefieldii {{became one of the most}} popular and extensively grown varieties of daffodil.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
