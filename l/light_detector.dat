25|$|The {{transfer}} characteristic of RO is usually represented as the electrical {{resistance of the}} photoresistor {{as a function of}} the current through the light source; it is a convolution of three main factors: the dependence of light source intensity on its current, optical coupling and spectral matching between the light source and photoresistor, and the photoresponse of the photoresistor. The first dependence is almost linear and temperature independent for LEDs in the practical range of the controlling current. On the contrary, for incandescent lamps the light-current curve is not linear, and the emission spectrum varies with temperature, and thus with the input current. As to the <b>light</b> <b>detector,</b> its properties depend on temperature, voltage and the history of utilization (memory effect).

40|$|Bolometers {{have proven}} to be good {{detectors}} for the search of neutrinoless double beta decay. By operating at cryogenic temperatures, they feature excellent energy resolution and low background. The detection of the possible light emitted when particles interact in the bolometer is a promising method to lower the background of the experiments. The different amount of light emitted in beta/gamma and alpha interactions, whether due to scintillation or Cerenkov emission, allows to discriminate the two interaction types. Because of the cryogenic environment, <b>light</b> <b>detectors</b> are often bolometers. In this work we present a software algorithm to lower the energy threshold of bolometric <b>light</b> <b>detectors</b> coupled to luminescent bolometers. The application to data from Ge <b>light</b> <b>detectors</b> coupled to ZnMoO 4 and TeO 2 bolometers shows that the energy threshold can be lowered substantially, increasing the discrimination power when the amount of emitted light is small.
