5000|$|A load {{combination}} {{results when}} more than one <b>load</b> <b>type</b> acts on the structure. Building codes usually specify a variety of load combinations together with load factors (weightings) for each <b>load</b> <b>type</b> {{in order to ensure}} the safety of the structure under different maximum expected loading scenarios. For example, in designing a staircase, a dead load factor may be 1.2 times the weight of the structure, and a live load factor may be 1.6 times the maximum expected live load. These two [...] "factored loads" [...] are combined (added) to determine the [...] "required strength" [...] of the staircase.|$|E

50|$|Three linearly {{independent}} cracking modes {{are used}} in fracture mechanics. These load types are categorized as Mode I, II, or III {{as shown in the}} figure. Mode I, shown to the left, is an opening (tensile) mode where the crack surfaces move directly apart. Mode II is a sliding (in-plane shear) mode where the crack surfaces slide over one another in a direction perpendicular to {{the leading edge of the}} crack. Mode III is a tearing (antiplane shear) mode where the crack surfaces move relative to one another and parallel to the leading edge of the crack.

5000|$|The stress {{intensity}} factor, , is a parameter that amplifies {{the magnitude of}} the applied stress that includes the geometrical parameter [...] (<b>load</b> <b>type).</b> Stress intensity in any mode situation is directly proportional to the applied load on the material. If a very sharp crack can be made in a material, the minimum value of [...] can be empirically determined, which is the critical value of {{stress intensity}} required to propagate the crack. This critical value determined for mode I loading in plane strain {{is referred to as the}} critical fracture toughness (...) of the material. [...] has units of stress times the root of a distance. The units of [...] imply that the fracture stress of the material must be reached over some critical distance in order for [...] to be reached and crack propagation to occur. The Mode I critical stress intensity factor, , is the most often used engineering design parameter in fracture mechanics and hence must be understood if we are to design fracture tolerant materials used in bridges, buildings, aircraft, or even bells. Polishing cannot detect a crack. Typically, if a crack can be seen it is very close to the critical stress state predicted by the stress intensity factor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{most common}} cause of failure in bus {{structures}} is fatigue, and it is generally located at strain concentration zones that appear in the welded junctions of these structures. Therefore, measurement and characterization of these regions becomes crucial in structural analysis and design of bus structures. In bus structural analysis, simplified finite element models (FEM) are generally used, since they enable to examine different variables with low computational cost. Nevertheless, by utilizing these models, it is impossible to reproduce the structure junction geometry in detail, which impedes the calculation of strain in the concentration areas. In the present paper, measure and characterization of the strain concentration factor (SCF) of welded junctions typically present in bus structure has been carried out. For this purpose, 10 ‘T’ welded junctions were tested, disposed in two different configurations. Every junction was subjected to two types of load, and to 10 different load levels for each <b>load</b> <b>type.</b> A DIC equipment was used to obtain the deformations close to the weld bead. Once processed al the measured data, and calculated the SCF, it was characterized as function of <b>load</b> <b>type</b> and level. The results presented in this article make possible to know the actual strain experienced by the tested junctions in simplified FEM models, allowing a more precise structural design without computational cost increase. Additionally, an alternative methodology for the calculation of SCF based on the DIC techniques has been presented...|$|E
