40|$|In {{this work}} {{it has been}} {{verified}} {{the efficacy of the}} treatment of the wool dyeing with dye extracted from green walnuts husks using three methods: determination of the concentration of the dye adsorbed in fibre; determination of total exhaustion and determination of dyeing resistances at 400 C washing. Using the values obtained for dye concentration absorbed in fibre were established the optimum working parameters for dying process with dye extracted from green walnuts husks. The husks of green nuts has compounds from naphthoquinones namely juglone (5 hydroxy- 1, 4 naphthoquinone), red-brown crystals with m. p. = 1550 C. This {{is in the form of}} <b>leuco</b> <b>compound</b> which oxidizes in air, becoming dark-brown [1]. Juglone (5 hydroxy- 1, 4 naphthoquinone) crystallizes in benzene - petroleum ether, being in a state of 4 β-D glucozido- 1, 4, 5 -trihydroxynaphthaleno (α-hydrojuglone) and as a mixture of α and β - hydrojuglone with tannins. [2, 3, 4]The free Juglone is unstable and is rapid polymerizate. It goes in black brown color matters which color the textile fibres in shades of brown. The study has followed the extraction of natural colorant from green nuts and its characterization through spectral and chromatography analysis techniques. Using the chromatography technique, it was observed the presence of a single coloured spot in brown, the characteristic color of juglone. Analyzing the obtained UV-VIS and IR spectra, it was observed the presence of characteristic groups of compounds 5 hydroxy - 1. 4 naphthoquinones...|$|E
40|$|The {{photodegradation}} {{mechanisms in}} xanthene dye-laser solutions are investigated at 77 K by the direct detection of {{a decrease in}} the concentration of dye molecules in the lowest excited triplet state (T 1 state) and of free radicals produced after degradation using an ESR technique under UV (3511 + 3638 A) or 5145 -Å laser iriadiations. It is shown that the ESR spectral shape of the radicals induced by an UV laser beam is quite different from that of those induced by a 5145 -Å beam. For those radicals, the irradiation time and power dependences, the effects of dye and solvent molecular structures {{and the role of the}} T 1 state by the addition of cyclooctatetraene (COT) quenchers are examined in some detail. As a result the two following laser-induced photochemical reactions are proposed: in UV laser- or flashlamp-pumped dye lasers, the C-H bond rupture of a solvent molecule due to the energy transfer of a dye molecule in a higher excited triplet state, which is produced by a T-T absorption of a dye molecule in the T 1 state, results in a radical and a <b>leuco</b> <b>compound</b> of the dye. On the other hand, in the case of the 5145 -Å laser excitation, a partially reversible change of a dye molecule in the T 1 state produced by only a one-photon absorption results in another radical which depends on the chromophoric structure of the dye...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{oxidation}} being triggered during manufacture of the discs, {{and in order to}} avoid the need for operating in inert atmosphere, the leuco dyes are further chemically modified to their blocked forms. Such blocked leuco dyes are the leuco dye precursors that form the leuco dye by a slow, controlled chemical reaction. Leucomethylene blue can be reacted with triisopropylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, forming triisopropylsilyloxycarbonylleucomethylene blue (TIPSOCLMB), which is stable in presence of air oxygen. In presence of nucleophile reagents, e.g. water, the blocked <b>leuco</b> dye <b>compound</b> undergoes hydrolysis, releasing the unblocked leuco dye. This reaction is slow (several days to a week), and the hydrolytic compound is supplied either as atmospheric moisture, or in the formulation of the resin.|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study (1) ithas been shown that pyocyanine in mixture with its <b>leuco</b> <b>compound</b> is a reversible oxidation-reduction system that at pH> 6 behaves like {{any one of the}} known reversible dyestuffs of quinoid structure. How this property may manifest itself under biological conditions is shown in the following experiment: A culture of Bacillus pyocyaneus in which the blue pigment has been formed becomes colorless on the exclusion of air. On agitation with air the blue color is restored. The bacteria reduce the pigment to the colorless leuco base, which then by the oxygen of the air is reoxidized to the colored dye. Pyocyanine acts here as an autooxidizable acceptor for labile hydrogen of the microorganisms. This experiment shows that pyocyanine may play a r 61 e in dehydrogenative oxidation of bacteria in that it undergoes a cycle from the oxidized to the reduced and back to the oxidized form. As potentiometric studies (1) have shown that this cycle is also reversible thermodynamically, i. e., {{in the course of this}} cycle the entropy of the system, pyocyanineleucopyocyanine, remains constant, all the theoretical requirements are given which would allow pyocyanine to serve as an ideal catalyst for bacterial oxidation processes. But before pyocyanine can be so considered, proof is required that this pigment actually accelerates the oxygen consumption, i. e., the respiration of bacteria. This proof is submitted in what follows: Outline of the Experiment The Warburg manometric method was applied to measure the respiration of B. pyocyaneus with and without the addition of pure recrystallized pyocyanine, using bacilli that had been cultivated under conditions impeding the formation of pigment and that had been washed free from all traces of nutritive media and suspended in a phosphate buffer...|$|E
