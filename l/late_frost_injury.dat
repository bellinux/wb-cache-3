40|$|In {{the past}} 5 years wilt {{has come to}} be {{recognized}} as the most important oak disease in the upper Mississippi valley. The disease has been reported from Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri and Illinois. The fungus Chalara quercina Henry has been shown definitely to be the cause of the disease. Trees of the red oak group are killed quickly, usually within 30 to 60 days after wilt symptoms are apparent. Those of the white oak group may survive several years after infection with only a few branches being killed each year. All types of oak apparently are susceptible since all of the 28 species inoculated in the greenhouse were infected. The disease has been found on 9 of the 11 native species in Iowa. Infected trees have not been observed to recover from oak wilt. Prevention of spread of the disease has been attempted by various methods of sanitation. In general, removing diseased trees as soon as symptoms appear has been effective in stopping or retarding spread in state park and state forest test areas. Pruning experiments on trees that had only a few infected branches indicate that white oaks may often be saved by removal of such infected branches at a point well back of the <b>latest</b> symptoms. <b>Frost</b> <b>injury,</b> leaf blight and insect and rodent injury often result in leaf discoloration which from a distance may be mistaken for oak wilt...|$|R

Two approaches {{were used to}} assess hardiness: the electrolyte-leakage method based on artificial freezing, and meas-urements of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. The <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> index at- 20 °C differed between prove-nances, with a significant provenance-by-plot interaction. In material from the lower-altitude Vel’ký Lom trial plot, the high-elevation TANAP provenance exhibited much lower <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> than the middle-elevation Habovka and low-elevation Beòuš provenances. In material from the high-altitude Mútne-Zákamenné trial plot, all three tested provenances showed approximately the same degree of <b>frost</b> <b>injury.</b> At- 80 °C no differences between prove-nances were observed, and the trees growing at the high-elevation site exhibited lower average <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> than the trees at Vel’ký Lom.

To determine the vulnerability of apical and lateral shoots to damage caused by <b>late</b> <b>frosts,</b> we observed four test plots in 2009 and 2014, each containing progenies of selected seed stands. Our statistical analyses were based on a model incorporating the following variables: site, year, type of frost damage, population as well as the possible interaction between these variables. Significant differences between the populations were found in terms of their sensitivity to damage from low temperature occurring during the growth period. Furthermore, we indirectly demonstrated differences in the severity of <b>late</b> <b>frost</b> on the experimental plots and the intensity variability of <b>late</b> <b>frost</b> shoot damage.

The main aim {{of our study}} is to analyze the frequency of these events for the Luxembourg’s winegrowing region in the future. Spring <b>frost</b> <b>injuries</b> on grape may occur when young green parts are exposed to air temperature below 0 C. The potential risk is determined by: (i) minimum air temperature conditions and the (ii) the timing of bud burst. Therefore, we developed and validated a model for budburst of the grapevine (*Vitis vinifera) * cultivar Rivaner, the most grown local variety, based on multi-annual data from 7 different sites across Europe and the US. An advantage of this approach is, {{that it could be}} applied {{to a wide range of}} climate conditions. Higher spring temperatures were projected for the future and could lead to earlier dates of budburst as well as earlier dates of last frost events in the season. However, so far it is unknown if this will increase or decrease the risk of severe <b>late</b> <b>frost</b> damages for Luxembourg’s winegrowing region. To address this question results of 10 regional climate change projections from the FP 6 ENSEMBLES project (spatial resolution = 25 km; A 1 B emission scenario) were combined with the new bud burst model. The use of a multi model ensemble of climate change projections allows for a better quantification of the uncertainties.

40|$|Several {{different}} silvicultural treatments {{were studied}} in two experiments. In the first, mechanical scarification, slash removal, vegetation control, clear-cut age and seedling types were investigated {{with respect to}} <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings. Frost damage was also related to near-ground minimum temperature. In the other experiment, the effects of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) shelterwood density gradients, ranging from dense, uncut forest to complete clear-cuttings, were analysed. Near-ground temperature and radiation were monitored close to planted Norway spruce cuttings with a mobile data acquisition system. Growth, frost damage and chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored and analysed in relation to microclimate. Budburst date was estimated and the nocturnal near-ground temperature during the period when the seedlings were most susceptible to frost was analysed in both experiments. The shelterwood moderated near-ground radiation fluxes and diurnal temperature varia-tions, while the daily mean temperature was unaffected. Near-ground minimum tempera-tures were lower, and vertical temperature inversions were more pronounced in clear-cuttings than in shelterwoods, during clear and calm nights. The effects were most pro-nounced during a dry period. Budburst was delayed in the shelterwood. Later budburst was shown {{to reduce the risk}} of exposure to frosts during the most frost-susceptible period, when cuttings of two clones, differing in budburst date, were compared. Mechanical scarification reduced frost damage to seedlings in the first growing season, but neither herbicide treatment, nor mowing affected the frequency of <b>frost</b> <b>injury.</b> The frequency of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> was higher amongst containerised seedlings than amongst bare-rooted seedlings, especially in the first growing season. Neither clear-cut age nor slash removal affected the frequency of <b>frost</b> damage. <b>Frost</b> <b>injury</b> to the cuttings was reduced by the shelterwoods, since 80 % were damaged by frost in clear-cuts and low-density shelterwoods, 27 % in moderately dense shelterwoods, and only 5 % in dense shelter-woods. Of the climatic variables tested, the accumulated net and global radiation the day after a severe frost event were the most strongly correlated with the degree of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> among cuttings, and the variation in their Fv/Fm ratios, in the graduated shelterwoods. <b>Frost</b> <b>injuries</b> were rarely lethal, but reduced growth and increased the proportion of seed-lings with multiple leaders and spike knots, especially amongst seedlings that were re-peatedly injured over several years.

40|$|Four Solanum tuberosum L. cultivars (Nicola, Pito, Puikula, Timo) {{and somatic}} hybrids between {{freezing}} tolerant S. commersonii and freezing sensitive S. tuberosum were evaluated for their tolerance to freezing and low temperature photoinhibition. Cellular freezing tolerance was studied using ion leakage tests and {{the sensitivity of}} the photosynthetic apparatus to freezing and high light intensity stress by measuring changes in chlorophyll fluorescence (FV/FM) and oxygen evolution. Exposure to high light intensities after freezing stress increased <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> significantly in all genotypes studied. Compared with S. tuberosum cultivars, the hybrids were more tolerant both of freezing and intense light stresses. In field experiments the mechanism of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> varied according to the severity of night frosts. During night frosts in 1999, the temperature inside the potato canopy was significantly higher than at ground level, and did not fall below the lethal temperature for potato cultivars (from - 2. 5 to - 3. 0 °C). As a result, <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> developed slowly, indicating that damage occurred to the photosynthetic apparatus. However, as the temperature at ground level and inside the canopy fell below - 4 °C, cellular freezing occurred and the canopy was rapidly destroyed. This suggests that in the field visual frost damage can follow from freezing or non-freezing temperatures accompanied with high light intensity. Therefore, in an attempt to improve low temperature tolerance in potato, it is important to increase tolerance to both freezing and chilling stresses...|$|R

In this work some preliminary results of the micrometeorological measurements performed at a target area within an appletrees orchard are presented and discussed.

The relationship between nucleation frequency and <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> was examined by subjecting corn seedlings to − 4 °C immediately after they were sprayed with bacterial suspensions with different nucleation frequencies and by following both ice nucleus concentration and bacterial population size on leaves of corn seedlings as a function of time after bacterial application.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Spring {{frost damage}} to pears in the Pacific Northwest {{frequently}} results in substantial crop losses. This research was undertaken {{to investigate the}} effects of frost on pear buds, flowers, and fruit through controlled freezing tests and field studies {{in order to better}} understand the frost phenomenon and refine frost protection decisions. Controlled freezing studies on 'Bartlett' pear (Pyrus communis L.) showed that the percent of florets injured by frost increased with decreasing temperature, advancing developmental stage, and increasing duration at minimum temperatures of - 2, - 3, and - 4 ° C. Increases in injury occurred with exposures of 30 or 60 minutes at all stages except the small fruit stage, in which injury continued to increase for 2 hours at - 2 ° C. No significant effects of freezing rate were found at - 2, - 3, or - 4 ° C. However, there was a significant effect of freezing rate at - 5 ° C. No hardiness differences were found between comparable floral developmental stages from weak and vigorous trees. Bloom delay through evaporative cooling resulted in a loss of hardiness beyond that found earlier in the season on non-misted trees for similar stages of development. However, under field conditions a certain amount of frost protection was gained through bloom delay. Simulated <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to small fruit ovaries at intervals after full bloom significantly-increased fruit malformation, reduced fruit weight, and increased fruit drop of 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Comice' pear trees. Time of injury did not affect fruit weight and malformation in most cases, but early injury did significantly increase fruit drop. Significant positive correlations were found between fruit weight and seed content, while negative correlations were found between fruit malformation and seed content for all cultivars. Crop density was correlated significantly with sum of percent floral <b>injury</b> from <b>frost,</b> orchard design, and height in the tree for 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Anjou' pear. Regression models for crop density, regressed on sum of the percent injury, orchard design, and height in the tree differed between cultivars indicating that one model cannot be used to estimate crop density at harvest for all cultivars. Crop density was greater at low levels of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> in free standing than in hedgerow trees, and at greater elevations in the trees. Data suggest that 30 percent <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> in hedgerow and 60 percent <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> in free standing pear orchards are reasonable injury levels to accept without incurring crop losses...|$|R
