40|$|This paper {{describes}} loop shaping {{control design}} in feedback control systems, primarily {{from a practical}} stand point that considers design specifications. Classical feedback control design theory, for linear systems where the plant transfer function is known, {{has been around for}} a long time. But it s still a challenge of how to translate the theory into practical and methodical design techniques that simultaneously satisfy a variety of performance requirements such as transient response, stability, and disturbance attenuation while taking into account the capabilities of the plant and its actuation system. This paper briefly addresses some relevant theory, first in <b>layman</b> <b>s</b> <b>terms,</b> so that it becomes easily understood and then it embarks into a practical and systematic design approach incorporating loop shaping design coupled with lead-lag control compensation design. The emphasis is in generating simple but rather powerful design techniques that will allow even designers with a layman s knowledge in controls to develop effective feedback control designs...|$|E
40|$|Transactional Memory (TM) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an alternative implementation of mutual exclusion that avoids many of the drawbacks of locks (e. g., deadlock, reliance on the programmer to associate shared data with locks, priority inversion, and failures of threads while holding locks). TM enables the program- mer to denote atomic regions (transactions) that are executed optimistically; if a conflict is detected, the thread is rolled {{back to the beginning}} of the transaction. A Software Transactional Memory (STM) im- plements speculative execution (so that a roll back can be performed) and conflict detection by adding additional code to the application. In an STM that tracks mutual exclusion at a word or cache-line granularity, an ownership table is used to keep track of which transactions currently have read and write permissions to which regions of memory. Memory addresses are mapped to ownership table entries by hashing the memory address. A frequently proposed design for ownership tables (used in previous STM and hybrid hardware/software TM proposals) is that of a tagless table, where read and write permissions are granted at the granularity of all addresses that map to a given ownership table entry. When two transactions have memory accesses that map to the same ownership table entry, the tagless nature of this organization requires the STM to conservatively force one transaction to abort if one or more of the aliasing accesses is a write. Using address traces from a multithreaded program, we demonstrate that the frequency of these false conflicts grows superlinearly with both the TM data footprint and concurrency and that increasing the size of the ownership table results in only a sub-linear reduction in conflict rate. These somewhat surprising relationships have a theoretical foundation that is also responsible for the (naively) unintuitive statistical result generally referred to as the. Birthday Paradox. : that in a collection of at least 23 randomly chosen people, the probability is more than 50 % that at least two of them will have the same birthday. In <b>layman.</b> <b>s</b> <b>terms,</b> two addresses are likely to map to the ownership table entry long before the table is full. We present an analytical model based on random population of an ownership table by concurrently executing transactions that correctly predicts the trends in measured data. From this study, we conclude that tagless ownership tables are not a robust approach to supporting transactional memories. Even large tables (. 64 K entries) are only somewhat effective at mitigating false conflicts in the presence of modest sized transactions (e. g., 20 cache blocks) and modest degrees of concurrency (e. g., 4 simultaneous transactions). In contrast, tagged ownership tables, which record addresses and use chaining to handle aliasing, do not result in false conflicts and, when appropriately sized, only infrequently require chaining. This result is particularly important in the context of hybrid TMs, where the small transactions are likely handled in hardware, leaving only the large ones for the STM...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. (Financial Economics) The term {{structure}} of interest rates, particularly the term spread determined from {{the difference between}} ten-year government bond yields and three-month Treasury bill yields, has received increased attention as a valuable forecasting tool {{for the purposes of}} monetary policy and recession forecasting. This is {{on the back of the}} observed positive relationship between term spread and economic activity. Moreover, the term spread has been observed to invert prior to the occurrence of economic recessions both in developed and developing countries. This study investigated the forecasting ability of the South African (<b>S.</b> A.) <b>term</b> spread in predicting S. A. recessions, taking into account the recent global economic recession. The reason behind the investigation is due to the forecasting consistencies illustrated by the term spread in providing statistically incorrect signals of recession in 2003, which did not transit into reality. It implied a weak relationship between the <b>S.</b> A. <b>term</b> spread and economic activity. Moreover, based on observations from the literature that term spreads and economic activities across countries are correlated, the term spreads of China, United States (U. S.) and Germany were investigated and compared to the <b>S.</b> A. <b>term</b> spread, to determine which better forecasts S. A. recessions. The study employed the Dynamic Probit Model, since it is considered to provide a better predictive edge over the Traditional Static Probit model. The findings revealed that the <b>S.</b> A. <b>term</b> spread accurately predicted all the S. A recessions since 1980; Chinese term spread accurately predicted the 1996 and 2008 S.
