5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the <b>LIMPET</b> 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay <b>LIMPET</b> was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{perceived}} threat from Chinese submarines while in transit and from North Vietnamese swimmers with <b>limpet</b> mines while in harbour, Sydney was always escorted {{by at least one}} other RAN vessel. While in harbour, boats from Sydney and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly inspected the hull, propellers, and anchor chain for explosives. On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the class}} was {{designed}} with reconnaissance, small scale minelaying and special operations in mind, it does not possess any offensive weapons such as torpedoes. The submarine was to use its small dimensions to easily maneuver in the relatively shallow waters of the Adriatic sea, staying undetected and transporting up to six special forces personnel who had 612 <b>limpet</b> mines and four AIM-M70 (M70/1) bottom mines or four R-1 submersibles at their disposal. Velebit had a crew of four.|$|E

5|$|Bond and Solitaire {{are saved}} when the <b>limpet</b> mine explodes seconds {{before they are}} dragged over the reef: though {{temporarily}} stunned by the explosion and injured on the coral, they are protected from the explosion by the reef and Bond watches as Mr Big, who survived the explosion, is killed by the sharks and barracuda.

5|$|Bond {{continues}} his mission in Jamaica, where he meets a local fisherman, Quarrel, and John Strangways, {{the head of}} the local MI6 station. Quarrel gives Bond training in scuba diving in the local waters. Bond swims through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a <b>limpet</b> mine on the hull of his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow coral reef and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area with regular feedings will eat them.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, the Norwegian Troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied), No. 12, and No. 14 (Arctic) Commandos {{assisted}} the Royal Navy {{in carrying out}} antiâ€“shipping raids in Norwegian coastal waters. The Commandos provided extra firepower for the navy Motor Torpedo Boats when they were at sea and acted as a guard force when they were at anchor in the Norwegian fjords. In April 1943, seven men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando {{took part in a}} raid on German shipping near Haugesund code named Operation Checkmate. They managed to sink several ships using <b>limpet</b> mines, but were captured and eventually taken to Sachsenhausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where they were executed.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with their expected mission, the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 612 M-66 or M-71 <b>limpet</b> mines. Also at their disposal were four large AIM-70/71 bottom mines mounted {{on the outside of}} the submarines. Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried in place of the AIM-70/71 mines. With a full crew of six members the boats had an underwater endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if the complement numbered ten personnel (four crew members and six naval commandos).|$|E

5|$|The {{waters of}} {{south-west}} Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks, Atlantic grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion {{in particular are}} recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins {{in the whole of}} the UK. River fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and Arctic char, whilst the Gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is also known for its shellfish, including cockles, <b>limpet,</b> mussels and periwinkles. Herring, mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's seafish.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The <b>limpet</b> Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach <b>limpet</b> mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E

40|$|Activity of <b>limpets</b> in an Irish sea lough, Lough Hyne, was {{suppressed}} during heavy rainfall; osmotic {{stress from}} dilution {{appears to have}} led to increased mortality in transplanted <b>limpets.</b> Activity increased as tides progressed from neaps to springs, and for <b>limpets</b> low on the shore it was enhanced by wave action. Lack of activity in calm water may reduce predation pressure from crabs. Either low relative humidity or dryness of the rock diminished activity of low-water <b>limpets.</b> Differences in feeding activity between low- and high-water <b>limpets</b> may relate to food supply, since more food was available low on the shore, and the guts of low-water <b>limpets</b> contained more diatoms. -from Authorslink_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine the mechanism by which <b>limpets</b> attach to the substratum. Pressure measurements were made under the feet of three species of <b>limpets</b> as they were forcibly detached from the substratum. These measurements show that <b>limpets</b> actively decrease the pressure under their feet, and {{in almost every case}} this pressure decrease can account for all of their tenacity. The results are the same whether the pressure transducer is flush with the surface or connected to the surface via a tube. The tenacity of <b>limpets</b> is dependent on ambient pressure, as predicted for a suction mechanism. Leaks disrupt the attachment of <b>limpets.</b> Thus, {{for at least an hour}} after they have been moving, suction appears to be the primary attachment mechanism of <b>limpets.</b> <b>Limpets</b> using suction often have tenacities greater than 0. 1 MN m~ 2, which corresponds to pressures under the foot lower than OMPa. If <b>limpets</b> have more than a few hours to attach, approximately 30 % of them form a different, stronger attachment that appears to be based on glue. These <b>limpets</b> remain stationary for extended periods. It is hypothesized that <b>limpets</b> in the field alternate between the use of suction and glue, depending on their need for mobility...|$|R
5|$|After {{travelling}} to Istanbul, Bond {{heads into}} the city to meet with station head Ali Kerim Bey, tailed by Bulgarian secret agents working for the Russians. They are in turn tailed by Grant, who kills one of them after Bond is taken back to his hotel, stealing their car and dumping it outside the Soviet Consulate in order to provoke hostilities between British and Soviet Intelligence. In response, the Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a <b>limpet</b> mine - but Kerim is away from his desk for a tryst with his mistress. He and Bond then investigate the attack by spying on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope installed in the underground aqueducts beneath Istanbul. Thus, they learn that the Soviet agent Krilenku {{is responsible for the}} bombing. Kerim Bey declares it unwise to stay in the city under such circumstances and takes Bond to a rural gypsy settlement. However, Krilenku learns of this and promptly attacks a Gypsy feast (where Bond and Kerim are honoured guests) with a band of hired Bulgarian fighters. Much to Bond's confusion, he is saved from an enemy fighter during the attack by a distant sniper shot from Grant. The following night, Bond and Kerim Bey track Krilenku down to his hideout, where Kerim Bey kills him with Bond's rifle.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once within striking distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using <b>limpet</b> mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{environmental}} change on the distribution and abundance of strongly interacting organisms, such as intertidal macroalgae and their grazers, needs a thorough knowledge of their underpinning ecological relationships. Control of grazer-plant interactions is bi-directional on northwestern European coasts: grazing by <b>limpets</b> structures populations of macroalgae, while macroalgae provide habitat and food for <b>limpets.</b> Scottish shores dominated by the macroalga Fucus vesiculosus support lower densities and larger sizes of <b>limpets</b> Patella vulgata than shores with less Fucus. These patterns {{may be due to}} differences in inter-size-class competitive interactions of <b>limpets</b> among shores with different covers of Fucus. To examine this model, densities of small and large <b>limpets</b> were manipulated in plots with and without Fucus. Amounts of biofilm were measured in each plot. The presence of Fucus increased survival but hindered growth of small (15 mm TL) <b>limpets,</b> which were negatively affected by the presence of large <b>limpets</b> (31 mm TL). In contrast, large <b>limpets</b> were not affected by the presence of Fucus or of small <b>limpets.</b> This suggests the occurrence of asymmetric inter-size-class competition, which was influenced by the presence of macroalgae. Macroalgae and increased densities of <b>limpets</b> did not influence amounts of biofilm. Our findings highlight the role of interactions among organisms in generatin...|$|R
