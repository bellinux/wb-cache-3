50|$|By {{the end of}} 2000, the Weekly had {{sales of}} more than $10 million and had {{achieved}} profitability. That success soon faded as the bursting of the dotcom bubble, sent the Weekly and its competitors into a financial tailspin. Papers began to fail and often were sold. In {{the case of the}} Weekly and the <b>Guardian,</b> <b>litigation</b> over who was at fault for the losses ensued.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{continuing}} legal complications in the Welles {{estate and}} a lawsuit by Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles, caused {{the project to}} be suspended. When Welles died in 1985 he had left many of his assets to his estranged widow Paola Mori, and after her own death in 1986 these were inherited by their daughter Beatrice Welles. However, he had also left various other assets, from his house in Los Angeles to the full ownership and artistic control of all his unfinished film projects, to his longtime companion, mistress and collaborator Oja Kodar, who co-wrote and co-starred in The Other Side of the Wind. Since 1992, Beatrice Welles has claimed in various courts that under California law, she has ownership of all of Orson Welles' completed and incomplete pictures (including those {{which he did not}} own the rights of himself in his own lifetime), and The Other Side of the Wind has been heavily affected by this <b>litigation.</b> The <b>Guardian</b> described how she [...] "stifled an attempt by US cable company Showtime and Oja Kodar (Welles's partner {{in the latter part of}} his life) to complete The Other Side of the Wind", whilst the Daily Telegraph stated that Beatrice Welles had [...] "blocked" [...] the film. Matters have been exacerbated by much personal animosity between Oja Kodar and Beatrice Welles - Beatrice blames Kodar for causing the break-up of her parents' marriage, while Kodar blames Beatrice for attempting to block the screening or re-release of a number of her father's works, including Citizen Kane, Othello, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight and Filming Othello. (The latter claim has been supported by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who has accused Beatrice of being solely motivated by profit in claiming royalties from these films, then settling out of court as studios have been keen to avoid costly legal battles.) A clause of Welles' will, specifying that anybody who challenges any part of Kodar's inheritance will be automatically disinherited, remains unenforced - Kodar sought to have it enforced in the 1990s, but could not afford the legal fees as the case dragged on.|$|R

50|$|Tolofson v Jensen, 1994 3 S.C.R. 1022 is a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} Supreme Court of Canada on conflict of laws in tort. The Court held that the primary determiner in selecting a country's law in tort should be the lex loci (the location where the tort occurred). The case was decided with Lucas (<b>Litigation</b> <b>guardian</b> of) v Gagnon.|$|E
5000|$|Dobson (<b>Litigation</b> <b>guardian</b> of) v Dobson, 1999 2 S.C.R. 753 was a {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} Supreme Court of Canada on a pregnant woman's legal duties in tort law. It {{was the first time}} the Supreme Court of Canada had to consider this issue. [...] The majority of the Court found that tort claims cannot be brought against women for negligence toward the fetus during pregnancy.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have noted that}} along with Borowski v Canada (AG) (1989), Tremblay v Daigle [...] "closed off litigation opportunities by pro-life opponents" [...] of pro-choice Canadians. Another scholar notes that this case, along with the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal's Borowski decision and the Supreme Court case R v Sullivan (1991), all probably indicate the fetus is not a person under the Canadian Charter. A comparable result to Daigle occurred in 1999 in Dobson (<b>Litigation</b> <b>guardian</b> of) v Dobson.|$|E
5000|$|In Morgentaler, {{the court}} had {{determined}} that, while the state {{has an interest in}} protecting the fetus [...] "at some point", this interest cannot override that of the pregnant woman because: [...] "the right to security of the person of a pregnant woman was infringed more than was required to achieve the objective of protecting the fetus, and the means were not reasonable." [...] Two further cases addressed the [...] "interest in the fetus". In Dobson (<b>Litigation</b> <b>Guardian</b> of) v. Dobson, a grandfather attempted to act on behalf of a child born with cerebral palsy, supposedly resulting from a car accident in which the mother was the driver. He attempted to sue the mother with negligence in driving. The mother was in favor of the suit succeeding, as it would have provided her with funds to raise her disabled child, while her insurance company was defending the suit through subrogation. Citing the City of Kamloops v. Nielsen, the Court decided that courts cannot impose a duty of care on a pregnant woman toward her fetus as it would interfere with the exercise of her autonomy rights during pregnancy, and the difficulty in defining a standard of care in pregnancy. Only a legislature can do this. In Winnipeg Child & Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G [...] (D.F.), I997 3 SCR 925 M, courts determined that a pregnant woman addicted to solvents could not be civilly committed for treatment.|$|E
40|$|In Energex Limited v Sablatura [2009] QSC 356 the {{difficulty}} facing the applicant related not to its substantive rights, but to {{its ability to}} vindicate those rights without an effective respondent to the application.

40|$|The {{decision}} of Justice Boddice in The Public Trustee of Queensland (as <b>Litigation</b> <b>Guardian</b> for ADF) v Ban & Anor {{is the latest}} in a series of Supreme Court actions arising out of Ms Ban’s management of the affairs of her long-time elderly friend, ADF. Following on from an earlier decision in which it was determined that Ms Ban held her share of funds in a joint bank account with ADF on trust for him, this most recent case concerned a claim for an account of funds withdrawn from that account on the basis that as trustee Ms Ban owed fiduciary duties to ADF. The purpose of the accounting was to determine whether any withdrawals had been made in breach of trust, which would give rise to equitable remedies. The primary question for determination was therefore whether the withdrawals were applied for the benefit of ADF. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, his Honour found that although some transactions were for ADF’s benefit, substantial withdrawals, (including a significant portion of a 700, 000 transfer), were not applied for his benefit, and were therefore made in breach of fiduciary obligation, giving rise to equitable rights and remedies. ...|$|E
