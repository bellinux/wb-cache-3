Soul Reaver was generally well received by critics and praised for its intriguing gothic story and high-quality graphics.

5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} <b>legal</b> <b>problems.</b> On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
40|$|A {{concrete}} example, {{the invention}} of the NOW account, illustrates five characteristic steps of creative <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving: recognizing an opportunity for creative <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving, identifying the relevant legal, commercial and technical constraints, creating potential solutions perhaps by adapting past case solutions, evaluating the alternatives in light of the constraints, and bringing a solution into fruition. In a constrained pedagogical application, an AI & Law model might be able to model certain steps of this process. Reasoning systemically for purposes of adaptation and critiquing solutions that meet {{the letter of the law}} but not its spirit, however, will prove a challenge. Most law professors, judges, attorneys, legislators, regulators and clients probably would agree that creative <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving is an important topic.

The focus of the research on <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving is on formulating hypotheses about modelling <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving for educational purposes and testing these hypotheses in an experiment.

5|$|Crewe was {{the seat}} of the de Crewe (or de Criwa) family in the 12th and 13th centuries; they built a timber-framed manor house there in around 1170. The manor passed to the de Praers family of Barthomley in 1319 by the {{marriage}} of Johanna de Crewe to Richard de Praers. Later in the 14th century it passed to the Fouleshurst (or Foulehurst) family, who held the manor jointly with that of Barthomley until around 1575, when the estate was dispersed. <b>Legal</b> <b>problems</b> resulted in the lands being acquired by Sir Christopher Hatton, from whose heirs Sir Randolph Crewe (1559–1646) purchased an extensive estate including the manors of Crewe, Barthomley and Haslington in 1608 for over £6,000 (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Croitoru {{was also}} known for his history of <b>legal</b> <b>problems.</b> He {{was a member of}} Satan's Choice, a biker gang.

After a lengthy investigation, the charges were dropped in June 2006 because of insufficient evidence. He worked as a security guard in Vancouver, British Columbia, until being arrested in May 2009 for conspiracy to commit murder. On January 24, 2011, Croitoru was charged with first degree murder in connection with the 2008 killing of Jonathan Barber in Burnaby, British Columbia.|$|E

Approached in 1964 by producer Norman Felton to write a spy series for television, Fleming provided several ideas, including the names of characters Napoleon Solo and April Dancer, for the series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. However, Fleming withdrew from the project following a request from Eon Productions, who were keen to avoid any <b>legal</b> <b>problems</b> that might occur if the project overlapped with the Bond films.|$|E
40|$|Recently a German {{professor}} has {{advocated the}} adoption {{in this country}} of the German style of <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving. Occasionally a German author attempts to civilise the common-law world using what is put forward as a more rational approach.

5|$|In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed in Stoumen v. Reilly {{the right}} of homosexuals to {{assemble}} peacefully.

A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially {{to have a place}} to socialize without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned of each other and grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve <b>legal</b> <b>problems</b> inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} educational {{issue in}} legal {{higher education is}} the integration of skills into the undergraduate curriculum. 1 This raises {{a whole series of}} questions including: What are these skills? Which skills reach across disciplines? Which are discipline specific? How essential are they and how can they be taught? 2 Integral to this issue is that students in the post modern 21 st century are continuously challenged by unique situations which are ill-defined, for which they may have no previous experience and which do not necessarily have one clear solution. Such divergent problems are not quantifiable or verifiable and so do not lend themselves to a single, simple solution 3 but require a self-directed response based on a creative analysis of the contextual factors involved. Problem-based learning (PBL), with its emphasis on autonomy and collaborative, active learning, appears to be one way to encourage students, particularly first years, to develop the skills needed to deal with the dynamic complexity 4 with which they are increasingly confronted. In particular, the author argues in this article, it is an approach that is effective in teaching the skill of <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving. This article describes the process undertaken to develop a computer-based module designed to introduce law students, through the use of PBL, to <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving and its potential relevance to their professional practice. Further, the article discusses how the principles and processes of PBL as integrated into a computer-based education module (CBE) can be applied to <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving. It describes the use of the module with first year off-campus students studying law at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) as well as final year on-campus law students and demonstrates how the CBE module has been integrated into teaching <b>legal</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills for these students...|$|R

5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his <b>legal</b> <b>problems</b> came while he was {{president}} of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E
