25|$|Another theory {{states that}} most are natural {{phenomena}} such as <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> and balloons, which appear disc-like in some lighting conditions.|$|R
5000|$|A pileus or cap cloud, {{similar to}} a <b>lenticular</b> <b>cloud,</b> may form above the {{mountain}} or cumulus cloud generating the wave.|$|E
50|$|A Föhn cloud is any cloud {{associated}} with a föhn, usually an orographic cloud, a mountain wave cloud, or a <b>Lenticular</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stratocumulus Duplicatus clouds {{appear as}} {{stratocumulus}} clouds {{with two or}} more layers or sheets. Stratocumulus duplicatus is common on species lenticularis or <b>lenticular</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Mountain wave schematic. The wind flows {{towards a}} {{mountain}} and produces a first oscillation (A). A second wave occurs further away and higher. The <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> form {{at the peak}} of the waves (B).|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the crest}} of the wave, {{adiabatic}} expansion cooling can form a cloud in shape of a lens (lenticularis). Multiple <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> can be stacked {{on top of each other}} if there are alternating layers of relatively dry and moist air aloft.|$|R
5000|$|As {{air flows}} along {{the surface of}} the Earth, it {{encounters}} obstructions. These can be human-made objects, such as buildings and bridges, or natural features, like hills, valleys, and mountains. All of them disrupt the flow of air into eddies. The strength of the eddies depends {{on the size of the}} object and the speed of the wind. It results in turbulence classified as ‘mechanical’ because it is formed through the “mechanical disruption of the ambient wind flow”.Where stable moist air flows over a mountain or a range of mountains, a series of large-scale standing waves may form on the downwind side. If the temperature at the crest of the wave drops to the dew point, moisture in the air may condense to form <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds.</b> As the moist air moves back down into the trough of the wave, the cloud may evaporate back into vapour. Under certain conditions, long strings of <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> can form near the crest of each successive wave, creating a formation known as a [...] "wave cloud." [...] The wave systems cause large vertical air movement, enough that water vapour may condense to produce precipitation. The clouds have been mistaken for UFOs (or [...] "visual cover" [...] for UFOs), particularly the round [...] "flying saucer"-type, because these clouds have a characteristic lens appearance and smooth saucer-like shape; also, because <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> generally do not form over low-lying or flat terrain, many people have never seen one and are not aware clouds with that shape can exist. Bright colours (called iridescence) are sometimes seen along the edge of <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{cap cloud}} {{is a special}} form of the <b>lenticular</b> <b>cloud</b> with a base low enough that it forms around and covers the peak, capping it.|$|E
5000|$|The third main {{type of lift}} used by glider pilots is the lee {{waves that}} occur near mountains. The {{obstruction}} to the airflow can generate standing waves with alternating areas of lift and sink. The top of each wave peak is often marked by <b>lenticular</b> <b>cloud</b> formations.|$|E
5000|$|A pileus ( [...] ; Latin for cap), {{also called}} scarf cloud or cap cloud, is a small, horizontal, <b>lenticular</b> <b>cloud</b> {{appearing}} above a cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud, giving the parent cloud a characteristic [...] "hoodlike" [...] appearance. Pilei tend to change shape rapidly. They are formed by strong updraft at lower altitudes, acting upon moist air above, causing {{the air to}} cool to its dew point. As such, they are usually indicators of severe weather, and a pileus found atop a cumulus cloud often foreshadows transformation into a cumulonimbus cloud, as it indicates a strong updraft within the cloud.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> are {{stationary}} lens-shaped {{clouds that}} are formed downwind of mountains by lee waves {{if the air}} mass {{is close to the}} dew point. They are normally aligned at right-angles to the wind direction and are formed at altitudes up to 12000 m.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The wind flows {{towards a}} {{mountain}} and produces a first oscillation (A) followed by more waves. The following waves will have lower amplitude {{because of the}} natural damping. <b>Lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> stuck {{on top of the}} flow (A) and (B) will appear immobile despite the strong wind.|$|R
50|$|The BBSR and Hendry studies {{identified}} as rare causes for UFO reports based on misidentification, such objects and phenomena as birds, light phenomena (including mirages, moondogs, sundogs, auroras, ground lights such as street lights, and searchlights reflected off of clouds), and atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, dust and fog (including unusual cloud formations such as <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds,</b> noctilucent clouds, rainbow effects, and high-altitude ice crystals). Other identified causes included kites, flares, reflections off windows, and windborn debris.|$|R
5000|$|The Sierra Wave {{is a type}} of <b>lenticular</b> <b>cloud</b> {{created by}} winds that lift off the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range of California. Known as lee waves, Sierra Waves form as winds hit the Sierra Nevada and are forced to rise, causing water vapor to condense as it cools and forming lenticular clouds on the leeward side of the mountain range. These clouds can remain stationary for many hours. The formation of a Sierra Wave is dependent upon many factors, including wind speed and direction, leeward wind patterns, and water vapor. Given that Sierra Waves are dependent upon many variables their formation is unpredictable.|$|E
5000|$|Species: Altocumulus {{has four}} species. The {{stratiformis}} species (Ac str) {{is composed of}} sheets or relatively flat patches of stratocumuliform cloud. The synoptic coding {{is determined by the}} predominant variety or occasionally by the genitus mother cloud. Altocumulus lenticularis (Ac len <b>lenticular</b> <b>cloud)</b> is a lens-shaped middle cloud which can resemble flying saucers and may occasionally be mistaken for [...] "unidentified flying objects". This is formed by uplift usually associated with mountains. but usually with at least some grey shading. It is coded CM4 on the SYNOP weather observation. Grey shading is also seen with altocumulus castellanus (Ac cas), a turreted middle cloud that can achieve significant vertical development and signals increasing airmass instability. It is nevertheless usually classified as middle rather than vertical and is coded CM8. The floccus species (Ac flo) is a tufted middle cloud which is also associated with greater instability. It shares the same code CM8. Chaotic altocumulus, which is typically poorly defined with multiple species or transitional forms arranged in several layers, is coded CM9.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> (Altocumulus lenticularis) are {{stationary}} lens-shaped {{clouds that}} {{form in the}} troposphere, normally in perpendicular alignment to the wind direction. There are three types of lenticular clouds: altocumulus standing lenticular (ACSL), stratocumulus standing lenticular (SCSL), and cirrocumulus standing lenticular (CCSL). Because of their shape, they have been offered as an explanation for some unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.|$|R
50|$|Adiabatic cooling {{occurs when}} the {{pressure}} on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings. When the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced, {{the air in the}} parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases. Adiabatic cooling occurs in the Earth's atmosphere with orographic lifting and lee waves, and this can form pileus or <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The rotor may {{generate}} cumulus or {{cumulus fractus}} in its upwelling portion, {{also known as}} a [...] "roll cloud". The rotor cloud looks like a line of cumulus. It forms on the lee side and parallel to the ridge line. Its base is near the height of the mountain peak, though the top can extend well above the peak and can merge with the <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> above. Rotor clouds have ragged leeward edges and are dangerously turbulent.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} that simple convection from mountain summits can also form wave clouds. This occurs as the convection forces a wave or <b>lenticular</b> wave <b>cloud</b> into the more stable air above.|$|R
5000|$|Pilots of powered {{aircraft}} tend {{to avoid}} flying near <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> {{because of the}} turbulence of the rotor systems that accompany them, but glider pilots actively seek them out. The precise location of the rising air mass is fairly easy to predict from {{the orientation of the}} clouds. [...] "Wave lift" [...] of this kind is often very smooth and strong, and enables gliders to soar to remarkable altitudes and to great distances. [...] the gliding world records for both distance (over 3,000 km; 1,864 mi) and absolute altitude (15,460 m; 50,721 ft)were set using such lift.|$|R
50|$|To {{alleviate}} this confusion, scientists Richard S. Scorer and Corfidi {{propose a}} cloud classification {{based only on}} physical criteria obtained from vertical soundings and observations from meteorological satellites to reclassify the castellanus as a cloud genus {{at the same level}} as a cumulus or a cirrus. Corfidi has long criticised the resistance from official bodies to this change. However, the 2016 version of the International Cloud Atlas will not change the status of the castellanus. The same scientists have a similar opinion about <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> that can exist at different levels that are not recognised as a full cloud genus but only as a species.|$|R
5000|$|Cloud {{iridescence}} is {{the occurrence}} of colors in a cloud similar to those seen in oil films on puddles, located in the general vicinity of the sun or moon. It is a fairly common phenomenon, most often observed in altocumulus, cirrocumulus, <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> and cirrus clouds. [...] The colors are usually pastel, but can be very vivid. When occurring near the sun, the effect {{can be difficult to}} spot as it is drowned in the sun's glare. This may be overcome by blocking the sun with one's hand or hiding it behind a tree or building. Other aids are dark glasses, or observing the sky reflected in a convex mirror or in a pool of water.|$|R
5000|$|In meteorology, irisation, {{a type of}} photometeor, is {{multiple}} mixed iridescent colors {{caused by}} sunlight being diffracted in clouds. The colors are often brilliant and mingled together, sometimes similar to mother-of-pearl. They sometimes appear as bands parallel {{to the edge of}} the clouds. Irisation is caused by very uniform water droplets diffracting light (Within 10 degrees from the Sun) and by first order interference effects (Beyond about 10 degrees from the Sun). It can extend up to 40 degrees from the Sun. Irisation is sometimes seen along the borders of <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds.</b> Irisations are named after the Greek goddess Iris, goddess of rainbows and messenger of Zeus and Hera to the mortals below.|$|R
5000|$|Meso-Mediterranean level: from 100 to 1000 m {{above sea}} level on the south-facing slope and 0 to 700m on the north slope. This level, with cooler temperatures, is {{characterized}} mainly by the holm oak, Maquis shrubland and arbutus but also by cork oak and maritime pine (on the sunny side), the downy oak (on the shady side), chestnut, lavender, broom, cistus, and lentisk. On the heights, between bare rocks, vegetation is stubbly - swept by frequent and violent westerly and south-westerly winds (the Libeccio) which become stronger after crossing the ridge of the Serra di Pigno and blow down along the valleys to the sea. The winds form remarkable <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> off Bastia.|$|R
25|$|Unexplained aerial {{observations}} {{have been}} reported throughout history. Some were undoubtedly astronomical in nature: comets, bright meteors, {{one or more of}} the five planets that can be seen with the naked eye, planetary conjunctions, or atmospheric optical phenomena such as parhelia and <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds.</b> An example is Halley's Comet, which was recorded first by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC and possibly as early as 467 BC. Such sightings throughout history often were treated as supernatural portents, angels, or other religious omens. Some current-day UFO researchers have noticed similarities between some religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports though the canonical and symbolic character of such images is documented by art historians placing more conventional religious interpretations on such images.|$|R
25|$|A third {{source of}} lift is wind {{circulation}} forcing air over a physical barrier {{such as a}} mountain (orographic lift). If the air is generally stable, nothing more than <b>lenticular</b> cap <b>clouds</b> will form. However, if the air becomes sufficiently moist and unstable, orographic showers or thunderstorms may appear.|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric {{internal}} waves can be visualized by wave clouds: at {{the wave}} crests air rises and cools {{in the relatively}} lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the relative humidity is close to 100%. Clouds that reveal internal waves launched by flow over hills are called <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> because of their lens-like appearance. Less dramatically, a train of internal waves can be visualized by rippled cloud patterns described as herringbone sky or mackerel sky. The outflow of cold air from a thunderstorm can launch large amplitude internal solitary waves at an atmospheric inversion. In northern Australia, these result in Morning Glory clouds, used by some daredevils to glide along like a surfer riding an ocean wave. Satellites over Australia and elsewhere reveal these waves can span many hundreds of kilometers.|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} {{horizontal}} striations in <b>lenticular</b> <b>clouds</b> was qualitatively described by Richard Scorer as being {{due to a}} vertically layered moisture field, although {{the magnitude of the}} required moisture perturbations has not previously been quantified. Sensitivity tests using high-resolution numerical simulations of these clouds are used here to confirm Scorer’s hypothesis, and show that only minute and essentially unmeasurable variations in moisture with height are required to generate striations of the size observed in nature. Relative humidity (RH) perturbations of only ± 0. 25 % can create an indentation into the cloud of approximately 170 m. RH perturbations of this scale are likely to be commonplace in nature, and are an order of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of standard measuring equipment.

40|$|The Plymouth State College (PSC) Meteorology Program has {{developed}} this server to provide explanations of {{and access to}} detailed pictures of some basic cloud forms. The cloud images are relatively large (640 x 480) {{in order to show}} detailed structure and features.

A 30 -minute time lapse mpeg video loop illustrates how clouds can move and change shape quickly. The purpose of this "boutique" is to provide a general cloud reference and is not intended to provide an all-inclusive list. Images will be added to or changed as opportunities permit. The types of clouds covered currently include high, middle, and low clouds, fog, multi-level clouds, and orographic clouds.
