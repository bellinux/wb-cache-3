I don't like unhealthy people. I had to play on that wretched piano after reading your letter; it made me feel unhappy.

40|$|We {{proposed}} a simple device named a Lift-mouse, which lifts {{up and down}} the palm of the user’s hand to give the impression of an appearance of relief of a 2 -D picture. Experimental results showed that an adequate stroke in a vertical direction, to express the height of the object displayed on the 2 D screen, was shorter than the real height of the object. Additionally, the stroke was reduced using the visual effect by changing the size of the mouse cursor. It was confirmed that the <b>lifting</b> <b>stroke</b> of the device can be much smaller than the actual size of an object through these effects...|$|E
40|$|Diversification {{of energy}} sources {{is a key}} task for {{decreasing}} environmental impacts and global emission of gases. JP- 8, a fuel derived from natural gas, coal, biomass, and waste plastics, is a bright prospect. JP- 8 is considered a multi-source multi-purpose fuel, with several applications. A preliminary characterization of the JP- 8 injection rate and injection quantity behavior was investigated based on the high-pressure {{common rail injection system}} used in a heavy-duty engine. According to the spill injection and injection pressure, a trade-off trend between injection rate and injection quantity was observed. As expected, pilot injection of JP- 8 aviation fuel and diesel fuel affects the spray quantity and injection evolution of the subsequent operation without pilot injection. The difference in spilling between diesel and JP- 8 aviation fuel is greater than the difference in injection amount per time; in the process of controlling the injector solenoid through ECU (Electric Control Units), the oil pressure valve and the needle valve operate to a higher extent {{in order to maintain the}} diesel fuel’s injection quantity volume. It was found that the total injection quantity was decreased by adding 20 % pilot injection duration. Because the pilot injection quantity causes solenoid response, loss and needle <b>lift</b> <b>stroke</b> friction loss...|$|R
50|$|Most images {{show only}} the engine side, giving no {{information}} on the pumps. Current opinion is that {{at least on the}} early engines, dead-weight force pumps were used, the work of the engine being solely to lift the pump side ready for the next downwards pump stroke. This is the arrangement used for the Dudley Castle replica which effectively works at the original stated rate of 12 strokes per minute/10 gallons (54.6litres) <b>lifted</b> per <b>stroke.</b> The later Watt engines worked lift pumps powered by the engine stroke {{and it may be that}} later versions of the Newcomen engine did so too.|$|R
50|$|The {{manipulation}} of the devil stick (also devil-sticks, devilsticks, flower sticks, gravity sticks, or juggling sticks) {{is a form of}} gyroscopic juggling or equilibristics, consisting of manipulating one stick ("baton") between one or two other sticks held one in each hand. The baton is <b>lifted,</b> struck, or <b>stroked</b> by the two control sticks ('handsticks' or 'sidesticks'), stabilising the baton through gyroscopic motion.|$|R
50|$|In shaping, {{the tool}} {{is brought into}} {{position}} with the workpiece. The tool then repeatedly moves {{in a straight line}} while the workpiece is incrementally fed into the line of motion of the tool, this produces a flat, smooth, and sculpted surface. For shaped pieces the tool reciprocates across the stationary workpiece. The tools are usually tilted or <b>lifted</b> after each <b>stroke.</b> This is done hydraulically or manually in order to prevent the tool surface from chipping when the workpiece travels back across.|$|R
50|$|The {{improved}} powerplant had its <b>stroke</b> <b>lifted</b> by 10 mm {{while the}} bore remained the same. The displacement was lifted to 12.6 litres {{which resulted in}} increased horsepower and torque. For military variants the engines were capable of running on alternative fuels (mixtures of diesel fuel, gasoline and or aviation kerosine fuel), albeit with a performance loss. The air cooling system was retained once again with the cooling fan driven via hydraulic clutch and engine oil temperature controlled. The fuel injection pumps featured different types variable or combination governors depending on the vehicle application.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{virtual reality}} systems that feed back to human senses {{have only been}} {{realized}} as visual and acoustic feedback. However, they are not enough to realize the force feedback system for hands, arms, legs and so on. The actuators required for such a system need to be flexible {{so as not to}} injure the body. The purpose of our study is to develop a flexible and lightweight actuator which can be safe enough to be attached to the human body. We propose new types of flexible pneumatic actuator that can be used even if the actuator is deformed by external force. In this study, we tested rodless type flexible pneumatic cylinders that have a self holding function for positioning under the condition of no supply pressure. We also developed a new type of McKibben artificial muscle that has a long stroke of more than 80 % of its original length. As a result of our experiment, we can confirm that the tested cylinder is useful to be applied in a positioning system because it consumes less air under the condition of holding. By using the tested Mckibben actuator, we can realize a long <b>stroke</b> <b>lifting</b> motion of a dumbbell whose mass is 6 kg...|$|R
40|$|The typical leaf-type isosceles-trapezoidal {{flexural}} (LITF) pivot {{consists of}} two flexural beams and two rigid-bodies. The single LITF pivot has the small range of motion and rel-atively large center shift. However, the vacancy in the pivot point makes LITF pivots much easier to be cascaded than other commonly used flexure joints. The performances of LITF pivots will be greatly improved by connecting them together in series. This paper presents an innovative design of LITF pivots. The single LITF pivot {{is regarded as a}} basic configurable module, and four of them can be used to construct new types of flexure joint, which are referred to here as quadri-LITF (Q-LITF) pivot. Ten types of Q-LITF pivots are synthesized in this paper. Compared with a single <b>LIFT</b> pivot, the <b>stroke</b> of a Q-LITF pivot is larger, and stiffness of the mechanism becomes smaller. The center-shift of the Q-LIFT pivot can be optimized by tuning geometric parameters of its single LITF mod-ules. Based on the pseudorigid-body (PRB) model of the single LITF pivot, the method for analyzing the Q-LITF pivots is proposed. One type of the Q-LITF pivots is selected as an example to demonstrate the proposed method for the Q-LITF pivot analysis. The com-parison between the results of PRB model analysis and the finite element analysis (FEA) shows the feasibility and efficiency of the analysis procedure. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4007917]...|$|R
40|$|Hummingbirds can {{maintain}} the highest wingbeat frequencies of any flying vertebrate – a feat accomplished {{by the large}} pectoral muscles that power the wing strokes. An unusual feature of these muscles {{is that they are}} activated by one or a few spikes per cycle as revealed by electromyogram recordings (EMGs). The relatively simple nature of this activation pattern provides an opportunity to understand how motor units are recruited to modulate limb kinematics. Hummingbirds made to fly in low-density air responded by moderately increasing wingbeat frequency and substantially increasing the wing stroke amplitude as compared with flight in normal air. There was little change in the number of spikes per EMG burst in the pectoralis major muscle between flight in normal and low-density heliox (mean= 1. 4 spikes cycle− 1). However the spike amplitude, which we take to be an indication of the number of active motor units, increased in concert with the wing stroke amplitude, 1. 7 times the value in air. We also challenged the hummingbirds using transient load lifting to elicit maximum burst performance. During maximum load <b>lifting,</b> both wing <b>stroke</b> amplitude and wingbeat frequency increased substantially above those values during hovering flight. The number of spikes per EMG burst increased to a mean of 3. 3 per cycle, and the maximum spike amplitude increased to approximately 1. 6 times those values during flight in heliox. These results suggest that hummingbirds recruit additional motor units (spatial recruitment) to regulate wing stroke amplitude but that temporal recruitment is also required to maintain maximum stroke amplitude at the highest wingbeat frequencies...|$|R
