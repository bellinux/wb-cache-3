He gave explicit orders to his team of composers that he would not accept any theme that referenced the title, and the group agreed to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> phrase.|$|E
25|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 21 April 1715. Looking at the rich scoring of three instrumental groups and a five-part choir, John Eliot Gardiner {{suggests that the}} cantata was not performed in the court's small , but in the town church St. Peter und Paul, where the ducal family evidently at times attended services. Bach later {{performed the}} cantata several times in Leipzig in a slightly modified form. There is proof of performances for the years 1724 and 1731; a further performance in 1735 is probable as well. Since the Weimar tuning of the organ, which served as a reference for the string instruments, was probably a third higher than the standard tuning tone in Leipzig, Bach had to either <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> voices of the reed instruments or rewrite them for the Leipzig performances, or to replace the parts by different instruments.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{who have}} {{summarised}} {{the plot of}} Finnegans Wake include Joseph Campbell, John Gordon, Anthony Burgess, William York Tindall, and Philip Kitcher. While no two summaries interpret the plot in the same way, {{there are a number}} of central [...] "plot points" [...] upon which they find general agreement. A number of Joyce scholars question the legitimacy of searching for a linear storyline within the complex text. As Bernard Benstock highlights, [...] "in a work where every sentence opens a variety of possible interpretations, any synopsis of a chapter is bound to be incomplete." [...] David Hayman has suggested that [...] "For all the efforts made by critics to establish a plot for the Wake, it makes little sense to force this prose into a narrative mold." [...] The book's challenges have led some commentators into generalised statements about its content and themes, prompting critic Bernard Benstock to warn against the danger of [...] "boiling down" [...] Finnegans Wake into [...] "insipid pap, and leaving the lazy reader with a predigested mess of generalizations and catchphrases." [...] Fritz Senn has also voiced concerns with some plot synopses, saying [...] "we have some traditional summaries, also some put in circulation by Joyce himself. I find them most unsatisfactory and unhelpful, they usually <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> hard parts and recirculate what we already think we know. I simply cannot believe that FW would be as blandly uninteresting as those summaries suggest." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{rock music}} historian, Ian McFarlane, {{it is one}} of the most covered songs written by an Australian with 27 {{different}} artists recording it in 1975 alone. Covers include fellow Australians, Col Joye and Digby Richards, and international artists, Mac Davis, Terry Jacks, Gary Glitter, Joe Dassin (in French), The Cats and Tom Jones. Some cover artists, including Davis, <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lyric [...] "... I'd never be a star" [...] for a happier ending. Johnson believes [...] "There were a few people who wouldn't sing [...] because in their minds they were big stars". Others, like Glitter, <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> upbeat ending in the Johnson version for a more sombre ending. Jacks' version went to No.97 in the US in 1974 – it reached No.22 in Canada – and Davis' rendition became the highest US charting version, reaching No.15 in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the name}} of the {{organization}} is the Canadian Unitarian Council, the CUC includes congregations with Unitarian, Universalist, Unitarian Universalist, and Universalist Unitarian in their names. Changing {{the name of}} the CUC has occasionally been debated, but there have been no successful motions. To recognize this diversity, some members of the CUC abbreviate Unitarian Universalist as U*U (and playfully read it as [...] "You star, you"). Note, not all CUC members like this playful reading and so when these people write the abbreviation they <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> star(*), just writing UU instead.|$|E

2500|$|Berryman's Collected Poems--1937-1971 {{edited and}} {{introduced}} by Charles Thornbury, {{was published in}} 1989. However, Robert Giroux decided to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> <b>The</b> Dream Songs from the collection. In his review of the Collected Poems, Edward Hirsch commented on this decision, stating, [...] "It is obviously practical to continue to publish the 385 dream songs separately, but reading the Collected Poems without them {{is a little like}} eating a seven-course meal without a main course." [...] Hirsch also notes that, [...] " [...] a thorough nine-part introduction and a chronology as well as helpful appendixes that include Berryman's published prefaces, notes and dedications; a section of editor's notes, guidelines and procedures; and an account of the poems in their final stages of composition and publication." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, UNESCO {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in the area. Initially UNESCO had {{listed the}} site in the tentative list on 18 June 2001 and a new nomination was presented on 27 January 2014. ICOMOS evaluated the report presented by Jordan from 21–25 September 2014. The finds are {{closely associated with the}} commemoration of the baptism. Following this evaluation, the site was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site under the title [...] "Bethany Beyond the Jordan (Al-Maghtas)".

2500|$|His {{next project}} was the graphic {{adventure}} game Snatcher, released for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2 computer platforms in Japan in [...] The game, influenced by science fiction {{works such as}} Blade Runner, The Terminator, and Bubblegum Crisis, {{is set in a}} post-apocalyptic world and centers around an amnesiac detective who faces a race of cyborgs (the titular Snatchers) that kill their victims, copy their likeness and assume their place in society. While Kojima and his team wrote the entire story of the game, they were forced to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> final act of the game due to time constraints. The game was highly regarded at the time for pushing the boundaries of video game storytelling, cinematic cut scenes, and mature content, and was praised for its graphics, soundtrack, high quality writing comparable to a novel, voice acting comparable to a film or radio drama, post-apocalyptic setting, light gun shooter segments, and in-game computer database with optional documents that flesh out the game world. The Sega CD version of Snatcher was for a long time the only major visual novel game to be released in America. However, partly due to a Teen rating limiting its accessibility, it only sold a [...] "couple of thousand units", according to Jeremy Blaustein, a member of Snatchers localization team.|$|E
