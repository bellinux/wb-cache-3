5|$|LFR {{remained}} {{as the main}} radio navigation system in the U.S. and other countries until it was gradually replaced by the much-improved VHF-based VOR technology, starting in the late 1940s. The VOR, still used today, includes a visual <b>left-right</b> indicator.|$|E
5|$|From the {{descriptions}} of the rules above, two important properties of its dynamics may immediately be seen. First, in Rule 184, for any finite set of cells with periodic boundary conditions, the number of 1s {{and the number of}} 0s in a pattern remains invariant throughout the pattern's evolution. Rule 184 and its reflection are the only elementary cellular automata to have this property of number conservation. Similarly, if the density of 1s is well-defined for an infinite array of cells, it remains invariant as the automaton carries out its steps. And second, although Rule 184 is not symmetric under <b>left-right</b> reversal, it does have a different symmetry: reversing left and right {{and at the same time}} swapping the roles of the 0 and 1 symbols produces a cellular automaton with the same update rule.|$|E
5|$|Stratton went on {{to become}} a first-generation {{experimental}}ist in psychology. Wundt's lab in Leipzig, with experimental programs bringing together the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory physiology and nervous-system studies, was a part of the career of most of the first generation. It was the exposure there, added to the graduate work at Yale, that influenced Stratton into becoming a psychologist. It was there that he started his binocular vision experiments as well. In these experiments, he found himself adapting to the new perception of the environment over a few days, after inverting the images his eyes saw on a regular basis. For this, he wore a set of glasses inverting images both upside-down and <b>left-right.</b> Stratton wore these glasses over his right eye and covered the left with a patch during the day, and slept blindfolded at night. Initial movement was clumsy, but adjusting to the new environment took only a few days.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes.The lung has a <b>left-right</b> symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} mass of the tau lepton there will be <b>left-right</b> mixing of the stau {{similar to that of}} stop and sbottom (see above).|$|E
25|$|The {{degrees of}} freedom in planar motion can be easily {{demonstrated}} using a computer mouse. The {{degrees of freedom}} are: <b>left-right,</b> forward-backward and the rotation about the vertical axis.|$|E
25|$|The heart tube elongates on {{the right}} side, looping and {{becoming}} the first visual sign of <b>left-right</b> asymmetry of the body. Septa form within the atria and ventricles to separate {{the left and right}} sides of the heart.|$|E
25|$|In this book, Eysenck {{suggests}} that political {{behavior may be}} analysed in terms of two independent dimensions: the traditional <b>left-right</b> distinction, and how 'tenderminded' or 'toughminded' a person is. Eysenck {{suggests that}} {{the latter is a}} result of a person's introversion or extraversion respectively.|$|E
25|$|A row of shophouses can be {{built in}} stages by exposing around 50-60cm of rebar in the <b>left-right</b> beams {{at each end of}} the row. When {{continuing}} construction, new rebar is tied to the existing rebar to allow the beam to be continued, thereby removing the need for new structural piers.|$|E
25|$|In finite graphs, {{although}} {{depth-first search}} itself is inherently sequential, Trémaux trees {{can be constructed}} by a randomized parallel algorithm in the complexity class RNC. They {{can be used to}} define the tree-depth of a graph, and as part of the <b>left-right</b> planarity test for testing whether a graph is a planar graph.|$|E
25|$|The unpopular war in Afghanistan, {{suspension}} of chief justice, and state emergency had weakened Musharraf {{and a massive}} left-wing alliance led by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani ousted Pervez Musharraf. In an indirect election, Asif Zardari succeeded Musharraf and the current period marks {{the return of the}} <b>left-right</b> directional politics but also features of the multiparty democracy.|$|E
25|$|The runes {{are written}} {{from right to}} left with the {{orientation}} of the runes going in the same direction, but the last words outside the runic band have the usual <b>left-right</b> orientation. It can be dated to {{the first half of the}} 11th century because of its use of the ansuz rune for the a and æ phomenes, and because of its lack of dotted runes.|$|E
25|$|Pulver next fought infamous brawler Leonard Garcia at WEC 36 on November 5, {{after the}} {{original}} date of September 10 was postponed due {{to the threat of}} Hurricane Ike. In a surprising turn of events, Pulver suffered a TKO loss in the first round as the Greg Jackson-trained Leonard Garcia stunned Pulver with a <b>left-right</b> combination, then swarmed Pulver with more punches against the cage fence.|$|E
25|$|Iceland has a <b>left–right</b> multi-party system. Following the 2016 {{parliamentary}} election, {{the biggest}} parties are the centre-right Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn), the Left-Green Movement (Vinstrihreyfingin– grænt framboð) and the Icelandic Pirate Party (Píratar). Other political parties with {{seats in the}} Althing are the Progressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn), the Reform Party (Viðreisn), Bright Future and the Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin). Many other parties exist on the municipal level, most of which run only locally in a single municipality.|$|E
25|$|Lefty is a {{regulator}} of TGFβ and {{is involved}} in the axis patterning during embryogenesis. It {{is also a member of}} the TGF superfamily of proteins. It is asymmetrically expressed in the left side of murine embryos and subsequently plays a role in <b>left-right</b> specification. Lefty acts by preventing the phosphorylation of R-SMADs. It does so through a constitutively active TGFβ type I receptor and through a process downstream of its activation.|$|E
25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a <b>left-right</b> reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not <b>left-right.</b> This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E
25|$|The Pirate Party was {{initially}} formed to reform laws regarding copyright and patents. The party agenda includes support for strengthening the individual's right to privacy, {{both on the}} Internet and in everyday life, and the transparency of state administration. The Pirate Party has intentionally chosen to be bloc independent of the traditional <b>left-right</b> scale to pursue their political agenda with all mainstream parties. The party originally stayed neutral on other matters, but started broadening into other political areas in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Another example {{would be}} a left neglect patient failing to {{describe}} left turns while describing a familiar route. This shows that the failure to describe things in the contralesional side can also affect verbal items. These findings show that space representation is more topological than symbolic. Patients show a contralesional loss of space representation with a deviation of spatial reference to the ipsilesional side. In these cases we see a <b>left-right</b> dissimilarity of representation rather than a decline of representational competence.|$|E
25|$|The new {{regulations}} introduced during the Monaco weekend to modify amongst other things the airboxes {{of the cars}} were now in effect and were visibly shown as teams had to cut holes in the engine covers. Another temporary chicane was installed prior to the flat-out <b>left-right</b> kink leading to the start-finish straight to slow the cars down. Benetton introduced a revised rear wing assembly and Ferrari had new side pods for their cars. Andrea de Cesaris was back in action, now with Sauber, and celebrated his 200th Grand Prix start.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{an image}} of oneself with the front-back axis flipped results in the {{perception}} of an image with its <b>left-right</b> axis flipped. When reflected in the mirror, your right hand remains directly opposite your real right hand, but it is perceived as the left hand of your image. When a person looks into a mirror, the image is actually front-back reversed, which is an effect similar to the hollow-mask illusion. Notice that a mirror image is fundamentally different from the object and cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object.|$|E
25|$|For flat mirrors, {{the law of}} {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are {{in front of the}} mirror. The image size {{is the same as the}} object size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which we perceive as a <b>left-right</b> inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors retroreflect light, producing reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were {{mounted on the}} torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo <b>left-right</b> and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar – a transducer {{was added to the}} torpedo nose, and the microphones were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.|$|E
25|$|Table 3 of the 3 January 2008 {{version of}} a working paper from the London School of Economics/Free University of Brussels by Hix and Noury {{considered}} {{the positions of the}} groups in the Sixth Parliament (2004-2009) by analysing their roll-call votes. The results for each group are shown in the diagram on the right. The vertical scale is anti-pro Europe spectrum, (0% = extremely anti-Europe, 100% = extremely pro), and the horizontal scale is economic <b>left-right</b> spectrum, (0% = extremely economically left-wing, 100% = extremely economically right-wing). The results are also shown in the table below.|$|E
25|$|The Sensor Bar is {{required}} when the Wii Remote is controlling up-down, <b>left-right</b> motion of a cursor or reticle on the TV screen {{to point to}} menu options or objects such as enemies in first-person shooters. Because the Sensor Bar also allows the Wii Remote to calculate {{the distance between the}} Wii Remote and the Sensor Bar, the Wii Remote can also control slow forward-backward motion of an object in a 3-dimensional game. Rapid forward-backward motion, such as punching in a boxing game, is controlled by the acceleration sensors. Using these acceleration sensors (acting as tilt sensors), the Wii Remote can also control rotation of a cursor or other objects.|$|E
25|$|This crude {{approach}} {{results in}} the often-poor performance of voice removal. Common effects are hearing the reverberation effects on the voice track (due to stereo reverb on the vocals not being in the center); also, other instruments (snare/bass drum, bass guitar and solo instruments) that happen to be mixed into the center get removed, degrading this approach to hardly more than a gimmick in those devices. Recent years have seen {{the development of new}} techniques based on the Fast Fourier Transform. Although still not perfect, the results are usually much better than the old technique, because the stereo <b>left-right</b> comparison can be done on individual frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The British Rallycross Circuit at Brands Hatch was {{designed}} and constructed by four-times British Rallycross Champion Trevor Hopkins. It is approx. 0.9 miles long and completed around 1981. Unlike earlier rallycross courses at Brands Hatch, cars start on the startline then veer right and downhill on the loose at Paddock Hill Bend. Through the <b>left-right</b> Esses at the bottom, the circuit rejoins the Indy Circuit to travel up and round Druids hairpin, before a 90-degree left through Langley's Gap and across the knife-edge, rejoining the Indy Circuit, but travelling anti-clockwise. From Cooper Straight, the cars swoop up the old link road and back to Paddock.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{enhancement}} to the HSI recast {{the composite}} index around a trinity of Economic, Environmental, and Social Fabric Indices. The result is thus conceptually {{similar to the}} Triple Bottom Line of Corporate Social Responsibility as described by John Elkington, {{as well as to}} the stated goals of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. The release note of HSI Version 2 also notes efforts to balance local and global context, individual and society concerns, <b>left-right</b> political issues, east-west and north-south cultural and social issues. Current Version 2 of the HSI ingests about 30 datasets and composite indicators, and covers 232 countries and dependencies. It is released at HumanSecurityIndex.org.|$|E
25|$|The ball mouse has two freely {{rotating}} rollers. These {{are located}} 90 degrees apart. One roller detects the forward–backward {{motion of the}} mouse and other the <b>left–right</b> motion. Opposite the two rollers is a third one (white, in the photo, at 45 degrees) that is spring-loaded to push the ball against the other two rollers. Each roller is on the same shaft as an encoder wheel that has slotted edges; the slots interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical pulses that represent wheel movement. Each wheel's disc has a pair of light beams, located so that a given beam becomes interrupted or again starts to pass light freely when the other beam of the pair is about halfway between changes.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 a major {{split in}} the Indian National Congress. Indira Gandhi had entered into open {{conflict}} with the traditional Congress leadership. Effectively two separate Congress parties appeared, the Congress(R) led by Indira and the Congress(O) led by Kamaraj. The split {{was in many ways}} a <b>left-right</b> one, with Indira whipping up populism against the established party elites. The Forward Bloc did in some ways welcome the new developments. It appreciated Indira's stands and reformulated its anti-Congress line to focus mainly opposition to the traditional Congress elite (i.e. the Congress(O)). In the 1969 presidential elections, AIFB supported Indira's candidate V.V. Giri. This caused an abrupt break-up of the Swatantra-AIFB alliance in Tamil Nadu, as the Swatantra Party sought to align itself with the Congress(O).|$|E
25|$|Peretz saw an {{intrinsic}} connection between {{a solution to}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the resolving of Israel's internal social tensions. He argued that the resources allotted to the settlements in the West Bank had diverted funds that could have helped to solve social problems throughout Israel. He described the conflict as having mutated Israeli politics, so that the traditional <b>left-right</b> distinctions did not hold. Instead of supporting a social-democratic left that would advance their cause, the lower classes, mostly of Middle Eastern Jewish origins, were diverted to the right by the fanning of nationalist tendencies. Concurrently, the left in Israel was usurped by the well-to-do, so that the Labor party had ironically become elitist. Peretz also backed direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian movement Hamas.|$|E
25|$|Ecutek tuning on {{the other}} hand was the first company to {{manipulate}} and change shift points on the GTR in the TCM (Transmission Control Module) on automatic mode. This can be done at will by the driver. Ecutek also allows the driver to adjust launch control on the fly available with a wrap around boost gauge that can read over 20 PSI. Like COBB Tuning, Ecutek currently offers engine tuning on the ECU and TCM with different launch control software from LC1 up to LC5. Ecutek's RACEROM offers in addition Valet Mode, Per-Cylinder Fueling, RaceRom Launch Control, Speed Density, Map Switching, Enhanced Targeted Boost Control, Upshift boostspike prevention, Per-gear boost control limit, per-gear rev limits, RACEROM Boost control, MAF <b>Left-Right</b> Swap for Custom Intercoolers, Large Fuel Injector Support and Visual Knock Warning.|$|E
25|$|The UDC was an independent-minded {{and often}} {{reluctant}} {{member of the}} House of Freedoms coalition from 2002 to 2008. The party's leading figure, Pier Ferdinando Casini, was critical of Silvio Berlusconi's leadership over the Italian centre-right and presented himself as a moderate alternative to populism, which, in his view, denoted the alliance between The People of Freedom (PdL) and Lega Nord. UDC's main goal, similarly {{to that of the}} Democratic Movement in France, has been to form governments beyond the <b>left-right</b> divide (e.g: Monti Cabinet and Letta Cabinet) and, possibly, reassembling the remnants of the old DC and control Italian politics from the centre. In this respect, Casini and his followers have long tried to form the nucleus of a third force in Italian politics (e.g.: New Pole for Italy, With Monti for Italy, Popular Area).|$|E
25|$|In about 1840, the English {{industrial}} chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson travelled to Canada, {{stopping at}} the Niagara Falls {{long enough to make}} the earliest known photograph of the falls, a daguerreotype in the collection of Newcastle University. It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the daguerreotype as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph. Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson himself. The image is <b>left-right</b> inverted, and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of the Horseshoe Falls as well as of Rome and Paris. These were then transferred to engravings to illustrate Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes (Paris, 1841–1864).|$|E
25|$|The vowels {{fall into}} two sets, the back vowels -a and -o, and the front vowels -e and -i. Each set {{consists}} of a lower vowel, -a or -e, and a higher vowel, -o or -i. In all cases, back-vowel syllables are related through <b>left-right</b> reflection: that is, they are mirror images of each other. How they relate to front-vowel syllables depends on the graphic form of the consonants. These follow two patterns. Symmetrical, vowel, p-, t-, sp-, are rotated 90 degrees (a quarter turn) counter-clockwise, while those that are asymmetrical top-to-bottom, c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-, are rotated 180 degrees (a half turn). The lower front-vowel (-e) syllables are derived this way from the low back-vowel (a) syllables, and the high front-vowel (-i) syllables are derived this way from the higher back-vowel (-o) syllables.|$|E
25|$|The Heavy and Medium typefaces were {{designed}} {{to compensate for the}} optical illusion that makes dark lines on pale backgrounds appear narrower than pale lines on dark backgrounds. Hence destinations are written in mixed case white Transport Medium on green and blue backgrounds, and in black Transport Heavy on white backgrounds. Route numbers are coloured yellow when placed directly on a green background. Some signs logically show the closest destination on the route first (i.e., on top), while others show the most distant settlement first. On a roundabout DS, the route locations are usually listed with the closest destination at the bottom and the furthest away at the top when going straight ahead, and likewise going left and right. However, many <b>left-right</b> signs more logically indicate the closest destination at the top with further afield destinations listed in descending order.|$|E
25|$|The Chrétien-Turner feud {{was only}} just the {{beginning}} of Liberal in-fighting. The PC Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's two signature policies of the late 1980s, namely free trade with the United States and the Meech Lake accord had badly fractionised the Liberals in ways that cut across traditional <b>left-right</b> lines, which was at least part of Mulroney's intention in introducing them, to use them as wedge issues to unite the PC base and divide the Liberals. The Liberal strategist John Duffy illustrated how badly Meech and free trade had fractionized the Liberals by pointing out the positions on each of four prominent Liberals of the late 1980s, namely the leftist Sheila Copps (anti-free trade, pro-Meech), the rightist Don Johnston (pro-free trade, anti-Meech), rightist Raymond Garneau (pro-free trade, pro-Meech) and the leftist Lloyd Axworthy (anti-free trade, anti-Meech). This was to be the context of Chrétien's return to politics in 1990.|$|E
