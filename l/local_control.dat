40|$|Bisphosphonates (BPs) {{have been}} widely used in {{clinical}} treatment of bone diseases with increased bone resorption because of their strong affinity for bone and their inhibition of bone resorption. Recently, there has been growing interest in their improvement of bone formation. However, the effect of <b>local</b> <b>controlled</b> delivery of BPs is unclear. We used polylactide acid-glycolic acid copolymer (PLGA) as a drug carrier to deliver various doses of the bisphosphonate zoledronate (Zol) into the distal femur of 8 -week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. After 6 weeks, samples were harvested and analyzed by micro-CT and histology. The average bone mineral density and mineralized bone volume fraction were higher with medium- and high-dose PLGA-Zol (30 and 300 µg Zol, respectively) than control and low-dose Zol (3 µg PLGA-Zol; p< 0. 05). <b>Local</b> <b>controlled</b> delivery of Zol decreased the numbers of osteoclast and increased the numbers of osteoblast.

3000|$|In our view, the {{key issue}} is whether the {{identifying}} assumptions entailed by ADR’s and DLR’s use of <b>local</b> <b>controls</b> lead to more biased or less biased estimates of the employment effect of minimum wages. Our previous work concluded that the assumptions implicit in their methods bias the estimated effect toward zero. The issue was not simply whether the variation left unused by DLR and ADR reduced the efficiency of their estimates of the employment effects of minimum wages. Labor economists often use approaches thought to reduce bias {{at the cost of}} less precise estimates. In the final section of this paper we provide a possible explanation for why limiting attention to <b>local</b> <b>controls</b> might produce a bias towards finding no employment effect and cite recent evidence from Baskaya and Rubinstein (2012) consistent with this explanation. At the same time, estimation of richer specifications prompted by some of the analyses presented by ADRZ undermines the conclusion that, for teens, including <b>local</b> <b>controls</b> reduces the estimated employment effect of the minimum wage. So in either case, the claim that controlling for spatial heterogeneity establishes that minimum wages do not reduce employment of unskilled workers is unfounded. 2 [...]...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PCT studies hold {{short-term}} {{predictive value}} in patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Our {{aim was to}} examine the long-term predictive value of baseline PCT studies for <b>local</b> tumor <b>control</b> and overall survival in SCCA of the upper aerodigestive tract treated with chemoradiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four patients with advanced SCCA underwent PCT followed by concomitant chemoradiation. The acquired perfusion maps represented BF, BV, MTT, and PS. Visual analysis of the parametric maps for identification of tumor perfusion patterns was conducted. ROC curves, t tests, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for <b>local</b> disease <b>control</b> and overall survival. RESULTS: The median time of <b>local</b> tumor <b>control</b> was 24 months. The BF and PS values were significantly higher in patients who had no recurrence than in those with local failure (P. 02). The BF and PS were predictive (P. 0006) but BV and MTT held no significant predictive values for <b>local</b> tumor <b>control.</b> The patients with high BF and PS had a longer <b>local</b> tumor <b>control</b> than the patients with hypoperfused tumors (P. 0007).

50|$|The initial {{discovery}} {{of the problem with}} the vessel’s propulsion system occurred when the Barberi’s chief engineer went up to the pilothouse after the collision.

This indication was confirmed by the stream of water that was being pushed away from the stern of the vessel. The chief engineer then unsuccessfully attempted to bring the propulsion unit to zero pitch using the pilothouse controls. Control of the propulsion units was transferred to the engine room, where the crew used the units’ <b>local</b> <b>controls</b> to bring the pitch to zero.
