25|$|The U.S. and ARVN units {{participating}} in Apache Snow knew, based on existing intelligence information and previous {{experience in the}} A Shau, that the operation was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> serious resistance from PAVN. Beyond that, however, they had little intelligence as to the actual strength and dispositions of PAVN units. The area was extremely remote and difficult to access. Aerial surveillance was difficult. U.S. battalion commanders had to generate their own tactical intelligence by combat patrols, capturing equipment, installations, documents, and occasionally prisoners of war to provide the raw data from which to draw their assessment of the North Vietnamese order of battle and dispositions. It was this time-consuming and hit-or-miss task force which characterized the main efforts of Colonel Honeycutt's 3/187th Infantry during the first four days of the operation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a grant of probate. If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} grant of administration. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|E

Some of the major changes are: an emphasis on the use of evidence to support answers, a shift away from obscure vocabulary to words that students are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> in college and career, a math section that is focused on fewer areas, a return to the 1600-point score scale, an optional essay, and the removal of penalty for wrong answers (rights-only scoring). To combat the perceived advantage of costly test preparation courses, the College Board announced a new partnership with Khan Academy to offer free online practice problems and instructional videos.|$|E

"Bees of {{all species}} are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> {{multiple}} stressors during their lives, and each {{is likely to}} reduce the ability of bees {{to cope with the}} others. A bee or bee colony that appears to have succumbed to a pathogen may not have died if it had not also been exposed to a sublethal dose of a pesticide and/or been subject to food stress (which might in turn be due to drought or heavy rain induced by climate change, or competition from a high density of honey bee hives placed nearby). Unfortunately, conducting well-replicated studies of the effects of multiple interacting stressors on bee colonies is exceedingly difficult. The number of stressor combinations rapidly becomes large, and exposure to stressors is hard or impossible to control with free-flying bees. Nonetheless, a strong argument can be made that it is the interaction among parasites, pesticides, and diet that {{lies at the heart of}} current bee health problems." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{preparing}} for their mission, {{in addition to}} the usual Apollo spacecraft training, Young and Duke, along with backup commander Fred Haise, underwent an extensive geological training program that included several field trips to introduce them to concepts and techniques they would use in analyzing features and collecting samples on the lunar surface. During these trips, they visited and provided scientific descriptions of geologic features they were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter.</b> In July 1971, they visited Sudbury, Ontario, Canada for geology training exercises, the first time U.S. astronauts did so. Geologists chose the area because of a [...] wide crater created about 1.8 billion years ago by a large meteorite. The Sudbury Basin shows evidence of shatter cone geology familiarizing the Apollo crew with geologic evidence of a meteor impact. During the training exercises the astronauts did not wear space suits, but carried radio equipment to converse with each other and scientist-astronaut Anthony W. England, practicing procedures they would use on the lunar surface.|$|E
500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "Just Dance" [...] is an {{intensely}} catchy single {{and is an}} excellent indicator of what the album was all about. Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised the song saying, [...] "You won't get many more catchy party odes than the chart topping Just Dance this year, a polished gem set to lodge in your head {{for the next few}} weeks." [...] Freedom lu Lac of The Washington Post described the song to be [...] "filled with mindlessly frothy synth-pop that matches low-grade dance grooves with GaGa's icy, almost disembodied vocals about dancing bliss". Lynn Saxberg from the Ottawa Citizen, while reviewing Gaga's The Fame Ball Tour, called the song a perfect sing-along club anthem. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote that the song resembles the [...] "desperate train wreck you're <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> getting wasted at any dive on the L.E.S. at four in the morning" [...] as is emphasized by the lyrics.

500|$|Many {{specimens}} also {{accumulated in}} natural traps, such as sinkholes and tar pits. The Hot Springs Mammoth Site in South Dakota is a 26,000-year-old, approximately -long sinkhole that functioned for 300 to 700 years before filling with sediment. The site {{is the opposite}} scenario of that in Waco; {{all but one of}} the at least 55 skeletons—additional skeletons are excavated each year—are male, and accumulated over time rather than in a single event. It is assumed that like modern male elephants, male mammoths primarily lived alone, were more adventurous (especially young males) and more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> dangerous situations than the females. The mammoths may have been lured to the hole by warm water or vegetation near the edges, slipping in and drowning or starving. Isotope studies of growth rings have shown that most of the mammoths died during spring and summer, which may have correlated with vegetation near the sinkhole. One individual, nicknamed [...] "Murray", lies on its side, and probably died in this pose while struggling to get free. Deep footprints of mammoths attempting to free themselves from the sinkhole's mud can be seen in vertically-excavated sections of the site.|$|E

Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly praised the production and music of the album, calling the album [...] "some of the most unusually effective dance-floor dynamite you're <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> all year". David Balls from Digital Spy complimented Shakira's ability to [...] "mix this album's eclectic range of influences into a listenable, cohesive collection of songs", but also noted that some fans may be disappointed {{over the fact that}} [...] "She Wolf downplays Shakira's Latin-pop routes in favour of a sound that will appeal to radio playlisters the world over". Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph praised Shakira's inventiveness on the album and summed up the review by saying [...] "incongruous elements only add to the perfection of Shakira's She Wolf". Michael Cragg from MusicOMH singled out the tracks produced by The Neptunes as the best on the album, and also noted that they are [...] "very much Shakira songs, not merely songs produced by The Neptunes". Johnny Davis from The Observer labelled the album [...] "preposterously brilliant", while Mike Diver from BBC Music thought it was [...] "perhaps the most enjoyably varied pop album of 2009". Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone was also positive towards the album and called Shakira a [...] "charmer— a globe-straddling star you can cuddle up to". Joey Guerra from Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the album a very positive review, praising Shakira's exploration of world music and her experimentation, saying [...] "every song goes to completely unexpected places, veering from a perfectly commercial shine to avant-garde pop." [...] Guerra also commended the Neptunes' production, calling She Wolf [...] "Shakira's most compelling, consistently entertaining disc since 1998's Dónde Están los Ladrones?," [...] and concluded that [...] "Shakira has created some of the most weirdly wonderful pop of the past year." [...] Moreover, the critic felt that Shakira had not completely abandoned her musical roots and commented: [...] "the rumors of Shakira's vanishing Latina identity have been grossly exaggerated." ...|$|E
