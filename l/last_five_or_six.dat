25|$|A {{significant}} {{diversity of}} species exists. Since coldwater coral reefs only occur at great depths, most hobbyists are largely confined to fish, sea anemones, crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and Feather duster worms. A few corals {{can be found}} at low depths. Since there are very few commercially available coldwater fish and invertebrates, hobbyists usually have to physically acquire specimens, although recently more specimens have become commercially available from the west coast of the United States as well as Japan, Australia, and the UK. The most common methods of acquisition are by trolling or seining, and experienced hobbyists use the movement of tides and searching methods to find certain species. Unlike commercially available tropical fish, whose behavior patterns and tank compatibilities have been well documented in the <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> decades, coldwater fish have been kept in public and private aquaria for over two centuries and much ichthyological knowledge has been gathered in order to maintain them.|$|E
500|$|During {{his ninth}} season in 1966, Taylor did not sign a new one-year {{contract}} and instead played out his option; {{he made no}} secret that it was likely his last season with the Packers. He caught a career-high 41 passes that year but recorded the fewest rushing yards since his second season. The Packers finished atop the Western Division with a 12–2 record and defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the 1966 NFL Championship Game for their fourth NFL title in six years. In January 1967, Taylor and the Packers played in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, known retroactively as Super Bowl I, in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. They easily defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 35–10. Taylor was the top rusher of the game with 56 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} on a Packer Sweep play, with his score being the first rushing touchdown in Super Bowl history. [...] "It was just good blocking on a weak-side sweep play," [...] said Taylor of his touchdown run. [...] "It's a cakewalk when you get the blocking. It was just like we had been doing the <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> years." [...] The game was his final with the Packers.|$|E

500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown in the <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I {{had to work hard}} adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let me tell you, it wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us. [...] You can call it a run-and-hit." [...] Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled induced labor for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.|$|E

In some cases the old first-year courses (for six-year degrees) in the basic sciences of physics, chemistry and biology have been abolished: that standard has to be reached by school examinations before entry.

The early instars feed on mature leaves by night, skeletonizing them, and hide {{on the underside of}} the leaves by day. Later instars spend the night feeding on leaves and hide in the day on the lower part of the tree trunk. The larvae do not consume freshly unfurled growth.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} into the effect of 2 - 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (24 D) and other herbicides on soil populations. Experiments were devised {{to test the hypothesis}} that the initial lag period in detoxication is a combination of a period of adaptation followed by proliferation. Methods employed were dilution plate counts, variations in conditions of treatment, respiration studies, and the use of a bacteriostat and pre-enrichment of the soil with autotrophic organisms. An active organism, which would decompose 24 D when inoculated into an aerated suspension of sterile soil, was isolated from soil enriched to this herbicide. There is a significant correlation between 24 D concentration and bacterial numbers in the soil. Applications of this herbicide stimulated the rate of respiration of an enriched soil and of a culture of the isolated active organism. Results indicate complete oxidation of the molecule. The evidence suggests that the organisms responsible occupy sites on the surfaces of the soil crumbs where the anion is adsorbed. These sites are quite distinct from those occupied by the nitrifying and thiosulphate-oxidising autotrophs. Proliferation of organisms begins on the fifth or sixth day of treatment, at which time it is calculated that a slow breakdown of herbicide begins. It was concluded that the organism responsible for the detoxication of 24 D in soils undergoes a period of adaptation to the new substrate, <b>lasting</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> days. During the following time, all the sites on the soil crumbs where the 24 D anion can be adsorbed are occupied to give a saturated soil. When herbicide is reapplied, rapid breakdown ensues accompanied by a high rate of carbon dioxide evolution and sufficient proliferation to replace those bacteria which have died. It is probable that a similar process occurs when soil is treated with other phenoxyacetic acids. <p...|$|R
