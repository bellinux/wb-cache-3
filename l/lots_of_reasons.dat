But once I saw Anna's art I knew that no traditional form of animation could do justice to the grimy, textured, surreal aesthetic she created. It was really an artistic choice, because from a business point of view it's just so risky." ...|$|E

5000|$|Carolyn Mackler was {{a self-proclaimed}} misfit in junior high; she never felt she {{completely}} fit in, {{and this has}} been a determining factor in her deciding to write young adult novels. Throughout junior high and high school, Mackler read many young adult novels in order to escape the belief that no one understood her. She read voraciously, but among her favorite authors were: Judy Blume, Lois Lowry, M.E. Kerr, and Norma Klein. Mackler writes on her website of the importance of novels for young adults and their influence on her:"People often ask me now why I write novels for teenagers. <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> One of the biggest reasons is that I honestly believe that, along with certain friendships, I was saved by the books I read during those years.

5000|$|As Kelsey McKinney of Vox states, [...] "The phrase {{has been}} reappropriated by feminists {{and turned into}} a meme meant to parody its pervasiveness and bad faith." [...] #NotAllMen-related memes include {{references}} to Aquaman, Adventure Time, Magic: The Gathering, and the Kool Aid Man crashing through a wall to exclaim [...] "not all men". An explanation of the NotAllMen hashtag came from Hillary Di Menna of This Magazine, who claimed that: [...] "Saying 'not all men' is not helpful. We need to listen and we need to reflect." [...] Slate Magazine writer Phil Plait wrote that the hashtag was [...] not an unexpected response. However, it's also not a helpful one. Why is it not helpful to say [...] "not all men are like that"? For <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> For one, women know this. They already know not every man is a rapist, or a murderer, or violent. They don't need you to tell them. Second, it's defensive. When people are defensive, they aren't listening to the other person; they're busy thinking of ways to defend themselves. I watched this happen on Twitter, over and again. Third, the people saying it aren't furthering the conversation, they're sidetracking it. The discussion isn't about the men who aren't a problem. (Though, I'll note, it can be. I'll get back to that.) Instead of being defensive and distracting from the topic at hand, try staying quiet for a while and actually listening to what the thousands upon thousands of women discussing this are saying. Fourth—and this is important, so listen carefully—when a woman is walking down the street, or on a blind date, or, yes, in an elevator alone, she doesn't know which group you're in. You might be the potential best guy ever in the history of history, but there's no way for her to know that. A fraction of men out there are most definitely not in that group. Which are you? Inside your head you know, but outside your head it's impossible to.
