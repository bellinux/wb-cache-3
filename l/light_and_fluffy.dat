500|$|Billy Grifter from Den of Geek was {{slightly}} {{disappointed with the}} [...] "mad scientist" [...] storyline as he felt it had been done before, but found several redeeming qualities: Alan Ruck's performance and the last five minutes featuring Noble and Blair Brown, and Torv with Joshua Jackson. Grifter thought the Noble-Brown scene was [...] "actually very funny," [...] praising the two actors' performances, and added that this humor made the following Torv-Jackson scene's impact [...] "even greater". Referring to Torv's [...] "passable" [...] Nimoy impression, Grifter concluded that [...] "the strength of Fringe {{is that it can}} take a rather <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> premise, like the one in [...] "Os", and embellish it with wonderful character moments and a genuine surprise or two".|$|E
500|$|Writing for School Library Journal, Cara von Wrangel Kinsey found Fairy Cube [...] "more {{accessible}} than Yuki's previous works," [...] despite covering {{subjects such}} as murder and revenge. A. E. Sparrow of IGN gave the first volume a favorable review, enjoying the series' different view of the fairies. Mania Entertainment's Danielle Van Gorder wrote that the story {{reminded her of the}} pre-Victorian version of the fairytale [...] "Snow White" [...] or the British Sidhe fairies, in her review of the first volume. Van Gorder worried that the cover would mislead readers into believing that it was [...] "a <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> kind of story" [...] and drive away the target audience. In a follow-up review of the final volume, she wrote that the conclusion of the series was less confusing than that of Yuki's earlier work Angel Sanctuary (1994–2000) and thought the story was [...] "well-executed," [...] though it still had some flaws. Rating the series 3 out of 4 stars, Jason Thompson, author of [...] (2007), wrote that while it reminded him of Angel Sanctuary, it covered [...] "more original subject matter" [...] and had [...] "tighter" [...] plotting. Anime News Network's Casey Brienza highly recommended the first volume, praising her inclusion of Celtic mythology. She enjoyed the plot and described the cover as beautiful, though she disliked the artistic inconsistencies caused by Yuki's use of assistants. According to [...] Katherine Dacey of PopCultureShock in her review of the first volume, the story succeeded through Yuki's use of [...] "outlandish touches," [...] creating [...] "an intoxicating—if occasionally ridiculous—mix of horror, romance, and revenge." [...] In her review of the final volume, Dacey expressed her feelings of annoyance that the characters spent much of the volume talking with very little action, and wrote that the story, despite a promising start, went downhill with the introduction of the beauty contest in the second volume. Categorizing [...] "Psycho Knocker" [...] as [...] "comeuppance theater," [...] she enjoyed it more than Fairy Cubes conclusion, though still wrote that [...] "it isn't her best work." [...] A reviewer of the French edition disliked how quickly the story progressed, commenting that the protagonists' personalities were not fully explored as a result. The reviewer praised the covers of the first and third volumes as [...] "magnificent".|$|E

2500|$|The Alaskan Athabaskan Indian ice-cream (Lower Tanana nonathdlodi Tanacross nanehdlaad) is dessert-like dry meat {{mixed with}} moose fat and {{different}} from the Canadian Indian ice cream of First Nations in British Columbia. One recipe for Indian ice cream consisted of dried and pulverized tenderloin that was blended with moose grease in a birch bark container until the mixture was <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>fluffy.</b> In addition, however, Alaskan Athabaskan communities also create songs for performance at potlatches: dance songs, potlatch songs and mourning songs. Within stories and embedded in fragments of folklore, old shamanic songs are also partially remembered; they are called [...] "ice‐cream songs" [...] because {{they used to be}} sung during the preparation of nonathdlodi, or [...] "Indian ice cream." ...|$|E

6000|$|This {{reminds me}} of the {{incident}} I set out to narrate when I wrote [...] "Dimples" [...] at the head of this note. I was standing at a busy corner in a Kensington thoroughfare waiting for a bus, when a group of three ladies appeared and came to a stand a yard or two from me and waited, too, for the traffic to pass before attempting to cross to the other side. One was elderly and feeble and was holding the arm of another of the trio, who was young and pretty. Her age was perhaps twenty; she was of medium height, slim, with a nice figure and nicely dressed. She was a blonde, with <b>light</b> blue-grey eyes <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> hair of pale gold: there was little colour in her face, but the features were perfect and the mouth with its delicate curves quite beautiful.|$|R
2500|$|Properly cooked {{couscous}} is <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>fluffy,</b> not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a food steamer (called aTaseksut in Berber, a [...] kiskas in Arabic or a couscoussier in French). The base {{is a tall}} metal pot shaped {{rather like}} an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp cheesecloth. There is little archaeological evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original couscoussier was probably made from organic materials that could not survive extended exposure to the elements.|$|E
