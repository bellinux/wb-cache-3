40|$|The {{study of}} Articial Neural Networks {{started with the}} {{analysis}} of <b>linear</b> <b>neurons.</b> It was then discovered that networks consisting only of <b>linear</b> <b>neurons</b> cannot describe non-linear phenomena. As a result, most currently used neural networks consist of non-linear neurons. In this pa-per, we show that in many cases, <b>linear</b> <b>neurons</b> can still be successfully applied. This idea is illustrated by two examples: the PageRank algo-rithm underlying the successful Google search engine and the analysis of family happiness. 1 Linear Neural Networks: A Brief Reminder Neural networks. A general neural network consists of several neurons ex-changing signals. At each moment of time, for each neuron, we need finitely many numerical parameters to describe {{the current state of}} this neuron and the signals generated by this neuron.

5000|$|An energy model, {{a kind of}} {{stimulus-response}} model, of binocular neurons {{allows for}} investigation behind the computational function these disparity tuned cells play {{in the creation of}} depth perception. [...] Energy models of binocular neurons involve the combination of monocular receptive fields that are either shifted in position or phase. [...] These shifts in either position or phase allow for the simulated binocular neurons to be sensitive to disparity. The relative contributions of phase and position shifts in simple and complex cells combine together in order to create depth perception of an object in 3-dimensional space. [...] Binocular simple cells are modeled as <b>linear</b> <b>neurons.</b> Due to the linear nature of these neurons, positive and negative values are encoded by two neurons where one neuron encodes the positive part and the other the negative part. This results in the neurons being complements of each other where the excitatory region of one binocular simple cell overlaps with the inhibitory region of another. Each neuron's response is limited such that only one may have a non-zero response for any time. This kind of limitation is called halfwave-rectifing. Binocular complex cells are modeled as energy neurons since they do not have discrete on and off regions in their receptive fields. Energy neurons sum the squared responses of two pairs of <b>linear</b> <b>neurons</b> which must be 90 degrees out of phase. [...] Alternatively, they can also be the sum the squared responses of four halfwave-rectified <b>linear</b> <b>neurons.</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{frequently}} use <b>linear</b> integrate-and-fire <b>neurons</b> in this paper, since {{analysis is}} easiest for them. For greater biophysical realism, we also use simple (single-compartment) Hodgkin–Huxley-like model neurons, {{for which we}} report numerical results, but no analysis. The theta neuron is in between: It is still simple enough {{for the sort of}} analysis that we are interested in here, but it is more realistic than the <b>linear</b> integrate-and-fire <b>neuron.</b>|$|R
50|$|ADALINE (Adaptive <b>Linear</b> <b>Neuron</b> {{or later}} Adaptive Linear Element) {{is an early}} {{single-layer}} artificial neural network {{and the name of}} the physical device that implemented this network. The network uses memistors. It was developed by Professor Bernard Widrow and his graduate student Ted Hoff at Stanford University in 1960. It is based on the McCulloch-Pitts neuron. It consists of a weight, a bias and a summation function.|$|E
50|$|In this case, {{the output}} unit {{is simply the}} {{weighted}} sum of its inputs plus a bias term. A number of such linear neurons perform a linear transformation of the input vector. This is usually more useful in the first layers of a network. A number of analysis tools exist based on linear models, such as harmonic analysis, and they can all be used in neural networks with this <b>linear</b> <b>neuron.</b> The bias term allows us to make affine transformations to the data.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s Bernard Widrow and Ted Hoff {{developed}} ADALINE (Adaptive <b>Linear</b> <b>Neuron)</b> {{which used}} electrochemical cells called memistors (memory resistors) to emulate synapses of an artificial neuron. The memistors were implemented as 3-terminal devices operating {{based on the}} reversible electroplating of copper such that the resistance {{between two of the}} terminals is controlled by the integral of the current applied via the third terminal. The ADALINE circuitry was briefly commercialized by the Memistor Corporation in the 1960s enabling some applications in pattern recognition. However, since the memistors were not fabricated using integrated circuit fabrication techniques the technology was not scalable and was eventually abandoned as solid state electronics became mature.|$|E

The analog architecture implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron whose topology can be programmed without any {{modification of the}} off-chip connections.

To obtain a robust behaviour with respect to noise and errors introduced in the computation by analog circuits, we use non-linear synapses and <b>linear</b> <b>neurons</b> as neural primitives...|$|R
30|$|We {{have shown}} {{that there is a}} natural {{analogous}} STDP learning for spiking neurons in our case of <b>linear</b> <b>neurons.</b> This asymmetric rule converges to a final connectivity which can be decomposed into symmetric and skew-symmetric parts. The first one is similar to the symmetric Hebbian learning case, emphasizing that the STDP is nothing more than an asymmetric Hebbian-like learning rule. The skew-symmetric part of the final connectivity is the cross-correlation between the inputs and their derivatives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gaussian {{processes}} {{have been}} favourably compared to backpropagation neural networks {{as a tool}} for regression. We show that a recurrent neural network can implement exact Gaussian process inference using only <b>linear</b> <b>neurons</b> that integrate their inputs over time, inhibitory recurrent connections, and one-shot Hebbian learning. The network amounts to a dynamical system which relaxes to the correct solution. We prove conditions for convergence, show how the system can act as its own teacher in order to produce rapid predictions, and comment on the biological plausibility of such a network. ...|$|R
50|$|Besides simple Boolean {{functions}} with binary {{inputs and}} binary outputs, the GEP-nets algorithm can handle {{all kinds of}} functions or neurons (<b>linear</b> <b>neuron,</b> tanh neuron, atan neuron, logistic neuron, limit neuron, radial basis and triangular basis neurons, all kinds of step neurons, and so on). Also interesting is that the GEP-nets algorithm can use all these neurons together and let evolution decide which ones work best {{to solve the problem}} at hand. So, GEP-nets can be used not only in Boolean problems but also in logistic regression, classification, and regression. In all cases, GEP-nets can be implemented not only with multigenic systems but also cellular systems, both unicellular and multicellular. Furthermore, multinomial classification problems can also be tackled in one go by GEP-nets both with multigenic systems and multicellular systems.|$|E
40|$|Recently, van Elberg and van Ooyen (2009) {{published}} a generalization of the Event-Based Integration Scheme for an Integrate-and-Fire neuron model with exponentially decaying excitatory currents and double exponential inhibitory synaptic currents, introduced by Carnevale and Hines. In the paper, {{it was shown}} that the constraints on the synaptic time constants imposed by the Newton-Raphson iteration scheme, can be relaxed. In this note, we show that according to the results published in D'Haene et al. (2009), a further generalization is possible eliminating any constraint on the time constants. We also demonstrate that in fact {{a wide range of}} <b>linear</b> <b>neuron</b> models can be efficiently simulated with this computation scheme, including neuron models mimicking complex neuronal behavior. These results can change the way complex neuronal spiking behavior is modeled: instead of highly non <b>linear</b> <b>neuron</b> models with few state variables, it is possible to efficiently simulate linear models with a large number of state variables...|$|E

In the next section, we explore a more general setting.|$|E
50|$|A {{fairly simple}} {{non-linear}} function, the sigmoid function {{such as the}} logistic function also has an easily calculated derivative, which can be important when calculating the weight updates in the network. It thus makes the network more easily manipulable mathematically, and was attractive to early computer scientists who needed to minimize the computational load of their simulations. It was previously commonly seen in multilayer perceptrons. However, recent work has shown sigmoid neurons to be less effective than rectified <b>linear</b> <b>neurons.</b> The {{reason is that the}} gradients computed by the backpropagation algorithm tend to diminish towards zero as activations propagate through layers of sigmoidal neurons, making it difficult to optimize neural networks using multiple layers of sigmoidal neurons.|$|R

This layered neural network uses only <b>linear</b> <b>neurons.</b> Some synthetic sinusoidal terms are used as inputs and represent a priori knowledge. A measured signal serves as a reference, then a supervised learning allows to adapt the weights and to fit its Fourier series. The amplitudes of the fundamental and high-order harmonics can be directly deduced from the combination of the weights. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated and compared.

In a second step, acknowledging that such high-dimensional learning tasks typically benefit from some form of regularization and arguing {{that the problem of}} scale has not been taken care of in a very satisfactory manner, we come to a combined resolution of both of these shortcomings by proposing a form of scale regularization. Moreover, using variational method, this regularization problem can also be solved rather efficiently and we demonstrate, on an artificial filter learning problem, the capabilities of our basic <b>linear</b> <b>neuron.</b> From a more general standpoint, we see this work as prime example of how learning and variational methods could, or even should work to their mutual benefit.

40|$|High {{computational}} {{demand in}} solving the optimization {{problems associated with the}} model predictive control (MPC) schemes is a major obstacle when applying the methods to large-scale or fast-sampling systems. In this paper, we propose a new structured neural network approach to solving the quadratic programming problem in the constrained MPC. This new approach has the advantage of solving large-scale quadratic programming problems in a massively parallel fashion. The structured neural network consists of a projection network and a network for implementing the gradient projection algorithm. where the projection network is constructed from specially structured <b>linear</b> <b>neurons</b> with a special training algorithm.

There do exist some networks which extract most of the information by implementing the maximum entropy principle for Gaussian sources. This is done by transforming input patterns to the base of eigenvectors of the input autocorrelation matrix with the biggest eigenvalues. The basic building block of these networks is the <b>linear</b> <b>neuron,</b> learning with the Oja learning rule. Nevertheless, some researchers in pattern recognition theory claim that for pattern recognition and classification clustering transformations are needed which reduce the intra-class entropy. This leads to stable, reliable features and is implemented for Gaussian sources by a linear transformation using the eigenvectors with the smallest eigenvalues. In another paper (Brause 1992) it is shown that the basic building block for such a transformation can be implemented by a <b>linear</b> <b>neuron</b> using an Anti-Hebb rule and restricted weights. This paper shows the analog VLSI design for such a building block, using standard modules of multiplication and addition. The most tedious problem in this VLSI-application is the design of an analog vector normalization circuitry. It can be shown that the standard approaches of weight summation will not give the convergence to the eigenvectors for a proper feature transformation. To avoid this problem, our design differs significantly from the standard approaches by computing the real Euclidean norm.
