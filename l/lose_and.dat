5|$|The game {{does not}} go well for Homer, who is {{obviously}} still jealous of Ned. Meanwhile, Bart and Todd find out about an upcoming children's miniature golf tournament, with the first prize of $50. They enter it, and although Todd {{is very good at}} miniature golf, Homer becomes confident that Bart will win. He tells Bart that it is not okay to <b>lose</b> <b>and</b> forces him to stare angrily at a picture of Todd for 15 minutes every day. Later, when Bart looks at his meager collection of trophies in his room, Lisa offers to help him practice. Utilizing spiritual books that calm Bart's mind, they meditate. Meanwhile, Homer makes a bet with Ned on whose boy is a better golfer: the father of the boy who does not win the tournament will mow the other father's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's small {{majority}} {{after the}} 1964 general election {{had made the}} transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room {{for members of the}} next generation. Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would <b>lose,</b> <b>and</b> that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to <b>lose,</b> <b>and</b> he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E

25|$|The group, then less organised, {{was given}} its name by the Australian media during the 1994 - 1995 Test series in Australia, {{reportedly}} for the fans' audacity in travelling to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would <b>lose,</b> <b>and</b> {{the fact that}} they kept on chanting even when England were losing quite badly.

25|$|The {{coastal region}} is a {{comparatively}} narrow zone, characterised by secondary soil which is rather <b>lose</b> <b>and</b> sandy. The sterile sandy tract supports only a poor vegetation of the psammophyte type. Plants {{are few and}} mostly prostrate. Erect species are small and short. Owing to very poor water holding capacity of the soil, these plants are provided with special xerophytic adaptations. Another conspicuous feature of this area is the mangrove vegetation, found at the estuaries of rivers and backwaters, and often extending to the interior along their banks. Human interference has much changed the vegetation of the coastal region.|$|E
25|$|Robbins has written, produced, and {{directed}} several films with strong social content, {{such as the}} critically acclaimed capital punishment saga Dead Man Walking (1995), starring Sarandon and Sean Penn. The film earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Director. His next directorial effort was 1999's Depression-era musical Cradle Will Rock. Robbins has also appeared in mainstream Hollywood thrillers, such as 1999's Arlington Road (as a suspected terrorist) and 2001's Antitrust (as a malicious computer tycoon), and in comical films such as The Hudsucker Proxy, Nothing to <b>Lose,</b> <b>and</b> High Fidelity.

Kali forced Nala to <b>lose</b> <b>and,</b> each time, he would raise the stakes higher despite the protest of his advisors and wife. Finally, Nala lost his kingdom to Pushkara. Both he and Damayanti were exiled to the forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the {{football}} rivalry between Argentina and Brazil {{can be traced to}} before football became so popular in both countries. Today, few remember wars and other political confrontations between both countries, and only recall matches, victories, goals and other sport-related incidents. Their rivalry is found in almost all sports, but a men's football match between Argentina and Brazil is one that neither side wants to <b>lose,</b> <b>and</b> often acquires more importance than the championship within which it takes place. To exemplify the intensity of this rivalry, one only needs to remember that after the 1946 incidents (see below), the two teams did not play against each other for ten years; either team would decline to play a given cup so that they would never have to play against the neighboring country.|$|E
25|$|Antiochus {{was driven}} out of Greece {{following}} the defeat of his expeditionary force at the Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC). The Roman navy with the Rhodians and other allies outmaneuvered and defeated the Seleucid navy, permitting the Roman army to cross the Hellespont. The Roman army operated under the commands of the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, younger brother of Scipio Africanus, who accompanied him as legatus. The Carthaginian general and dire enemy of the Roman Republic Hannibal Barca, had fled to Antiochus' court after his defeat at the Battle of Zama {{and the end of}} the Second Punic War. Some believe that Hannibal was present at Magnesia. This is false, however, because Hannibal, who had commanded the fleet and lost at Eurymedon, had retreated and then fled to Crete for fear that Antiochus would <b>lose</b> <b>and</b> turn him over to the Romans.|$|E
