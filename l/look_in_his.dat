25|$|The {{president}} inaugurated {{planning for}} the New Look in July 1953 by asking the incoming members of the JCS (Admiral Arthur W. Radford, chairman; General Matthew B. Ridgway, Army chief of staff; General Nathan F. Twining, Air Force chief of staff; and Admiral Robert B. Carney, chief of naval operations) to prepare a paper on overall defense policy. Although the JCS paper did not recommend any fundamental changes, the National Security Council in October 1953 adopted a key tenet of the New Look that a large-scale limited war or a general war would likely be fought with nuclear weapons. Eisenhower formally presented the New <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> State of the Union message in January 1954 and Secretary Wilson helped to explain it. More defense for less money was possible, he said. With new weapons and techniques and ready reserves of troops and materiel, the United States could support capable military forces within budget allocations that Congress was willing to provide.|$|E
25|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place in}} the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems {{determined}} to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and The Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, and produces a Priest and Chorus Girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, The Persian {{and the rest of the}} group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, The Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain").Christine remarks that The Phantom was always the angel of music ("He Will Not Go Without A Friend").|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E

500|$|Farnese {{deployed}} a 5,000-man vanguard, both {{infantry and}} cavalry, in the plain which separated his camp at Ranst from Borgerhout. Three small battalions, not surpassing 12 companies each one, but {{made up of}} chosen men, went in advance; the right {{was taken by the}} Spanish tercio of Lope de Figueroa, the center by a Lower German regiment under Francisco de Valdés and the right by a Walloon regiment under Claude de Berlaymont, known as Haultpenne. Each formation was supported by a sleeve of 100 musketeers, a group of men armed with axes to cut the palissades and a wheeled bridge to cross the moat. A corps of light cavalry led by Antonio de Olivera followed the infantry at some distance with instructions to cover its withdrawal if the attack went bad, or to follow up the victory, if it took place. According to Alonso Vázquez, Farnese made the Walloon soldiers of the Spanish Army wear white shirts over their armors, a practise common in night attacks known as camisades, to distinguish themselves from the Walloons who fought for the Union of Utrecht. Thus the Walloons <b>look,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> words, like [...] "a very colorful procession of clerics and sacristans".|$|E

"First of all I was {{attracted}} to the songs, because I thought that he painted great pictures in his lyrics, particularly for someone {{who had not been}} around the typical Music Row co-writes. I thought that he sang very well too. But more than anything {{there was a kind of}} this ‘I-will-do-it’ <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes - I was really drawn in by the fact that he was so set on being successful in this business." ...|$|E

"Go to the County Ground on any {{day in the}} cricket season – or, {{for that}} matter, on a good many days outside it – and somewhere between the indoor school and the {{pavilion}} {{you are likely to}} meet a comfortable, well-fed-looking man going in one direction when he obviously wants to go in several. He has a rosy face, a quizzical <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> blue eyes and one eyebrow goes up as he asks you wistfully, {{out of the side of}} his mouth, [...] "ave you seen so-and-so?" [...] This is 'The Coach'. Arthur Holt finds that title convenient: it saves him the embarrassment of telling ground staff boys that they must call him Mister Holt and not Arthur." ...|$|E
2500|$|SP4 Frederick J. Widmer – Assistant Radiotelephone Operator; Widmer, who {{has been}} the subject of pointed blame, is quoted as saying, [...] "The most {{disturbing}} thing I saw was one boy—and this was something that, you know, this is what haunts me from the whole, the whole ordeal down there. And there was a boy with his arm shot off, shot up half, half hanging on and he just had this bewildered <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face and like, 'What did I do, what's wrong?' He was just, you know, it's, it's hard to describe, couldn't comprehend. I, I shot the boy, killed him and it's—I'd like to think of it more or less as a mercy killing because somebody else would have killed him in the end, but it wasn't right." [...] Widmer died on August 11, 2016 at the age of 68.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing of}} [...] "The Fly" [...] began during {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby at Berlin's Hansa Studios in 1990. The song's origins {{can be traced}} to a demo recorded there, which eventually evolved into the B-side [...] "Lady With the Spinning Head." [...] The demo was among the material that was bootlegged from the Berlin sessions and released as Salome: The Axtung Beibi Sessions. In 1991, the album's recording sessions moved to the seaside mansion [...] "Elsinore" [...] in Dalkey, where the group continued to work on the demo. It was troublesome, but it inspired portions of three separate songs, [...] "The Fly" [...] being one of them, and [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station" [...] being the other two. Lead vocalist Bono stated, [...] "One day, [...] Flood had a different <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye. It started to feel good. We recorded 'The Fly'. Edge's guitar sound was literally like a fly had broken into your brain and was buzzing around." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1978, Wood's {{depression}} had worsened, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} Kathy had become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom. From the bedroom, he asked Kathy to bring him a drink which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, [...] "Kathy, I can't breathe!", a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood's bossing her around. After hearing no movement from the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a heart attack. Kathy later said, [...] "I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget the <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell." ...|$|E
