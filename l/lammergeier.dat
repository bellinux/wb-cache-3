25|$|The fauna of Ladakh {{has much}} in common with that of Central Asia in general and that of the Tibetan Plateau in particular. Exceptions to this are the birds, many of which migrate from the warmer parts of India to spend the summer in Ladakh. For such an arid area, Ladakh has a great {{diversity}} of birds— a total of 225 species have been recorded. Many species of finches, robins, redstarts (like the black redstart), and the hoopoe are common in summer. The brown-headed gull is seen in summer on the river Indus and on some lakes of the Changthang. Resident water-birds include the brahminy duck also known as the ruddy sheldrake and the bar-headed goose. The black-necked crane, a rare species found scattered in the Tibetan plateau, is also found in parts of Ladakh. Other birds include the raven, Eurasian magpie, red-billed chough, Tibetan snowcock, and chukar. The <b>lammergeier</b> and the golden eagle are common raptors here specially in Changthang region.|$|E
25|$|Golden eagles, being {{habitual}} scavengers at carrion, {{come into}} conflict with scavenging birds as well. They may encounter corvids at carrion sites and the large passerines are often highly cautious, either feeding {{some distance from the}} eagle or waiting until the eagle is done eating, lest they be predaceously grabbed. Occasionally, however, corvids may behave more boldly around golden eagles. In one case, a group of three black-billed magpies were observed to rob a golden eagle of its prey. Golden eagles also usually dominate both New World and Old World vultures. Smaller species like black vulture (Coragyps atratus) in North America and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in Eurasia are known to be occasionally hunted by golden eagles. Besides the Steller's sea eagle, the larger species of Old World vulture and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) are the only noticeably larger raptorial birds that a golden eagle may encounter. The relationship between these large vultures and golden eagles can be highly contentious, with most sources favoring victory for the eagle due to its more aggressive disposition, much stronger feet and sharp talons. In one case, a colony of griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) was exceptionally able to displace a pair golden eagles from a cliff where they were trying nest so they could nest there themselves. On the other hand, a 5-year-old griffon vulture reintroduced into the wild in Bulgaria was thought to have been killed by a golden eagle. The golden eagle is a potential predator of the <b>lammergeier</b> which is often attracted to much the same habitat and prey as the eagle but often feeds largely on bone marrow from carcasses. It has been observed that both golden eagles and lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. In the Southwestern United States, several conflicts between huge California condors and golden eagles have been observed. At carrion, victory during conflicts can go either way apparently. Recent observation have suggested that the critically endangered condors do not seem to actively defend their nesting territories from golden eagles but have been recorded gaining incidental protection from prairie falcons and common ravens, which both aggressively displaced the eagles from their own adjacent territories. The golden eagle is considered an occasional predator of California condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be {{little in the way of}} eyewitness accounts to confirm this. It is possible that (as in the Bulgarian griffon vultures) the California condors have lost their natural cautiousness around eagles due to having been reintroduced from captivity.|$|E

In the 1980s, the Kemps made a number of Survival films in Spain, including three one-hour specials culminating in Wolf! The Spanish Outlaw, that revealed the ability of the Eurasian wolf to maintain a foothold in the country’s northern hills, despite its age-old conflict with village communities. The rugged terrain also provided the setting for The Bonebreaker's Mountain featuring the giant <b>lammergeier</b> - half vulture, half eagle - that drops large animal bones from its talons to smash on the rocks in order to extract nutritious bone-marrow.

2500|$|In {{some areas}} {{tortoises}} {{are more important}} in the diet than snakes, and they displace mammals and birds as the most important prey group in most of Southeastern Europe as well as the Caucasus. Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Greek tortoises (Testudo graeca) made up 55.4% of the prey in two nests in Bulgaria and 52.9% of the prey in 19 nests in the Republic of Macedonia. The same species are also prevalent in the diet of eagles from Greece, but no quantitative analysis is known from that country. Russian tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) made up 31.9% of the prey in 5 nests in Turkmenistan and 25.4% of the prey in 36 nests in Kazakhstan. When hunting tortoise, golden eagles use a unique technique: they pick up the tortoise and fly up to at least [...] above the rocky ground, then drop the tortoise onto the terrain below in the hope of smashing open its hard shell. The only other bird species confirmed to hunt vertebrates in this way is the <b>lammergeier</b> (Gypaetus barbatus), although gulls may use a similar technique on hard-shelled prey such as mussels. The larger desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) of North America has occasionally turned up as prey there. Other turtles have been reported as being hunted, such as painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) in Washington state and baby loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in Corsica, but essentially are a negligible part of the diet.|$|E
