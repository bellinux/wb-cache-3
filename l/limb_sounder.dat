50|$|A <b>limb</b> <b>sounder</b> {{looks at}} the edge of the {{atmosphere}} where it is visible above the Earth. It does this in one of two ways: either it tracks the sun, moon, a star, or another transmitting satellite through the limb as the source gets occultated behind the Earth, or it looks towards empty space, collecting radiation that is scattered from one of these sources. In contrast, a nadir-looking atmospheric sounder looks down through the atmosphere at the surface. The SCIAMACHY instrument operates in all three of these modes.|$|E
50|$|On {{the third}} day of the mission, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was {{deployed}} from Discovery's payload bay 350 statute miles above Earth to study human effects on the planet's atmosphere and its shielding ozone layer. The UARS mission objectives were to provide an increased understanding of the energy input into the upper atmosphere, global photochemistry of the upper atmosphere, dynamics of the upper atmosphere, the coupling among these processes, and the coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere. This provided data for a coordinated study of the structure, chemistry, energy balance, and physical action of the Earth's middle atmosphere - thatslice of air between 10 and 60 miles above the Earth. The UARS was the first major flight element of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a multi-year global research program that would use ground-based, airborne, and space-based instruments to study the Earth as a complete environmental system. UARS had ten sensing and measuring devices: Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES); Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS); Microwave <b>Limb</b> <b>Sounder</b> (MLS); Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE); High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI); Wind Imaging Interferometer (WlNDII); Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM); Solar/Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE); Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) and Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM II). UARS's initial 18-month mission was extended several times - it was finally retired after 14 years of service.|$|E

50|$|Higgins' {{entertainment}} industry career began in 1946, {{when he took}} a cadetship at Sydney's 2GB commercial radio station at the age of 15. This led to an on-air announcing position and hosting of breakfast and, later, evening variety shows. A trained singer, he soon began recording singles which lifted his profile around Australia. His flair for comedy came to the fore in the 1950s when he became a cast member of the very popular The Jack Davey Show. He moved between commercial radio and the ABC, touring the country, hosting and singing with the ABC show band. It was during this period he performed with luminaries such as Peter Dawson, Slim Dusty and Mel Tormé. His radio career reached a peak in the mid-1950s and, when television arrived in 1956, he successfully made the transition, appearing on variety shows, hosting game shows on the 7 Network and in the early 1960s on Singalong and Bobby <b>Limb's</b> <b>Sound</b> of Music on the 9 Network.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this grant was to support {{analysis}} of the limb scattering data taken during the 1997 flight of the SOLSE (Shuttle Ozone <b>Limb</b> <b>Sounding</b> Experiment) and LORE (Limb Ozone Retrieval Experiment) instruments. Work was done to assess {{the performance of the}} retrieval algorithms for cloudy and clear sky cases in preparation for a poster presentation. The nadir-viewing data were also compared to coincident GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) data and to radiative transfer calculations. An algorithm similar to the TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) ozone retrieval algorithm was developed to infer the ozone column amount from the SOLSE nadir data. Comparison with coincident TOMS ozone column data confirmed that column ozone could be derived successfully from SOLSE nadir radiances, and also revealed significant changes in the SOLSE wavelength resolution and absolute radiometric calibration that were subsequently confirmed by comparing the post-flight instrument characterization to the pre-flight characterization, indicating a potentially useful method for monitoring instrument behavior in-flight...|$|R

40|$|With {{the loss}} of a lower limb, amputees lack the active muscle {{empowered}} control of the ankle that is important for balance control. We examined single-leg stance on prosthesis vs. <b>sound</b> <b>limb</b> balancing on narrow ridges in transtibial amputees. When balancing on the prosthetic limb, the lateral displacement of the center of pressure was reduced and was compensated by an increase in counter-rotation. We show that single-leg stance on a prosthetic limb can be compared to balancing on a narrow ridge. Standing on a prosthetic limb involves the same balance mechanisms as balancing on narrow ridges of 40 -mm to 20 -mm width. Yet, the ability to balance on a narrow ridge with the <b>sound</b> <b>limb</b> was only a weak predictor for an amputee's ability to stand on the prosthetic limb. Balancing in single-leg stance on a prosthetic limb is not a common activity. The ability to compensate with the <b>sound</b> <b>limb</b> may therefore be functionally more important than the ability to stay in dynamic balance on the prosthetic limb. (C) 2016 IPEM.

50|$|The {{objective}} of the Shuttle Ozone <b>Limb</b> <b>Sounding</b> Experiment (SOLSE) {{is to determine the}} altitude distribution of ozone in an attempt to understand its behavior so that quantitative changes in the composition of our atmosphere can be predicted. SOLSE is intended to perform ozone distribution that a nadir instrument can achieve. This will be performed using Charged Coupled Device (CCD) technology to eliminate moving parts in a simpler, low cost, ozone mapping instrument. The experiment is housed in a Hitchhiker (HH/GAS) canister with canister extension ring and equipped with a Hitchhiker Motorized Door Assembly (HMDA). Instrumentation includes an Ultraviolet (UV) spectrograph with a CCD array detector, CCD array and visible light cameras, calibration lamp, optics and baffling. Once on orbit a crew member will active SOLSE which will perform limb and Earth viewing observations. Limb observations focuses on the region 20 km to 50 km altitude above the horizon for the Earth's surface. Earth viewing observations will enable SOLSE to correlate the data with other nadir viewing, ozone instruments.|$|R

40|$|The risk {{of falling}} in older adults {{has been widely}} {{investigated}} among the able-bodied population {{but there is little}} evidence identifying fall risk among older adults who have a unilateral transfemoral amputation. Older adult amputees have a loss of muscular control at the ankle and knee joints in the prosthetic limb and decreased muscle strength in the <b>sound</b> <b>limb</b> from aging. Previous research has investigated minimum foot clearance (MFC) to understand the risk of tripping while walking, and results show MFC decreases with age in able-bodied individuals. Changes in MFC have not been examined for older adults with unilateral transfemoral amputation, and in general, the methods for determining MFC must be modified for deviations in amputee gait. The first objective of this thesis was to develop a methodology for identifying MFC in older adult unilateral transfemoral amputees while walking over a level surface and during stair ambulation. Comparisons were made between the prosthetic <b>limb</b> and <b>sound</b> <b>limb.</b> Six older adult unilateral transfemoral amputees completed multiple walking and stair ambulation trials. Results showed 4 of 6 subjects had smaller MFC with the prosthetic limb compared to the <b>sound</b> <b>limb</b> while walking over a level surface. During stair ascent and descent, horizontal clearance of the prosthetic foot with respect to the step edge was typically greater than the <b>sound</b> <b>limb.</b> The methodology developed in this thesis allowed for identification of MFC regardless of unilateral transfemoral amputee gait style. The second objective was to investigate stumble recovery following obstruction of the prosthetic limb during swing. Results showed an elevating recovery strategy yielded a shorter recovery duration and smaller trunk deviation in the sagittal and frontal planes in comparison to a lowering strategy. The final objective was to develop a geometric model of the prosthetic limb for determining the mass, center of mass, and mass moment of inertia of its segments. Published anthropometric methods for determining these inertial properties in able-bodied individuals are inaccurate due to the amputation. The developed geometric model of the prosthetic limb successfully produced the inertial properties, and the model results were comparable to direct measurements taken for each segment...|$|R
