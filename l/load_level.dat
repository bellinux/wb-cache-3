40|$|AbstractCorrosion Inhibiting Compounds (CICs) retard {{or prevent}} {{degradation}} by corrosion, {{and are used}} widely in aviation, particularly in large aircraft with well-developed Corrosion Prevention and Control Programs. The diverse General Aviation sector, including small airliners, also benefit, but are poorly supported in terms of guidelines for CIC selection and application. One risk is that lubricating chemicals (like CICs) might affect the fatigue performance of structural joints, and potentially affect the overall economic or safe life of the aircraft. This paper discusses {{the effect of the}} application of Corrosion Inhibiting Compounds (CICs) on the fatigue life of riveted joints, and on the failure mechanisms involved. Single lap joints treated and untreated with CICs were tested under constant amplitude fatigue loading, with multiple <b>load</b> <b>levels.</b> Two different CICs, one oil-based, and one a soft-waxy CIC, were applied. The results showed that the presence of CICs had a significant influence on the fatigue life, and also on the failure mode of the joints. At high <b>load</b> <b>levels,</b> the application of CICs caused a reduction in the fatigue life of the joint by more than a factor of two. In this load range, the CICs appeared to cause the failure mode to change from tensile failure of the sheet (the prevalent mode at medium <b>load</b> <b>levels)</b> to shear failure of the rivets (observed at the highest <b>load</b> <b>levels).</b> Specimens that failed by rivet shearing showed some fatigue cracks propagating along the critical rivet row. In treated specimens tested at medium <b>load</b> <b>levels,</b> a reduction in the fatigue life still occurred, with all specimens failing in the sheet. At low <b>load</b> <b>levels,</b> there was little difference in fatigue life for the three conditions, although specimen test run-outs meant that further testing will be needed. The results are believed to have significance for managing the small aircraft in which these joints are common...|$|R

50|$|Viscoplasticity is {{a theory}} in {{continuum}} mechanics that describes the rate-dependent inelastic behavior of solids.

Rate-dependent plasticity is important for transient plasticity calculations. The main difference between rate-independent plastic and viscoplastic material models is that the latter exhibit not only permanent deformations after the application of loads but continue to undergo a creep flow as a function of time under the influence of the applied load.|$|E
50|$|The {{comparative}} study of different load indices carried out by Ferrari et al. reported that CPU load information based upon the CPU queue length does much better in load balancing compared to CPU utilization.

5000|$|The {{influence}} {{and quality of}} the fibre interface can be evaluated through mechanical properties.Measurements of the crack resistance were performed with notched specimens (see figure) in so-called single-edge-notch-bend (SENB) tests.

Because of the complex crack surface (see figure {{at the top of this}} article) the real crack surface area can not be determined for CMC materials. The measurements therefore use the initial notch as the crack surface, yielding the formal SIF shown in the figure. This requires identical geometry for comparing different samples.
