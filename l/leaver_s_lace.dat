Second, we prove that for certain specific Coxeter systems, some subalgebras of J_C are free fusion rings, thereby connecting the algebras to compact quantum groups arising in operator algebra theory...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Coach lace is a trim used almost {{exclusively}} in the upholstery of carriages and coaches. The names 2 ̆ 2 coach lace 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 livery lace 2 ̆ 2 were used consistently throughout its manufacture. The robust looped wool pile created by a supplementary warp, was a variation of velvet similar to Brussels carpeting and makes this trim easily identifiable. This paper examines the manufacturing of American coach lace from the mid- 18 th century until its demise in the 19302 ̆ 7 <b>s.</b> Coach <b>lace</b> is a textile little recognized today. The prevalence and context within which it existed and how coach lace adapted to new forms of transportation, technolo 1 :, 2 ̆ 7 Y and production organization will be explored. Business records, census records, city directories, government reports, patents, textile directories, and carriage and automobile journals {{were some of the}} records consulted. Objects were sought and examined such as textile samples, carriages, coaches, train passenger cars and automobiles that retained their original upholstery and had provenance. The story of American coach lace production is necessarily hinged to the production of carriages. Carriages as a mode of transportation relied on a network of roads and the means to atford the purchase and maintenance of the vehicle. The roadway system that developed during the 18 th century that resulted in increased communication and a more rapid exchange of technology and goods...|$|R

40|$|Donated oocytes are a {{treatment}} modality for female infertility {{which is also}} associated with increased risks of preeclampsia. Subsequently {{it is important to}} evaluate if there is concomitant increased risks for adverse neonatal events in donated oocyte neonates. A structured search of the literature using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Reviews was performed to investigate the perinatal health outcomes of offspring conceived from donor oocytes compared with autologous oocytes. Meta-analysis was performed on comparable outcomes data. Twenty-eight studies were eligible and included in the review, and of these, 23 were included in a meta-analysis. Donor oocyte neonates are at increased risk of being born with low birth weight (< 2500 g) [risk ratio (RR) : 1. 18, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 14 - 1. 22, P-value (P) < 0. 00001], very low birth weight (< 1500 g) (RR: 1. 24, CI: 1. 15 - 1. 35, P< 0. 00001), preterm (< 37 weeks) (RR: 1. 26, CI: 1. 23 - 1. 30, P< 0. 00001), of lower gestational age (mean difference - 0. 3 weeks, CI: - 0. 35 weeks to - 0. 25 weeks, P< 0. 00001), and preterm with low birth weight (RR: 1. 24, CI: 1. 19 - 1. 29, P< 0. 00001), when compared with autologous oocyte neonates. Conversely, low birth weight outcomes were improved in term donor oocyte neonates (RR: 0. 86, CI: 0. 8 - 0. 93, P= 0. 0003). These negative outcomes remained significant when controlling for multiple deliveries. The donor oocyte risk rates are higher than those found in general ART outcomes, are important considerations for the counselling of infertile patients and may also influence the long term health of the offspring.

40|$|In his acknowledgments, John Conway writes: 2 ̆ 2 I have 2 ̆ 7 {{gone out}} photographing 2 ̆ 7 {{with only one}} other person in my life, my friend Garth Abrams. When we arrived at a place, we usually walked off in {{different}} directions, each preferring our own way. 2 ̆ 2 That statement defines Saskatchewan: Uncommon Views. As a Saskatchewan landscape photographer, I too resonate deeply with the solitude the Great Plains invites, if not commands. Conway 2 ̆ 7 s spartan landscapes form the mouthpiece for a haunting lament shared by all who choose to spend time alone here. To recognize these unadorned one hundred sweeps and unpretentious corners is to acknowledge our own unfinished edges, and to confront vast space {{as an end in}} itself rather than a medium through which to escape into wishful thinking. The enigma, I believe, has to do with the pushpull, love-hate, hot-cold dualities that the land fosters. Initially it can be a daunting proposition to spend long periods of solitude in a place that feels like nowhere. Conway 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> landscapes, <b>laced</b> with their patches and traces of human intention, past and present, invite us to show up alone and to pay full attention. As a chronicler, he records, not as an occupation but with an enquiring mind. By being totally present, hunched into a tripod, he allows the landscape to speak in ways that present-day occupants might not hear, perhaps because the all-too-familiar scenery has become a mere backdrop to the task of feeding a family or conducting a profitable agribusiness. A common reaction might very well be 2 ̆ 2 Now why would you want to take a picture of that? 2 ̆ 2 The most poignant answer lies in the images themselves. Each photograph evokes its own dialogue with the viewer. I particularly appreciate the generous layout of one image per double page. The book is designed to invite one to linger and contemplate rather than, like big business interests, to plow through the landscapes. The accompanying text is provided as a mere whisper, the pictures speaking louder than words. The essays, though not essential to the book, provide three unique frames through which to gain perspective on Conway 2 ̆ 7 s epic portfolio. This is a book to be absorbed, if not also dissected...|$|R
40|$|Camille Rose Garcia {{is part of}} a {{contemporary}} underground art movement known as Pop Surrealism. An apparent dream-like and unexpected nature borrows from the oeuvre of Surrealism, while an allusion to the familiar and popular denotes similarities to the comic culture of the 1930 s and Pop Art of the 1960 s. Garcia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> paintings are <b>laced</b> with the personal remnants of childhood memories that recall frequent trips to Disneyland and visits to her grandparent 2 ̆ 7 s cabin tucked away in the redwood forests of Northern California. Her artwork, a haunting recipe of sweet and sour, beautiful and grotesque, ominous and nostalgic, travels through Los Angeles 2 ̆ 7 s counterculture to paint the story of a machine-driven, violence-ridden, pill-popping society that has seemingly turned its back on the good, the human, and the existential. The twentieth century was marked by an invasion of tract homes, multi-national corporations, rising government intervention into everyday life, mass production, and an unending stream of consumer goods. Popular products and age old stories were hollowed out and embedded with myths to help increase sales. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} postmodern thinkers proclaimed the demise of the human subject. The twenty-first century must now try to makes sense of this phenomenon. Adopting the definition of myth presented by Roland Barthes in his essay Myth Today, this thesis posits that through its appropriation of Disney imagery and use of narrative motifs from classic fairy tales, the art of Camille Rose Garcia forces the viewer to compare, interpret, and choose...|$|R
40|$|Most Hilltoppers {{believe that}} Western Kentucky University is unique. They {{take pride in}} its lovely campus, its {{friendly}} spirit, the loyalty of its alumni, and its academic and athletic achievements. But Western 2 ̆ 7 s development also illustrates a major trend in American higher education during the past century. Scores of other institutions have followed the Western pattern, growing from private normal school to state normal school, to teachers college, to general college, finally emerging as an important state university. Historian Lowell Harrison traces the Western story from the school 2 ̆ 7 s origin in 1875 to the January 1986 election of its seventh president. For much of its history, Western has been led by paternalistic presidents whose major battles have been with other state schools and parsimonious legislatures. In recent years the presidents have been challenged by students and faculty who have demanded more active roles in university governance, and by a Board of Regents and the Council on Higher Education, which have raised challenging new issues. Harrison 2 ̆ 7 s account of the institution 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> development is <b>laced</b> with anecdotes and vignettes {{of some of the}} school 2 ̆ 7 s interesting personalities: President Henry Hardin Cherry, whose chapel talks convinced countless students that 2 ̆ 2 the Spirit Makes the Master 2 ̆ 2; 2 ̆ 2 Uncle Ed 2 ̆ 2 Diddle, whose flying towel and winning teams earned national basketball fame; 2 ̆ 2 Daddy 2 ̆ 2 Bur-ton who could catch flies while lecturing; Miss Gabie Robertson, who held students into the next class period; the lone Japanese student who was on campus during World War II. Harrison also recalls steamboat excursions, the Great Depression and the Second World War, the astounding boom in enrollment and buildings in the 1960 s, the period of student unrest, and the numerous fiscal crises that have beset the school. This is the story of an institution proud of its past and seeking to chart its course into the twenty-first century. Lowell Harrison is professor of history at Western Kentucky University and the author of many books {{on the history of the}} Commonwealth. [URL]...|$|R
