About the same time, Ina Harvey, the receptionist from the Strathmore Hotel opposite Adelaide railway station, revealed that a strange man had stayed in Room 21 or 23 {{for a few days}} {{around the time of the}} death, checking out on 30 November 1948. She recalled that he was English speaking and only carrying a small black case, not unlike one a musician or a doctor might carry. When an employee <b>looked</b> <b>inside</b> the case he told Harvey he had found an object inside the case he described as looking like a 'needle.' ...|$|E
2500|$|For kabbalists, ten utterances in Genesis {{with which}} God created {{the world are}} linked to the ten sefirotthe divine {{structure}} of all being. According to the Zohar and the Sefer ha-Yihud, the Torah is synonymous with God. [...] More specifically, in the Sefer ha-Yihud, the letters in the Torah are the forms of God. [...] The kabbalist looks beyond the literal aspects of the text, to find the hidden mystical meaning. [...] The text not only offers traditions and ways of thinking, but it also reveals the reality of God. One of the first Jewish philosophers, Philo of Alexandria (20BCE-40), said that Abraham knew the essential Torah, before it was given, because Abraham was himself a philosopher: he observed the world around him and <b>looked</b> <b>inside</b> himself to discover the laws of nature. [...] While this is not strictly speaking a mystical notion, it does introduce the idea of an inner Torah that underlies the written word. Much later, in the 19th century, the Sfas Emes, a Hasidic rebbe, made the assertion that it was actually Abraham’s deeds that became Torah. [...] The Torah is thus seen as an ongoing story played out through the lives of the Nation of Israel. [...] The Torah is an important text because even the most minor traditions of the Kabbalah will acknowledge its aspects of the divine.|$|E

[...] The assailant {{told her she was}} lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she did not and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly <b>looked</b> <b>inside</b> to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E
