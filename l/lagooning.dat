40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the capacities of cattail (Typha latifolia L.) and reed (Phragmites australis L.) for heavy metal storage in the phytomass. Samples were studied in the fourth of the four interconnected natural <b>lagooning</b> basins of a constructed treatment wetland, developed as an integrated pilot system for the treatment of leachates in a domestic landfill site at Etueffont (Territoire de Belfort, France). The efficiency of the <b>lagooning</b> system was evaluated through physical and chemical parameter measurements over a period of three seasons. Anion/cation and heavy metal concentrations were sampled and analyzed in water flowing into and out of the <b>lagooning</b> basin. Simultaneously, reed and cattail biomass samples (roots/rhizomes, shoots) were collected at both inflow and outflow, and the biomass characteristics were determined. The average above-ground biomass of T. latifolia and P. australis varied, respectively, from 0. 41 to 1. 81 kg DW m− 2 in the fall, 0. 31 to 1. 34 kg DW m− 2 in winter, and 0. 38 to 1. 68 kg DW m− 2 in spring, with significant seasonal variations. The greatest mean concentrations of heavy metals were found in the below-ground plant parts of the two species during the spring season.

The presence of currently established bacterial indicators (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia), virological (enteroviruses, somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages, and phages infecting Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron), and helminth eggs were tested during this study. Bacterial and viral indicators were removed at least with one log reduction in the <b>lagooning</b> system, {{and to a lesser}} extent with UV-radiation treatment. The <b>lagooning</b> system was less efficient in removing phages and viruses than were bacterial indicators, with the exception of F-specific phages. Phages of B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were less removed than all of the other microbiological parameters. In the UV-radiation treatment, however, the faecal coliforms proved the most sensitive, while clostridial spores, somatic coliphages, Bacteroides phages, and enteric viruses were the more resistant. Helminth eggs were not detected in any samples from effluents of either the secondary or tertiary treatments. Indicator levels in both treatments met the established regulations of both local and national authorities for the disposal or reuse of wastewater in irrigation for non-human crop. We demonstrate that somatic coliphages are effective indicators of enteric viruses in both of the WWTPs studied. © IWA Publishing 2008. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{treatment}} of wool scouring effluent (WSE) in Australia is <b>lagooning</b> (anaerobic and aerobic). As the pressure to devise a more environmentally acceptable treatment method increases {{there is a need}} to study alternative, efficient biological treatment systems for WSE. In this study, laboratory and pilot-scale anaerobic biological and chemical flocculation treatment processes were investigated for removing the pollutants (mainly wool grease) from WSE. Anaerobic biological treatment utilises the natural microbial flora to destabilise and bioflocculate the WSE resulting in the settling of wool grease from the bulk liquid. Batch trials showed a grease reduction by anaerobic bioflocculation of between 30 % (pilot scale) and 50 % (laboratory scale) over 8 days. However, the destabilisation of the wool grease emulsion after only 2 - 3 days resulted in a total grease reduction of > 80 % after addition of a polymeric flocculant. A laboratory anaerobic bioflocculation-chemical flocculation process gave promising results by removing > 90 % grease at hydraulic retention times of 1 - 2 days. In the pilot-scale the same process resulted in up to 80 % grease removal efficiency. The results of this study indicate that anaerobic biological and chemical treatment of WSE is a promising alternative treatment system compared to other chemical or natural (<b>lagooning)</b> treatment systems. Our approach suggests adding a flocculant to aid the separation of biologically coagulated grease from the bulk liquid.

Since the efficiency of the <b>lagooning</b> process in the removal of pollutants from raw water depends on the internal hydrodynamics of the basin, the hydraulic performance of the basin was studied by combining the results of a stimulus-response tracer test with the monitoring of the tracer (fluoride) concentration throughout the basin at different times. The outcomes of the test demonstrated that the system was efficiently mixed and could be assimilated to a continuous stirred reactor presenting no flow anomalies, with an actual mean residence time (RT) of 12. 7 days, compared with a nominal RT of 18 days. This assured that dissolved contaminants (such as fluoride) coming from the river were efficiently diluted before entering the WTP. The axial dispersion coefficient calculated from the RT distribution was of approximately 47, 300 m 2 /d. Three of the most popular formulae developed for the calculation of the axial dispersion coefficient provided results spreading over three orders of magnitude, thus showing their limitations. Finally, because of the width extent of the basin and the characteristics of its inflow, the 1 -D advection - dispersion model failed in predicting the tracer concentration values in time at the outlet channel. On the contrary, the analytical solution of the 2 -D advection - dispersion model proved to be suitable to fit the tracer concentration data over time at the outlet channel but it failed in describing the tracer distribution throughout the basin on the monitoring date...|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{depuration}} {{plants have}} often shown low reliability and economic sustainability, when utilised for agro-industrial wastewater treatment, {{due to the}} particular wastewater properties: high organic load and essential oil concentrations, acidity, nutrient scarcity and qualitative-quantitative variability of effluents. Aerated <b>lagooning</b> systems represent a suitable alternative, because {{they are able to}} assure good reliability and low energy requirements, avoiding the drawbacks shown by the intensive depuration plants. In order to optimize performance of the <b>lagooning</b> systems, particularly in terms of energy requirements, depuration processes of aerobic-anaerobic aerated lagoons were investigated, both at full- and laboratory-scale. Citrus processing wastewater were subject to bubble aeration with low flow rates and limited time; the removal rate of organic load was evaluated and energy requirements of different depuration schemes were compared. The experimental investigations in full-scale aerated lagoons showed a low energy supply (0. 21 - 0. 59 kWh per kg of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) removed with an average value of 0. 45 kWh kgCOD – 1), an adequate equalisation capability and constantly good depurative performance also with high concentrations of essential oil (500 - 1000 ppm). The experimental investigations in lab-scale aerated tanks under controlled conditions indicated the possibility of decreasing energy requirements (down to 0. 16 kWh kgCOD – 1) by reducing aeration power (down to 0. 6 W m– 3) and limiting aeration time to night 12 hours only, when energy price is lower. In spite of the low aeration, the COD removal rates were on the average six-fold higher compared to the anaerobic tank. Other outcomes indicated an ability of the spontaneous microflora to adapt to high concentrations of essential oils, which however did not provide an increase of the removal rate of the organic load in the experimented scheme...|$|E
