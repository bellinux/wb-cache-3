5|$|Charuseela {{returns to}} Devarakota and assumes that Harsha {{is trying to}} impress her family with the {{intention}} of marrying her. Initially livid, Charuseela is impressed when Harsha succeeds in persuading her uncle's family not to migrate to the city to live with their employed son and instead makes their son agree to visit them every possible weekend. Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is going to take over all the agricultural land around the village for political gain since the value of the <b>land</b> <b>will</b> appreciate following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor. Harsha confronts them and warns them not to interfere in his work of developing the village.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, the {{greatest}} {{changes in the}} Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter {{at a rate of}} ten percent every 1.1billion years. In one billion years' time, as the Sun's radiation output increases, its circumstellar habitable zone will move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life on <b>land</b> <b>will</b> become extinct. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today.|$|E

25|$|According to the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (previously South Pacific Regional Environment Programme), {{two small}} {{uninhabited}} Kiribati islets, Tebua Tarawa and Abanuea, disappeared underwater in 1999. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will rise by about 50cm (20in) by 2100 {{due to global}} warming and a further rise would be inevitable.

25|$|Fair trade {{certified}} commodities must {{adhere to}} sustainable agro-ecological practices, including reduction of chemical fertilizer use, prevention of erosion, {{and protection of}} forests. Coffee plantations {{are more likely to}} be fair trade certified if they use traditional farming practices with shading and without chemicals. This protects the biodiversity of the ecosystem and ensures that the <b>land</b> <b>will</b> be usable for farming in the future and not just for short-term planting. In the United States, 85% of fair trade certified coffee is also organic.|$|E
25|$|In September 2009 it was {{announced}} that Australia's most prominent fire ecologist, Kevin Tolhurst, was developing a new course for the University of Melbourne on fire behaviour. Later that month the City of Manningham announced it was developing the state's first integrated fire management plan in conjunction with the interim findings of the Royal Commission. It is expected that eventually all Victorian councils responsible for both urban and rural <b>land</b> <b>will</b> need to develop such plans, which define fire risks in open space areas, along major roads, and in parkland.|$|E
25|$|On July 31, 2015, Cupertino-based Apple Inc. {{purchased}} a 40-acre site in San Jose.

Apple paid $138.2 million in cash for the site. The seller, Connecticut-based Five Mile Capital Partners, paid $40 million for the site in 2010. Real estate experts expect that other tech companies currently located in Silicon Valley will also follow in Apple's path by purchasing land or property in San Jose.|$|E

25|$|It {{is planned}} to use nearly 14% of the {{reclaimed}} land for residential and commercial purposes. Total 52 buildings will be constructed including eight museums. For maximum usage of land, the floor space index (FSI) has been raised up to 5.

25|$|Following the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster, {{authorities}} {{shut down}} the nation's 54 nuclear power plants, {{but it has been}} estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life. As of 2013, the Fukushima site remains highly radioactive, with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing, and some <b>land</b> <b>will</b> be unfarmable for centuries. The difficult Fukushima disaster cleanup will take 40 or more years, and cost tens of billions of dollars.|$|E

The SANFL plans to sell off the surrounding land in a 25-year development plan, though the main grandstand will be retained as SANFL headquarters and the oval {{for use by the}} Crows and some SANFL matches. On 28 November 2014 the SANFL announced they had sold the venue to property developers Commercial and General for A$71 million.

50|$|The {{primary mission}} duration, {{starting}} from launch, is 30 months, comprising 8 months of interplanetary cruise {{followed by a}} primary mission of 22 months (one Mars year) on the surface. The spacecraft will enter the atmosphere, and make a rocket-powered soft landing in a region of the south pole where geysers are known to form. This <b>landing</b> <b>will</b> take place during the polar summer, when the surface is free of ice. The predicted landing ellipse is 20 x 50 km and hence the <b>landing</b> <b>will</b> be targeted to a region, and not to a specific geyser location. During the first post-landing phase, it will conduct science operations to characterize the landing site, to understand the surface geology of the area during the ice-free summer period.|$|R
