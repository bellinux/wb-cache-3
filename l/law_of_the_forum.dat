40|$|Concerned by <b>the</b> {{overwhelming}} presence <b>of</b> vexatious federal securities-fraud class actions, Congress {{passed the}} Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 {{to increase the}} procedural burden plaintiffs would face in filing these nonmeritorious suits. Instead of being deterred, plaintiffs simply brought their suits in state court. Congress responded with the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), making federal court the exclusive venue for securities-fraud class actions. However, Congress expressly saved from SLUSA 2 ̆ 7 s reach claims that were traditionally brought in state court under corporate law through the Delaware carve-out. Though this exemption was meant to protect the historic dual federal-state securities-regulation regime, recent appellate court opinions have stretched SLUSA 2 ̆ 7 s reach too far, leaving plaintiffs incapable of bringing many traditional state-law claims essential to <b>the</b> proper policing <b>of</b> corporate <b>law</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forum.</b> This Note addresses <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> such a broad reading of SLUSA and advocates a two-pronged approach that will simultaneously effectuate SLUSA 2 ̆ 7 s purpose while still preserving these important state-law claims.

40|$|This Article {{breaks from}} {{conventional}} wisdom in both case law and scholarship. It proposes {{a simple but}} novel thesis: Arbitrators and arbitral institutions, in cases of voluntary submission of disputes, should not be entitled to any form of legal immunity. Instead, any limit on or waiver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arbitrator 2 ̆ 7 s or institution 2 ̆ 7 s liability should come in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a contractual release-either adopted in the parties 2 ̆ 7 arbitration agreement or negotiated between the parties and the arbitrator. Central to this thesis is a distinction between two types <b>of</b> immunity. <b>The</b> first form <b>of</b> immunity is “contractual immunity. ” <b>The</b> hallmark <b>of</b> contractual immunity is an agreement to release the arbitrator and, where relevant, the arbitral institution from liability. <b>The</b> second form <b>of</b> immunity is “legal immunity. ” Unlike contractual immunity, legal immunity {{does not depend on}} a term <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties 2 ̆ 7 agreement or the arbitrator 2 ̆ 7 s mandate. Instead, the legal immunity applies by operation <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (typically <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arbitral <b>forum)</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties 2 ̆ 7 intentions. The distinction between contractual and legal immunity is central to <b>the</b> market-based model <b>of</b> dispute resolution developed in this Article. Under this model, arbitration is one type of “product” in a market for dispute resolution services. A distinguishing feature about this product is that, with few exceptions, it is a voluntary undertaking, not simply among the litigants, but between them, the arbitrator, and, in many cases, an arbitral institution. The parties, the arbitrator, and the arbitral institution can dicker over <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> their relationship just like professionals in any other setting. A rule of legal immunity is inconsistent with the market-based model. It discourages <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> arbitration by forcing the parties involuntarily to surrender a remedy when there is misconduct by the decisionmaker. It drives up <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> arbitration by allowing the arbitrators to reap <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> immunity without having to make a transfer payment in return for the parties 2 ̆ 7 foregoing the right to sue. Finally, it undermines competition among providers of dispute resolution services because arbitrators cannot differentiate themselves along this axis. By contrast, limiting immunity to its first form (contractual immunity) comports with the market-based model. It preserves the parties 2 ̆ 7 freedom to structure the arbitration along their preferred lines. It ensures that any waiver <b>of</b> remedies by <b>the</b> parties will be effectively compensated in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a transfer payment from the arbitrator. Finally, it enables competitors in the dispute resolution marketplace to differentiate themselves by offering the parties partial or complete remedies as a guarantee of their performance (as exemplified by the ICC and AAA rules). This Article develops the foregoing argument in five parts. Part I develops a market-based theory of dispute resolution. It shows how the market for dispute resolution services has become a robust, competitive one, marked by competition among various types of services (mediation, arbitration, judicial resolution) and among providers of a particular service (arbitrators). Part II uses this market-based approach to criticize the traditional explanations offered for the immunity doctrine—arguments based on the arbitrator 2 ̆ 7 s function and the purposes served by immunity. Neither the functional argument nor the policy arguments fare well when subjected to the market-based paradigm developed in Part I. Part III uses this approach to analyze proposals in the scholarship on arbitral immunity—qualified immunity, limited liability, and institutional liability. Each of them fails to correct the price distortions, the barriers to entry, and <b>the</b> underutilization <b>of</b> arbitration caused by immunity. Part IV applies this approach to defend a model replacing <b>the</b> current system <b>of</b> legal immunity with a system of liability subject to contractual waivers. It answers anticipated criticisms based on the unequal bargaining power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties and the potential litigation prompted by a liability rule. It also explores <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis when one relaxes certain assumptions about <b>the</b> voluntary nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transaction, <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> information, and <b>the</b> viability <b>of</b> insurance markets...|$|R
