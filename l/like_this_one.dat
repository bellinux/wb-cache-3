25|$|British {{accounts}} of the battle minimized {{the efforts of the}} Dutch-Belgian cavalry. One historian noted that the overall Allied cavalry commander Henry Paget, Earl of Uxbridge placed himself at the front of a Dutch cavalry unit and ordered a charge, but none of the horsemen followed him. Incidents <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> caused many British officers to brand all Dutch soldiers as cowards. The author pointed out that chain-of-command and language problems may have been the real culprits in this particular case. Only that morning the Prince William of Orange placed the Dutch-Belgian cavalry under Uxbridge's command. In fact, Dutch-Belgian cavalry losses were serious, with two regiments each losing more than 50 killed.|$|E

But these categorical presumptions {{are a lot more}} narrowly defined than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted categorical presumption of confidentiality. She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> informants may also expect to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for a murder case.|$|E
25|$|Even though Clinton roughly {{received}} 3.1 {{million more}} votes than Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis had four years earlier, the Democrats recorded a 2.6 percentage point decrease in {{their share of}} the popular vote compared to 1988 due to the higher turnout. His 43% share of the popular vote was the second-lowest for any winning candidate in the 20th century after Woodrow Wilson in 1912 (41.8%). President Bush's 37.5% was the lowest percentage total for a sitting president seeking re-election since William Howard Taft, also in 1912 (23.2%); just <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> the 1912 election was also a three-way race (that time between Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Theodore Roosevelt). It was also the lowest percentage for a major-party candidate since Alf Landon received 36.5% of the vote in 1936. Bush had a lower percentage of the popular vote than even Herbert Hoover, who was defeated in 1932 (39.7%). However, none of these races included a major third candidate. As of the 2016 election, Bush has been the last president voted out of office after one term, as Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama were all re-elected to second terms in office.|$|E

After a personal inspection of the area by President Herbert Hoover, the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations. One of the solutions was the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike. Today, concerns related to the dike's stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with [...] "piping" [...] and erosion. Leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events.

Stegall further recognized the episode's editing, as [...] "a complicated story <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> could have been endlessly confusing, with multiple versions of the same character, two extremely similar universes, and plot points reaching back to the first season.
