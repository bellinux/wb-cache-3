Similarly {{it is possible to}} define the concept of 'unit limnigraph' which describes the variations of the level of an aquifer recharged by a unit infiltration. Knowing the past sequence of infiltration it is then possible to compute the future evolution of the water level according to different scenarios of forecast infiltration. As the aquifer inertia is often very large, it is then possible to predict the water level as much as six months ahead. Combining a unit hydrograph and a unit <b>limnigraph</b> a convolution relationship of water level-spring discharge or spring discharge-water level may be derived. In this case the forecast may be carried out faster and more precisely because {{it is not necessary to}} compute the infiltration on the hydrological basin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{satisfactory}} results {{have yet to}} be obtained in earthquake prediction, {{one of the most common}} indicators of an anomalous precursor is a change in groundwater level in existing wells. Further wells should thus be drilled in unconfined aquifers since these are more susceptible to seismic waves. The Eskisehir region lies in the transition zone between the Aegean extensional domain and the compressible northern Anatolian block. <b>Limnigraphs,</b> installed in 19 exploration wells in the Eskisehir region, recorded pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic level changes during the earthquakes of 17 August Izmit (Mw= 7. 4) and 12 November Duzce (Mw= 7. 2) 1999 that occurred along the North Anatolian Fault Zone. The Izmit and Duzce earthquakes affected groundwater levels, especially in confined aquifers. The aquifer characteristics before and after the earthquakes were unchanged so the aquifer is elastic in its behaviour. Further detailed geo-mechanical investigation of the confined aquifer in the Eskisehir region may improve understanding of earthquake prediction.

We report data taken by various <b>limnigraphs</b> and current meters and isolate, by spectral analysis, the most conspicuous barotropic periods of these signals. The analysis that follows is based on the linearized shallow-water equations, that are solved for the free oscillations and thus identify the eigenperiods and corresponding mode structures for this lake. Computational results are presented for a finite difference representation for these surface-seiche equations applied to the entire Lake Onega including its bays. The grid consists of quadratic elements of 1000 m side length corresponding to 9344 active cells. The emerging matrix eigenvalue problem exceeds the storage and compuational capacity of standard PCs or workstations and thus requires use of the approximate Lanczos procedure to isolate the first ten eigenperiods and corresponding mode structures of the barotropic seiches, lying between 12. 1 and 2. 2 h.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} dissertation {{deals with the}} temporal dynamics of the nutrient mobilization from a forested watershed {{with the emphasis on}} the definition and analysis of the hydrological mechanisms responsible for the regulation of observed responses of the streamwater nitrate concentrations and the amounts of the flushed nitrate. In 2006 and 2007 we continuously monitored the changeability of hydrometeorological conditions on rain gauges, <b>limnigraphs</b> and meteorological station on the studied area, the Padež stream forested watershed. The measurements of the hydrometeorological conditions were periodically supplemented by the continuous measurements of the streamwater chemistry in different seasonal and hydrological settings. The measurements of the streamwater nitrate concentrations during the hydrological events disclosed a considerable but variable responsiveness of the concentration to the hydrological conditions. In spite of the variability of the hydrological conditions, a seasonal influence could be recognised which has a prevailing role in regulating the intensity of biogeochemical transformations of nitrogen compounds, their further availability to mobilize under the impact of the hydrological mechanisms and respond to rainfall events. In the scope of the conceptual explanation of nitrate flushing, the perceived temporal patterns of the hydrograph and peak streamwater concentration formation were linked to the temporal frequency of the soil profile saturation deficit oscillations and associated changeability of spatial extension of the saturated variable areas. An extensive database obtained through continuous measurements was used for the application of the data mining methods. Using the algorithm M 5 which, based on the recognised relations between the data builds the model trees and classification rules, we supplemented our domain knowledge of the nitrate flushing from the forested watershed and modelled the streamwater nitrate concentration. Additionally, we calculated the mass flux of the nitrate which is annually washed from the studied forested watershed...|$|R

Il développe la phase 1 d'une démarche méthodologique visant l'élaboration d'un plan de gestion des eaux d'un lac collinaire en zone semi-aride tunisienne pour un développement agricole durable. Cette phase correspond à l'utilisation d'un modèle de prévision du ruissellement et des sédiments par averse. Le modèle mathématique à paramètres physiques distribués KINEROS est utilisé et appliqué sur un petit bassin versant de 135, 35 ha pour 9 averses enregistrées durant les deux années 1997 et 1998 en affectant aux différents paramètres du modèle des valeurs réalistes basées sur les résultats expérimentaux collectés dans la littérature. L'application de ce type de modèle nécessite la connaissance de l'occupation du sol à un instant donné. Pour ce faire, une carte d'aménagement agricole pour l'ensemble du bassin versant a été établie correspondant à la résultante de deux cartes élaborées; {{la carte}} culturale et la carte d'aménagement antiérosif. L'analyse des résultats obtenus a montré que le modèle KINEROS peut être utilisé comme outil d'aide à la gestion des terres et des sols en zone semi-aride tunisienne à relief accidenté. The process of erosion-sedimentation is initiated by rainfall and runoff from hill slopes and channels. Runoff is {{considered as a}} transport vector, which is related to agricultural management systems and land use. To simulate and predict the behaviour of ungauged watersheds, distributed parameter models are of great interest. Among the different developed models, conceptual and physically-based models are interesting to investigate, specifically under semi-arid conditions. As reported by many authors, these models allow reliable evaluation of the hydrologic responses to land use changes and thus can be used for elaboration of water and soil conservation plans. The accuracy of erosion and sedimentation results is related {{to the quality of the}} hydrologic component. An appropriate way of studying soil erosion is through the formulation of the fundamental transport equations of water and sediment using the kinematic wave simplification. In this context, the KINEROS model is used. This paper deals with water management systems, which are able to satisfy an increasing food supply requirement within a context of water scarcity while respecting environmental requirements. It develops the first phase of a methodological approach for the establishment of a management plan for water stored in a small dam for a sustainable agricultural management. This phase was elaborated and applied to the M'Richet El Anze watershed in a Tunisian semi-arid area using the following approach. A study of the hydrological and sedimentological performances of the KINEROS model using a set of hydrological and sedimentological data measured at a hydrologic station for a sub-catchment of 40 ha of the M'Richet El Anze watershed during the period September 1994 - March 1996. Flow has been measured since 1994 at a hydrometric station with a rectangular channel (9. 3 m T 1. 2 m T 1. 5 m in height, with an average slope of 2. 5 %). A <b>limnigraph</b> (OTT X) and a triangular flume, situated at the end of the channel, were used to measure the flow rate with a time step of 10 min. Sediment load was measured by taking manual samples with 1 L bottles during flow events at non-regular times. Sediment deposited in the artificial channel was weighed after the runoff event. Rainfall was measured with a time step of 5 min using two gauges situated within the watershed. Input data files were elaborated using : (1) a topographic map for watershed discretisation, slope and size planes; (2) soil sampling for soil characteristics and parameters; and (3) land surface and vegetation status maps of the watershed and photos on parcels corresponding to different periods of each year for land use and surface information parameters. The KINEROS model was used to predict runoff and sediment loads for a small dam in the M'Richet El Anze watershed using an elaborate agricultural management map, which is the product of a crop map and a water and soil conservation map. Elaboration of the crop map was based on three criteria : soil texture, depth and rock cover, whereas the water and soil conservation management map was based on two criteria: land slope and soil rock cover. The rainfall data used for the runoff and sediment simulation were measured for the period 1997 - 1998 and only rainfall-generated runoff at the hydrologic station was considered. Characterization of rainfall erosivity was applied for different rainstorms, using the empirical erosivity index EI. The maximum erosivity was obtained for the 1998 - 09 - 25 rainstorm (39. 4 K. J. mm/m 2. h). Results showed that autumnal rainfalls were the most aggressive events affecting soil erosion in the Tunisian semi-arid region, especially those in September and October. We also noted an important rainfall erosivity index for June with an orographic rainstorm (30. 1 K. J. mm/m 2. h). Related to these results, runoff seems to be related to rainstorm erosivity and soil moisture. Erosivity can affect soil structure while soil moisture involves an infiltration component, and both affect soil hydraulic conductivity. In this context, analyzing runoff-rainstorm events within a watershed and relating them to the rainfall erosivity index allowed runoff modeling, which can be done with more results. As developed by the author in 1988 for a small watershed in a Tunisian semi-arid region, a boundary intensity (IL) can be identified that is related to an antecedent soil moisture index (IPA). Related to the same work, runoff generation is defined when a pounded rainfall (PI) is anticipated. The difference between total and pounded rainfall correspond to excess rainfall. The PI is related to antecedent soil moisture index (IPA) and the boundary intensity (IL). These results showed the importance of the hydrologic component of the model and especially infiltration modeling. Thus, accuracy of erosion data is related to the precision of the hydrological results. The following can be concluded from the application of the KINEROS model: 1. The KINEROS model can be used for predicting runoff from ungauged watersheds and for evaluating future land use master-plans for Tunisian semi-arid high lands; 2. Best runoff simulations were obtained for rainstorms that lasted less than one hour, with high intensity and a total rain of more than 20 mm; 3. The accuracy of erosion results was related to the hydrological component and precision of parameters assessment; 4. For runoff forecasts in the small dam of M'Richet El Anze, the small amount and the irregularity of runoff prompt the use of collected water for extra irrigation of crops and vegetation tolerant to water stress; 5. Development of annual crops would increase the efficiency of autumnal runoff; 6. Irrigation duty duration from the small dam was related to the extent of water erosion and sediment deposition, which were related to runoff and topography; 7. The developed methodology used for the application of the KINEROS model to predict the impact of water and soil conservation management on a Tunisian semi-arid watershed without calibration is interesting, especially because it allows the elaboration of distributed soil parameters and crop maps, which can be used as a decision support system for erosion control on hill slopes, keeping dams located downstream in good working order...|$|E
40|$|The paper shows {{results of}} soil erosion {{research}} undertaken in November 2006 on 7 experimental plots located in agricultural Dworski Stream catchment (Carpathian Foothills, Poland) for two hydrological years (2007 and 2008). All the plots were 2 m wide. Four {{of them were}} 22. 1 m long while the remaining three were 11. 1, 5. 5 and 2. 8 m in length. All the plots were closed with 2 m Gerlach troughs. Eroded material was collected in tanks placed by every plot, while runoff was registered by means of <b>limnigraphs.</b> The inclination of the plots was 8 degrees. Studies were carried on silty pseudogley soil (Stagnic Luvisols). The main aim of the article {{is to determine the}} amount of soil loss in relation to rainfall erosivity and type of crops. In 2007 the rainfall erosivity factor (EI 30) was 1628. 9 MJ·mm·ha- 1 ·h- 1 and turned out to be almost two times as much as it was for 2008 (667 MJ·mm·ha- 1 ·h- 1). In the summer half-year of 2007 hydrological year there were 13 slope wash events whereas in 2008 there were none. Runoff varied considerably in the summer half-year. Maximum values of runoff coefficient amounted to 39. 2 % for the potato, 34. 2 % for the fallow land, 16. 3 % for the winter wheat and 12. 0 % for the grassland. In the summer half-year of 2007 slopewash values amounted to 27. 0 kg. ha- 1 for winter wheat, 42. 0 kg. ha- 1 for grassland, 43, 396 kg. ha- 1 for potato and 47, 340 kg. ha- 1 for fallow. During 93 % (2007) and 100 % (2008) of days in a summer half-year, the slopes were stable, because rainfalls did not occur or were too small to initiate overland flow and slope wash. Rainfalls of the maximum 30 -minut intensity above 15 mm. hr- 1 always resulted in overland flow and slope wash but their morphological effectiveness (the total amount of the transported soil) depended on land use. In the hydrological year 2007, the highest soil erosion during the single rains took place on root crop field and bare fallow...|$|R
40|$|En France, les sécheresses consécutives des années 1985, 1986, 1989 et 1990 ont mis en lumière les problèmes relatifs à l'alimentation en eau potable, l'irrigation des terres agricoles et la préservation des écosystèmes aquatiques. Dans le cas des zones humides, continentales et littorales, caractérisées par une compartimentation {{hydraulique}} souvent complexe, le manque de connaissance se fait particulièrement sentir. Bien que de nombreux travaux aient permis d'évaluer l'évaporation des masses d'eau et l'évapotranspiration de certaines espèces d'hydrophytes et d'hélophytes, les études débouchant sur des bilans quantitatifs restent peu fréquentes. Le bilan hydrologique du marais de Moëze (2250 ha) a été calculé par décade entre le 11 / 06 / 89 et le 31 / 08 / 89. Il {{prend en compte}} le débit au droit de l'ouvrage d'alimentation, les volumes prélevés pour l'irrigation hors marais, les infiltrations et l'évapotransplration sur les 318 km de canaux. L'estimation de la consommation d'eau des parcelles est globalisée {{au niveau}} des mesures d'infiltration. Les pertes par infiltration sont secondaires (9, 4 %) au regard des volumes prélevés pour l'irrigation (38, 0 %) et évapotransplrés par les canaux (43, 7 %) dont 51, 1 % uniquement par les 28, 6 % des plans d'eau colonisés par Typha latifolia. L'optimisation de la gestion estivale de l'eau d'un marais littoral agricole nécessite dans un premier temps de minimiser les pertes. C'est essentiellement sur la consommation d'eau des canaux colonisés par les hélophytes que l'on peut intervenir. Nous proposons un abaque qui permet d'évaluer l'importance des économies d'eau réalisées en fonction de plusieurs scénarios d'aménagement du réseau hydraulique. In France, the drought {{that occurred during the}} years 1985, 1986, 1989 and 1990 have emphazised the problems of freshwater supplies for human consumption, for irrigation and for the conservation of aquatic systems. Today the water has to be economized through a rationalized management. Water balance must be evaluated in order to compare supply an demand. Hydrological functioning is particularly badly known as far as continental and coastal wetlands are concerned, probably because of a generally very complex hydrological partition. Many papers deal with the evaporation rate from a clear water surface or the evapotranspiration rate from several species of hydrophytes and halophytes. However studies of quantitative water budgets of wetlands remain few in number. This paper reports an analysis of the budget summer water in that was a salt marsh now containing freshwater. The 25 km 2 marsh of Moëze is located on the French Atlantic coast; it has been progressively constituted by filling up a tidal bay since the flandrien period. The soils correspond to fluvio-marine silts, locally called « bri » accumulated over several tens of meters thick. The marsh is bounded on the North by the ancient limestone coast, on the South by the Arnoult River, and on the West by the coastline. Its drainage network includes permanently flowing main canals and also small silted-up ditches which sometimes dry up in summer and are largely colonized by aquatic plants, particularly Typha latifolia. The channels network is very dense (144 meters of ditches per hectare) and complex because of a close connection between all the canals and ditches. The regional oceanic climate is characterized by a surplus water balance from October to April (+ 315 mm) and quite a short one tram May to September (- 338 mm). The important terms of the water budget equation in this study were : the quantity of water pumped from the Arnoult River through the inflow sluicegate (Qa), the precipitations (P), the irrigation out of the marsh (lr), the evapotranspiration of water bodies (Epo), the seepage through canals and ditches (ls), and the change in water soil strorage (Vs). These terms are not equally susceptible to be measured. Groundwater seepage and evapotranspiration are difficult to measure and they are often determined by difference, but, they contain the residual error of ail the terms. The methods to evaluate each term of water budget were carried as follows : 1. As the inflow gate functions as a siphon, the flow rate (Qa) was calculated with the drowned orifice formula (LENCASTRE, 1984). The upstream and downstream water levels were permanently recorded by 2 <b>limnigraphs.</b> The upstream and downstream water velocities were measured every 2 days with a micro-currentmeter. 2. The precipitation values (P) used in the water budget equation correspond to the average of 4 rain gauges placed around the marsh. 3. The evapotranspiration of the channel network (Epo) was directly estimated through 4 experimental floating tanks (0. 50 x 0. 55 x 1. 05 m size) previously used by GIRAUD (1985). One of the tanks was placed in clear water, the others was planted the typical aquatic vegetation of the marsh (Lemna sp., Ceratophyllum sp., and Typhia latifolia). The drop the water levels in the tanks corresponded to the loss of water due tou evapotranspiration. All the tanks were filled up to a fixed level, and the amount of water added, measured every 2 days. 4. The outputs for irrigation (Ir) concern 298 ha of maïze out of the marsh, and 23 farmers. The water amounts taken off were estimated form an inquiry of irrigation practices associated to a field control. 5. The water losses by seepage (ls) through canals and ditches were directly measured on the field by using the closed basin method. A length of canal was closed by 2 watertight bulkheads. The fall of water level was recorded and the amount of water added to maintain a fixed level was measured. This method is considered by KRAATZ (1977) as being the most accurate specially for low seepage. The fall of water level never exceeds 10 % of the water depth in the basin. 34 canals and ditches in the marsh were sampled. According to CHEVALLIER et al. (1984), 3 parameters influencing the soil permeability were measured : granulometry, CaC 03 content and sodicity. After the sampling plan we have retained 4 experimental canals (average length = 47 m, average water surface = 135 m 2, average depth = 0. 44 m). 6. The water strorage in the soil (Vs) was evaluated by analyzing the groundwater table fluctuations and moisture changes. The water budget calculated for 10 -day periods depending on the climatology calculations, from 10 th June 1989 to 31 st August 1989. The water losses due to seepage were secondary (9. 4 %) compared to the amounts of water taken off by irrigation (38. 0 %) and channel network evapotranspiration (43. 7 %). The water consumption of helophytes such as Typhia latifolia was 2 to 3 times higher than the evaporation of a clear surface water body as shown in figure 3. In the marsh of Moëze, 51. 1 % of channel evapotranspiration was due to the colonization by Typhia latifolia of the canals and ditches although they represent only 28. 6 % of the channel network surface. This study shows that is possible to quantify a water budget for a large scale wetland from field measurements associated to experimental approaches, with a satisfactory accuracy : less than 10 %. To reduce the water consumption of the marsh of Moëze, three essential recommendations may be given : the reduction of the global channel network surface, the cleaning of a part of ditches colonized by Typhia latifolia, or the combination of both techniques. According to the different management schemes, it is possible to predict the amounts of freshwater saved (fig. 5) ...|$|R
