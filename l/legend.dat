5|$|A later popular Polish <b>legend</b> {{related to}} the history of the Polish {{coronation}} weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale of the Golden Gate of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Bolesław's entered the city. This <b>legend</b> has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Bolesław notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the <b>legend.</b>|$|E

5|$|The only direct written {{mention of}} Gediminas' sister is a <b>legend</b> {{describing}} {{the murder of}} two Franciscan friars who came to Vilnius to spread Christianity.
