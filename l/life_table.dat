5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first <b>life</b> <b>table,</b> gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's <b>life</b> <b>table</b> by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E
25|$|However, {{for some}} purposes, such as {{pensions}} calculations, it is usual {{to adjust the}} <b>life</b> <b>table</b> used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends; but some models exist {{to account for the}} evolution of mortality like the Lee–Carter model.|$|E
25|$|Forecasting {{the life}} {{expectancy}} directly, generally using ARIMA or other time series extrapolation procedures: that {{has the advantage of}} simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other <b>life</b> <b>table</b> results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} mortality due to cancer, it {{is necessary}} to have mortality data by year of age in the population of cancer patients.

25|$|C. megacephala prefer warm climates, {{and display}} a {{correlation}} between warmer temperatures and higher fecundity. In tropical populations, such as in Brazil, fertility is also lower in areas with high densities of larvae, where many in one small area compete for the same food source. A correlation between wing size and temperature as well as tibia size and temperature has also been found in this species. There was a similar relationship between wing and tibia size and fecundity. All three of these values variables, fecundity, wing size and tibia size, stay within the same range throughout the year, showing seasonal variation to be absent. This has been of interest to researchers, since this fly is present in high numbers in warm weather and low numbers in cold weather. The majority of Dipteran species that have had a <b>life</b> <b>table</b> constructed have demonstrated a tendency for smaller bodies in the warmer months. C. megacephala has a relatively long lifespan as an adult which has helped the species become successful at invading new geographical areas. The long adult lifespan means that the parents are present to rear the offspring, ensuring their survival.|$|E

2500|$|The 17th {{century was}} a period of {{advances}} in mathematics in Germany, France and England.

Another important advance came in 1662 from a London draper named John Graunt, who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group, or cohort, of people of the same age, despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual.

40|$|Objective—This report, {{following}} {{publication of}} the national <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> (1, 2) for 1999 – 2001, presents state-specific <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> for the 50 states and District of Columbia by race (white and black) and sex. These tables are the most recent {{in a series of}} decennial <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> for the United States. Methods—Data used to prepare these state-specific <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> include population counts by age on the census date of April 1, 2000; deaths occurring in the 3 -year period of 1999 – 2001; and counts of U.

Methods for calculating the <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> were modified from the previous decennial <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> to automate the smoothing of age-specific mortality data and to allow for the estimation of <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> for smaller population subgroups, which often had insufficient data available to estimate reliable <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> under the previous method. The current method allows for the estimation of <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> for the black population in six states, which were never previously published due to small numbers of deaths. Standard errors for estimating life expectancy and probability of dying are also presented in this report. Results—Among the 50 states, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy at birth during the 1999 – 2001 period at 80. 23 years, and Mississippi had the lowest life expectancy at 73. 88 years. Life expectancy for the District of Columbia was even lower at 73. 09 years. State-specific life expectancy at birth improved from the previous decennial period (1989 – 1991) for all states and the District of Columbia. Life expectancy at age 65 ranged from 20. 42 years in Hawaii to 16. 61 years in Kentucky. Life expectancy at age 65 also improved for all states except Kentucky...|$|R

The second set of <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> also uses the census mortality data for the ages 5 - 19 but fits Coale and Demeny [1966] West Model <b>life</b> <b>tables.</b> Both these sets of <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> were derived following procedures in Haines [1979].

Given the lack of national <b>life</b> <b>tables</b> for the United States prior to the early twentieth century, it is hoped that these tables will be of value in research on mortality and on issues for which mortality and survival probabilities by age, sex, and race are used.
