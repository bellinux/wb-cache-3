50|$|The book {{maintains}} that leaders do not <b>lie</b> much <b>to</b> other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> {{their own people}} than autocrats. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. The author says that it is difficult for leaders <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for <b>lying</b> <b>to</b> be effective. He concludes that it is easier for leaders <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|R
