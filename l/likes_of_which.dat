25|$|What {{followed}} was {{a season of}} domination, the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> had not been seen since McLaren's 1988 season. With the F2002, Schumacher scored 9 more victories, his total of 11 wins was a record for the season, while Rubens Barrichello scored four. The only race that the car failed to win was at Monaco, while the F2001 {{did not take the}} Malaysian GP. Furthermore, Schumacher finished every race on the podium, never finishing lower than second with the F2002. The German won the world championship in record time, clinching the title at the 11th race of the season in France. The two Ferrari drivers were comfortably first and second in the Drivers' Championship, and Ferrari scored as many points (221) {{as the rest of the}} teams put together.|$|E
25|$|In , Senna {{became the}} {{youngest}} ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> littered the team's history, {{was no longer a}} serious competitor. In preseason testing, Senna made public misgivings about the car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the engine was not as powerful as the prior year's V10. Senna won the first four races as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge. Before the Mexican Grand Prix, Senna was injured in a jet-skiing accident near São Paulo for which he required stitches {{on the back of his}} head. During qualifying for that Grand Prix, he attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over the car after crashing into a tyre barrier. At the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Senna's car had come to a halt on the final lap, but he was not left stranded out on the circuit, as race-winner Mansell pulled over on his parade lap and allowed the Brazilian to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. During the Spanish Grand Prix, Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320km/h (200mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.|$|E

25|$|On 1 April 1978, {{he started}} an ambitious tour of SFR Yugoslavia with Lokice dance group {{in support of}} the album that had already sold 150,000 copies. Čolić also started to play the guitar {{occasionally}} on stage. Putujući zemljotres (Traveling Earthquake Tour) produced and organized by Maksa Ćatović moved all over the country, soon becoming a phenomenon the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the country had not seen before. The scenes of screaming girls rushing the stage were repeated in city after city. The tour's climax took place in Belgrade at Red Star FC stadium on 5 September 1978 with 70,000 people in attendance despite the fact that Čolić already played two sold out shows in Belgrade a few months earlier on 4 and 8 April at Hala Pionir. Supporting Čolić on stage that night were Chris Nicholls on keyboards and Dado Topić on bass guitar with old favourites Kornelije Kovač, Arsen Dedić, Kemal Monteno, Josip Boček, Trio Strune and RTV Belgrade singing quintet appearing as guests. Čolić and the massive tour essentially became a cultural phenomenon transcending musical boundaries such that in the lead up to the big Belgrade concert journalist Dušan Savković and film director Jovan Ristić decided to make a movie about Čolić. Savković wrote a rudimentary screenplay, but the movie ended up being a 90-minute feature documentary titled Pjevam danju, pjevam noću that follows Čolić from Belgrade concert onwards and looks back on his career up to that point. Two days after the Belgrade concert, Čolić was in his hometown Sarajevo at Koševo Stadium for the tour's grand finale, however the rain interrupted much of the concert and the whole thing {{turned out to be a}} little anticlimactic. By the end of its promotion cycle, the album sold more than 700,000 copies and with later re-releases during the 1990s went over the million mark.|$|E

The third and final test match of the tour is sometimes known as the Flour Bomb test, as an anti-apartheid activist in a Cessna light aircraft dropped leaflets, flares, a parachute-supported banner reading [...] "Biko" [...] and flour bombs into Auckland's Eden Park throughout the match, felling a New Zealand player.

500|$|The {{events in}} Ninja GaidenII take place {{one year after}} the events in the first Ninja Gaiden game. It is about an evil emperor named Ashtar who, after hearing of Jaquio's defeat, devises a plan to take over the world and engulf it in {{darkness}} through an evil sword called the Dark Sword of Chaos. A U.S. Army agent named Robert T. Sturgeon recruits the game's protagonist Ryu Hayabusa and tells him that he is the only person who can stop him. The game received positive praise in previews from Electronic Gaming Monthly and Nintendo Power and continued to receive high ratings and coverage, being nominated for several awards from Nintendo Power in 1991. Overall, reviewers have said that visuals and controls of Ninja GaidenII improved over its predecessor while maintaining a high level of difficulty for players; the game was criticized for having a more generic and predictable plot. The game maintains lasting appeal among players, with one reviewer saying that Ninja GaidenII is [...] "a challenging experience the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> gamers in the 8-bit era lived and died for".|$|E
500|$|Taft was {{convinced}} {{he would be}} vindicated by history. After he left office, he {{was estimated to be}} about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company, with James Madison, John Quincy Adams and McKinley. Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker. According to Gould, [...] "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party." [...] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice [...] "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> we are not likely to see again in American history".|$|E
500|$|Mega Man X {{takes place}} in an {{unspecified}} time during the 22nd century (2120) and approximately 100 years after the original Mega Man series. A human archaeologist named Dr. Cain discovers {{the ruins of a}} robotics research facility that had once been operated by the legendary robot designer Dr. Thomas Light. Among the ruins, Cain finds a large capsule which contains a highly advanced robot with human-level intelligence and emotions, and even free will, the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the world has never seen before. Light had wished to instill within his creation reasonable sanity, good nature, and an understanding of the more controversial aspects of human morality. The robot was buried while running a 30-year diagnostic program to ensure these features. Cain spends the next several months studying the robot, who is named Mega Man X, or simply [...] "X". Cain decides to duplicate X and, within several months, completes the first [...] "replicate android" [...] or [...] "Reploid", a robot who can think, feel, learn, and grow exactly like a human. Within the year, the design is standardized and Reploids are mass-produced. However, with the free will given to a Reploid comes the possibility of criminal activity; such rogue Reploids are branded as [...] "Mavericks" [...] by law-abiding citizens.|$|E

500|$|Fingleton {{made his}} {{debut in the}} Fifth and final Test in similar {{circumstances}} to his break {{at the start of}} the season; Bill Ponsford fell ill and Bradman twisted an ankle. As Bradman later took a hard-running catch as a substitute fielder on the same day, some suspected that he had feigned injury to avoid playing on a rain-affected wicket hostile to batting—he had appeared uncomfortable against aggressive bowling in the previous Test. In a low-scoring match, Fingleton's first action on the field was to let a ball go between his legs as South Africa batted first. Opening with captain Bill Woodfull in the absence of Ponsford, Fingleton saw his skipper removed from the first ball of the innings. He was allowed to ease into his first innings when the first ball he faced, from Neville Quinn, was a deliberate full toss to give him an opportunity to score his initial runs easily. The pair became friends from this point onwards. Fingleton was second top-scorer with 40 as Australia made 153 recorded an innings victory. The match lasted less than one day's playing time as the hosts fell for only 36 and 45. The cricketer-journalist Richard Whitington later wrote that [...] "for courage and skill... was worth quadruple that number". The Sydney Mail predicted that Fingleton's display on the rain-affected wicket, the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> were common, proved that he would [...] "someday be a great success" [...] there. Fingleton ended the season with 386 runs at 42.88 with one century and a fifty in six matches.|$|E
500|$|Various music journalists, {{critical}} theorists, {{and authors}} have deemed Madonna {{the most influential}} female recording artist of all time. She topped VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Women in Music" [...] list and The Daily Telegraphs [...] "20 Greatest Female Artists" [...] list. Author Carol Clerk wrote that [...] "during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon." [...] Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that [...] "She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep {{on the edge of}} tendency and commerciality." [...] Laura Barcella and Jessica Valenti in the book Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that [...] "really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look du jour, and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye." [...] William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to." [...] Alan McGee from The Guardian felt that Madonna is a post-modern art, the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> we will never see again.

Tonight, she cried, she fought, and she learned that she was carrying his child." [...] and added that Pompeo is often [...] "ovelooked" [...] saying, [...] "Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it reviewing [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] wrote, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the show has done several times before. He added. [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen {{for more than half of}} it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] USA Today also lauded Pompeo saying, [...] " [...] In some ways, the episode (How to Save a Life) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo. She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes, from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life." ...|$|E
