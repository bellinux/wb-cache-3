5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{adverse effect}} of {{daylight saving time}} may <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours.|$|E

5|$|Brighton's origins <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into open fields called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary farming methods, significantly influenced {{the pattern of}} urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E
5|$|Dunrobin's origins <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, {{but most}} of the present {{building}} and the gardens were added by Sir Charles Barry between 1835 and 1850. Some of the original building is visible in the interior courtyard, despite a number of expansions and alterations that made it the largest house in the north of Scotland. After being used as a boarding school for seven years, it is now open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{arrives at}} the Valakian homeworld, where they are met by Esaak, the Valakian {{director}} of a clinic, and Larr, a Menk orderly. T'Pol, Phlox, Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the answer to a cure may <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Menk.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metal {{is a form}} {{of music}} {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms and highly amplified distorted guitars, generally with grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal is a development of blues, blues rock, rock and prog rock. Its origins <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British hard rock bands who between 1967 and 1974 took blues and rock and created a hybrid with a heavy, guitar-and-drums-centered sound. Most of the pioneers in the field, like Black Sabbath, were English, though many were inspired by American performers like Blue Cheer and Jimi Hendrix.|$|E
5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far {{from the center of}} the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.|$|E
5|$|The Islands of the Forth are a {{group of}} small islands located in the Firth of Forth and in the estuary of the River Forth {{on the east coast}} of Scotland. Most of the group <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open waters of the firth, between the Lothians and Fife, with the {{majority}} to the east of the city of Edinburgh. Two islands lie further west in the river estuary.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} and longest arc was Fraternité; {{the faintest}} was Courage. The normal optical {{depths of the}} arcs are estimated to <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range 0.03–0.09 (0.034±0.005 for {{the leading edge of}} Liberté arc as measured by stellar occultation); the radial widths are approximately the same as those of the continuous ring—about 30km. The equivalent depths of arcs vary in the range 1.25–2.15km (0.77±0.13km for the leading edge of Liberté arc). The fraction of dust in the arcs is from 40% to 70%. The arcs in the Adams ring are somewhat similar to the arc in Saturn's G ring.|$|E
5|$|The department's origins <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal collection, {{but it was}} {{augmented}} by Napoleon's 1798 expeditionary trip with Dominique Vivant, the future director of the Louvre. After Jean-François Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone, CharlesX decreed that an Egyptian Antiquities department be created. Champollion advised the purchase of three collections, formed by Edmé-Antoine Durand, Henry Salt and Bernardino Drovet; these additions added 7,000works. Growth continued via acquisitions by Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Mariette, after excavations at Memphis, sent back crates of archaeological finds including The Seated Scribe.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, {{the nature of the}} Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E

5|$|The natural {{terrain of}} the area has been {{modified}} in the urban core of the city by grading, but maintains its gentle rolling character in the outlying areas. Numerous small creeks are found throughout the city and small lakes and woodlands <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern and southern portions of the city. Sowashee Creek runs through the southern portion {{of the city and}} branches off into Gallagher's Creek, which flows {{through the center of the}} city. Loper's Creek runs through the far-western part of the city while smaller creeks including Shearer's Branch, Magnolia Creek, and Robbins Creek are dispersed throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} sides, which <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rain {{shadow of the}} central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting {{is a major problem}} caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.|$|E
5|$|Though ideologically {{the temples}} are {{divided between the}} sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all-Hindu affair. There are four abodes in the Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotriall of which <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foothills of the Himalayas. The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to {{differentiate}} the original Char Dhams. As the number of pilgrims to these places has increased in modern times, it is called Himalayan Char Dham.|$|E
