40|$|<b>Low-temperature</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{of garlic}} seed cloves {{substitutes}} the initial climatic {{requirements of the}} crop and accelerates the cycle. We have reported that seed bulbs from ‘Coreano’ variety conditioned at 5 °C for five weeks reduces growth and plant weight {{as well as the}} crop yields and increases the synthesis of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins. Therefore, this treatment suggests a cold stress. Plant acclimation to stress is associated with deep changes in proteome composition. Since proteins are directly involved in plant stress response, proteomics studies can significantly contribute to unravel the possible relationships between protein abundance and plant stress acclimation. The aim of this work was to study the changes in the protein profiles of garlic seed cloves subjected to conditioning at low-temperature using proteomics approach. Two sets of garlic bulbs were used, one set was stored at room temperature (23 °C), and the other was conditioned at low temperature (5 °C) for five weeks. Total soluble proteins were extracted from sprouts of cloves and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Protein spots showing statistically significant changes in abundance were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS and identified by database search analysis using the Mascot search engine. The results revealed that <b>low-temperature</b> <b>conditioning</b> of garlic seed cloves causes alterations in the accumulation of proteins involved in different physiological processes such as cellular growth, antioxidative/oxidative state, macromolecules transport, protein folding and transcription regulation process. The metabolic pathways affected include protein biosynthesis and quality control system, photosynthesis, photorespiration, energy production, and carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism. These processes can work cooperatively to establish a new cellular homeostasis that might be related with the physiological and biochemical changes observed in previous studies...|$|E
40|$|Light {{exposure}} {{is an important}} environmental factor which breaks seed dormancy in many plant species. Phytochromes {{have been identified as}} playing a crucial role in perception of the light signal that releases seed germination in Arabidopsis. Phototropins (Phot 1, Phot 2) are blue/UV-photoreceptors in plants which mediate phototropic responses, chloroplast relocation, hypocotyl growth inhibition and stomata opening. We studied germination under different light conditions in Arabidopsis Phot 1 -null and Phot 2 -null mutants and in a double phot 1 phot 2 mutant. Germination of single phot 1 and phot 2 mutants in darkness was much lower than in wildtype (WT) seeds, whereas double phot 1 phot 2 mutant lacking both functional phototropins germinated at frequency comparable to WT seeds, irrespective of light and temperature conditions. Light treatment of imbibed seeds was essential for effective germination of phot 1, irrespective of <b>low-temperature</b> <b>conditioning.</b> In contrast, cold stratification promoted dark germination of phot 2 seeds after imbibition in dim light. Low germination frequency of phot 1 seeds under low light intensity suggests that the presence of functional Phot 1 might be crucial for effective germination at these conditions. The lower germination frequency of phot 2 seeds under continuous light suggests that Phot 2 might be responsible for stimulating germination of seeds exposed to direct daylight. Thus, the phototropin system may cooperate with phytochromes regulating the germination competence of seeds under different environmental condition...|$|E
40|$|Quarantine {{treatment}} enables {{export of}} avocado fruit (Persea americana) {{to parts of}} the world that enforce quarantine against fruit fly. The recommended cold-based quarantine treatment (storage at 1. 1 °C for 14 days) was studied with two commercial avocado cultivars 'Hass' and 'Ettinger' for 2 years. Chilling injuries (CIs) are prevalent in the avocado fruit after cold-quarantine treatment. Hence, we examined the effect of integrating several treatments: modified atmosphere (MA; fruit covered with perforated polyethylene bags), methyl jasmonate (MJ; fruit dipped in 2. 5 μM MJ for Hass or 10 μM MJ for Ettinger for 30 s), 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP; fruit treated with 300 ppb 1 -MCP for 18 h) and <b>low-temperature</b> <b>conditioning</b> (LTC; a gradual decrease in temperature over 3 days) on CI reduction during cold quarantine. Avocado fruit stored at 1 °C suffered from severe CI, lipid peroxidation, and increased expression of chilling-responsive genes of fruit peel. The combined therapeutic treatments alleviated CI in cold-quarantined fruit to the level in fruit stored at commercial temperature (5 °C). A successful therapeutic treatment was developed to protect 'Hass' and 'Ettinger' avocado fruit during cold quarantine against fruit fly, while maintaining fruit quality. Subsequently, treated fruit stored at 1 °C had a longer shelf life and less decay than the fruit stored at 5 °C. This therapeutic treatment could potentially enable the export of avocado fruit to all quarantine-enforcing countries. Similar methods might be applicable to other types of fruit that require cold quarantine...|$|E
40|$|Polymeric matrix {{composites}} {{are susceptible}} to degradation and material properties changes if subjected to low-temperature environmental conditions. This paper attempts to present a study on effective {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} for various hybrid carbon fibers/glass fibers polymeric composite structures previously subjected to <b>low-temperature</b> environmental <b>conditioning.</b> The hybrid composite architectures were made from various layers of glass mat and/or glass woven embedded along with layers of unidirectional carbon fibers into a polymeric matrix. The samples were preconditioned to a low-temperature environment at a constant temperature of - 35 C for 1 -week long, 24 h/day. The instantaneous CTE and thermal strain fields were recorded with a DIL 402 PC/ 1 dilatometer from Netzsch GmbH (Germany) by setting a monotonically linear rise of temperature from 20 to 250 C, at a rate of 1 C min- 1. The experimentally retrieved data were compared with the values obtained by running a micromechanical-based approach simulation on a representative volume element. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Arabidopsis CBF genes (CBF 1 –CBF 3) encode {{transcription}} factors {{having a}} major role in cold acclimation, the adaptive process whereby certain plants increase their freezing tolerance in response to low non-freezing temperatures. Under these conditions, the CBF genes are induced and their corresponding proteins stimulate the expression of target genes configuring <b>low-temperature</b> transcriptome and <b>conditioning</b> Arabidopsis freezing tolerance. CBF 2 seems to be the most determinant of the CBFs since it also regulates CBF 1 and CBF 3 expression. Despite the relevance of CBF genes in cold acclimation, {{little is known about the}} molecular components that control their expression. To uncover factors acting upstream of CBF 2, mutagenized Arabidopsis containing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the CBF 2 promoter were screened for plants with de-regulated CBF 2 expression. Here, the identification and characterization of five of these mutants, named acex (altered CBF 2 expression), is presented. Three mutants show increased levels of cold-induced CBF 2 transcripts compared with wild-type plants, the other two exhibiting reduced levels. Some mutants are also affected in cold induction of CBF 1 and CBF 3. Furthermore, the mutants characterized display unique phenotypes for tolerance to abiotic stresses, including freezing, dehydration, and high salt. These results demonstrate that cold induction of CBF 2 is subjected to both positive and negative regulation through different signal transduction pathways, some of them also mediating the expression of other CBF genes as well as Arabidopsis responses to abiotic stresses...|$|R
