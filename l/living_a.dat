5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people <b>living</b> <b>a</b> nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E
